Strategy Diagrams

This book adopts the current top-down approach to building Business Intelligence systems.  This approach assumes that BI is driven by management strategy.  Strategy diagrams identify the critical activities that allow a company to differentiate itself from the competition in order to create value in the marketplace (Morgan et al. 2007).  These diagrams are formal and explicit models of knowledge and strategy.  The three strategy diagrams allow us to model strategy are: 

*Activity Map (Porter)
*Customer Outcomes Map (Chatterjee)
*Strategy Map (Norton and Kaplan)
*Causal link Map (Norton and Kaplan)

The first step in creating a BI system is to develop all three maps.  This first requires gaining a firm understanding of the business.  The next step is to gain a firm understanding of the strategy.  Then the architect begins by interviewing all decision makers required by the project.  This will often include multiple interviews with the same decision makers and also group discussions.  The input is a list of decision makers.

The final step is to create the causal link map.  The causal link map removes all the features of the three strategy diagrams and focuses on the causal links.  This allows the strategy to become a theory (causal link map) with testable hypotheses (links). 

The testing of the causal link map is fundamental in building an effective BI system.  An important function of the reports that the decision maker will examine assume that X causes Y.  X serves as a leading indicator of Y.  The assumption is that by focusing on X it is possible to make certain that Y occurs.  If this is not the case then focusing on X is a waste to time and resources.  Therefore, testing the causal links is perhaps the most important step in developing the BI system.</text>

{{fsharpTitle|Units of Measure}}

'''Units of measure''' allow programmers to annotate floats and integers with statically-typed unit metadata. This can be handy when writing programs which manipulate floats and integers representing specific units of measure, such as kilograms, pounds, meters, newtons, pascals, etc. F# will verify that units are used in places where the programmer intended. For example, the F# compiler will throw an error if a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;m/s&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used where it expects a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;kg&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Use Cases ==

=== Statically Checked Type Conversions ===

Units of measure are invaluable to programmers who work in scientific research, they add an extra layer of protection to guard against conversion related errors. To cite a famous case study, NASA's $125 million [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/news/mco991110.html Mars Climate Orbiter] project ended in failure when the orbiter dipped 90 km closer to Mars than originally intended, causing it to tear apart and disintegrate spectacularly in the Mars atmosphere. A post mortem analysis narrowed down the root cause of the problem to a conversion error in the orbiter's propulsion systems used to lower the spacecraft into orbit: NASA passed data to the systems in metric units, but the software expected data in Imperial units. Although there were many contributing project-management errors which resulted in the failed mission, this software bug in particular could have been prevented if the software engineers had used a type-system powerful enough to detect unit-related errors.

=== Decorating Data With Contextual Information ===

In an article [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html Making Code Look Wrong], Joel Spolsky describes a scenario in which, during the design of Microsoft Word and Excel, programmers at Microsoft were required to track the position of objects on a page using two non-interchangeable coordinate systems:

: In WYSIWYG word processing, you have scrollable windows, so every coordinate has to be interpreted as either relative to the window or relative to the page, and that makes a big difference, and keeping them straight is pretty important. [...]
: The compiler won’t help you if you assign one to the other and Intellisense won’t tell you bupkis. But they are semantically different; they need to be interpreted differently and treated differently and some kind of conversion function will need to be called if you assign one to the other or you will have a ''runtime'' bug. If you’re lucky. [...]
: In Excel’s source code you see a lot of &lt;code&gt;rw&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; and when you see those you know that they refer to rows and columns. Yep, they’re both integers, but it never makes sense to assign between them. In Word, I'm told, you see a lot of &lt;code&gt;xl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xw&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;xl&lt;/code&gt; means “horizontal coordinates relative to the layout” and &lt;code&gt;xw&lt;/code&gt; means “horizontal coordinates relative to the window.” Both ints. Not interchangeable. In both apps you see a lot of &lt;code&gt;cb&lt;/code&gt; meaning “count of bytes.” Yep, it’s an int again, but you know so much more about it just by looking at the variable name. It’s a count of bytes: a buffer size. And if you see &lt;code&gt;xl = cb&lt;/code&gt;, well, blow the Bad Code Whistle, that is obviously wrong code, because even though &lt;code&gt;xl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cb&lt;/code&gt; are both integers, it’s completely crazy to set a horizontal offset in pixels to a count of bytes.

In short, Microsoft depends on coding conventions to encode contextual data about a variable, and they depend on code reviews to enforce correct usage of a variable from its context. This works in practice, but its still possible for incorrect code to work its way it the product without the bug being detected for months.

If Microsoft were using a language with units of measure, they could have defined their own &lt;code&gt;rw&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;xw&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;xl&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cb&lt;/code&gt; units of measure so that an assignment of the form &lt;code&gt;int&lt;xl&gt; = int&lt;cb&gt;&lt;/code&gt; not only fails visual inspection, it doesn't even compile.

== Defining Units ==
New units of measure are defined using the &lt;code&gt;Measure&lt;/code&gt; attribute:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type m (* meter *)

[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type s (* second *)&lt;/source&gt;

Additionally, we can define types measures which are derived from existing measures as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type m                  (* meter *)
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type s                  (* second *)
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type kg                 (* kilogram *)
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type N = (kg * m)/(s^2) (* Newtons *)
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type Pa = N/(m^2)       (* Pascals *)
&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Important:''' Units of measure look like a data type, but they aren't. .NET's type system does not support the behaviors that units of measure have, such as being able to square, divide, or raise datatypes to powers. This functionality is provided by the F# static type checker at compile time, but units are erased from compiled code. Consequently, it is not possible to determine value's unit at runtime.

We can create instances of float and integer data which represent these units using the same notation we use with generics:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let distance = 100.0&lt;m&gt;
let time = 5.0&lt;s&gt;
let speed = distance / time;;

val distance : float&lt;m&gt; = 100.0
val time : float&lt;s&gt; = 5.0
val speed : float&lt;m/s&gt; = 20.0&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the that F# automatically derives a new unit, &lt;code&gt;m/s&lt;/code&gt;, for the value &lt;code&gt;speed&lt;/code&gt;. Units of measure will multiply, divide, and cancel as needed depending on how they are used. Using these properties, it's very easy to convert between two units:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;[&lt;Measure&gt;] type C
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type F

let to_fahrenheit (x : float&lt;C&gt;) = x * (9.0&lt;F&gt;/5.0&lt;C&gt;) + 32.0&lt;F&gt;
let to_celsius (x : float&lt;F&gt;) = (x - 32.0&lt;F&gt;) * (5.0&lt;C&gt;/9.0&lt;F&gt;)&lt;/source&gt;

Units of measure are statically checked at compile time for proper usage. For example, if we use a measure where it isn't expected, we get a compilation error:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [&lt;Measure&gt;] type m
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type s

let speed (x : float&lt;m&gt;) (y : float&lt;s&gt;) = x / y;;

[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type m
[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type s
val speed : float&lt;m&gt; -&gt; float&lt;s&gt; -&gt; float&lt;m/s&gt;

&gt; speed 20.0&lt;m&gt; 4.0&lt;s&gt;;; (* should get a speed *)
val it : float&lt;m/s&gt; = 5.0

&gt; speed 20.0&lt;m&gt; 4.0&lt;m&gt;;; (* boom! *)

  speed 20.0&lt;m&gt; 4.0&lt;m&gt;;;
  --------------^^^^^^

stdin(39,15): error FS0001: Type mismatch. Expecting a
	float&lt;s&gt;
but given a
	float&lt;m&gt;.
The unit of measure 's' does not match the unit of measure 'm'&lt;/source&gt;

Units can be defined for integral types too:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; [&lt;Measure&gt;] type col
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type row
let colOffset (a : int&lt;col&gt;) (b : int&lt;col&gt;) = a - b
let rowOffset (a : int&lt;row&gt;) (b : int&lt;row&gt;) = a - b;;

[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type col
[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type row
val colOffset : int&lt;col&gt; -&gt; int&lt;col&gt; -&gt; int&lt;col&gt;
val rowOffset : int&lt;row&gt; -&gt; int&lt;row&gt; -&gt; int&lt;row&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Dimensionless Values ==

A value without a unit is ''dimensionless''. Dimensionless values are represented implicitly by writing them out without units (i.e. &lt;code&gt;7.0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-14&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;200.5&lt;/code&gt;), or they can be represented explicitly using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;1&gt;&lt;/code&gt; type (i.e. &lt;code&gt;7.0&lt;1&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-14&lt;1&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;200.5&lt;1&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

We can convert dimensionless units to a specific measure by multiplying by &lt;code&gt;1&lt;''targetMeasure''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. We can convert a measure back to a dimensionless unit by passing it to the built-in &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; methods:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;[&lt;Measure&gt;] type m

(* val to_meters : (x : float&lt;'u&gt;) -&gt; float&lt;'u m&gt; *)
let to_meters x = x * 1&lt;m&gt;

(* val of_meters : (x : float&lt;m&gt;) -&gt; float *)
let of_meters (x : float&lt;m&gt;) = float x&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, its often easier (and safer) to divide away unneeded units:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let of_meters (x : float&lt;m&gt;) = x / 1.0&lt;m&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

== Generalizing Units of Measure ==

Since measures and dimensionless values are (or appear to be) generic types, we can write functions which operate on both transparently:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [&lt;Measure&gt;] type m
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type kg

let vanillaFloats = [10.0; 15.5; 17.0]
let lengths = [ for a in [2.0; 7.0; 14.0; 5.0] -&gt; a * 1.0&lt;m&gt; ]
let masses = [ for a in [155.54; 179.01; 135.90] -&gt; a * 1.0&lt;kg&gt; ]
let densities = [ for a in [0.54; 1.0; 1.1; 0.25; 0.7] -&gt; a * 1.0&lt;kg/m^3&gt; ]

let average (l : float&lt;'u&gt; list) =
    let sum, count = l |&gt; List.fold (fun (sum, count) x -&gt; sum + x, count + 1.0&lt;_&gt;) (0.0&lt;_&gt;, 0.0&lt;_&gt;)
    sum / count;;

[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type m
[&lt;Measure&gt;]
type kg
val vanillaFloats : float list = [10.0; 15.5; 17.0]
val lengths : float&lt;m&gt; list = [2.0; 7.0; 14.0; 5.0]
val masses : float&lt;kg&gt; list = [155.54; 179.01; 135.9]
val densities : float&lt;kg/m ^ 3&gt; list = [0.54; 1.0; 1.1; 0.25; 0.7]
val average : float&lt;'u&gt; list -&gt; float&lt;'u&gt;

&gt; average vanillaFloats, average lengths, average masses, average densities;;
val it : float * float&lt;m&gt; * float&lt;kg&gt; * float&lt;kg/m ^ 3&gt; =
  (14.16666667, 7.0, 156.8166667, 0.718)&lt;/source&gt;

Since units are erased from compiled code, they are not considered a real data type, so they can't be used ''directly'' as a type parameter in generic functions and classes. For example, the following code will not compile:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; type triple&lt;'a&gt; = { a : float&lt;'a&gt;; b : float&lt;'a&gt;; c : float&lt;'a&gt;};;

  type triple&lt;'a&gt; = { a : float&lt;'a&gt;; b : float&lt;'a&gt;; c : float&lt;'a&gt;};;
  ------------------------------^^

stdin(40,31): error FS0191: Expected unit-of-measure parameter, not type parameter.
Explicit unit-of-measure parameters must be marked with the [&lt;Measure&gt;] attribute&lt;/source&gt;

F# does not infer that &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; is a unit of measure above, possibly because the following code ''appears'' correct, but it can be used in non-sensical ways:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type quad&lt;'a&gt; = { a : float&lt;'a&gt;; b : float&lt;'a&gt;; c : float&lt;'a&gt;; d : 'a}&lt;/source&gt;

The type &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; can be a unit of measure ''or'' a data type, but not both at the same time. F#'s type checker assumes &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; is a type parameter ''unless otherwise specified''. We can use the &lt;code&gt;[&lt;Measure&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; attribute to change the &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; to a unit of measure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; type triple&lt;[&lt;Measure&gt;] 'a&gt; = { a : float&lt;'a&gt;; b : float&lt;'a&gt;; c : float&lt;'a&gt;};;

type triple&lt;[&lt;Measure&gt;] 'a&gt; =
  {a: float&lt;'a&gt;;
   b: float&lt;'a&gt;;
   c: float&lt;'a&gt;;}

&gt; { a = 7.0&lt;kg&gt;; b = -10.5&lt;_&gt;; c = 0.5&lt;_&gt; };;
val it : triple&lt;kg&gt; = {a = 7.0;
                       b = -10.5;
                       c = 0.5;}&lt;/source&gt;

'''Cabbie Claw''' or '''Cabelew''' is a traditional dish from the North-East of Scotland and Orkney. Traditionally made using Speldings, young fish of the ''Gadidae'' family, such as Cod, Haddock or Whiting.
The obscure name is a derivative of the French name for Cod- ''Cabillaud''.

==To make Cabbie Claw==
===Ingredients===
*Whole Cod, or other Whitefish
*Coarse Sea salt
*Parsley
*Horseradish
*Mashed potato
*Parsley and  Cayenne Pepper

===Sauce===
*Butter
*Flour
*Milk
*Hard boiled Eggs
*Water the fish is cooked in
*Nutmeg, Salt and Pepper

*Take a very fresh spelding, clean it removing the eyes, split the fish and wipe it down. Rub the fish with coarse salt and leave over night. The following day, hang the fish in a shaded,cool, draughty place for 24hrs. Cover the fish in a kettle with boiling water, parsley and fresh horseradish may be added to the broth. Simmer until cooked. Remove the fish from the stock (retaining it), skin and bone the fish, then flake the flesh roughly and keep warm in a slow oven.

To make the sauce : make a roux with the butter and flour, then slowly add the fish stock and milk., constantly stirring to avoid lumpiness. Chop the whites of the eggs roughly (reserving the yolks), and mix into the sauce and season. Layer the fish on top of the mashed potato, pour over the sauce, garnish with chopped egg yolks, parsley and the cayenne.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What's the difference between rocks and minerals? ==
A mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure formed by geological processes.  A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals whereas a rock may also include organic remains and mineraloids. Some rocks are predominantly composed of just one mineral. For example, limestone is a sedimentary rock composed almost entirely of the mineral calcite. Other rocks contain many minerals, and the specific minerals in a rock can vary widely. Some minerals, like quartz, mica or feldspar are common, while others have been found in only one or two locations worldwide.

      <comment>/* Igneous rocks */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three different types of rocks: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic. The difference between each type is in how they are formed.

=== Igneous rocks ===
Igneous rocks have many distinct characteristics. For example, light-colored igneous rocks are more acidic, and have over 65% silica. Dark-colored rocks are more basic and have a higher percentage of ferro-magnesian minerals. Igneous rocks are broken up in to three main groups: acid, intermediate, and basic. Acid rocks have over 65% silica, intermediate rocks have 55-65% silica, and basic rocks have 45-55% silica. Igneous rock forms when magma (molten rock) cools and solidifies. Extrusive igneous rocks are those formed when magma reaches the surface (at which point it is called lava), cooling and solidifying quickly. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed when magma slowly cools deep below the surface of the earth. Different sized grains form, depending on the conditions of the rock formation. Intrusive rocks are generally more coarse-grained than extrusive. Coarse grains are more than 3/16 of an inch; medium grains, 1/64-3/16; and fine grains, less than 1/64 of an inch. Granite, Rhyolite, and Obsidian are all examples of igneous rocks. All these characteristics are key in identifying igneous rocks.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Sedimentary rocks ===
Sedimentary rock forms when layers of sand and pebbles are compressed enough to form rock. Fossils are mainly found in sedimentary rock, specifically limestone because limestone is formed in warm, shallow seas and organisms and shells get fossilized at the bottom. There are three different grain sizes in sedimentary rock. Coarse which you can see with the naked eye. Medium which you can see with a hand lens, and fine which you can see with a microscope. Sedimentary rocks are split into three different categories. Chemical, detrital and biogenic. Chemical refers to rocks containing minerals produced by chemical precipitation. Detrital refers to rocks which contain particles from preexisting rocks. While biogenic rocks contain fossil and shell fragments. Sandstone, Shale, and Limestone are all examples of sedimentary rocks.igneous and sedimentary rocks are largely prevalent in the world

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Metamorphic rocks ===
Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to heat and pressure, but not to the point of melting. Depending on whether it was formed under just heat or heat and pressure the orientation of the crystals will be different. Contact metamorphoric rocks are formed in just heat and crystals are randomly arranged. Regional metamorphic rocks are formed in both heat and pressure, and have crystals that are aligned. The greater the pressure and temperature these rocks are exposed to the larger the grains. Medium to high grade metamorphic rocks occurs at a minimum temperature of 480 degrees f and a maximum temperature of 1,472 degrees f but can be much lower. Some examples of metamorphic rocks are Slate, Marble, and Granulite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following properties are very useful for identification purposes:

* Hardness
* Cleavage
* Luster
* Color
* Streak
* Texture


These are described in detail later

You will need a few tools for measuring various aspects of rocks.  Not all of them are required, but the more of them that are available to you, the more successful you will be in identifying specimens.

* Specific Gravity meter
* streak plate for determining &quot;streak&quot; color
* Magnifying glass
* Hardness kit (you can use the following as a hardness kit as explained later.)
** Fingernail
** Copper penny
** Knife blade
** Window glass
** Steel file

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Mohs scale of mineral hardness characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material. It was created in 1812 by the German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs and is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science.

Mohs based the scale on ten minerals that are all readily available. As the hardest known naturally occurring substance, diamond is at the top of the scale. The hardness of a material is measured against the scale by finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, and/or the softest material that can scratch the given material. For example, if some material is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on the Mohs scale is 4.5.

The Mohs scale is a purely ordinal scale. For example, corundum (9) is twice as hard as topaz (8), but diamond (10) is almost four times as hard as corundum. The table below shows comparison with absolute hardness measured by a sclerometer.

On the Mohs scale, fingernail has hardness 2.5; copper penny, about 3.5; a knife blade, 5.5; window glass, 6.5; steel file, 6.5. Using these ordinary materials of known hardness can be a simple way to approximate the position of a mineral on the scale.

Some mnemonics traditionally taught to geology students to remember this table are &quot;The Girls Can Flirt And Other Queer Things Can Do&quot; or &quot;To Get Candy From Aunt Fanny, Quit Teasing Cousin Danny&quot;. Another Mnemonic is &quot;Two Gypsies Called Flo And Fred Queued To Cut Diamonds.&quot;

An alternative table is shown below which has been modified to incorporate additional substances that may fall in between two levels.

To test the hardness of a specimen take it and try to scratch it with the first rock your in your hardness kit, Talc, if it is scratched then the rock your testing then it is hardness 1. If not then try to scratch the Talc with your rock. If the rock scratches the Talc then it is harder then the Talc. You should now repeat this proses with the next rock in your harness kit, Gypsum. Continue this proses until you find a rock that scratches the specimen your testing. The hardness of the rock that scratches your specimen is the hardness of your specimen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Fluorita green.jpeg|thumb|right|Green fluorite with prominent cleavage.]]
'''Cleavage''', in mineralogy, is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] structural planes. These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular locations of atoms and ions in the crystal, which create smooth repeating surfaces that are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;* Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, ''Manual of Mineralogy'', 20th ed., Wiley, ISBN 0-471-80580-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of cleavage ===
Cleavage forms parallel to crystallographic planes:&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

[[File:Biotita1.jpeg|thumb|right|Biotite with basal cleavage.]]

*Basal or pinacoidal cleavage occurs parallel to the base of a crystal. This orientation is given by the {001} plane in the crystal lattice (see the Miller indexes page in Wikipedia), and is the same as the {0001} plane in Bravais-Miller indexes, which are often used for rhombohedral and hexagonal crystals.  Basal cleavage is exhibited by the mica group and by graphite.

*Cubic cleavage occurs on the {001} planes, parallel to the faces of a cube for a crystal with cubic symmetry.  This is the source of the cubic shape seen in crystals of ground table salt, the mineral halite. The mineral galena also typically exhibits perfect cubic cleavage.

*Octahedral cleavage occurs on the {111} crystal planes, forming octahedron shapes for a crystal with cubic symmetry. Diamond and fluorite exhibit perfect octahedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage is seen in common semiconductors. For lower-symmetry crystals, there will be a smaller number of {111} planes.

*Dodecahedral cleavage occurs on the {110} crystal planes forming dodecahedra for a crystal with cubic symmetry. For lower-symmetry crystals, there will be a smaller number of {110} planes.

*Rhombohedral cleavage occur parallel to the {10&lt;u style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;1&lt;/u&gt;1} faces of a rhombohedron. Calcite and other carbonate minerals exhibit perfect rhombohedral cleavage. 

*Prismatic cleavage is cleavage parallel to a vertical prism {110}. Cerussite, tremolite and spodumene exhibit prismatic cleavage.

=== Parting ===
Crystal parting occurs when minerals break along planes of structural weakness due to external stress or along twin composition planes. Parting breaks are very similar in appearance to cleavage, but only occur due to stress. Examples include magnetite which shows octahedral parting, the rhombohedral parting of corundum and basal parting in pyroxenes.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

=== Uses ===
Cleavage is a traditional physical property used in mineral identification both in hand specimen and microscopic examination of rock and mineral studies. As an example, the angles between the prismatic cleavage planes for the pyroxenes (88-92°) and the amphiboles (56-124°) are diagnostic.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

Crystal cleavage is of technical importance in the electronics industry and in the cutting of gemstones.

Precious stones are generally cleaved by impact as in diamond cutting.

Synthetic single crystals of semiconductor materials are generally sold as thin wafers which are much easier to cleave.  Simply pressing a silicon wafer against a soft surface and scratching its edge with a diamond scribe is usually enough to cause cleavage; however, when dicing a wafer to form chips, a procedure of scoring and breaking is often followed for greater control.  Elemental semiconductors (Si, germanium, and diamond) are diamond cubic, a space group for which octahedral cleavage is observed.  This means that some orientations of wafer allow near-perfect rectangles to be cleaved.  Most other commercial semiconductors GaAs, InSb, etc.) can be made in the related zinc blende structure, with similar cleavage planes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' Initiated based on the [[MySQL/Introduction|MySQL Introduction chapter]] of the [[MySQL|MySQL book]].

== What is SQL? ==

'''Note:''' Section based on the [[SQL|SQL Wikibook]].

'''[[wikipedia:SQL|SQL]]''', which is an initialism for '''Structured Query Language''', is a language to request data from a database, to add, update, or remove data within a database, or to manipulate the metadata of the database.

SQL is generally pronounced as the three letters in the name, e.g. ''ess-cue-ell'', or in some people's usage, as the word ''sequel''.

SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how to accomplish the task.  The steps required to execute SQL commands are handled transparently by the SQL database.  Sometimes SQL is characterized as ''non-procedural'' because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems.  Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.

Instructions are given in the form of commands, consisting of a specific SQL command and additional parameters and operands that apply to that command.  The simplest example of how to retrieve all of the rows and columns of a table named ''Customers'' is:
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT * FROM Customers
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
The asterisk (*) that follows the SELECT command is a wildcard character that refers to all of the columns of the table.  SQL assumes that the whole set of records is to be retrieved unless you provide conditional logic to restrict the result to a subset, which is added using a WHERE clause.  Following are a few typical SQL examples for a table named Customers with three columns:  CustomerID, LastName, and FirstName.
&lt;table border=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID=99&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns the last name and first name of the customers that have a CustomerID value of 99.  Typically this will return a single row, if it exists, because values such as CustomerID would be defined as a primary key that uniquely identifies one customer and cannot have other rows identified with the same value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM Customers ORDER BY LastName, FirstName&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns an alphabetized list of the last and first names of all customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, LastName, FirstName) Values (1, &quot;Doe&quot;, &quot;John&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creates a row with the CustomerID of 1 for John Doe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;UPDATE Customers SET FirstName=&quot;Johnny&quot; WHERE CustomerID=1&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes John Doe's first name to Johnny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;DELETE Customers WHERE CustomerID=1&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removes the row where the CustomerID is the value 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In general, SQL isn't case sensitive and ignores excess whitespace characters, except for the contents of an alphanumeric string.  Upper case is frequently used for SQL commands as a matter of style, but this is not a universal convention.

Some databases support ''stored procedures'' in which SQL is embedded within another procedural language to manipulate data or tables on the server for more complex operations than allowed by SQL alone, and without necessarily returning data from the server.  These procedural languages are usually proprietary to the vendor of the SQL server.  For example, Oracle uses its own language PL/SQL while Microsoft SQL Server uses T-SQL.  These procedural languages are similar in design and function, but use different syntax that are not interoperable.

SQL can also be embedded within other languages using SQL modules, libraries, or pre-compilers that offer functions to open a path of communication to the SQL server to send commands and retrieve results.  Since the execution of an SQL command is a useful service that is performed externally to the host language by the SQL server, the overall processing is divided into two tiers: the client tier and the server tier.  The modules and libraries used to provide the connection between the client and server are usually referred to as ''middleware'', particularly when connections are allowed with one interface from the client to various servers from different vendors.  ODBC, JDBC, OLEDB are common middleware libraries, among a large number of others specific to a wide range of client hosting operating systems and programming models.  The use of SQL has become so prevalent that it would be unusual to find an application language that doesn't support it in some manner.

SQL commands and their modifiers are based upon official SQL standards and certain extensions to that each database provider implements. Commonly commands are grouped into the following categories:

; Data Definition Language ([[wikipedia:Data_Definition_Language | DDL ]])

* CREATE - Used to create a new table, a view of a table, or other object in database.
* ALTER - Used to modify an existing database object, such as a table.
* DROP - Used to delete an entire table, a view of a table or other object in the database.

; Data Control Language ([[wikipedia:Data_Control_Language | DCL ]])

* GRANT - Used to give a privilege to someone.
* REVOKE - Used to take back privileges granted to someone.

; Data Manipulation Language ([[wikipedia:Data_Manipulation_Language | DML ]])

* INSERT - Used to create a record.
* UPDATE - Used to change certain records.
* DELETE - Used to delete certain records.

; Data Query Language ([[wikipedia:Data_Query_Language | DQL ]])

* SELECT - Used to retrieve certain records from one or more tables.


== Why MySQL? ==

* Free as in Freedom - Released with GPL version 2 license (though a different license can be bought from Sun Microsystems, see below)
* Cost - Free!
* Support - Online tutorials, forums, mailing list (lists.mysql.com), paid support contracts.
* Speed - One of the fastest databases available.
* Functionality - support most of ANSI SQL commands.
* Ease of use - less need of training / retraining.
* Portability - easily import / export from Excel and other databases
* Scalable - Useful for both small as well as large databases containing billions of records and terabytes of data in hundreds of thousands of tables.
* Collaboration - selectively grant or revoke permissions to users.

=== The MySQL license ===

MySQL is available under a ''dual-licensing'' scheme:
* Under the GNU General Public License, version 2, (&quot;or later&quot; allowed in versions released before 2007): this is a Free (as in freedom), copyleft software license that allows you to use MySQL for commercial and non-commercial purposes in your application, as long as your application is released under the GNU GPL. There is also a &quot;FLOSS Exception&quot; which essentially allows non-GPL'd but Free applications (such as the PHP programming language, under the PHP license) to connect to a MySQL server. The exception lists a set of free and open-source software license that can be used in addition to the GNU GPL for your MySQL-dependent Free application.
* A so-called &quot;commercial&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Calling it &quot;commercial&quot; is misleading, because the GNU GPL can be used in commercial (but non-proprietary) projects.&lt;/ref&gt;, paid license, that is, a license where MySQL grants you the right to integrate MySQL with a non-FLOSS application that you are redistributing outside your own organization. &lt;ref&gt;Proprietary projects still can connect to a MySQL server without purchasing this license by using old versions of the MySQL client connection libraries (under the GNU Lesser General Public License). However, these libraries cannot connect to the newest versions of the MySQL server.&lt;/ref&gt;

== MySQL and its forks ==

MySQL is Free Software, so some forks and unofficial builds delivering contributions from the community exist.

=== MariaDB ===

In 2008 Sun Microsystems bought MySQL. After the acquisition, the development process has changed. The team has started to release new MySQL versions less frequently, so the new code is less tested. There were also less contributions from the community.

In 2009 Monty Widenius, the founder of MySQL, left the company and created a new one, called [http://www.askmonty.org/ The Monty Program]. He started a new fork called MariaDB. The scopes of MariaDB are:

* import all the new code that will be added to the main MySQL branch, but enhancing it to make it more stable;
* clean the MySQL code;
* add contributions from the community (new plugins, new features);
* develop the Maria storage engine;
* adding new features to the server.

There are no public releases of this fork, still. Its license will be the GNU GPLv2 (inherited from MySQL).

=== Drizzle ===

In 2008 Brian Aker, chief architect of MySQL, left the project to start a new fork called [http://www.drizzle.org/ Drizzle]. Sun Microsystems is funding the project. Its charateristics are:

* only a small part of the MySQL code has survived in this fork, the rest being removed: only essential features are implemented in the Drizzle server;
* the survived code has been cleaned;
* Drizzle is modular: many features are or can be implemented as plugins;
* the software is optimized for multiCPU and multicore 64 bit machines;
* only GNU/Linux and UNIX systems are supported.

There are no public releases of this fork, still. Its main license will be the GNU GPLv2 (inherited from MySQL), but where possible the BSD license is applied.

=== OurDelta ===

[http://ourdelta.org/ OurDelta - Builds for MySQL] is another fork. It's based on the MySQL main branch and it adds some patches contributed by the community. Some of these patches will be used by MariaDB, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' Based on the [[MySQL/Language|Language chapter]] of the [[MySQL|MySQL book]].
== Browsing the databases ==

The following SQL commands provide information about the databases located on the current server. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA table containing this information is SCHEMATA.

The mysqlshow command line tool can be used instead.

You can't show databases if the server has been started with the --skip-all-databases option.

If you don't have the 'SHOW DATABASES' privilege, you'll only see databases on which you have some permissions.

=== List databases ===

Show all databases:

 SHOW DATABASES;

The SCHEMA keywords can be used in place of DATABASES. MySQL doesn't support standard SQL SCHEMAs, so SCHEMA is a synonym of database. It has been added for compatibility with other DBMS's.

====Add a filter on the databases names====

 SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'pattern';

The LIKE operator here works as in normal SELECTs or DML statements. So you an list all databases whose name starts with 'my':

 SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'my%';

====Add complex filters====

You can add more complex filters using the WHERE clause:

 SHOW DATABASES WHERE conditions;

WHERE clause allows you to use regular expressions, '&lt;' and '&gt;' operators, string functions or other useful expressions to filter the records returned by SHOW DATABASES.

=== List tables and views ===

The following SQL commands provide information about the tables and views contained in a database. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables containing this information are `TABLES` and `VIEWS`.

Since the following statements provide very little information about views, if you need to get metadata about them you'll probably prefer to query the VIEWS table.

The mysqlshow command line tool can be used instead.

====Show all tables====

 USE `database`;
 SHOW TABLES;

 SHOW TABLES FROM `database`;

The 2 forms shown above are equivalent.


====Apply a filter====

You can apply a filter to the tables names, to show only tables whose name match a pattern. You can use the LIKE operatore, as you do in SELECTs or in the DML statements:

 SHOW TABLES LIKE `pattern`;

Also, you can apply a more complex filter to any column returned by the SHOW TABLES command using the WHERE clause:

 SHOW TABLES WHERE condition;

(see below)

====Extra info====

By default, SHOW TABLES returns only one column containing the name of the table. You can get extra information by using the FULL keyword:

 SHOW FULL TABLES;

This will add a column called `Table_type`. This can have 3 values: 'BASE TABLE' for tables, 'VIEW' for views ans 'SYSTEM VIEW' for special tables created by the server (normally used only INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables).

So you can only list tables:

 SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE `Table_type`='BASE TABLE';

Or, you can only list views:

 SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE `Table_type`='VIEW';

====Show only open tables====

You can get a list of the non-temporary tables (not views) which are open in the cache:

 SHOW OPEN TABLES;

This command has the same parameters as SHOW TABLES, except for FULL (useless in this case). You can't get this information from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

=== List fields ===

The following SQL commands provide information about the columns in a table or in a view. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA table containing this information is COLUMNS.

The mysqlshow command line tool can be used instead.

==== DESCRIBE ====

 DESCRIBE `table`;
 DESCRIBE `database`.`table`;
 DESCRIBE `table` 'filter';

DESC can be used as a shortcut for DESCRIBE.

'filter' can be a column name. If a column name is specified, only that column will be shown. If 'filter' contains the '%' or the '_' characters, it will be evaluated as a LIKE condition. For example, you can list all fields which start with 'my':

 DESC `table` 'my%';

==== SHOW COLUMNS ====

 EXPLAIN `table`; --synonym
 SHOW [FULL] FIELDS FROM `table`; -- synonym
 SHOW COLUMNS FROM `table`; --synonym
 SHOW COLUMNS FROM `table` FROM `database`;
 SHOW COLUMNS FROM `table` LIKE 'pattern';
 SHOW COLUMNS FROM `table` WHERE condition;

FIELDS and COLUMNS are synonyms. EXPLAIN is a synonym of SHOW COLUMNS / FIELDS too, but it doesn't support all of its clauses.

A databases name can be specified both in the form
 SHOW COLUMNS FROM `table` FROM `database`;
both:
 SHOW COLUMNS FROM `database`.`table`;

==== Extra info ====

Using the FULL keyword, extra info can be retried: the columns' collation, privileges you have on the column and the comment.

=== List indexes ===

The following SQL commands provide information about the indexes in a table. Information about keys is contained in the `COLUMNS` table in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

The mysqlshow -k command line tool can be used instead.

 SHOW INDEX FROM `TABLE`;
 SHOW INDEX FROM `TABLE` FROM `databases`;

The KEYS reserved word can be used as a synonym of INDEX. No other clauses are provided.

=== INFORMATION_SCHEMA ===

&lt;code&gt;information_schema&lt;/code&gt; is a virtual database provided by MySQL 5 and later, that contains metadata about the server and the databases.

== Specifying names ==

In this book, we will quote the MySQL identifiers (tables names, fields, databases, etc.) using backquotes (&lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt;).

Backquote is ASCII 96. It can be type on GNU/Linux systems by pressing: ALT+'.

Most often, this is optional. However, this allows better error messages from MySQL. For example, this error is not very helpful:
 mysql&gt; SELECT user_id, group_id FROM user,group LIMIT 1;
 ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax;
  check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version
  for the right syntax to use near 'group LIMIT 1' at line 1

But this one is better:
 mysql&gt; SELECT user_id, group_id FROM `user`,`group` LIMIT 1;
 ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'savannah.group' doesn't exist

Ok, it was just a missing &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;:
 mysql&gt;  SELECT user_id, group_id FROM `user`,`groups` LIMIT 1;
 +---------+----------+
 | user_id | group_id |
 +---------+----------+
 |     100 |        2 |
 +---------+----------+
 1 row in set (0.02 sec)


This syntax allows the user to use reserver words and some illegal characters in objects' names. It is even possible to use backquotes by tying it twice:

 RENAME TABLE `user` TO ````

However, this is not a portable syntax. The SQL standard recommends the use of a double quote (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). If you want to write portable SQL quote, do not quote the identifiers. But is there something like portable SQL, even remotely? ;)

== Definitions: what are DDL, DML and DQL? ==

* DDL (Data Definition Language) refers to the CREATE, ALTER and DROP statements
* DML (Data Manipulation Language) refers to the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
* DQL (Data Query Language) refers to the SELECT, SHOW and HELP statements (queries)
* DCL (Data Control Language) refers to the GRANT and REVOKE statements

== User Variables ==

=== Session Variables ===

* The ability to set variables in a statement with the := assignment operator:
* For e.g. (@total) to calculate the total in an example, you have to have the total column first because it must be calculated before the individual percentage calculations 
* Session variables are set for the duration of the thread.
* In the vast majority of cases you'd use a programming language to do this sort of thing.
* Mysql variables can be useful when working on the Mysql command line.
* If no records are returned, the user variable will not be set for that statement.
* A user variable set in the field list cannot be used as a condition.

 select @test := 2;
 select @test + 1

* The value of a variable is set with the SET statement or in a SELECT statement with :=

 set @startdate='some_start_date', @enddate='some_end_date'

 SELECT @toremember:=count(*) FROM membros;
	
 select @numzero := count(*) from table1 where field=0; 
 select @numdistinct := count(distinct field) from table1 where field &lt;&gt; 0 ; 
 select @numzero @numdistinct;

* You can copy values retrieved by a SELECT into one or more variables:
 SELECT INTO

=== Global Variables ===

A global variable is visible to all users.

=== SHOW VARIABLES ===

== Alias ==
An expression and a column may be given aliases using AS. The alias is used as the expression's column name and can be used with order by or having clauses. For e.g.

 SELECT 
     CONCAT(last_name,' ', first_name) AS full_name,
     nickname AS nick 
 FROM
     mytable 
 ORDER BY
     full_name

These aliases can be used in ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. They should not be used in WHERE clause.

A table name can have a shorter name for reference using AS. You can omit the AS word and still use aliasing. For e.g.

 SELECT
     COUNT(B.Booking_ID), U.User_Location 
 FROM
     Users U
 LEFT OUTER JOIN
     Bookings AS B
 ON 
     U.User_ID    = B.Rep_ID AND
     B.Project_ID = '10'
 GROUP BY
     (U.User_Location)

Aliasing plays a crucial role while you are using self joins. For e.g. people table has been referred to as p and c aliases!

 SELECT
     p.name                                   AS parent,
     c.name                                   AS child,
     MIN((TO_DAYS(NOW())-TO_DAYS(c.dob))/365) AS minage
 FROM
     people AS p 
 LEFT JOIN
     people AS c 
 ON
     p.name=c.parent WHERE c.name IS NOT NULL
 GROUP BY
     parent HAVING minage &gt; 50 ORDER BY p.dob;

== Queries ==

=== SELECT ===

select syntax is as follows:
 SELECT *
 FROM table
 WHERE condition
 GROUP BY grouping field
 HAVING group condition
 ORDER BY order
 LIMIT limit, offset

==== List of fields ====

You must specify what data you're going to retrieve in the SELECT clause:

 SELECT DATABASE() -- returns the current db's name
 SELECT CURRENT_USER() -- returns your username
 SELECT 1+1 -- returns 2

Any SQL expression is allowed here.

You can also retrieve all fields from a table:

 SELECT * FROM `stats`

If you SELECT only the necessary fields, the query will be faster.

==== The table's name ====

If you are retrieving results from a table or a view, usually you specify the table's name in the FORM clause:

 SELECT id FROM `stats` -- retrieve a field called id from a table called stats

Or:

 SELECT MAX(id) FROM `stats`
 SELECT id*2 FROM `stats`

You can also use the `db_name`.`table_name` syntax:

 SELECT id FROM `sitedb`.`stats`

But you can also specify the table's name in the SELECT clause:

 SELECT `stats`.`id` -- retrieve a field called id from a table
 SELECT `sitedb`.`stats`.`id`

==== WHERE ====

You can set a filter to decide what records must be retrieved.

For example, you can retrive only the record which has an id of 42:

 SELECT * FROM `stats` WHERE `id`=42

Or you can read more than one record:

 SELECT * FROM `antiques` WHERE buyerid IS NOT NULL

==== GROUP BY ====

You can group all records by one or more fields. The record which have the same value for that field will be grouped in one computed record. You can only select the grouped record and the result of some aggregate functions, which will be computed on all records of each group.

For example, the following will group all records in the table `users` by the field `city`. For each group of users living in the same city, the maximum age, the minimum age and the average age will be returned:

 SELECT city, MAX(age), MIN(age), AVG(age) GROUP BY `city`

In the following example, the users are grouped by city and sex, so that we'll know the max, min and avg age of male/female users in each city:

 SELECT city, sex, MAX(age), MIN(age), AVG(age) GROUP BY `city`, `sex`

==== HAVING ====

The HAVING clause declares a filter for the records which are computed by the GROUP BY clause. It's different from the WHERE clause, that operates before the GROUP BY. Here's what happens:

# The records which match to the WHERE clause are retrieved
# Those records are used to compute new records as defined in the GROUP BY clause
# The new records that match to the HAVING conditions are returned

This means which WHERE decides what record are used to compose the new computed records.

HAVING decides what computed records are returned, so it can operate on the results of aggregate functions. HAVING is not optimized and can't use indexes.

Incorrect use of HAVING:

 SELECT city, sex, MAX(age), MIN(age), AVG(age) GROUP BY `city` HAVING sex='m'

This probably gives a wrong results. MAX(age) and other aggregate calculations are made using all values, even if the record's sex value is 'f'. This is hardly the expected result.

Incorrect use of HAVING:

 SELECT city, sex, MAX(age), MIN(age), AVG(age) GROUP BY `city`, `sex` HAVING sex='m'

This is correct and returns the expected results, but the execution of this query is not optimized. The WHERE clause can and should be used, because, so that MySQL doesn't computes records which are excluded later.

Correct use of HAVING:

 SELECT city, sex, MAX(age), MIN(age), AVG(age) GROUP BY `city` HAVING MAX(age) &gt; 80

It must group all records, because can't decide the max age of each city before the GROUP BY clause is execute. Later, it returns only the record with a MAX(age)&gt;80.

==== ORDER BY ====

You can set an arbitrary order for the records you retrive. The order may be alphabetical or numeric.

 SELECT * FROM `stats` ORDER BY `id`

By default, the order is ASCENDING. You can also specify that the order must be DESCENDING:

 SELECT * FROM `stats` ORDER BY `id` ASC -- default
 SELECT * FROM `stats` ORDER BY `id` DESC -- inverted

NULLs values are considered as minor than any other value.

You can also specify the field position, in place of the field name:

 SELECT `name`, `buyerid` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY 1 -- name
 SELECT `name`, `buyerid` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY 2 -- buyerid
 SELECT `name`, `buyerid` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY 1 DESC

SQL expressions are allowed:

 SELECT `name` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY REVERSE(`name`)

You can retrieve records in a random order:

 SELECT `name` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY RAND()

If a GROUP BY clause is specified, the results are ordered by the fields named in GROUP BY, unless an ORDER BY clause is present. You can even specify in the GROUP BY clause if the order must be ascending or descending:

 SELECT city, sex, MAX(age) GROUP BY `city` ASC, `sex` DESC

If you have a GROUP BY but you don't want the records to be ordered, you can use ORDER BY NULL:

 SELECT city, sex, MAX(age) GROUP BY `city`, `sex` ORDER BY NULL

==== LIMIT ====

You can specify the maximum of rows that you want to read:

 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 10

This statement returns a maximum of 10 rows. If there are not 10 rows, it returns the number of rows you find. The limit clause is usually used with ORDER BY.

You can get a given number of random records:

 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 1 -- one random record
 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 3

You can specify how many rows should be skipped before starting return the record found. The first record is 0, not one:

 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 10
 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 0, 10 -- synonym

You can use the LIMIT clause to get the pagination of results:

 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 0, 10 -- first page
 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 10, 10 -- second page
 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 20, 10 -- third page

Also, the following syntax is accepted:

 SELECT * FROM `antiques` ORDER BY id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10

You can LIMIT to check the syntax of a query without waiting it returns the results:

 SELECT ... LIMIT 0

'''Optimization tips:'''

* SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS speeds down the LIMIT.
* LIMIT is particularly useful for SELECTs which use ORDER BY, DISTINCT and GROUP BY, because their calculations doesn't have to involve all the rows.
* If the query is resolved by the server copying internelly the results into a temporary table, LIMIT helps MySQL to calculate how many memory is required by the table.

==== DISTINCT ====

The DISTINCT keyword can be used to remove all duplicate rows from the resultset:

 SELECT DISTINCT * FROM `stats` -- no duplicate rows
 SELECT DISTINCTROW * FROM `stats` -- synonym
 SELECT ALL * FROM `stats` -- duplicate rows returned (default)

You can use it to get the list of all values contained in one field:

 SELECT DISTINCT `type` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY `type`

Or you can use it to get the existing combinations of some values:

 SELECT DISTINCT `type`, `age` FROM `antiques` ORDER BY `type`

If one of the fields you are SELECTing is the PRIMARY KEY or has a UNIQUE index, DISTINCT is useless. Also, it's useless to use DISTINCT in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause.

====IN and NOT IN====
 SELECT id
 FROM stats
 WHERE position IN ('Manager', 'Staff')

 SELECT ownerid, 'is in both orders &amp; antiques'
 FROM orders, antiques WHERE ownerid = buyerid
 UNION
 SELECT buyerid, 'is in antiques only'
 FROM antiques WHERE buyerid NOT IN (SELECT ownerid FROM orders)

==== EXISTS and ALL ====
''(Compatible: Mysql 4+)''
 SELECT ownerfirstname, ownerlastname
 FROM owner 
 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM antiques WHERE item = 'chair')

 SELECT buyerid, item 
 FROM antiques
 WHERE price = ALL (SELECT price FROM antiques)

==== Optimization hints ====

There are some hints you may want to give to the server to better optimize the SELECTs. If you give more than one hints, the order of the keywords is important:

 SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
    [HIGH_PRIORITY] [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
    [SQL_SMALL_RESULT | SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
    [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    ...

'''HIGH_PRIORITY'''

Usually, DML commands (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) have higher priority than SELECTs. If you specify HIGH_PRIORITY though, the SELECT will have higher priority than DML statements.

'''STRAIGHT_JOIN'''
Force MySQL to evaluate the tables of a JOIN in the same order they are named, from the leftmost.

'''SQL_SMALL_RESULT'''
It's useful only while using DISTINCT or GROUP BY. Tells the optimizer that the query will return few rows.

'''SQL_BIG_RESULT'''
It's useful only while using DISTINCT or GROUP BY. Tells the optimizer that the query will return a many rows.

'''SQL_BUFFER_RESULT'''
Force MySQL to copy the result into a temporary table. This is useful to remove LOCKs as soon as possible.

'''SQL_CACHE'''
Forces MySQL to copy the result into the query cache. Only works if the value of query_cache_type is DEMAND or 2.

'''SQL_NO_CACHE'''
Tells MySQL not to cache the result. Useful if the query occurs very seldom or if the result often change.

'''SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS'''
Useful if you are using the LIMIT clause. Tells the server to calculate how many rows would have been returned if there were no LIMIT. You can retrieve that number with another query:

 SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM `stats` LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100;
 SELECT FOUND_ROWS();

==== UNION and UNION All====
''(Compatible: Mysql 4+)''

Following query will return all the records from both tables.
 SELECT * FROM english 
 UNION ALL
 SELECT * FROM hindi

&lt;tt&gt;UNION&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;UNION DISTINCT&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
If you type only UNION, then it is considered that you are asking for distinct records. If you want all records, you have to use &lt;tt&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/tt&gt;.

 SELECT word FROM word_table WHERE id = 1
 UNION
 SELECT word FROM word_table WHERE id = 2

 (SELECT magazine FROM pages)
 UNION DISTINCT
 (SELECT magazine FROM pdflog)
 ORDER BY magazine

 (SELECT ID_ENTRY FROM table WHERE ID_AGE = 1)
 UNION DISTINCT 
 (SELECT ID_ENTRY FROM table WHERE ID_AGE=2)

== Data manipulation ==

=== INSERT ===

The syntax is as follows:

Insert value1 into Column1, value2 into Column2, and value3 into Column3:
 INSERT INTO TableName (Column1, Column2, Column3)
 VALUES (value1, value2, value3)
Insert one record (values are inserted in the order that the columns appear in the database):
 INSERT INTO TableName
 VALUES (value1, value2, value3)
Insert two records:
 INSERT INTO TableName
 VALUES (value1, value2, value3), (value4, value5, value6)

 INSERT INTO antiques VALUES (21, 01, 'Ottoman', 200.00);
 INSERT INTO antiques (buyerid, sellerid, item) VALUES (01, 21, 'Ottoman');

You can also insert records 'selected' from other table.

 INSERT INTO table1(field1, field2)
 SELECT field1, field2
 FROM table2

 INSERT INTO World_Events SELECT * FROM National_Events

'''Performance tips:'''

* To insert many rows, consider using LOAD DATA INFILE instead.
* If bulk INSERTs are too slow and they operate on indexed non-empty tables, maybe you should increase the value of bulk_insert_buffer_size.
* Before performing bulk inserts, you may want to disable thekeys.
* LOCKing a table also speeds up the INERT.

=== UPDATE ===

The syntax is:

 UPDATE table SET field = newvalue WHERE criteria ORDER BY field LIMIT n

Examples are:

 UPDATE owner SET ownerfirstname = 'John'
   WHERE ownerid = (SELECT buyerid FROM antiques WHERE item = 'Bookcase');
 
 UPDATE antiques SET price = 500.00 WHERE item = 'Chair';
 
 UPDATE order SET discount=discount * 1.05
 
 UPDATE tbl1 JOIN tbl2 ON tbl1.ID = tbl2.ID
   SET tbl1.col1 = tbl1.col1 + 1
   WHERE tbl2.status='Active'
 
 UPDATE tbl SET names = REPLACE(names, 'aaa', 'zzz')
 
 UPDATE products_categories AS pc
   INNER JOIN products AS p ON pc.prod_id = p.id
   SET pc.prod_sequential_id = p.sequential_id
 
 UPDATE table_name SET col_name =
   REPLACE(col_name, 'host.domain.com', 'host2.domain.com')

 UPDATE posts SET deleted=True
   ORDER BY date LIMIT 1

With ORDER BY you can order the rows before updating them, and only update a given number of rows (LIMIT).

It is currently not possible to update a table while performing a subquery on the same table. For example, if I want to reset a password I forgot in SPIP:
 mysql&gt; UPDATE spip_auteurs SET pass =
  (SELECT pass FROM spip_auteurs WHERE login='paul') where login='admin';
 ERROR 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'spip_auteurs' for update in FROM clause

TODO: [http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/06/23/how-to-select-from-an-update-target-in-mysql/] describes a work-around that I couldn't make to work with MySQL 4.1. Currently the work-around is not use 2 subqueries, possibly with transactions.

'''Performance tips'''

* UPDATEs speed depends of how many indexes are updated.
* If you UPDATE a MyISAM table which uses dynamic format, if you make rows larger they could be splitted in more than one part. This causes reading overhead. So, if your applications often do this, you may want to regularly run an OPTIMIZE TABLE statement.
* Performing many UPDATEs all together on a LOCKed table is faster than performing them individually.

=== REPLACE ===

REPLACE works exactly like INSERT, except that if an old record in the table has the same value as a new record for a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index, the old record is deleted before the new record is inserted.

With IGNORE, invalid values are adjusted to the closest values and inserted; warnings are produced but the statement does not abort. 

Prior to MySQL 4.0.1, INSERT ... SELECT implicitly operates in IGNORE mode. As of MySQL 4.0.1, specify IGNORE explicitly to ignore records that would cause duplicate-key violations.


=== DELETE ===

 DELETE [QUICK] FROM table1
 TRUNCATE table1

* If you don't use a WHERE clause with DELETE, all records will be deleted.
* It can be very slow in a large table, especially if the table has many indexes.
* If the table has many indexes, you can make the cache larger to try making the DELETE faster (key_buffer_size variable).
* For indexed MyISAM tables, in some cases DELETEs are faster if you specify the QUICK keyword (DELETE QUICK FROM ...). This is only useful for tables where DELETEd index values will be reused.
* TRUNCATE will delete all rows quickly by DROPping and reCREATE-ing the table (not all Storage Engines support this operation).
* TRUNCATE is not transaction-safe nor lock-safe.
* DELETE informs you how many rows have been removed, but TRUNCATE doesn't.
* After DELETing many rows (about 30%), an OPTIMIZE TABLE command should make next statements faster.

 DELETE FROM `antiques`
   WHERE item = 'Ottoman'
   ORDER BY `id`
   LIMIT 1

You can order the rows before deleting them, and then delete only a given number of rows.

== Table manipulation ==

=== CREATE TABLE ===
Create table syntax is:
Create table tablename (FieldName1 DataType,&lt;br /&gt;
FieldName2 DataType)

The rows returned by the &quot;select&quot; query can be saved as a new table. The datatype will be the same as the old table. For e.g.
CREATE TABLE LearnHindi &lt;br /&gt;
select english.tag, english.Inenglish as english, hindi.Inhindi as hindi &lt;br /&gt;
FROM english, hindi &lt;br /&gt;
WHERE english.tag = hindi.tag
 
=== ALTER TABLE ===

ALTER TABLE command can be used when you want to add / delete /modify the columns and / or the indexes; or, it can be used to change other table properties.

Add a column:

 ALTER TABLE awards
 ADD COLUMN AwardCode int(2)

Modify a column:

 ALTER TABLE awards
 CHANGE COLUMN AwardCode VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL

 ALTER TABLE awards
 MODIFY COLUMN AwardCode VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL

Drop a column:

 ALTER TABLE awards
 DROP COLUMN AwardCode

Re-order the record in a table:

 ALTER TABLE awards ORDER BY id

(this operation is only supported by some Storage Engines; it could make some query faster)

=== Renaming a table ===

In order to rename a table, you must have ALTER and DROP privileges on the old table name (or on all the tables), and CREATE and INSERT privileges on the new table name (or on all the tables).

You can use ALTER TABLE to rename a table:

 RENAME TABLE `old_name` TO `new_name`

You can rename more than one table with a single command:

 RENAME TABLE `old1` TO `new1`, `old2` TO `new2`, ...

RENAME is a shortcut. You can also use the ALTER TABLE statement:

 ALTER TABLE `old` RENAME `new`

Using ALTER TABLE you can only rename one table per statement, but it's the only way to rename temporary tables.

=== DROP TABLE ===

 DROP TABLE `awards`

Will completely delete the table and all the records it contains.

You can also drop more than one table with a single statement:

 DROP TABLE `table1`, `table2`, ...

There are come optional keywords:

 DROP TEMPORARY TABLE `table`;
 DROP TABLE `table` IF EXISTS;

TEMPORARY must be specified, to drop a temporary table. IF EXISTS tells the server that it must not raise an error if the table doesn't exist.

== Using NULL ==

Null is a special logical value in SQL. Most programming languages have 2 values of logic: True and False. SQL also has NULL which means &quot;Unknown&quot;. A NULL value can be set.

NULL is a non-value, so it can be assigned to TEXT columns, INTEGER columns or any other datatype. A column can not contain NULLs only if it has been declared as NOT NULL (see ALTER TABLE).

 INSERT into Singer
        (F_Name, L_Name, Birth_place, Language) 
        values 
        (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Homer&quot;, NULL, &quot;Greek&quot;),
        (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Sting&quot;, NULL, &quot;English&quot;),
        (&quot;Jonny&quot;, &quot;Five&quot;, NULL, &quot;Binary&quot;);

Do not quote the NULL. If you quote a Null then you name the person NULL. 
For some strange reason, NULLs do not show visually on windows XP in Varchar fields but they do in Fedora's version, so versions of mysql can give different outputs. Here we set the value of Sting and Homer's first name to a zero length string &quot;&quot;, because we KNOW they have NO first name, but we KNOW we do not know the place they were born. To check for a NULLs use
 
 SELECT * from Singer WHERE Birth_place IS NULL;
 or
 SELECT * from Singer WHERE Birth_place IS NOT NULL;
 or
 SELECT * from Singer WHERE isNull(Birth_place)

Remember, COUNT never counts NULLS.

 select count(Birth_place) from Singer;
 0
 and sum(NULL) gives a NULL answer.

Normal operations (comparisons, expressions...) return NULL if at least one of the compared items is NULL:

 SELECT (NULL=NULL) OR (NULL&lt;&gt;NULL) OR (NOT NULL) OR (1&lt;NULL) OR (1&gt;NULL) OR (1 + NULL) OR (1 LIKE NULL)

because all the expressions between in parenthesis return NULL. It's definitely logical: if you don't know the value represented by NULL, you don't know is it's =1 or &lt;&gt;1. Be aware that even (NULL=NULL and (NOT NULL) return NULL.

=== Dealing with NULL ===
The function 'COALESCE' can simplify working with null values.
for example, to avoid showing null values by treating null as zero, you can type:
 SELECT COALESCE(colname,0) from table where COALESCE(colname,0) &gt; 1;

In a date field, to treat NULL as the current date:
 ORDER BY (COALESCE(TO_DAYS(date),TO_DAYS(CURDATE()))-TO_DAYS(CURDATE()))


 EXP(SUM(LOG(COALESCE(''*the field you want to multiply*'',1))) 
The coalesce() function is there to guard against trying to calculate the logarithm of a null value and may be optional depending on your circumstances.

 SELECT t4.gene_name, COALESCE(g2d.score,0), 
 COALESCE(dgp.score,0), COALESCE(pocus.score,0) 
 FROM t4 
 LEFT JOIN g2d ON t4.gene_name=g2d.gene_name 
 LEFT JOIN dgp ON t4.gene_name=dgp.gene_name 
 LEFT JOIN pocus ON t4.gene_name=pocus.gene_name;

Use of IFNULL() in your SELECT statement is to make the NULL any value you wish.

 IFNULL(expr1,expr2)
If expr1 is not NULL, IFNULL() returns expr1, else it returns expr2. 

IFNULL() returns a numeric or string value, depending on the context in which it is used:
 mysql&gt; SELECT IFNULL(1,0);
 -&gt; 1
 mysql&gt; SELECT IFNULL(NULL,10);
 -&gt; 10
 mysql&gt; SELECT IFNULL(1/0,10);
 -&gt; 10
 mysql&gt; SELECT IFNULL(1/0,'yes');
 -&gt; 'yes'

Null handling can be very counter intuitive and could cause problems if you have an incorrect function in a delete statement that returns null. For example the following query will delete all entries.
 DELETE FROM my_table WHERE field &gt; NULL (or function returning NULL)

If you want to have NULL values presented last when doing an ORDER BY, try this:
 SELECT * FROM my_table ORDER BY ISNULL(field), field [ ASC | DESC ]

== Reserved Words ==
Difficult Column Names, Like `DATE` -- use backtick. If using &quot;date&quot; as a column name, enclose it in backticks ` as follows:
 CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks (
   pkey int NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `date` date,
   ticker varchar(5),
   open decimal (9,2),
   high decimal (9,2),
   low decimal (9,2),
   close decimal (9,2),
   volume int,
   timeEnter timestamp(14),
   PRIMARY KEY (pkey)
 );

== Data Types ==

=== varchar ===
VARCHAR is shorthand for CHARACTER VARYING. 'n' represents the maximum column length (upto 255 characters)
char(n) is similar to varchar(n) with the only difference that char will occupy fixed length of space in the database whereas varchar will need the space to store the actual text. For example, a VARCHAR(10) column can hold a string with a maximum length of 10 characters. The actual storage required is the length of the string (L), plus 1 byte to record the length of the string. 
For the string 'abcd', L is 4 and the storage requirement is 5 bytes.

=== text ===
A BLOB or TEXT column with a maximum length of 65,535 characters.

=== integer ===
Specifying an n value has no effect whatsoever. Regardless of a supplied value for n, maximum (unsigned) value stored is 429 [[Wikipedia:Crore|crores]].
If you want to add negative numbers, add the &quot;signed&quot; keyword next to it.

=== decimal ===
decimal(n,m)
decimal(4,2) means numbers upto 99.99 (and NOT 9999.99 as you may expect) can be saved. Four digits with the last 2 reserved for decimal.

=== Dates ===
Out of the three types DATETIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP, the DATE type is used when you need only a date value, without a time part.
MySQL retrieves and displays DATE values in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
The DATETIME type is used when you need values that contain both date and time information.
The difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP is that the TIMESTAMP range is limited to 1970-2037 (see below).

TIME can be used to only store the time of day (HH:MM:SS), without the date. It can also be used to represent a time interval (for example: -02:00:00 for &quot;two hours in the past&quot;). Range: '-838:59:59' =&gt; '838:59:59'.

YEAR can be used to store the year number only.


If you manipulate dates, you have to specify the actual date, not only the time - that is, MySQL will not automagically use today as the current date. On the contrary, MySQL will even interpret the HH:MM:SS time as a YY:MM:DD value, which will probably be invalid.


The following examples show the precise date range for Unix-based timestamps, which starts at the Unix Epoch and stops just before the first new year before the &lt;math&gt;2^{31}-1&lt;/math&gt; usual limit (2038).
 mysql&gt; SET time_zone = '+00:00'; -- GMT
 Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

 mysql&gt; SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(-1);
 +-------------------+
 | FROM_UNIXTIME(-1) |
 +-------------------+
 | NULL              |

=== set and enum ===
A SET datatype can hold any number of strings from a predefined list of strings specified during table creation. The SET datatype is similar to the ENUM datatype in that they 
both work with predefined sets of strings, 
but where the ENUM datatype restricts you to a single member of the set of predefined strings, the SET datatype allows you to store any of the values together, from none to all of them.



== Operators ==

MySQL uses some standard SQL operators and some non-standard operators. They can be used to write expressions which involve constant values, variables, values contained in fields and / or other expressions.

=== Precedence ===

==== Operator precedence ====

Table of operator precedence:

 INTERVAL
 BINARY, COLLATE
 !
 - (unary minus), ~ (unary bit inversion)
 ^
 *, /, DIV, %, MOD
 -, +
 &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;
 &amp;
 |
 =, &lt;=&gt;, &gt;=, &gt;, &lt;=, &lt;, &lt;&gt;, !=, IS, LIKE, REGEXP, IN
 BETWEEN, CASE, WHEN, THEN, ELSE
 NOT
 &amp;&amp;, AND
 XOR
 ||, OR
 :=

Modifiers:
* '''PIPES_AS_CONCAT''' - If this SQL mode is enabled, || has precedence on ^, but - and ~ have precedence on ||.
* '''HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE''' - If this SQL mode is enabled, NOT has the same precedence level as !.

==== Use of parenthesis ====

You can use parenthesis to force MySQL to evaluate a subexpression before another indipendently from operator precedence:

 SELECT (1 + 1) * 5 -- returns 10

You can also use parenthesis to make an expression more readable by humans, even if they don't affect the precedence:

 SELECT 1 + (2 * 5) -- the same as 1 + 2 * 5

=== Assignment operators ===

You can use the = operator to assign a value to a column:

 UPDATE `myTable` SET `uselessField`=0

When you want to assign a value to a variable, you must use the := operator, because the use of = would be ambigous (is it as assignment or a comparison?)

 SELECT @myvar := 1

You can also use SELECT INTO to assign values to one or more variables.

=== Comparison operators ===

==== Equality ====

If you want to check if 2 values are equal, you must use the = operator:

 SELECT True = True -- returns 1
 SELECT True = False -- returns 0

If you want to check if 2 values are different, you can use the &lt;&gt; or != operators, which have the same meaning:

 SELECT True &lt;&gt; False -- returns 1
 SELECT True != True -- returns 0

&lt;&gt; return 1 where = returns 0 and vice versa.

==== IS and NULL-safe comparison ====

When you compare a NULL value with a non-NULL value, you'll get NULL. If you want to check if a value is null, you can use IS:

 SELECT (NULL IS NULL) -- returns 1
 SELECT (1 IS NULL) -- returns 0
 SELECT (True IS True) -- returns an error!

You can check if a value is non-NULL:

 SELECT (True IS NOT NULL) -- returns 1

There is also an equality operator which considers NULL as a normal value, so it returns 1 (not NULL) if both values are NULL and returns 0 (not NULL) if one of the values is NULL:

 SELECT col1 &lt;=&gt; col2 FROM myTable

There is not a NULL-safe non-equality operator, but you can type the following:

 SELECT NOT (col1 &lt;=&gt; col2) FROM myTable

==== IS and boolean comparisons ====

IS and IS NOT can also be used for boolean comparisons. You can use them with the reserved words TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN (which is merely a synonym for NULL).

 SELECT 1 IS TRUE -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 IS NOT TRUE -- returns 0
 SELECT 1 IS FALSE -- returns 0
 SELECT (NULL IS NOT FALSE) -- returns 1: unkown is not false
 SELECT (NULL IS UNKOWN) -- returns 1
 SELECT (NULL IS NOT UNKNOWN) -- returns 0

==== Greater, Less... ====

You can check if a value is greater than another value:

 SELECT 100 &gt; 0 -- returns 1
 SELECT 4 &gt; 5 -- return 0

You can also check if a value is minor than another value:

 SELECT 1 &lt; 2 -- returns 1
 SELECT 2 &lt; 2 -- returns 0

This kind of comparisons also works on TEXT values:

 SELECT 'a' &lt; 'b' -- returns 1

Generally speaking, alphabetical order is used for TEXT comparisons. However, the exact rules are defined by the COLLATION used. A COLLATION defines the sorting rules for a given CHARACTER SET. For example, a COLLATION may be case-sensitive, while another COLLATION may be case-insesitive.

You can check if a value is equal or greater than another value. For example, the following queries have the same meaning:

 SELECT `a` &gt;= `b` FROM `myTable`
 SELECT NOT (`a` &lt; `b`) FROM `myTable`

Similarly, you can check if a value is less or equal to another value:

 SELECT `a` &lt;= `b` FROM `myTable`

==== BETWEEN ====

If you want to check if a value is included in a given range, you can use the BETWEEN ... AND ... operator. AND doesn't have its usual meaning. Example:

 SELECT 20 BETWEEN 10 AND 100 -- returns 1

The value after BETWEEN and the value after AND are included in the range.

You can also use NOT BETWEEN to check if a value is not included in a range:

 SELECT 8 NOT BETWEEN 5 AND 10 -- returns 0

==== IN ====

You can use the IN operator to check if a value is included in a list of values:

 SELECT 5 IN (5, 6, 7) -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 IN (5, 6, 7) -- returns 0

You should not include in the list both numbers and strings, or the results may be unpredictable. If you have numbers, you should quote them:

 SELECT 4 IN ('a', 'z', '5')

There is not a theorical limit to the number of values included in the IN operator.

You can also use NOT IN:

 SELECT 1 NOT IN (1, 2, 3) -- returns 0

=== Logical operators ===

==== MySQL boolean logic ====

MySQL doesn't have a real BOOLEAN datatype.

FALSE is a synonym for 0. Empty strings are considered as FALSE in a boolean context.

TRUE is a synonym for 1. All non-NULL and non-FALSE data are considered as TRUE in a boolean context.

UNKNOWN is a synonym for NULL. The special date 0/0/0 is NULL.

==== NOT ====

NOT is the only operator which has only one operand. It returns 0 if the operand is TRUE, returns 1 if the operand is FALSE and returns NULL if the operand is NULL.

 SELECT NOT 1 -- returns 0
 SELECT NOT FALSE -- returns 1
 SELECT NOT NULL -- returns NULL
 SELECT NOT UNKNOWN -- returns NULL

! is a synonym for NOT.

 SELECT !1

==== AND ====

AND returns 1 if both the operands are TRUE, else returns 0; if one of the operands is NULL, returns NULL.

 SELECT 1 AND 1 -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 AND '' -- return 0
 SELECT '' AND NULL -- returns NULL

&amp;&amp; is a synonym for AND.

 SELECT 1 &amp;&amp; 1

==== OR ====

OR returns TRUE if at least one of the operands is TRUE, else returns FALSE; if one of the operands is NULL, returns NULL.

 SELECT TRUE OR FALSE -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 OR 1 -- returns 1
 SELECT FALSE OR FALSE -- returns 0
 SELECT NULL OR TRUE -- returns NULL

|| is a synonym for OR.

 SELECT 1 || 0

==== XOR ====

XOR (eXclusive OR) returns 1 if only one of the operands is TRUE and the other operand is FALSE; returns 0 if both the operands are TRUE o both the operands are FALSE; returns NULL if one of the operands is NULL.

 SELECT 1 XOR 0 -- returns 1
 SELECT FALSE XOR TRUE -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 XOR TRUE -- returns 0
 SELECT 0 XOR FALSE -- returns 0
 SELECT NULL XOR 1 -- returns NULL

==== Synonyms ====

AND can be written as &amp;&amp;&lt;br/&gt;
OR can be written ad ||&lt;br/&gt;
NOT can be written as !

Only NOT (usually) has a different precedence from its synonym. See operator precedence for datail.

=== Arithmetic operators ===

MySQL supports operands which perform all basic arithmetic operations.

You can type positive values with a '+', if you want:
 SELECT +1 -- return 1

You can type negative values with a '-'. - is an inversion operand:
 SELECT -1 -- returns -1
 SELECT -+1 -- returns -1
 SELECT --1 -- returns 1

You can make sums with '+':
 SELECT 1 + 1 -- returns 2

You can make subtractions with '-':
 SELECT True - 1 -- returns 0

You can multiply a number with '*':
 SELECT 1 * 1 -- returns 1

You can make divisions with '/'. Returns a FLOAT number:
 SELECT 10 / 2 -- returns 5.0000
 SELECT 1 / 1 -- returns 1.0000
 SELECT 1 / 0 -- returns NULL (not an error)

You can make integer divisions with DIV. Resulting number is an INTEGER. No reminder. This has been added in MySQL 4.1.
 SELECT 10 DIV 3 -- returns 3

You can get the reminder of a division with '%' or MOD:
 SELECT 10 MOD 3 -- returns 1

==== Using + to cast data ====

You can convert an INTEGER to a FLOAT doing so:

 SELECT 1 + 0.0 -- returns 1.0
 SELECT 1 + 0.000 -- returns 1.000
 SELECT TRUE + 0.000 -- returns 1.000

You can't convert a string to a FLOAT value by adding 0.0, but you can cast it to an INTEGER:

 SELECT '1' + 0 -- returns 1
 SELECT '1' + FALSE -- returns 1
 SELECT &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; + &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; -- returns 0

=== Text operators ===

There are no concatenation operators in MySQL.

Arithmetic operators convert the values into numbers and then perform arithmetic operations, so you can't use + to concatenate strings.

You can use the CONCAT() function instead.

==== LIKE ====

The LIKE operator may be used to check if a string matches to a pattern. A simple example:

 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE 'hello world'

The pattern matching is usually case insensitive. There are two exceptions:

* when a LIKE comparison is performed against a column which has been declared with the BINARY flag (see CREATE TABLE);
* when the expression contains the BINARY clause:
 SELECT * 'test' LIKE BINARY 'TEST' -- returns 0

You can use two special characters for LIKE comparisons:
* '''_''' means &quot;any character&quot; (but must be 1 char, not 0 or 2)
* '''%''' means &quot;any sequence of chars&quot; (even 0 chars or 1000 chars)

Note that &quot;\&quot; also escapes quotes (&quot;'&quot;) and this behaviour can't be changed by the ESCAPE clause. Also, the escape character does not escape itself.

Common uses of LIKE:

* Find titles starting with the word &quot;hello&quot;:
 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE 'hello%'

* Find titles ending with the word &quot;world&quot;:
 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '%world'

* Find titles containing the word &quot;gnu&quot;:
 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '%gnu%'

These special chars may be contained in the pattern itself: for example, you could need to search for the &quot;_&quot; character. In that case, you need to &quot;escape&quot; the char:

 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '\_%' -- titles starting with _
 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '\%%' -- titles starting with %
 
Sometimes, you may want to use an escape character different from &quot;\&quot;. For example, you could use &quot;/&quot;:

 SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '/_%' ESCAPE '/'

When you use = operator, trailing spaces are ignored. When you use LIKE, they are taken into account.

 SELECT 'word' = 'word ' -- returns 1
 SELECT 'word' LIKE 'word ' -- returns 0


LIKE also works with numbers.

 SELECT 123 LIKE '%2%' -- returns 1

If you want to check if a pattern doesn't match, you can use NOT LIKE:

 SELECT 'a' NOT LIKE 'b' -- returns 1

==== SOUNDS LIKE ====

You can use SOUNDS LIKE to check if 2 text values are pronounced in the same way. SOUNDS LIKE uses the SOUNDEX algorythm, which is bases on english rules and is very approximate (but simple and thus fast).

 SELECT `word1` SOUNDS LIKE `word2` FROM `wordList` -- short form
 SELECT SOUNDEX(`word1`) = SOUNDEX(`word2`) FROM `wordList` -- long form

SOUNDS LIKE is a MySQL-specific extension to SQL. It has been added in MySQL 4.1.

==== Regular expressions ====

You can use REGEXP to check if a string matches to a pattern using regular expressions.

 SELECT 'string' REGEXP 'pattern'

You can use RLIKE as a synonym for REGEXP.

=== Bitwise operators ===

Bit-NOT:

 SELECT ~0 -- returns 18446744073709551615
 SELECT ~1 -- returns 18446744073709551614

Bit-AND:

 SELECT 1 &amp; 1 -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 &amp; 3 -- returns 1
 SELECT 2 &amp; 3 -- returns 2

Bit-OR:

 SELECT 1 | 0 -- returns 1
 SELECT 3 | 0 -- returns 3
 SELECT 4 | 2 -- returns 6

Bit-XOR:

 SELECT 1 ^ 0 -- returns 1
 SELECT 1 ^ 1 -- returns 0
 SELECT 3 ^ 1 -- returns 2

Left shift:

 SELECT 1 &lt;&lt; 2 -- returns 4

Right shift:

 SELECT 1 &gt;&gt; 2 -- 0

== Import / export ==

Aside from mysqldump (cf. [[MySQL/Administration]]), you can also export raw data using:
 SELECT ... FROM table INTO OUTFILE 'path'
 LOAD DATA INFILE 'path' INTO TABLE table

Examples:
 SELECT * FROM destinataire INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/test' WHERE id IN (41, 141, 260, 317, 735, 888, 1207, 2211);
 # in another database/computer/etc.:
 LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test' INTO TABLE destinataire;

Beware that the MySQL daemon itself will write the file, not the user you run the MySQL client with. The file will be stored on the server, not on your host. Moreover, the server will need write access to the path you specify (usually, the server can _not_ write in your home directory, e.g.). Hence why we (unsecurely) used &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; in the examples.

=== Examples ===

==== Finding Duplicates ====

 SELECT Vendor, ID, Count(1) as dupes
 FROM table_name
 GROUP BY Vendor, ID HAVING Count(1) &gt;1

 SELECT txt, COUNT(*)
 FROM dupes
 GROUP BY txt HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;

 SELECT id, COUNT( id ) AS cnt, 
 FROM myTable
 GROUP BY id HAVING cnt &gt; 1

==== Remove duplicate entries. ====
Assume the following table and data.
    
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dupTest &lt;br /&gt;
(pkey int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,&lt;br /&gt;
a int, b int, c int, timeEnter timestamp(14),&lt;br /&gt;
PRIMARY KEY  (pkey));

insert into dupTest (a,b,c) values (1,2,3),(1,2,3),&lt;br /&gt;
(1,5,4),(1,6,4);

Note, the first two rows contains duplicates in columns a and b. It contains other duplicates; but, leaves the other duplicates alone.

ALTER IGNORE TABLE  dupTest ADD UNIQUE INDEX(a,b);</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Federalism and State Authority ==

The United States, with a few exceptions such as Canada and Austria, is unique in its anti-federalist system, where sovereign governments share certain powers.  As you may recall in the study of the Articles of Confederation as well as the debate over the ratification of the Constitution, the argument concerning the power of the federal government versus that of the states was a hot issue.  In fact, the debate continued for many decades after the Constitution went into effect, leading to the Civil War, which ultimately settled the supremacy of the federal government over the states.  Even so, the debate continues to one extent or another over where the boundaries between federal prerogative and state's rights should be drawn.

== What is Federalism? ==

'''Federalism,''' as stated before, is a sharing of power between sovereign governments.  The federal government has specific powers laid out in the Constitution.  And while the Tenth Amendment reserves any power &quot;to the States respectively, or to the people&quot; any powers not expressly granted to the federal government by the Constitution, Article IV details the relationship of the states with the federal government, as well as limits on the states.

*  &quot;Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.   And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.&quot;  (Section 1)  In other words, documents such as driver's licenses and marriage certificates are recognized across state lines, and court rulings in one state still apply in other states.  This is known as the &quot;full faith and credit clause.&quot;
*  &quot;The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.&quot; (Section 2, Clause 1)  This has been the source of differing interpretations, with one side purporting the idea that this clause requires the federal government to treat all citizens equally, while the other side contends that the rights afforded on a person's home state will be carried over into another state.  The Supreme Court has upheld the meaning as disallowing states from discriminating against citizens of another state over its own citizens.
*  &quot;A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.&quot; (Section 2, Clause 2)  If a governor of one state requests a fugitive who has crossed into another state to be returned to his or her home state (extradition), then the governor of the other state must do so.  The Supreme Court has ruled that federal courts may compel governors to surrender fugitives (writs of mandamus).
*  &quot;No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.&quot; (Section 2, Clause 3)  Called the Fugitive Slave Clause, this portion of the Constitution is no longer valid -- it was repealed following the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery.  However, when it was in effect, it allowed for the extradition of runaway slaves returned on the claims of their enslavers.
*  &quot;New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.&quot;  (Section 3, Clause 1)  This simply states that Congress may admit new states into the United States.  It forbade the creation of new states from portions of current states or portions of two states combined unless the legislatures of the concerned state or states, as well as Congress, agreed.  There was (and still is, nominally) debate about how the State of West Virginia came about, since it was carved out of a portion of the State of Virginia by Union sympathizers during the Civil War, and yet done so without the consent of the Virginia legislature.
*  &quot;The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.&quot;  (Section 3, Clause 2)  Essentially, all federal territories are areas ''belonging to'' but not a ''part of'' the United States.  In the past, such areas included the Louisiana Territory, the Oregon Territory, and Alaska before statehood.  Examples today include Puerto Rico and Guam, which are not states but are U.S. territories.  The U.S. Congress has final power over U.S. territory and has the power to determine which portions of the Constitution apply in the territories.
*  &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.&quot;  (Section 4)  Self-explanatory; each state in the U.S. will have a republican form of government.  And they do.  State governments run parallel to the federal government, with three branches of government.  State governments are very similar to each other and to the federal government.  This will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.  The federal government also has a responsibility to protect states from invasion or attack.

== How State Governments Work ==
As was mentioned earlier, state governments are very similar to the structure of the federal government, with three branches (legislative, executive, judicial).  Each state has its own constitution, but the specifics of the laws, regulations, and the system itself differs from state to state.  In this respect, states are not mere subordinate provinces of Washington, DC, but sovereign states in Union with each other.  State governments are thus very powerful compared to their counterparts in most other countries.  However, the U.S. Constitution remains the ultimate authority as supreme law of the land.

=== Executive ===

==== Governor ====
The executive branch of government in each of the states is headed by the '''governor,''' who is elected by the citizens of each state and not subordinate to federal authority.  As such, the governor is head of government, head of state, and commander-in-chief of the state's military forces (the National Guard).  The process for the election of the governor, the extent of his or her power, and the limitations on the governor's term of service are different for each state, according to each state's constitution.

'''Lieutenant governors''' are often elected on the same ticket as the governor.  However, in 18 states, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately, and it is possible (and often the case) for governors and lieutenant governors to be of different political parties.  42 of the 50 states and all five U.S. territories have lieutenant governors.  Lieutenant governors are essentially &quot;second in command&quot; to the governor, and have many roles similar to that of the vice president of the United States.  If a governor is out of the state or dies or becomes incapacitated, the lieutenant governor takes over as governor (though, in some states, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor until an election is held).  The lieutenant governor is often the presiding officer of the upper house of the state legislature (similar to the vice president's role as president of the U.S. Senate), and in some states the lieutenant governor is equivalent to a secretary of state position in other states.

==== Departments and Offices ====
Unlike the federal government, most states have plural executives, in which key members of the executive are elected by the people.  This is not true across the nation, however, and varies greatly by state, with some such positions done by election and some by appointment.  In some states, all or several of these positions may be constitutionally-created, while in other states, some or all of these positions are appointed by the governor, legislature, or judiciary.  These posts include (but are certainly not limited to) secretaries of state, attorney generals, and state auditors.

'''Secretaries of State''' are probably most known for their duties as the chief election officials of their respective states.  The secretary of state is usually in the line of succession for the governorship, usually after the lieutenant governor.  In states which do not have a lieutenant governor, the secretary of state is next in the line of succession for the governorship.  In states which do not have a secretary of state, the duties often fall upon the lieutenant governor.  Common duties amongst secretaries of state throughout the United States include administration of the Uniform Commercial Code (law which ensures uniformity in business contracts and practices across the United States), record keeping, administration of notaries public, and keepers of the states' seal.  In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, this position is called &quot;Secretary of the Commonwealth.&quot;

State '''attornies general''' are chief legal advisors to the state government and chief law enforcement officers of the state.  In some states, they head a state department of justice, similar to that of the U.S. Department of Justice.

State auditors may also be known as state comptrollers or state controllers.

Several state departments exist similar to the president's cabinet at the federal level.  These departments administer the state's bureaucracy, and may variously be known as departments, agencies, or commissions, dependant on state.  One well-known bureaucratic agency in which people deal with regularly is the Department of Motor Vehicles.  This is the agency which issues driver's licenses and registration.  In some states, the function is handled by an actual Department of Motor Vehicles (or similar agency with a different name), while in other states it is handled by subdivisions of the state's transportation department.  In Hawaii, this function is done at the county level.  Some other agencies which you (the reader) may be familiar with include Fish &amp; Game, Forestry, or Transportation.

==== Law Enforcement ====

===== State Marshall =====

===== State Police/State Trooper/Highway Patrol =====

===== Forest/Park Ranger =====

=== State Assembly ===

=== State Judiciary ===

=== County Government ===
The '''county''' is the level of administration subordinate to the state.  Counties exist as political divisions in 48 of the 50 states.  In Connecticut and Rhode Island, counties represent little more than geographical divisions -- lines on the map.  In Alaska, counties are known as boroughs, and in Louisiana, they are called parishes.  County governments range in power from state to state, from non-existent (as is the case in Connecticut and Rhode Island), to weak (most parts of New England) to having a wide range of power within their specific county or jurisdiction.

==== Administration ====

The administrative center of a county is known as the '''county seat.'''  It is almost analogous to the &quot;capital city&quot; for the county.  Counties are often governed by a '''board of supervisors''' or '''county commission''' (as with most everything discussed thusfar in this section, there are great variations across state lines and, in some cases, even county lines), which are elected by the people in the county.  These boards or commissions have executive, legislative, and judicial power within their jurisdictions; the power to enact county ordinances, the power to enforce said ordinances, and even certain limited appellate powers relating to county administration and decisions made by commissions underneath the board, especially relating to planning.

Day-to-day operations are often overseen by a county manager.  A county clerk, registrar, or recorder is responsible for records such as corporate charters, marriage licenses, judgements, elections, and voter registration.  In addition, in most counties, the local trial courts are located at the county seat.

==== Services and Scope ====

As was mentioned above, the scope of each county's authority in administrating its jurisdiction varies greatly across the country.  In New England, this scope is minimal -- non-existent in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts, where the ability to tax and issue permits lies with municipal governments.  In other parts of New England, counties function as part of a sheriff's jurisdiction (see below).

In most counties outside of New England, counties typically provide courts, public utilities, libraries, hospitals, public health, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails.  Other key county officials include the coroner/medical examiner, treasurer, assessor, auditor, controller, and district attorney.

==== The Sheriff ====

The duties and responsibilities of sheriffs vary greatly across state and county lines.  A '''sheriff''' is generally the highest law-enforcement official for the county, and is often elected by the people of the county, a unique characteristic of United States politics.  In the South, the election for sheriff may be seen as the most important position in county politics.

The sheriff's office uses sworn officers called '''sheriff's deputies''' to execute the law enforcement responsibilities of his or her office.  Again, these duties vary greatly between states, with commensurate duties going to state police in some states.  Of the 3,141 counties in the United States, only 80 have an actual &quot;county police department.&quot;  The sheriff's department usually performs the duties of &quot;county police.&quot;

==== Taxation ====

Though rare, counties may impose a sales tax on goods and services purchased in a county.  Most revenue for the county comes in the way of property taxes (such as on a home or place of business), user fees (such as those for parks), and other fees or fines (traffic violations, parking meters, etc.).  These funds are used to provide county services, such as law enforcement, schools, or snow removal.

=== Municipalities ===

'''Municipalities''' are levels of government below the county level.  Different sorts of municipalities include villages, towns or townships, and cities.  These are '''incorporated''' by state charter.  Any area not incorporated into a municipality is considered to be an unincorporated area, and is directly administered by the county.

Why did you enter this competition? Miss Jamaica Tourism Queen 2008 because I have all the qualities that I think are necessary to bring home the Mikimoto crown.I believe that Jamaica has so many stunningly beautiful women with dynamic personalities and being one of them I think it's time that we show this to the world.Jamaica has never won the crown or even placed top 3 which is absolutely unbelievable because we have the capability to do so.

What personal attribute(s) you feel will give you an 'edge' over the other contestants? The personal attributes that I possess that I believe will give me the edge over the other contestants are my sassiness, my spunk, my passion and vigor for everything I do, my sincerity &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;, and my drive and determination to win not only Miss Jamaica but also Miss Tourism.I want to go to China and leave a lasting impression so even when it is all over everyone is speaking about Miss Jamaica.In addition to that I have been training for months now and preparing for this pageant I decided to enter from September last year and from then I have been putting my all into this, so at the end of the day I can feel fulfilled within myself that I have done all that I could possibly do and the rest I leave up to God.

How do you intend to take home the Miss Tourism crown for Jamaica? I plan to take home the Miss Tourism crown for Jamaica by being myself. Like I said before I believe that I have all the qualities necessary to win the Miss Tourism crown.I am smart, I am sassy, I am intelligent, and I am beautiful.I love my country and I want to show the world what this little island can do&quot;we likkle but we tallowah&quot;.If I am chosen as Miss Jamaica I am going to go to China and give Venezuela, Brazil , Puerto Rico and all those other countries that are always winning a SERIOUS run for their money!!

What will be your platform (charity) if you win, and why? My platform for charity will be helping children to cultivate their love for animals.As an animal lover myself in today's society I see too much abuse and blatant disregard for animals and animal life.If children dont regard life starting with animals as they get older they will have no regard for life in general.If a child is allowed the opportunity to interreact with pets or domestic animals then they will see the value of life, by creating a bond with the animal.Our problem in today's society is lack of value of life, people dont even value their own life that is why the crime rate is so high.The bible says &quot; train a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it&quot;.We need to start with the youth and it is the little things that make such a big difference.

If you could pick the winner (other than yourself), who would that be, and why? If I could choose a winner other than myself I would choose Bridgette Young.She is smart, she is beautiful, she is a very nice girl, and she seems to me as being very genuine. She displays this glowing beauty from inside from the first time we met our personalities clicked I think she would be a great representative for Jamaica and I think she would make us proud.

Describe yourself using three adjectives. Three adjectives to describe me are Caring, adventerous, and Sincere.

What beauty product can't you go without? A beauty product that I absolutely cant do without is my moisturizer (oil of olay)

Reggae or Dancehall? Definitely Dancehall I love to have fun, dance and enjoy myself.

&quot;Fashion over style&quot; or &quot;Style over fashion&quot; Style over fashion, not everything that is in fashion will necessarily look good on you everyone must know what fits them and have their own unique style.

Bikinis or boyshorts for the beach? Bikinis for the beach for sure.

'''Construction'''

The derailleur consists of a clamp, a pivot, and a cage. A derailleur is usually attached to the bicycle frame's seat tube by a round clamp, or bolted onto a small, slotted metal piece which has been welded onto the seat tube. The derailleur has two metal plates which form a cage around the chain. The derailleur's clamp and cage are connected to each other by a pivot.
 
'''Function'''

The front derailleur's function is to move the chain from one chain ring to another. The rider uses a lever connected to the pivot by a cable to move the cage inwards or outwards. When the cage moves inward, toward the bicycle frame, the outer portion contacts the chain and pushes it inward, off of the current chain ring and onto the next chain ring closer to the bicycles frame. When the cage moves outward, away from the frame, the inner portion contacts the chain and pushes it outward, off of the current chain ring and onto the next chain ring further away from the bicycle's frame.

'''Adjustments'''

Height-By adjusting the height of the clamp, it is possible to move the derailleur cage closer or further from the top of the chain rings.
 
Angle-By rotating the clamp to the left or right, it is possible to adjust the position of the derailleur cage relative to the chain and the chain rings, either parallel or out of parallel.
 
Travel-The front derailleur has two limit screws which limit how far the cage is able to travel either inward or outward. These function much like a door stop. If the cage is able to move too far inward, it can move the chain completely off the inner chain ring. If the cage is able to move too far outward, it can move the chain completely off the outer chain ring where it can get jammed between the ring and the inside of the crank arm. The screw which limits the inward travel is often labeled as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;L&quot;. Turning this screw counterclockwise, or unscrewing it results in the cage moving inward as far as possible. Turning the screw clockwise results in moving the cage further away from the bicycle frame. The screw which limits how far the derailleur can move outward is often marked as &quot;High&quot; or &quot;H&quot;. Since the outer chain ring is larger and therefore harder to pedal, associating &quot;High&quot; or &quot;H&quot; with &quot;Hard&quot; can make it easier to remember which is which. With the &quot;High&quot; adjusting screw turned completely counterclockwise, the derailleur cage will be able to travel to its outermost position, as far from the bicycle's frame as possible. Turning this screw clockwise will decrease this possible amount of travel. 

Cable tension-With no cable attached, or with a cable attached in a slackened state, the derailleur is in its resting position, as far inwards toward the bicycle frame possible, depending on how the &quot;Low&quot; limit screw has been positioned. There is usually an adjusting knob attached to the front derailleur's handlebar-mounted shifting lever. Rotating this knob clockwise, or screwing it in, will lessen the cable tension. Rotating the knob counterclockwise, or unscrewing it, will increase the cable tension. Lessening cable tension results in the derailleur cage moving inward. Increasing cable tension results in the derailleur cage moving outward. 

'''Initial Setup'''

Braze-on mounted front derailleur-For frames with a welded on front derailleur &quot;braze-on&quot; mount, place the derailleur's convex mounting face so it mates with the rearward facing, concave mounting face of the braze-on. Insert the mounting bolt through the braze-on from front to rear, screwing it into the derailleur's mounting bolt hole. Take one end of the bicycle chain and route it over the top of the smallest front chain ring, inserting it through the derailleur cage, passing it on to the rear of the bicycle, wrapping around any of the rear wheel's gear cogs, down through the rear derailleur pulleys, and then back forward toward the underside of the front chain rings. over the cogs of the rear wheel and routed through the rear derailleur's pulley wheels and back toward the underside of the front chain rings. Final chain length should already be determined. If not, see &quot;chain length&quot; section of maintenance page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Memory layout diagrams''' and '''memory evolution diagrams''' depict the contents of a linear address space, either at a single moment in time, or as they change with time.

== History and Known Uses ==
Memory layout/evolution diagrams are typically used in descriptions of language systems ([[Wikipedia:en:Compiler|compilers]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Interpreter_(computing)|interpreters]]).
They are frequently seen in undergraduate courses on programming language concepts, computer hardware, or compiler design,
for example during discussions of [[Wikipedia:en:Call_stack|stack allocation of memory for function calls]] or layout of data in memory for records or arrays.

Memory Layout Diagrams date back at least to the [[Wikipedia:en:Principles_of_Compiler_Design|Green Dragon Book]](Aho &amp; Ullman 1977),
which shows many MLD's for stack frame layout (in Chapter 10);
Memory Evolution Diagrams have been used more recently to illustrate use and re-use of memory in a way that produces diagrams that can be understood later by students reviewing their lecture notes.

== What is Being Visualized ==
'''Memory layout diagrams''' and
'''memory evolution diagrams''' each provide information about
the organization of values within computer memory,
indicating the value contained within each of a number of memory cells.
The former show a snapshot of the contents of memory at a given instant;
the latter show the development through time of the contents.

As indicated below,
various different uses of memory may be illustrated,
for example stack frame layout,
data structure organization,
heap (free storage) layout, etc.

Depending on the need,
the diagram may show an abstract layout with labels but no values,
or a memory image for a specific execution of a specific program including specific values in each memory cell.
Stylistic variations include whether labels are written beside or in a given memory cell.

== Visualization Techniques ==
=== Memory layout diagrams ===
A memory layout diagram can be simply a collection of rectangles,
typically stacked vertically,
with each rectangle corresponding to a given memory cell or group of cells.
Depending on emphasis,
a layout diagram may show all cells or only some of them,
and it may show each byte or each word of memory.
For example, to illustrate the use of stack frames for function parameters
using this example C++ program for raising a number to a power

&lt;pre&gt;
bool even(int i) { // return True iff i is an even number
    return i % 2 == 0;
}

double power(double base, int exp) {
    if (exp == 1)
        return base;
    else if (even(exp)) {
        double base_to_half_exp = power(base, exp/2);
        return base_to_half_exp * base_to_half_exp;
    }
    else
        return base * power(base, exp-1);
}

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; power(2, 10) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

we might draw one box for each word (and a large box for a double word), producing a diagram like the following for (for example) the point at which we are checking to see if 4 is even during the computation of power(2, 10) --- carefully formatted and hand-drawn images might look like this (the potentially confusing cross-outs and erasures in the hand-drawn image are the motivation for the Memory Evolution Diagrams below):

[[File:Power_log_mld.svg|417px]][[File:Power_log_mld_overwritten.jpg|300px]]

The above examples show specific values for a specific execution of the program;
the diagrams in Chapter 10 of the green dragon book show a more abstract view of the same topic.

Memory layout diagrams are frequently used to discuss options for data structure layout in memory. For example, Chapter 7.3 of Scott's [http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/pragmatics/ Programming Language Pragmatics] shows several ways of laying out in memory a structure almost identical to the one below (with an example MLD, based on the assumption that each field is word-aligned and a &quot;bool&quot; value will be stored in one byte of memory). Note that Scott's diagrams are more abstract than the one shown here, as they do not include specific values for all fields.

&lt;pre&gt;                                       
struct element {   // similar to Ex. 7.35 of Scott's &quot;Programming Language Pragmatics&quot; (3rd ed).
  char   name[2];
  int    atomic_number;
  double atomic_weight;
  bool   metallic;
};

struct element aluminum = {{'A', 'l'}, 13, 26.98, true };
&lt;/pre&gt;[[File:element_data_struct_mld.svg|231px]]

=== Memory evolution diagrams ===
A memory evolution diagram is a systematic way of capturing memory use over time.
It can be thought of as a series of layout diagrams for different times,
aligned next to each other, for example progressing from left to right with time.
Typically a large range of values that have not changed are not copied,
so that one looks back to the left when no value is shown for a certain cell.
Contrast the diagram below with the hand-drawn image above ---
the MED, even if drawn by hand, provides a much more comprehensible image of what has happened.
(Note also that the MED here shows more information than the MLD above,
in that it includes frame pointer and stack pointer information,
and an additional function call;
adding these to the picture above makes the difference in clarity even more pronounced.)

Use this for all kinds of BBQ. It's a bit spicy, so use sparingly.

== Ingredients  ==
* 2 cups smoked paprika
* 1/4 cup salt
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 3 tbsp cayenne pepper (you can change this at will)
* 1/4 cup dry mustard
* 1/4 cup garlic powder
* 1/4 cup dried rosemary
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

== Procedure ==
#Combine all ingredients in a container with a shaker lid.

This is sort of our classic BBQ ribs.

==Ingredients==
* 1 slab pork spareribs
* 6 tbsp [[Cookbook:Rib Rub|Rib Rub]]                                           
* 1 cup tomato paste
* 1/2 cup molasses
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 2 tbs Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbs soy sauce
* Hickory chunks

==Procedure==
#Season spareribs with rib rub.
#Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
#Place chunks in smoker or charcoal grill set for indirect heat at 250°.
#Combine liquid ingredients and bring to a boil over high heat.
#Reduce liquid by 1/3.
#Place spareribs into smoker or grill for 4-5 hours, basting occasionally with sauce.
#Brush remaining sauce on top of ribs and place on a medium high grill until browned.
#Let rest for 10 minutes and carve.</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.



Also, when creating pages for food receipies, place place them within the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|cookbook]] namespace.  This helps ensure that your contributions will be found by other users searching the cookbook for things to try. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 22:35, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

== Cookbook ==

Please create new pages in the cookbook's namespace.  To do this, create the page as [[Cookbook:Recipe Name]] rather than as simply [[Recipe name]].  I am in the process of moving the pages you have created (thanks for creating them).  If you need assistance, please ask.  Also consider creating an account. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:28, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Working with metadata===

The point always comes with working with database objects when you need to understand more about the nature of the database structure than perhaps you do at the time of writing the code. Database tables get changed, a column type may be changed from a date to string type for instance, or a new column may be added or deleted; potentially you may have to reference a table which has not even yet been built or which is constructed on the fly. It is at this juncture that a rather handy facet of JDBC can be brought to bear: the metadata interfaces ResultSetMetaData and DatabaseMetaData.

It is important to remember when working with resultsets is that arrays are constructed from a SQL perspective, i.e. they start with an index with a value of 1 and not 0. You should also note that there are potentially issues with SqLite and JDBC when working with metadata on a table with 0 rows; rsmd.getColumnType() for example, won't work, whereas rsmd.getColumnName() curiously will.

Let's consider the following rudimentary method from which we can know the extent of the columns which any arbitrary ResultSet is returning:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
  public int getColumnCount(ResultSet rs) {
    int iOutput = 0;
        try {
            ResultSetMetaData rsMetaData = rs.getMetaData();
            iOutput = rsMetaData.getColumnCount();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            return iOutput = -1;
        }
    return iOutput;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

So, using the previous Db.executeQry(java.lang.String) wrapper method we can now do something very simple like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
[..]
   String mySqlSelect = &quot;SELECT * FROM some_arbitrary_table&quot; ;
   ResultSet myRs = db.executeQry(mySqlSelect);
   int iResult = getColumnCount(myRs);
   System.out.println(iResult);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we need to know the column types.....

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 public int[] getType(ResultSet rs) {
        int iType[] = null;
        try {
            ResultSetMetaData rm = rs.getMetaData();
            int iArray[] = new int[rm.getColumnCount()];
            for (int ctr = 1; ctr &lt;= iArray.length; ctr++) {
                int iVal = rm.getColumnType(ctr);
                iArray[ctr - 1] = iVal;
            }
            return iArray;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            return iType;
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

This will return an array of integers expressing the column types which are in our ResultSet. We may need to handle these integer values as strings, so the alternative way of doing this is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
  public String[] getColumnTypeArray(ResultSet rs) {
        String sArr[] = null;
        try {
            ResultSetMetaData rm = rs.getMetaData();
            String sArray[] = new String[rm.getColumnCount()];
            for (int ctr = 1; ctr &lt;= sArray.length; ctr++) {
                String s = rm.getColumnTypeName(ctr);
                sArray[ctr - 1] = s;
            }
            return sArray;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            return sArr;
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

The correlation between the integer array and the string array is an aspect of the ''java.sql.Types'' class. Either way will work for programmatic purposes.

So we now know the ResultSet's column extent and its data types. Now we need to know the column names so we can reference them. Here again ResultSetMetaData provides the answer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 public String[] getColumnNameArray(ResultSet rs) {
        String sArr[] = null;
        try {
            ResultSetMetaData rm = rs.getMetaData();
            String sArray[] = new String[rm.getColumnCount()];
            for (int ctr = 1; ctr &lt;= sArray.length; ctr++) {
                String s = rm.getColumnName(ctr);
                sArray[ctr - 1] = s;
            }
            return sArray;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            return sArr;
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;


So, using the previous Db.executeQry wrapper method we can now begin to handle our unknown and/or unforeseeable database structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
  [..]
  String mySqlSelect = &quot;SELECT * FROM some_arbitrary_table&quot; ;  
  ResultSet myRs = db.executeQry(mySqlSelect);  
  int iResult = getColumnCount(myRs);  
  String[] colNames = getColumnNameArray(myRs);
  String[] colTypes = getColumnTypeArray(myRs);
  for (int i=1;i&lt;iResult;i++)
  {
     System.out.println(&quot;Column: &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + colNames[i] + &quot; and is type: &quot; + colTypes[i]);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Using Wikibooks/Page}}
{{TOC}}
If you've read [[../Finding A Wikibook/]], then you see that there are many ways to find a Wikibook on the topic of your choice.  However, whether starting a new book or expanding heavily on a book that is merely a stub, you need to ensure that your book is visible to both readers and potential contributors.  The terminology used in Wikibooks for the various methods of organization can be confusing, and the proper implementation of those methods on your book can be even harder to grasp.  After reading the following sections you should have a better idea how this all works.

To help make the entire book visible to readers and potential contributors, most books have:

* the template '''{{tlx|BookCat}}''' on the bottom of every page in the book, except the main page
* The template '''{{tlx|Subjects|Foo|Bar}}''' on the bottom of the book's main page (see below for what to use instead of &quot;Foo&quot; or &quot;Bar&quot;)
* The exact same '''{{tlx|Subjects|Foo|Bar}}''' template (with exactly the same list of subjects) on the bottom of the book's category page
* The '''{{tlx|book category header}}''' template at the top of the book's category page

{{clear}}
==Subjects and categories==
As a reader, browsing the [[Subject:Major Subjects|subject pages]] allows you to find books on the topic of your choice.  As a writer, you have an interest in having your book appear in the subject of ''your'' choice.  The subject pages are dynamically generated, meaning you cannot add your book to a subject page directly to have it appear there.  Each subject page has wiki markup in it that specifies a certain category to look in for pages that will be then displayed on the subject page.  When you file your book's main page in that special category, it will appear on the corresponding subject page.  The details of how to do this are explained later.

The pages of your book also need to be filed in a category, but they should not be filed in the special category that matches up to the subject in which you are filing the main page of your book.  If they were, every page of your book would show up on the subject page, overwhelming all the other books and destroying the value of the subject page.  Instead, they should be filed in a category whose name is the title of your book.  The details of this are explained below.

Keeping these two types of categories straight can be difficult, and so the category a book's main page is filed in is often referred to as a ''subject category'', since anything filed in it appears in a subject page.  The category the rest of the book's pages are filed in is referred to as a ''book category'', since everything filed in it should pertain only to a single book.  You might wonder if a book category and subject category might ever have the same name, resulting in havoc.  Several factors ensure that this does not happen.  Subject pages correspond ''exactly'' to the category that they &quot;pull&quot; from to make filing a book's main page easier and, by convention, subjects have been named using {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Sentence case&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  Books are normally titled using {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Title Case&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  Using these conventions, subject category and book category name conflicts are avoided, permitting situations such as {{nowrap|[[:Category:Emergency Medicine]]}} acting as the book category for {{nowrap|[[Emergency Medicine]]}} and {{nowrap|[[:Category:Emergency medicine]]}} acting as the subject category for {{nowrap|[[Emergency Medicine]]}}.

==Filing your book's main page==
Your book's main page is key to having your book be found by those who would have an interest in it.  Several pieces of code need to be added to it for your book to appear both on subject pages and on pages used for other methods of finding books.

===Subject category===
If you have spent the time determining your book's subject matter and scope, then you will have an easier time determining what subject category to file it in.  The [[Subject:Major Subjects|top-level subjects]] all contain more specific subjects within them.  Only in the rarest of cases will your book be filed in a top-level subject category, and if you believe it belongs there you should consider narrowing the scope of the book.  A book needs to be placed in the most specific subject possible, and usually only needs to be placed in one subject.  A more specific subject is one of many that are encompassed by a less specific subject, so there is no need to file a book in ''both''.  For instance, a book filed in [[Subject:Constructed languages]] does not also need to be filed in [[Subject:Languages]] since the former is one of many subjects that are part of the latter.

Also, file your book based on the topic it actually covers and not topics that would only be related tangentially. For example, a book filed in [[Subject:Educational software]] should ''not'' be filed in [[Subject:Microsoft Windows]] as well simply because it covers a program that runs on Windows. 

The hard part is figuring out what subject best matches your book's content. The easy part is actually putting the main page in the subject category that corresponds to the subject page you want it to show up in. Simply place '''{{tlx|Subjects|Foo}}''' or '''{{tlx|Subjects|Foo|Bar}}''' on the bottom of your book's main page, where &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; are subject category names. As mentioned earlier, less is more, so do not overdo it.

===Alphabetical classification===
Finally, the [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical classification|alphabetical classification]] system allows people to search for a book by the first letter or number in its title.  This is especially helpful if someone is looking for several books on the same topic that all start out with the same first word in the title.

The easiest of all the methods you have at your disposal for filing your book, simply add '''{{tlx|Alphabetical|*}}''' to the bottom of your book's main page, where &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is the first letter or number in your book's title. Use your discretion as to whether to count the words &quot;A&quot; or &quot;The&quot; as the first words of your title for the purposes of filing. Ideally, if those words are not necessary, they should not be added to the beginning of the title in the first place.

==Filing your book's chapters and pages==
The rest of the pages of your book should not have any of the above bits of code added to them.  They need to be filed, either directly or indirectly, in the category with the same name as your book's title.  Directly means that they are filed specifically in that category, while indirectly means they are filed in another category that is itself filed in your book's category.  Placing all your pages into a book category allows for an alphabetical index of pages to complement your book's table of contents, without having to generate such an index manually.  When you create a new page in your book and add it to your book's category, it automatically appears in this index.

As you learned in [[../How To Structure A Wikibook/]], your pages can be structured using a flat method or one using chapters. How you file the pages within your book's category also depends on personal preference and the conventions used by your book.

===Flat filing===
The simplest method of filing your book's pages is to put them all in the category of your book's name directly. If your book's name is {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Foo Bar&lt;/tt&gt;}} the category would be {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Category:Foo Bar&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  This ''could'' be done with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Foo Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  This is not the ideal option, however.

The pages should be sorted within the category to make it easier to locate them.  If you do not specify the method of this sorting, they will all show up under the first letter of your book's name.  Continuing the example of {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Foo Bar&lt;/tt&gt;}}, all the pages would show up under &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;.  Rather than manually specifying sorting on a per-page basis, use the {{tlx|BookCat}} template at the bottom of every page to sort the page based on the portion after the title.  {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Foo Bar/Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}} would be sorted based on &lt;tt&gt;Blah&lt;/tt&gt;.  You can also add {{tlx|BookCat}} in a  [[../Advanced_Techniques#Templates|template]] included on all your pages for the same effect.

You will notice that the category added to the bottom of the pages is red. You need to click it and create the category before it will exist. Add a description to the top of it and preferably also add a link to your book's main page as well. Most importantly, file your book's category in the subject category that your book's main page is filed in. The subject pages do not show categories, only pages, so this allows people viewing a subject's corresponding category to see both your book's main page and your book's individual category. 

You can use the very same code you placed on your book's main page &amp;mdash; '''{{tlx|Subjects|Foo}}''' or '''{{tlx|Subjects|Foo|Bar}}''' &amp;mdash; on the bottom of your book's category, where &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; are subject category names.

===Deep filing (advanced)===
If you have structured your book using chapters and a deep structure, you may have hundreds of pages. That many pages in your book's category can become unwieldy. The more advanced option is to file pages within each chapter inside separate categories that are in turn filed in your book's category.  This technique can be understood better by using an example. Take a book with the following pages (not as many as would actually be used for this method):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|My Book
|-
|style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot;|My Book/Foo
|style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot;|My Book/Bar
|-
|My Book/Foo/Page || My Book/Bar/Page
|}

{{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Category:My Book&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}} would still exist and be filed in the same subject category as the book, as with flat filing.  However, additional categories would be created for all the pages under &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;, with those categories filed in {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  Pages in the &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; chapter would be in {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Foo&lt;/tt&gt;}} and pages in the &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; chapter would be in {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Bar&lt;/tt&gt;}}.

The code used for this method is similar to that used in the flat filing method. Add {{tlx|BookCat|2=filing=deep}} to the bottom of the pages or in a template placed on all the pages, which will automatically file the pages into subcategories of the root book category.  The pages will be sorted based on the first letter of the page rather than the chapter and all the pages of the same chapter are inside a unique category.

When creating the categories for each chapter's pages by clicking the red link that appears at the bottom of the page, add the category to the book's category with {{tlx|BookCat}}.  This puts the chapter category into the book's category and sorts it based on the chapter's name, rather than the first letter of the book's name.

You can use this technique if you have many templates in use by your book as well.  If {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}} had several templates, it could use {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}} for even more control.  Templates can be filed by having {{tlx|BookCat}} placed inside the template, which will ignore the &lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt; portion of their name when sorting them inside of a &lt;tt&gt;/Templates&lt;/tt&gt; subcategory. Add the template subcategory to your book's category with {{tlx|BookCat}} on the bottom of the category page.

To conclude the demonstration by example, {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}} would end up looking like the following using deep filing:
:Category:My Book
::My Book
::My Book/Foo
::My Book/Bar
::Category:My Book/Foo
:::My Book/Foo/Page
::Category:My Book/Bar
:::My Book/Bar/Page
::Category:My Book/Images

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Title Case vs Sentence Case==
I understand we need a convention for separating book subjects from book categories, but I'm not sure that using Title Case vs Sentence case is the right way to go about that.  For instance, what happens of a book's title is one word?  Maybe that's a hypothetical situation that would never arise? What about something like [[Geometry]] or [[Algebra]] or [[Economics]]? Hmmm... apparently the situation is not as hypothetical as I had hoped. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:53, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
: Ideally books would use more descriptive titles and narrower scopes and so they would not have one-word titles. For Geometry and Algebra, those books have pages filed in {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Title (book)&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  I've renamed some books where there were conflicts with a subject category I wanted to use. Geometry and Algebra simply have too many pages to do that. In the interest of being concise and avoiding confusing the reader, I had not covered this predicament you bring up in the main text of the page. It may not be a guideline or policy, but I would suggest that all books have at least two words in the title to allow the sentence/title case methodology to distinguish between a book's category and a subject's category. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

== Deep filing FULLBOOKNAME ? ==

This is a small quibble, I know, but wouldn't it be better style for the markup examples in {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;#Deep filing (advanced)&lt;/tt&gt;}} to use {{tl|FULLBOOKNAME}} &amp;mdash; thus, {{nowrap|'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Images]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''}}, and so on?  (This also relates to another change I chickened out of making, addition of a remark that the one-size-fits-all solution for flat filing has the advantage that if the book is ever renamed, or some pages are moved to another book, the category markup in those pages won't have to be changed at all.)  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:55, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
: I changed the text to reflect this for filing pages, such as {{nowrap|'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Chapter]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''}}.   {{nowrap|'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{BOOKNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''}} is needed on the bottom of chapter categories to omit the &lt;tt&gt;Category:&lt;/tt&gt; portion of the title when assigning a parent category. The category code for templates can use {{tlx|BOOKNAME}} only if templates are named using slash notation as subpages of a main template with the book's name. Most images aren't named using slash convention at all and so the category must be specified manually. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:30, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

People nowadays like to be together not in the old-fashioned way of, say, mingling on the piazza of an Italian Renaissance city, but, instead, huddled together in traffic jams, bus queues, on escalators and so on. It's a new kind of togetherness which may seem totally alien, but it's the togetherness of modern technology. 

''J.G. Ballard'' 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


== Introduction ==

Technology HAS become increasingly popular and effective in the classroom,  despite it being a new AND CONTROVERSIAL concept. Many educators support technology in the classroom stating that it makes learning more engaging for students of the digital age, especially the interaction of Web 2.0. Technology makes it possible for students to communicate with other students of different cultures around the world, creating a diverse classroom. However, there are also educators who disagree with the integration of technology and education, claiming that it distracts students fro despite m learning.  Critics RAISE the issue that many schools cannot afford to have a large technology integration or program. REGARDLESS OF these arguments, social networking is extremely popular among students with millions of users interacting every day, from all over the world. This provides an opportunity for educators to use sites built for communicating among friends, into sites where students can communicate with other students about education. 

== What Is Social Networking and How Does It Work In the Classroom? ==

Many people in AMERICA have most likely heard of the term “social networking” or have heard of a site that does social networking, but do not know what exactly social networking is. Social networking is a community where family, friends, and colleagues connect online. People discuss COUNTLESS TOPICS, ranging from how their day WAS to career field discussions. Since social networking sites are online, users are diverse in age, gender, race and culture. HOWEVER, many, if not most, of the PEOPLE who use social networking SITES consist of middle school, high school and college-age students spending as much time social networking as THEY DO watching television. With the majority of users being in an educational setting, it provides an opportunity for teachers to making learning engaging and interactive. 

One of the most important aspects that an educator can teach is that learning can take place inside and outside of a classroom. Learning is a lifelong process, and if students recognize this, they gain a BROADER lesson from their teacher than in a textbook. Social networking makes IT possible for CLASSROOMS TO connect and FOR STUDENTS TO learn outside of the classroom. Teachers are already using emails and websites to keep their students informed with notices, notes, projects, exams and assistance. While EMAIL and classroom websites can be informative for students and their parents, social networking allows students and teachers to use what they have learned in the classroom, apply their knowledge, and display it to their peers, no matter where they are physically located. The versatility of social networking permits educators to use any subject and making it engaging for all students. For example, many teachers would enjoy bringing a real-life scientist in their classroom but cannot because of availability and financial reasons. These teachers could use Facebook for their class to have a live discussion with the scientist. Students are given an engaging experience without the limitations of finance, time and geography.    

== Advantages and Disadvantages of Social Networking ==

Although social networking is still somewhat of a new concept, research has shown that there are many advantages of using it in the classroom. Students who live in rural areas or are unable to attend their school of choice because of geography are now able to receive a high-quality education through social networking and virtual schools. Classroom would also become learning environments with global diversity. Sister schools around the world would be able to communicate with each other in real-time, ALLOWING students to gain a perspective of their world through learning. There are also advantages for educators using social networking. The National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future has developed Teacher Linked In Networked Communities, which is an initiative to have teachers feel part of their community through social networking and become part of a diverse “learning team”. These networks would be a new approach to professional development where educators would discuss feedback, new ideas, and instructional strategies with colleagues. Besides being used for building knowledge, social networking sites have also been used to strengthen the relationship between students and teachers. Alyssa Trzeszkowski-Giese, a high school English teacher from James W. Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia, discovered that Facebook helped put a “face” not only on her students, but on herself as well. 

Social networking has shown many beneficial factors to improve education for children, however there are also many setbacks. One of the first issues schools always address is “Can we afford this?” While Massachusetts school districts actually benefit financially from virtual education, others like Florida schools district cannot. Florida school districts and many other cannot afford to spend their budget on computer and internet access for all students and teachers. Another major issue of social networking is that schools are now connected to students constantly, forcing them to TAKE disciplinary action when students do negative public actions, such as underage drinking, and cyberbullying, which is the verbal attacking people online. The internet allows people to remain anonymous to some extent, resulting in people saying things they would most likely not say in person. The Internet provides open communication between students and educators, but it also forces teachers and administration to set THEIR boundaries. Just as teachers have to set limits in the classroom, they must also do the same online by putting a limited amount of personal information on their user pages. Teachers also have to consider what age group they may want to interact with, for example, A fifth grade TEACHER may be hesitant to have students who are in third or seventh grade interact with her students online. 

== Unanswered Questions ==

Educators, school administrations, students, communities, and researchers have raised and determined many questions about social networking and how it is used in the classroom. However, there are still many questions that still need to be answered:

''Current and pre-service educators are learning how to integrate technology into the lessons. With social networking becoming more prominent, what other aspects should they learn?

Are the schools right to resist technology in the classroom, or are students correct that they can benefit from the integration?

Policies are being developed to prevent cyberbullying, but can cyberbullying really be stopped by students?

Financially speaking, is it better for students to attend school online, or in an actual building?

With social networking and technology eliminating the problem of geography and physical location of meeting people, is this the end the traditional brick-and-mortar school?''

Comment: 
The second question seems a bit opinion based, you might considering revising the question.

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 2 - Ratings'''&lt;/center&gt;==

'''LIST''' and '''EXPLAIN''' your rating for each of the four criteria. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance:  
:I rated this article 3 for importance because... it does contain relevant information, but it does not represent a thorough understanding of the topic.

&lt;li&gt;Interest: 
:I rated this article 3 on interest because... The sidebar contains relevant information, only a few novel ideas, and some of the points were not adequately explained. 
 
&lt;li&gt;Credibility: 
:I rated this article 3 for credibility because... Although there are more than sufficient sources, all but one were from the same popular magazine. Also there were not scholarly sources. This leads to bias, and does not represent both sides of the topic adequately enough. There is no parenthetical citation used throughout the article. 


&lt;li&gt;Writing skill:  
:I rated this article 2 on writing because... Many sentences were awkward, and needed more sentence structure variation. (Repeated however, also, and despite - vary your word choice.) There seemed to be lacking explanations throughout the article, and it did not really grab the readers attention. 
&lt;/ul&gt;


'''HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE RUBRIC''' that apply to the article.
 
To do this: Highlight sections with the cursor and use the BOLD icon above '''OR''' type &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (3 apostrophes) before and after the text you want to make bold

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''important''' was the information presented on this topic to you as a teacher education student?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers key ideas crucial  for future teachers to know
&lt;li&gt;Based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Highly relevant to current educational practice (*this description may be less applicable for some topics such as history of education) 
&lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent overview of the topic including relevant research, educational practice, laws and litigation. Includes in-depth discussion of at least a few selected key issues.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes ideas relevant to future teachers
&lt;li&gt;Mostly based on researched information.
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to today’s schools
&lt;li&gt;Provides a '''good general overview with relevant information and discussion of a few key ideas'''
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A couple useful points; some irrelevant  information'''  
&lt;li&gt;
About half of the information is the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;
Some out-dated information; may not reflect current practice
&lt;li&gt;
Good information is included but the paper yields a partial /'''incomplete understanding of the topic or key issues
'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; One useful point
&lt;li&gt;A few facts but mostly the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is irrelevant in today’s schools.
&lt;li&gt;Focused on unimportant subtopics OR overly general with few specifics. Important information is missing.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information is not relevant to future teachers.
&lt;li&gt;Information is entirely the author’s opinion.
&lt;li&gt;The information is obsolete.
&lt;li&gt;Only irrelevant details or common knowledge. Lacks any substantive information.  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''interesting''' was the article to read?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that was motivating to read/view
&lt;li&gt;Visuals (headings, colors, fonts, pictures, etc.) enhance the article by making it easier or more inviting to read
&lt;li&gt;Multiple perspectives are considered and discussed 
&lt;li&gt;Mostly new information/ideas 
&lt;li&gt;Insightful interpretation &amp; analysis are evident throughout the article; a clearly stated conclusion synthesizes all of the material presented.
&lt;li&gt;Points are clearly made and elaborated on with compelling examples.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes new information that enhances understanding of the topic
&lt;li&gt;Visuals add to the article
&lt;li&gt;At least two perspectives were presented
&lt;li&gt;About half of the information/ideas are new
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation and analysis is provided for 3-4 points in the article; a reasonable conclusion based on this information is stated
&lt;li&gt;Some good points are made and explained.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Sidebar includes new information related to the topic.'''
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are included but have minimal effect
&lt;li&gt;'''One interesting or new perspective is presented'''
&lt;li&gt;'''A couple (2-3) new ideas''' or pieces of information
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation/ analysis is included for a few (1-2) individual sections, but there is n'''ot a conclusion that synthesizes the information presented.''' 
&lt;li&gt;'''Points are made but may not always be adequately supported or explained.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar repeats what is already in the article
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are somewhat distracting or not included 
&lt;li&gt;Only the “typical” view or one biased perspective is presented.
&lt;li&gt;One new idea or bit of information
&lt;li&gt;Information presented with minimal analysis or interpretation; no conclusion or the conclusion is not based on the information presented
&lt;li&gt;At least one clear point is made and supported.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No side bar included.
&lt;li&gt;Visuals are offensive and completely detract from the content 
&lt;li&gt;No perspective is acknowledged.
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new.
&lt;li&gt;No analysis or interpretation included
&lt;li&gt;No clear points are made or points appear pasted from other sources without any explanation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How '''credible''' do you think the information is?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are properly cited and included in a reference list in APA format.
&lt;li&gt;Information from diverse sources representing multiple perspectives is included. Several reputable and current sources are cited. The author acknowledges potential bias in sources where appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Author clearly identifies his own ideas, biases and opinions 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Required sources are included; a couple of formatting errors 
&lt;li&gt;Information from a variety of sources is included. Most sources are reasonably reputable; bias is acknowledged in others.
&lt;li&gt;It is clear when the author is presenting his own opinion; he doesn’t try to pass if off as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Required sources are included&quot;'; APA format is not used or has many errors.
&lt;li&gt;A variety of sources is listed but the information primarily reflects a single viewpoint. Sources are reasonable.
&lt;li&gt;The author occasionally (1-2 times) states his own opinion as fact.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 4 sources are cited/listed in the references or only 1 scholarly source was used 
&lt;li&gt;'''Sources lack diversity''' OR information from divergent sources is only superficially mentioned. Some sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;Author routinely (3-4 times) states her opinion as fact, ignores own biases.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Missing two or more sources OR sources used but not cited or listed.
&lt;li&gt;All sources and information reflect a single viewpoint. Most sources are untrustworthy or biased and not acknowledged as such.
&lt;li&gt;The entire article is biased and opinion-based without acknowledgment of this perspective.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;How well do you think this article was '''written'''?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, assess key points, and are written according to guidelines (see R4)
&lt;li&gt;Specific, appropriate and observable learning targets are stated; the content is clearly organized to help the reader achieve these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures and maintains attention throughout
&lt;li&gt;All or almost all of the cited information is introduced, elaborated on and explained
&lt;li&gt;Writing is organized, easy to read, and contains few to no mechanical errors. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge)  align with the learning targets, and assess key points.   
&lt;li&gt;Specific and reasonable learning targets are stated; the content aligns with these goals 
&lt;li&gt;Captures attention initially and periodically throughout 
&lt;li&gt;Most of the cited information is discussed or explained.
&lt;li&gt;The article flowed pretty well and there were just a few mechanical errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Multiple-choice questions (2 application &amp; 2 knowledge) assess key points'''
&lt;li&gt;Reasonable learning targets are stated; the content relates to these goals
&lt;li&gt;Parts of the article capture attention
&lt;li&gt;About half of the cited information is discussed
&lt;li&gt;A few areas were hard to follow, confusing or oddly organized. There were a few distracting errors.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 multiple-choice questions are included.
&lt;li&gt;Learning targets generally related to the content are stated
&lt;li&gt;A'''t least one part of the article is interesting'''
&lt;li&gt;Information is “pasted” together with minimal explanation.
&lt;li&gt;'''Organization was difficult to follow, sentences were awkward and/or there were several distracting errors.'''
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions are missing or not multiple-choice.
&lt;li&gt;Learning target is missing or unrelated to content or is/are not actual learning targets
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in the article grabs the reader’s attention
&lt;li&gt;Article is entirely “pasted” together from other sources.
&lt;li&gt;Poor organization, '''sentence structure''' and/or grammatical errors made it very difficult to understand the content.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;'''Part 3 - &quot;2+2&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

List TWO compliments and TWO suggestions about the article &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt;
*Hints: 
**Focus on the work, not the person
**&lt;u&gt;Describe&lt;/u&gt; &quot;There is...&quot;, &quot;I see..&quot; rather than &lt;u&gt;judge&lt;/u&gt; &quot;You didn't...&quot;

Compliments
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;. The article has more than the minimum number of sources. 
&lt;li&gt;. Good explanation of Social Networking.

&lt;/ol&gt;
Suggestions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.In The News
Special Feature Article: In the News

This special feature article will present current events related to the chapter topic. It will provide brief summaries of recent reports in the news media that discuss research, laws, litigation (court cases), classroom practice, films, book releases, events, etc. related to the chapter topic.  The article may also link to articles in newspapers, magazines, Internet sites, etc. where the reports can be found.

Article format:

Introduction: 1 paragraph introduction to the chapter topic and a general report of the media's focus on associated issues.

Several 1-2 paragraph summaries of (and links to) reports in the media. Any key terms mentioned in the summaries should be explained. For example, if a report discusses the opening of a new charter school, the summary should describe what a charter school is.

Conclusion: 1-2 paragraph synthesis of the current events related to the topic. What is currently happening in VA, the US, the world on this topic? What should current and future teachers be looking for in the months ahead. 

Remember that the &quot;In the News&quot; article must also include all the features required in Wikibook articles generally: title, author, learning target(s), sidebar, 5 sources, 4 multiple-choice questions, and include about 1000-words of original text.  


Be sure to reread the description of the assignment. There are supposed to be summaries of recent news articles given in this article. 
&lt;li&gt;.
 
&lt;/ol&gt; Be sure to vary your sources not only to bolster the credibility of the article but also to avoid bias. News links would be a good way to do this. You should make sure to cite your references in your article otherwise the reader will not know whether information represents your opinion or actual fact that has been documented. 

You can make compliments and suggestions that relate to specific areas of the paper or to the paper in general. I suggest a mixture of both. Focus on what's most important. Of course, you can also include more than two suggestions and more than two compliments. The goal is to help the author improve his/her article.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

== Comments (1 + 1) ==

The peer reviewer provided good feedback on the grammar and mechanics of the paper, which the author usually has trouble in. 

The peer reviewer could have been more speficic on the content of the article, instead of giving the directions of the assignment. I do not see specific parts that I did not follow.</text>

* 7 tbsp coarsely ground coriander seed (usually in the us it's sold as just plain coriander)
* 3 tbsp garlic powder
* 1/4 cup smoked paprika
* 3 tbsp cayenne pepper

== Ingredients ==
* 4 filet mignons, 1 1/2 in. (4cm) thick
* 2 tbsp coarsely ground black pepper
* Salt
* 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 1 cup (about 200ml)cognac

== Procedure ==
#Sprinkle filet mignons with kosher salt on both sides. Don't try this with table salt.
#Coat filet mignons with mustard on both sides and dredge into black pepper, pressing lightly to help adhesion.
#Grill steaks over high heat for 1 minute per side, then place on a new medium burner until interior temp. reaches 140°f (60°c). Remove and keep warm.
#Place cognac into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat until reduced by 1/3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] page, I will be working on a guide to the [[wikipedia:The Pendragon Adventure|Pendragon series]] by D.J. MacHale. Much of the text will be imported from HallaWiki, a wiki about the series on which I did a lot of writing. Here's a basic layout for perhaps the first half:

*Title page
*Introduction/links
*Section 1: The Books
**The Merchant of Death
**The Lost City of Faar
**The Never War
**The Reality Bug
**Black Water
**The Rivers of Zadaa

**The Soldiers of Halla
*Section 2: The Worlds
**Denduron
**Cloral
**Veelox
**Eelong
**Zadaa
**Quillan
**Earth


Feel free to expand on this layout, or even start the book. I'll be in Costa Rica in a few days, so not much will get done until perhaps August.</text>

|description =White clover was introduced to North America by the Europeans because it is great as pasture crop.  Most white clover has three leaves per stem, but sometimes it is possible to find one with four.  It's not as hard as it sounds either, but it does take some patience.  If you come across a patch of white clover, lie down in the grass and start looking.  You should be able to find a four-leaf specimen in five or ten minutes.  Some people believe that a four-leaf clover brings good luck.  Whether it does or not, they are certainly interesting, and make a great conversation starter.
|facts = Clover flowers can be collected, dried, and ground into a type of flour that is rich in protein.  It takes about a gallon of fresh flowers to make a cup of flour.  Mix it 50-50 with wheat flower and make pancakes.

|description = White sweet clover is another plant that was brought to North America from Europe to be grown as a pasture crop.  Its sweet smell becomes even stronger when the plant is dried.    This plant produces a very large number of seeds which can then take over in many types of habitats.  When it does this, it crowds out native species of plants, so scientists call it an ''invasive alien''.  ''Invasive'' because it takes over where ever it grows.  ''Alien'' because it is not native to North America. 
|facts = White Sweet Clover is the preferred flower for beekeepers as the honey that bees make from its nectar is particularly good.

Most species are found in places with a climate similar to that of New England.  The petals of the flower have deep notches in them, and sometimes these notches go all the way down the length of the petal.

|description =This daisy has fine, white, thread-like rays shooting out of the yellow disk in the center. If you look closely at the yellow disk, you will see that the disk itself is made of more tiny little flowers.  Any flower that does this is a member of the ''Aster'' family.  The whole flower is about a half inch across, but the plant can grow over four feet tall.  Are you taller than a Daisy Fleabane?
|facts = People used to think that sprinkling the dried flowers of the Daisy Fleabane in a house would get rid of fleas.  It doesn't really, but that's how it got its name.  The word ''bane'' means ''the thing that gets rid of'' or ''banishes.''  Most plants whose name ends with ''bane'' are poisonous, but not this one.

|caption3=Oxeye Daisies are often planted along highways.
|description =The Oxeye Daisy is also sometimes called Moon Daisy or Dog Daisy.  This is one of many plants called a daisy, but when people think about daisies, this is usually what they have in mind.  The flower of the Oxeye Daisy is about two inches across.  Compare that to the [[../Erigeron annuus|Daisy Fleabane]] (which is only a half inch across).  The Oxeye Daisy also has wider ray petals than the Fleabane, but if you look closely, you will see that the center disk is also a bunch of tiny yellow flowers.  These tiny yellow flowers will turn into seeds.
|facts = Sometimes people play a game with the daisy to decide if someone else loves them or not.  As they pull off a petal, they say &quot;He loves me.&quot;  Then they pull off another and say &quot;He loves me not.&quot;  They continue doing this until they pull off the last petal.  You'll get a better answer if you just ''ask'' the person if they love you instead of tearing apart a flower!

|description =Virginia Pepperweed is not a stunningly pretty plant.  The flowers are tiny and grow at the tip of the stem.  After a while, the flowers mature and turn into seeds, but the stem grows some more, and new flowers appear at the tip.  The seeds are round with a stripe running down the center from the notched tip to the stem.  This is kind of a weedy plant, growing near sidewalks (sometimes between the cracks), next to fire hydrants, stop signs, and railroad tracks.  Although the plant isn't very pretty to look at, it does have a secret, and its name gives a little hint about this secret.  If you strip off a handful of the seeds, pop them into your mouth, and chew them up, you will see why they call it a Pepperweed! 
|facts = Some people boil the seeds for ten minutes in a stew to add more flavor.  Others just sprinkle the raw seeds and leaves on their salad.  They are a great source of vitamin C and vitamin A.

|description =This little plant has small tube-shaped flowers that are white on the outside, but cream-colored on the inside.  The flower looks a little bit like a snake's head!  It has two types of leaves.  The lower ones are straight, but the upper ones have two wings near the stem pointing backwards.  This plant never gets more than a foot high.  It gets part of its energy from the sun, and part of its energy from other plants.
|facts = Although this plant is common in New England, it is endangered or threatened in other parts of the United States.

|description =Pokeweed is a fast-growing plant that produces a cluster of dark-purple berries.  The flowers are white with green in the center.  The ''young'' leaves and shoots of this plant are edible and commonly eaten, but if they are picked when they are too old, they are dangerously poisonous.  The seeds are ''always'' poisonous, so the berries should never be eaten.

The stems are green or red, or sometimes green fading to red.  It grows to over ten feet tall in dense clumps.  
|facts = Though the berries are highly poisonous to humans, songbirds such as Northern Cardinal, Brown Thrasher, and Northern Mockingbird ''love'' them.

|description =This is a weedy little plant that doesn't grow more than a couple of feet tall.  The flower always looks as if most of the petals have been plucked out around the top, but that's just the way the flower always looks.  The leaves sprout from around the center of the plant at ground level, while the flowers are found at the end of the long stems.
|facts = This is another plant that is not native to North America, though it has been growing here for a long time.  By the time of the American Revolution, the Cherokee Indians had been using English Plantain in medicines for over a hundred years.

|common name =Common Dandelion
|binomial =Taraxacum officinale
|image1 =TARAXACUMOFFICINALE4.jpg
|caption1 =Flower

|description =The Common Dandelion is one of the most easily recognizable flowers in the United States.  But be careful!  There are a lot of other flowers that ''look'' like the Common Dandelion, but ''aren't''.  To be sure, check the stem and make sure it's both round and hollow.  There should be only one flower on each stem.  When you break the stem, a milky sap should ooze out.  Then check the leaves.  They should not be hairy, but they should have jagged edges shaped like a lion's teeth. In fact, that's what the word ''dandelion'' means - tooth of the lion.  

It is fun to pick a ripe seed head and blow all the seeds off the stem.  You can also tie the stems of the flowers together to form a chain.  
|facts = You can eat Dandelions!  Many people put the young leaves in their salads (old leaves are bitter), and some people even dry the roots and use them as a coffee substitute.  Look, Ma! No caffeine!

|description = Yellow Hawkweed is a tall weed (about three feet) whose flower looks a lot like a dandelion.  But unlike the dandelion, it will produce several flowers in a cluster at the top of the stem.  The leaves are hairy and stay near the ground grouped around the stem (which is also hairy).
|facts = How did Yellow Hawkweed get its name?  They ''yellow'' part is easy (look at the flower!).  The ''weed'' part is easy too.  But what about the ''hawk'' part?  Long ago people used Yellow Hawkweed to treat poor eyesight.  They thought that hawks ate this plant, and that was why they have such great vision.  Though there is a connection between our health and our diet, eating Yellow Hawkweed will not make you see better.

Even more tangy than using buttermilk.

== Ingredients ==

* 2 each thighs, legs, and boneless breasts
* 1 tbsp smoked [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 tsp granulated [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* Freshly squeezed [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|Cornmeal]] as needed for dredging
* 16 ounces vegetable [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]

== Procedure ==
# Combine seasonings.
# Moisten chicken with lemon juice and coat with seasoning mixture.
# Dredge chicken in cornmeal and let rest 2-3 minutes only.
# Melt shortening in a large cast iron skillet; heat to 350°. WATCH CAREFULLY!
# Place legs and breasts around the edges, then place thighs in the center. (more on that later)
# Fry for 12 minutes, then turn and fry another 12 minutes.
# Drain on a cooling or oven rack. Please don't use paper towels, they will make your chicken greasy.
# Sprinkle with black pepper; serve.

== Notes ==

The reason for putting the chicken in different spots is because there is usually a hotspot in the center of the pan.

Also, the chicken will stay rocket-hot for a good 20 minutes, so do not put the chicken into an oven. Especially a GAS oven. It'll just make it soggy.

Maple syrup and pork just sort of seem to be made for each other.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 slab pork spareribs
* 1 tbsp salt
* 3 tbsp dark brown sugar
* 2 tbsp smoked paprika
* 2 tbsp cayenne pepper
* 1 cup maple syrup
* 1 cup white wine
* 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 3 tbsp cider vinegar
* Hickory wood chunks

== Procedure ==
#Combine seasonings and rub on pork ribs.
#Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
#Place hickory chunks into a 350° smoker ''or'' a charcoal grill set for indirect heat at 350°.
#Combine liquid ingredients and bring to a boil over high heat until reduced by half.
#Place ribs in smoker/grill and cook, basting often with maple syrup mixture, for 3-4 hours
#Brush ribs with remaining mixture and place on a medium high grill until well browned.
#Rest 15 minutes; serve.</text>

== Black Hole FAQ ==
Here are some frequently asked questions on [[black hole]]s, the strangest objects in the sky.

----

1. Q. What is a black hole?

A. A black hole is a region is space with so much gravitational  attraction that nothing, not even light can escape.

----

2. Q. Will black holes suck up everything in the [[universe]]?

A. No, black holes have an area around them called an [[event horizon]]. Once you go pass this horizon you'll get sucked up, but as long as you are out of the event horizon you are safe.

----

3. Q. How come we can't see a black hole?

A. No light emits out of a black hole and if there is any light emitting out of the black hole it gets sucked right back into the black hole so it never reaches our eyes.

----

4. Q. What would happen if I got sucked into a black hole?

A. You will be pulled long and thin due to the gravitational tidal forces from the black hole. Then you'll be squeezed into an extremely small space called a [[singularity]].

----

5. Q. What is a black hole's effect on time?

A. General relativity (A theory proposed by [[Albert Einstein]], that states how matter creates gravitational force by distorting the very fabric of [[spacetime]] and how matter reacts to the shape of spacetime.) predicts that when an object approaches close enough to a black hole, it's infall rate will slow down as seen from far away. Also, any signal from the object show that clocks are running more slowly than of ours. This difference is called [[time dilation]].

----

6. Q. Can a black hole transport a Human being to one place to another?

A. Science fiction supports such objects called [[wormhole]]s that transport you to one spot in spacetime to another spot. Transporting beings through a black hole is pretty much impossible. First, you wouldn't survive the fall into a black hole, so there is no use in transporting people by this means. Second, cosmic censorship states that no object that enters a body with a singularity (such as a black hole) can escape.

Different types of black holes have differently shaped singularities: in a stationary black hole it is a point, in a rotating black hole it is a ring. If you passed through the center of the ring without touching the ring singularity itself, the mathematics predicts you will come out ''somewhere else'' and you '''''cannot return'''''. This is the basis of the wormhole idea. However the mathematics gives no indication of where (or when) that ''somewhere else'' is, and no way to control or select it yourself.

----

7. Q. Do black holes last forever?

A. No, black holes evaporate by a process called [[virtual particle]] production (see [[Hawking Radiation]]). In this process a particle pairs up with it's [[antiparticle]] at the event horizon. Normally particles and antiparticles destroy each other on contact, but in this case the black hole rips the particle and antiparticle apart before they can annihilate each other. One of these particles fly off into space and the other falls into the black hole. Since the one of the black holes particles have just been lost, the black hole has lost mass, and since this is happening all the time black holes are always losing mass.

----

8. Q. Will the sun turn into a Black Hole?

A. No, the sun is not massive enough. If it was 10 times as massive as it is now it would.

----

9. Q. If the sun did turn into a Black Hole what would it's effect on our [[Earth]] be?

A. Even though the sun won't turn into a black hole, if it did without gaining or losing any mass, the only effect on our Earth would be EXTREME freezing temperatures. The earth wouldn't get suck up because it has the same amount of mass and the same amount of gravitational attraction.

----

10. Q. How many types of black holes are there?

A. Three, a stationary black hole ([[Schwarzschild Black Hole]]), a rotating black hole ([[Kerr Black Hole]]), and an electrically charged black hole ([[Reissner-Nordström Black Hole]]). However in the real world only rotating black holes are likely to exist (nothing in the universe is truly stationary and any [[electrical charge]] on a black hole would tend to be neutralized rapidly).

----

11. Q. What is a Schwarzchild Radius?

A. It is the distance to the center (singulatity) of a stationary black hole to it's outer region (Event horizion).

----

12. Q. Do galaxies contain supermassive black holes in their centers?

A. Recent calculations predict that there are supermassive black holes in the center of most (if not all) galaxies, including the Milky Way.</text>

The equation used to graph a vertical transverse wave, which rests apon a line segment medium, is as follows:

y=mx+b; ∑_(t &gt;0)^∞▒〖t f(tsub1,tsub2,…)〗

An extension of ‘y = mx+b’, this is used to draw lines with crests and troughs, such as that of a transverse wave. T is the number of crests and troughs, and t-sub 1, t-sub 2, etc, are the lengths of each continual trough. For example, a line with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2 that has 3 troughs and 4 crests, where the first crest–trough accompanies 1 unit, the second pair accompanies half a unit, and the third pair accompanies half a unit, and the last pair accompanies a full unit, is written like this:

Y = 3x + 2; 4 f[1, .5, .5, 1] 

*The values that of said lengths of the trough–crest pairs MUST be equal to the slope. The slope, while obviously cannot pertain to a curved line, is used to represent the slope of the line that all the crests and troughs pass through. Let's look at the line we drew based on our numbers:
 
(Ignoring the green line) We can see that there are indeed four sets of crests and troughs,  and that each line does encompass the length that we set, and that the added total length equals the slope of the Initial Line, or line that the crests and/or troughs branch off of. Which, in this case, is the red line. The purple line is the actually transverse wave. The green line is something I did in my spare time the night before this on this same MS Paint file.

Width of the Crest and/or Trough
If the width of the crest or trough is to pass 1 unit, it is to be written as a side note in our equation, for example, using the same line we drew, if say the first crest or trough (the first being the one in the lowest value quadrant ) was to extend to 2 units in width, it would be written like this:

y=mx+b; ∑_(t &gt;0)^∞▒〖t f(tsub1,tsub2,…)〗  [tsub1WID=2]
In the event that multiple crests or troughs have width that goes beyond 1, it shall be written as such:
y=mx+b; ∑_(t &gt;0)^∞▒〖t f(tsub1,tsub2,…) 〗  [tsub1WID=2]
							**         [tsub2WID = 1.5]
								[tsub3WID = 1.2]
								….
In the case that the width of a crest or trough Is BELOW that of 1 unit, then it shall be written on the same format, but where we put “2” before, we would instead put a value below one, such as **.6 or 5/6.
								 
*This is if the total line segment length is equal to one “Slope Unit,” which is the entire slope, or m/1. For example, a line segment with a slope of 2, that is only one slope unit in length, would go up ONLY from one unit to the right and two units  up, which should look like this:
 
With a length of say, three slope units, a line with the same slope would look like this:
 
In the event that the line segment is equal to more than 1 slope unit, then the added lengths of the crests and troughs must be equal to the slope times the number of slope units.
** These values are merely an example. The actual values depend on the wave.

==Final observation==
Here is an example of a more complex, and real transverse wave.

Y = 10x – 10; 4 f(1.5, .5, 2.5, 5.5)

The first and second crest–trough may look kind of weird, but the ones smaller in length usually do.

No need for wing sauce. These are already plenty hot.

== Ingredients ==
* 12 whole chicken wings, tips removed and cut in half
* 1 1/2 tbsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tbsp lemon pepper
* 1/2 tbsp black pepper
* 1/2 tbsp salt
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 tbsp finely grated lemon zest
* Cornmeal as needed for dredging
* Oil for deep frying

== Procedure ==
#Combine seasoning except lemon zest and then sprinkle over chicken. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
#Combine egg and lemon zest in a pie plate and place cornmeal in another pie plate.
#Heat oil to 350°.
#Dip chicken into egg mixture and then dredge in cornmeal.
#Fry in batches for 11-12 minutes. Drain on a rack. Please don't use paper towels unless you want greasy chicken.
#Sprinkle with red pepper flake for hotter wings, but this is completely optional. Serve.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Complete Rewrite ==

I have completely rewritten the text on this page, and added more diagrams, to try to give a clearer explanation of how coordinates work. [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 06:47, 13 December 2010 (UTC)

The sentence where it says positive rotation
&quot;If you point your thumb into the direction of the positive rotation axis and close your fingers, they show the direction of the rotation, i.e. the angles get larger in that direction.&quot;
 
How can i understand what positive rotation is to point my thumb at it?.This sentence needs further explanation if a noob is to continue.
regards

:I would say that figure 3 makes it fairly clear. Presumably, in the tool a rotation operation can be implemented by defining a vector for the rotation axis and a separate value for the angle of the rotation. If the value of the angle is positive, that means a &quot;positive&quot; rotation following the fingers of the right hand. To produce a &quot;negative&quot; rotation about the same axis, you leave the axis vector the same and set the &quot;angle&quot; to a negative value. Regards, [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:24, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

:I agree with Recent Runes. Assuming you're rotating something about an axis parallel to one of the axes, figures 1 and 3 make this concept quite easy to understand.  Besides, this is not massively important (&quot;needs further explanation if a noob is to continue&quot;) -- if you're unsure about the direction of rotation, use Blender to try it, you can always Ctrl-Z to undo the rotation if it went the wrong way for you.  The text is only there to explain that, by the right-hand rule, positive angles are counterclockwise when viewed from &quot;above&quot; the axis of rotation.
[[User:Zoinks|Zoinks]] ([[User talk:Zoinks|talk]]) 16:12, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

I would also suggest erasing the [a b c I B F] labels in the image 2 (or not adding them in a replacement) as these aren't mentioned in the page text.
[[User:Zoinks|Zoinks]] ([[User talk:Zoinks|talk]]) 15:58, 26 October 2010 (UTC)


The way I see them, the graphical examples appear counter-clockwise. I am puzzled, but will figure it out. ETA: OK I think I understand. I am supposed to orient my view towards the direction of the thumb.

== Axes / Origin ==

Maybe also define the origin as the point at which the X,Y,Z axes cross each other -- this (important) fact isn't mentioned; the axes seem to be defined in terms of their (relative) directions rather than as (imaginary) lines in 3D space.
This ''is'' covered in Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Coordinate_Spaces_in_Blender, but perhaps worth mentioning here too.
[[User:Zoinks|Zoinks]] ([[User talk:Zoinks|talk]]) 16:45, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

The description is also confusing as written. The clause &quot;they are conventionally labelled X (the vertical or height), Y (the horizontal or length) and Z (the breadth), in that order&quot; completely contradicts the rest of the paragraph's use of x, y, and z. Also, using the word &quot;breadth&quot; while W is used for width is also confusing. I have submitted a correction for this.

==the diagram is not show what whirt it should show==

in the diagrm it have just three images and also those just show the Y axe and the Z axe.</text>

I will put the text found on the cover page here in the discussion section and delete it on the main page.

File:Biological cefundamental building blocks of life. Cells vary to form individual &quot;single-cell&quot; organisms (bacteria) to &quot;multi-cellular&quot; structures (tissue,ll.svg 
Schematic of typical animal cell, showing subcellular components. Organelles: (1) nucleolus (2) nucleus (3) ribosome (4) vesicle (5) rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6) Golgi apparatus (7) Cytoskeleton (8) smooth ER (9) mitochondria (10) vacuole (11) cytoplasm (12) lysosome (13) centrioles
Cells are structural units that make up plants and animals; also, there are many single celled organisms. What all living cells have in common is that they are small 'sacks' composed mostly of water. The 'sacks' are made from a phospholipid bilayer membrane. This membrane is semi-permeable (allowing some things to pass in or out of the cell while blocking others). There exist other methods of transport across this membrane that we will get into later.
So what is in a cell? Cells are 90% fluid (called cytoplasm) which consists of free amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and numerous other molecules. The cell environment (i.e., the contents of the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as well as the way the DNA is packed) affect gene expression/regulation, and thus are VERY important aspects of inheritance. Below are approximations of other components (each component will be discussed in more detail later):

[edit] Elements
•	59% Hydrogen (H) 
•	24% Oxygen (O) 
•	11% Carbon (C) 
•	4% Nitrogen (N) 
•	2% Others - Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), etc. 
[edit] Molecules
•	50% protein 
•	15% nucleic acid 
•	15% carbohydrates 
•	10% lipids 
•	10% Other 
[edit] Components of cytoplasm
•	Cytosol - contains mainly water and numerous molecules floating in it- all except the organelles. 
•	Organelles (which also have membranes) in 'higher' eukaryote organisms: 
o	Nucleus (in eukaryotes) - where genetic material (DNA) is located, RNA is transcribed. 
o	Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) - Important for protein synthesis. It is a transport network for molecules destined for specific modifications and locations. There are two types: 
	Rough ER - Has ribosomes, and tends to be more in 'sheets'. 
	Smooth ER - Does not have ribosomes and tends to be more of a tubular network. 
o	Ribosomes - half are on the Endoplasmic Reticulum, the other half are 'free' in the cytosol, this is where the RNA goes for translation into proteins. 
o	Golgi Apparatus - important for glycosylation, secretion. The Golgi Apparatus is the &quot;UPS&quot; of the cell. Here, proteins and other molecules are prepared for shipping outside of the cell. 
o	Lysosomes - Digestive sacks found only in animal cells; the main point of digestion. 
o	Peroxisomes - Use oxygen to carry out catabolic reactions, in both plant and animals. In this organelle, an enzyme called catalase is used to break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas. 
o	Microtubules - made from tubulin, and make up centrioles,cilia,etc. 
o	Cytoskeleton - Microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments. 
o	Mitochondria - convert foods into usable energy. (ATP production) A mitochondrion does this through aerobic respiration. They have 2 membranes, the inner membranes shapes differ between different types of cells, but they form projections called cristae. The mitochondrion is about the size of a bacteria, and it carries its own genetic material and ribosomes. 
o	Vacuoles - More commonly associated with plants. Plants commonly have large vacuoles. 
•	Organelles found in plant cells and not in animal cells: 
o	Plastids - membrane bound organelles used in storage and food production. These are similar to entire prokaryotic cells - for example, like mitochondria they contain their own DNA and self-replicate. They include: 
	Chloroplasts - convert light/food into usable energy. (ATP production) 
	Leucoplasts - store starch, proteins and lipids. 
	Chromoplasts - contain pigments. (E.g. providing colors to flowers) 
o	Cell Wall - found in prokaryotic and plant cells; provides structural support and protection.

Plasma membrane bilayer
The phospholipid bilayer which the cell membrane is an example of, is composed of various cholesterol, phospholipids, glycolipids, blagoscony and proteins. Below is an example of a simple phospholipid bilayer.
 
The smaller molecules shown between the phospholipids are Cholesterol molecules. They help to provide rigidity or stability to the membrane. The two main components of phospholipids are shown in these figures by blue circles representing the hydrophilic head groups and by long thin lines representing the hydrophobic fatty acid tails.
Both the interior of the cell and the area surrounding the cell is made up of water or similar aqueous solution. Consequently, phospholipids orient themsleves with respect to the water and with each other so that the hydrophilic (&quot;water loving&quot;) head groups are grouped together and face the water, and the hydrophobic (&quot;water fearing&quot;) tails turn away from the water and toward each other. This self-organization of phospholipids results in one of just a few easily recognizable structures. Cell membranes are constructed of a phospholipid bilayer as shown above.
Smaller structures can also form, known as 'micelles' in which there is no inner layer of of phospholipid. Instead, the interior of a micell is wholly hydrophobic, filled with the fatty acid chains of the phospholipids and any other hydrophobic molecule they enclose. Micelles are not so important for the understanding of cellular structure, but are useful for demonstrating the principles of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, and for contrasting with lipid bilayers.
At least 10 different types of lipids are commonly found in cell membranes. Each type of cell or organelle will have a different percentage of each lipid, protein and carbohydrate. The main types of lipids are:
•	Cholesterol 
•	Glycolipids 
•	Phosphatidylcholine 
•	Sphingomyelin 
•	Phosphatidylethnolamine 
•	Phosphatydilinositol 
•	Phosphatidylserine 
•	Phosphatidylglycerol 
•	Diphosphatidylglycerol (Cardiolipin) 
•	Phosphatidic acid 
Nucleus
The nucleus contains genetic material or DNA in the form of chromatin. It is a double membraned structure, with pores on it. These pores act as a &quot;gateway&quot; to help the nucleoplasm to maintain continuity with the cytoplasm.
[edit] Mitochondria
A mitochondrian is the organelle responsible for a cell's metabolism. It synthetizes ATP through a protein called ATP synthase. Mitochondria have a double membrane. An outer membrane and a folded inner membrane. The internal membrane, called the 'cristaeAWDQS' is invaginated (folded or creased), to maximize surface area enabling it to hold more ATP synthases.
[edit] Chloroplasts
 
 
The inside of a chloroplast with the granum circled.
Chloroplasts are found only in photosynthesizing cells; e.g. plant cells. Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis by using several photosystem proteins. Chloroplasts also give a cell its green colour and are widely believed to have evolved from symbiotic prokaryotes that adapted to live inside eukaryotic cells. Physiologically, chloroplasts are flat discs usually 2-10 micrometer in diameter and 1 micrometer thick. The chloroplast has a two membrane envelope termed the Inner &amp; Outer membrane respectively. Between these two layers is the intermembrane space.
[edit] Ribosomes
Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis; they are composed of two subunits that to elongate an aminoacid sequence. And they were dicovered by 'Chris Jennings'.
[edit] Endoplasmic Reticulum
The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) acts as a transport from the nucleus and ribosomes to the Golgi apparatus. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum:
[edit] Smooth ER
Smooth ER act as transport for various things, mainly the RNA from the nucleus to the ribosomes (RNA is a small piece of the DNA code specifically designed to tell the ribosomes what to make). Smooth ER appears smooth in texture, hence the name.
[edit] Rough ER
Rough ER are &quot;rough&quot; because of the ribosomes embedded in them. The rough ER take the protein to the Golgi apparatus to be packaged into vacuoles
[edit] Golgi Complex
The Golgi Complex bonds functional groups to different biomolecules to direct them to their respective destinations. It basically &quot;packages&quot; the stuff into vacuoles. The Golgi Complex looks like pieces of pita bread stacked on top of each other.They are the ones that have their origin from the ER.They basically function as the delivery system of the cell.
[edit] Vacuole
Vacuoles are storage places. They store water, food or cell waste products.
[edit] Central Vacuole
The central vacuole is found only in plant cells. It is filled with water and is pressurised, like a balloon. This forces all the other organelles within the cell out toward the cell wall. This pressure is called turgor pressure and is what gives plants their &quot;crisp&quot; and firm structure.
[edit] Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes perform a variety of metabolic processes and as a by-product, produce hydrogen peroxide. Peroxisomes use peroxase enzyme to break down this hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
[edit] Lysosomes
Lysosomes are vacuoles containing digestive and destructive membranes. In white blood cells, these are used to kill the bacteria or virus, while in tadpole-tail cells they kill the cell by separating the tail from the main body.
They also do much of the cellular digestion involved in apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death.
[edit] A day in the life of a cell
The nucleus has transcribed a piece of its DNA, called RNA, and sent it to the ribosomes embedded in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These ribosomes then translate the RNA into valuable protein, which is then transported to the Golgi Apparatus. The Golgi Apparatus &quot;packages&quot; the protein into a secretory vesicle where it eventually reaches the cell membrane ready for secretion out of the cell and into the external environment.

{{fsharpTitle|Reflection}}

'''Reflection''' allows programmers to inspect types and invoke methods of objects at runtime without knowing their data type at compile time.

At first glance, reflection seems to go against the spirit of ML as it is inherently not type-safe, so typing errors using reflection are not discovered until runtime. However, .NET's typing philosophy is best stated as ''static typing where possible, dynamic typing when needed'', where reflection serves to bring in the most desirable behaviors of dynamic typing into the static typing world. In fact, dynamic typing can be a huge time saver, often promotes the design of more expressive APIs, and allows code to be refactored much further than possible with static typing.

This section is intended as a cursory overview of reflection, not a comprehensive tutorial.

== Inspecting Types ==
There are a variety of ways to inspect the type of an object. The most direct way is calling the &lt;code&gt;.GetType()&lt;/code&gt; method (inherited from &lt;code&gt;System.Object&lt;/code&gt;) on any non-null object:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;hello world&quot;.GetType();;
val it : System.Type =
  System.String
    {Assembly = mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089;
     AssemblyQualifiedName = &quot;System.String, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089&quot;;
     Attributes = AutoLayout, AnsiClass, Class, Public, Sealed, Serializable, BeforeFieldInit;
     BaseType = System.Object;
     ContainsGenericParameters = false;
     DeclaringMethod = ?;
     DeclaringType = null;
     FullName = &quot;System.String&quot;;
     GUID = 296afbff-1b0b-3ff5-9d6c-4e7e599f8b57;
     GenericParameterAttributes = ?;
     GenericParameterPosition = ?;
     ...&lt;/source&gt;

Its also possible to get type information without an actual object using the built-in &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; typeof&lt;System.IO.File&gt;;;
val it : System.Type =
  System.IO.File
    {Assembly = mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089;
     AssemblyQualifiedName = &quot;System.IO.File, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089&quot;;
     Attributes = AutoLayout, AnsiClass, Class, Public, Abstract, Sealed, BeforeFieldInit;
     BaseType = System.Object;
     ContainsGenericParameters = false;
     DeclaringMethod = ?;
     DeclaringType = null;
     FullName = &quot;System.IO.File&quot;;
     ...&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;''object''.GetType&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; return an instance of &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type_members.aspx System.Type]&lt;/code&gt;, which has a variety of useful properties such as:
* '''&lt;code&gt;val Name : string&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns the name of the type.
* '''&lt;code&gt;val GetConstructors : unit -&gt; ConstructorInfo array&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns an array of constructors defined on the type.
* '''&lt;code&gt;val GetMembers : unit -&gt; MemberInfo array&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns an array of members defined on the type.
* '''&lt;code&gt;val InvokeMember : (name : string, invokeAttr : BindingFlags, binder : Binder, target : obj, args : obj) -&gt; obj&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Invokes the specified member, using the specified binding constraints and matching the specified argument list

=== Example: Reading Properties ===

The following program will print out the properties of any object passed into it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type Car(make : string, model : string, year : int) =
    member this.Make = make
    member this.Model = model
    member this.Year = year
    member this.WheelCount = 4
    
type Cat() =
    let mutable age = 3
    let mutable name = System.String.Empty
    
    member this.Purr() = printfn &quot;Purrr&quot;
    member this.Age
        with get() = age
        and set(v) = age &lt;- v
    member this.Name
        with get() = name
        and set(v) = name &lt;- v
        
let printProperties x =
    let t = x.GetType()
    let properties = t.GetProperties()
    printfn &quot;-----------&quot;
    printfn &quot;%s&quot; t.FullName
    properties |&gt; Array.iter (fun prop -&gt;
        if prop.CanRead then
            let value = prop.GetValue(x, null)
            printfn &quot;%s: %O&quot; prop.Name value
        else
            printfn &quot;%s: ?&quot; prop.Name)

let carInstance = new Car(&quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot;, 2009)
let catInstance =
    let temp = new Cat()
    temp.Name &lt;- &quot;Mittens&quot;
    temp
    
printProperties carInstance
printProperties catInstance&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;-----------
Program+Car
WheelCount: 4
Year: 2009
Model: Focus
Make: Ford
-----------
Program+Cat
Name: Mittens
Age: 3&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Example: Setting Private Fields ===
In addition to discovering types, we can dynamically invoke methods and set properties:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let dynamicSet x propName propValue =
    let property = x.GetType().GetProperty(propName)
    property.SetValue(x, propValue, null)&lt;/source&gt;

Reflection is particularly remarkable in that it can read/write private fields, even on objects which appear to be immutable. In particular, we can explore and manipulate the underlying properties of an F# list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; open System.Reflection
let x = [1;2;3;4;5]
let lastNode = x.Tail.Tail.Tail.Tail;;

val x : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
val lastNode : int list = [5]

&gt; lastNode.GetType().GetFields(BindingFlags.NonPublic ||| BindingFlags.Instance) |&gt; Array.map (fun field -&gt; field.Name);;
val it : string array = [|&quot;__Head&quot;; &quot;__Tail&quot;|]
&gt; let tailField = lastNode.GetType().GetField(&quot;__Tail&quot;, BindingFlags.NonPublic ||| BindingFlags.Instance);;

val tailField : FieldInfo =
  Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.FSharpList`1[System.Int32] __Tail

&gt; tailField.SetValue(lastNode, x);; (* circular list *)
val it : unit = ()
&gt; x |&gt; Seq.take 20 |&gt; Seq.to_list;;
val it : int list =
  [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5]&lt;/source&gt;
The example above mutates the list in place and to produce a circularly linked list. In .NET, &quot;immutable&quot; doesn't really mean ''immutable'' and private members are mostly an illusion.

: '''Note:''' The power of reflection has definite security implications, but a full discussion of reflection security is far outside of the scope of this section. Readers are encouraged to visit the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/stfy7tfc(VS.100).aspx Security Considerations for Reflection] article on MSDN for more information.

== Microsoft.FSharp.Reflection Namespace ==
While .NET's built-in reflection API is useful, the F# compiler performs a lot of magic which makes built-in types like unions, tuples, functions, and other built-in types appear strange using vanilla reflection. The [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/fsharp.core/microsoft.fsharp.reflection.html Microsoft.FSharp.Reflection namespace] provides a wrapper for exploring F# types.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System.Reflection
open Microsoft.FSharp.Reflection

let explore x =
    let t = x.GetType()
    if FSharpType.IsTuple(t) then
        let fields =
            FSharpValue.GetTupleFields(x)
            |&gt; Array.map string
            |&gt; fun strings -&gt; System.String.Join(&quot;, &quot;, strings)
        
        printfn &quot;Tuple: (%s)&quot; fields
    elif FSharpType.IsUnion(t) then
        let union, fields =  FSharpValue.GetUnionFields(x, t)
        
        printfn &quot;Union: %s(%A)&quot; union.Name fields
    else
        printfn &quot;Got another type&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Using fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; explore (Some(&quot;Hello world&quot;));;
Union: Some([|&quot;Hello world&quot;|])
val it : unit = ()

&gt; explore (7, &quot;Hello world&quot;);;
Tuple: (7, Hello world)
val it : unit = ()

&gt; explore (Some(&quot;Hello world&quot;));;
Union: Some([|&quot;Hello world&quot;|])
val it : unit = ()

&gt; explore [1;2;3;4];;
Union: Cons([|1; [2; 3; 4]|])
val it : unit = ()

&gt; explore &quot;Hello world&quot;;;
Got another type
&lt;/source&gt;

== Working With Attributes ==
.NET attributes and reflection go hand-in-hand. Attributes allow programmers to decorate classes, methods, members, and other source code with metadata used at runtime. Many .NET classes use attributes to annotate code in a variety of ways; it is only possible to access and interpret attributes through reflection. This section will provide a brief overview of attributes. Readers interested in a more complete overview are encouraged to read MSDN's [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5x6cd29c(VS.100).aspx Extending Metadata With Attributes] series.

Attributes are defined using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;AttributeName&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a notation already seen in a variety of places in previous chapters of this book. The .NET framework includes a number of built-in attributes, including:

* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.obsoleteattribute.aspx System.ObsoleteAttribute] - used to mark source code intended to be removed in future versions.
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.flagsattribute.aspx System.FlagsAttribute] - indicates that an enumeration can be treated as a bit field.
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serializableattribute.aspx System.SerializableAttribute] - indicates that class can be serialized.
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerstepthroughattribute.aspx System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute] - indicates that the debugger should not step into a method unless it contains a break point.

We can create custom attributes by defining a new type which inherits from &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.attribute.aspx System.Attribute]&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type MyAttribute(text : string) =
    inherit System.Attribute()
    
    do printfn &quot;MyAttribute created. Text: %s&quot; text
    
    member this.Text = text

[&lt;MyAttribute(&quot;Hello world&quot;)&gt;]    
type MyClass() =
    member this.SomeProperty = &quot;This is a property&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

We can access attribute using reflection:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x = new MyClass();;

val x : MyClass

&gt; x.GetType().GetCustomAttributes(true);;
MyAttribute created. Text: Hello world
val it : obj [] =
  [|System.SerializableAttribute {TypeId = System.SerializableAttribute;};
    FSI_0028+MyAttribute {Text = &quot;Hello world&quot;;
                          TypeId = FSI_0028+MyAttribute;};
    Microsoft.FSharp.Core.CompilationMappingAttribute
      {SequenceNumber = 0;
       SourceConstructFlags = ObjectType;
       TypeId = Microsoft.FSharp.Core.CompilationMappingAttribute;
       VariantNumber = 0;}|]&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;MyAttribute&lt;/code&gt; class has the side-effect of printing to the console on instantiation, demonstrating that &lt;code&gt;MyAttribute&lt;/code&gt; does not get constructed when instances of &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; are created.

=== Example: Encapsulating Singleton Design Pattern ===

Attributes are often used to decorate classes with any kind of ad-hoc functionality. For example, let's say we wanted to control whether single or multiple instances of classes are created based on an attribute:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type ConstructionAttribute(singleInstance : bool) =
    inherit System.Attribute()
    member this.IsSingleton = singleInstance

let singletons = new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;System.Type,obj&gt;()
let make() : 'a =
    let newInstance() = System.Activator.CreateInstance&lt;'a&gt;()
    let attributes = typeof&lt;'a&gt;.GetCustomAttributes(typeof&lt;ConstructionAttribute&gt;, true)
    let singleInstance =
        if attributes.Length &gt; 0 then
            let contructionAttribute = attributes.[0] :?&gt; ConstructionAttribute
            contructionAttribute.IsSingleton
        else false
    
    if singleInstance then
        match singletons.TryGetValue(typeof&lt;'a&gt;) with
        | true, v -&gt; v :?&gt; 'a
        | _ -&gt;
            let instance = newInstance()
            singletons.Add(typeof&lt;'a&gt;, instance)
            instance
    else newInstance()

[&lt;ConstructionAttribute(true)&gt;]
type SingleOnly() =
    do printfn &quot;SingleOnly contructor&quot;

[&lt;ConstructionAttribute(false)&gt;]
type NewAlways() =
    do printfn &quot;NewAlways constructor&quot;

let x = make&lt;SingleOnly&gt;()
let x' = make&lt;SingleOnly&gt;()
let y = make&lt;NewAlways&gt;()
let y' = make&lt;NewAlways&gt;()

printfn &quot;x = x': %b&quot; (x = x')
printfn &quot;y = y': %b&quot; (y = y')
System.Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

&lt;pre&gt;SingleOnly constructor
NewAlways constructor
NewAlways constructor
x = x': true
y = y': false&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the attribute above, we've completely abstracted away the implementation details of the singleton design pattern, reducing it down to a single attribute. Its worth noting that the program above hard-codes a value of &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; into the attribute constructor; if we wanted to, we could pass a string representing a key from the application's config file and make class construction dependent on the config file.

The aim of this work is to present a rich discussion of the various aspects of modern structural analysis, ranging from elementary continuum mechanics theory to advanced analysis using open-source software.  The text is geared towards practical engineering problems and attempts to cover all essential analysis considerations and techniques present in the daily work of the experienced professional.

The content is divided in two main parts: [[/Part I - Theory/]], and [[/Part II - Application/]].  The idea is that Part I - Theory provides the foundation for the analysis described in Part II - Application.  Ideally, all the reasoning described in Part II - Application should stem from and refer to statements in Part I - Theory.

The work may refer to any high-quality open-source software, such as [http://www.code-aster.org Code Aster] and [http://wxmaxima.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page wxMaxima].  Commercial tools are not incorporated unless related information is of exceptional interest and no open-source alternative exists.

It is important that all users of this resource realize that the material is subordinated to relevant normative documents and that its content might be incorrect; and act accordingly!

== Categorisation ==

Like many Wikibookians, I saw noticed your impressive work on categorisation in my watchlist. I've long looked with dread at the categorisation schemes as these desperately need a lot of work. I'm glad someone has taken the initiative on this important task.

One of my areas of interest is project documentation, mainly the help pages (see: [[Help:Contents]] and a full list at [[User:Swift/Help pages]]) and project resources (e.g. [[Wikibooks:Templates]] and [[Wikibooks:Maintenance]]). As you should now have a great deal of experience with the categorisation aspect of our project, I was hoping you migth be able to lend a hand to explain the cataloguing schemes to others.

I just did a bit of copyediting on [[WB:CCR]] (which should perhaps be moved to something like {{bad link|Help:Cataloguing}}) and brought it up to date. Where did you read up on categorisation, and do you know of a better place to put this information? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:43, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
:I was a bit nervous when I first tried to add some order to the chaos, knowing that I might stir things up a bit on Recent Changes and even worried that someone might get angry.  I'm glad you're all supportive!  Before I got the itch to start taking the broom to things, so to speak, I believe I looked over [[Help:Category]], which is linked from [[Help:Contents]].  It's pretty extensive in covering categories in general, but at the time I was looking for any rhyme or reason for how things were organized.  I already had knowledge of Mediawiki from my own use of it on my website.  I did a search on &quot;categories&quot; to find more information and came across [[Wikibooks:Categories]], which I now see is linked to at the very bottom of [[Help:Category]].  I see it's marked for cleanup and I would probably agree.  

:I leave what the title ought to be up to you, but I think a merge of [[WB:CCR]] and [[Wikibooks:Categories]] would be helpful for explaining guidelines for Wikibooks in particular.  [[Help:Category]] focuses mostly on Mediawiki operation.  [[WB:CCR]] mentions book categories, subject categories, dewey decimal, alphabetical listing, and library of congress.  [[Wikibooks:Categories]] contains good descriptions of subject and book categories with no information on implementation or mention of the others covered by [[WB:CCR]].  [[Wikibooks:Reading_Levels]] could be good for incorporating into a final page as well, since it's something that would need to be considered at the same time as the others.  I'd certainly be game for lending a hand in explaining cataloguing on a nice combined page with all the information a prospective Wikibook creator would need to know in order to file their book properly for others to find it.  After all, I'd hate to spend time trying to spend time getting things sorted out for it to go to waste in a matter of months when others don't follow the same pattern!  Just let me know which target page should be the focus for our efforts on documentation.  

:The following is some additional information that may or may not be in that page but, at the least, defines for you my plan of action.  I'd eventually like to see categories match up in structure to the structure of subjects with [[:Category:Books by subject]] matching [[Subject:Major_Subjects]] from top-down.  But as Whiteknight noted above, the subjects were ad-hoc as well.  My initial focus is getting books I see in the categories filed properly and the categories filed within themselves properly.  Then I can take a higher level look as Whiteknight suggests and analyzing whether the subjects themselves make sense.  I've seen the discussion at [[Subject_talk:Major_Subjects]] on sentence or title case.  Guidelines here seem to point to book titles being title case and so sentence case for categories avoids conflicts.  While subjects can be any name as the category they pull from is in the code, it'd be nice if they match, so that would mean they should be sentence case too.  It's why I made the subject category [[:Category:European history]] to file all the books that were put in [[:Category:European History]] and that serves as the one major example that defines my stance on that, in the absence of technical changes or policy changes that would prevent another occurrence.  I'd also like to note that [[:Category:Fine arts]] shows how I'm filing subject categories within other subject categories using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blah| {{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  In this way someone browsing the categories immediately sees the difference between a book's category and a subject's category (subject categories show up first).  This hasn't been done for all the categories yet, of course, but I feel it will be helpful to prevent people from filing their new books into a category reserved solely for another book and improve navigation when browsing by category. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:09, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Re: Categories ==

Hello Adrignola, I'm sorry that I haven't replied sooner. I want to say first that your efforts to get books organized is quite exemplary, thanks! I wrote a little [http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/2009/04/categorization-continues.html blog post] to showcase some of your work and also to explain why the category system here has become so messy over time.

A problem with categories is that there is no unified plan: A lot of people are just making and organizing categories in an ad hoc way, and the lack of planning really starts to show after a while. [[User:Whiteknight/Wikibooks Categories|The planning work]] that I had done in my user space was an attempt to introduce a roadmap of sorts to future efforts, but obviously that effort never took off. I didn't even get a complete plan written down before I abandoned it myself. If you find anything of value on that page, you are welcome to use it yourself for any purpose.

Following the organization structure of the [[WB:AS|subject pages]] is a reasonable idea, but then again those pages were put together in the same ad hoc way that categories were: A lot of it was according to my whims as I was doing it, and so that structure isn't completely sane either. My suggestion is that you can follow it so long as it makes sense, and don't follow it when I've obviously done something stupid (it happens!).

:I think there should be consistency between subjects and categories but there are also some important differences: subjects use one particular way of categorization (in the case of language books by continent) but categories can include several ways of categorization (e.g. by difficulty for native English speakers: [[:Category:Languages by category]]). Also, not all categories need to appear in the subject pages (e.g. [[:Category:Soundbite requests]], [[:Category:Languages textbook pages]]). Thus, while there should be consistency, hierarchies of categories and subjects should not be identical . --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:40, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:: I am focusing primarily on matching categories to subjects and not the other way around.  Soundbite requests and Languages by category won't be showing up in [[Subject:Languages]], I agree.  Not every language has been marked as level one, two, or three, anyway, so that would be a poor choice to have show up in the subject hierarchy.  Soundbite requests is a maintenance category, so it also won't be showing up in the subjects. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:14, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

== A small hint ==

Hey Adrignola.  First, great job with categorization.  It seems every time I check Recent Changes, you've categorized another dozen pages!  Also, I appreciate your responses to my post in the Reading Room.  

Anyway, I wanted to let you know that there is a template, {{tlx|BookCat}}, that automatically adds the book to the appropriate Book Category.  It can be used on the main page of a book, or any of its subpages.  Furthermore, you can add it to a template.  For example, see what I've done to [[1 Corinthians]].  Every page contains a navigation box at the bottom.  This is {{tlx|1 Corinthians Navigation}}.  I simply place {{tlx|BookCat}} into this template, and now every page in 1 Corinthians is automatically added to [[:Category:1 Corinthians]] (assuming it includes the navigation template).  The reason BookCat is &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;includeonly&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is because the template itself is not within a book, and the reason the actual category link is &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is because BookCat does a better job (see how the main page is separate from the rest in the category listing).

Most books don't have a common template like this, but many do.  It might make life a little easier if you can exploit that technique. -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 23:55, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

: Yeah, that's fine the way you use it.  I just wanted to let you know, in case you come across a situation it can be used. -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 00:16, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

: I would like to add that there are several categories to include book categories, in particular {{bad link|Category:Computing textbook pages}}, {{bad link|Category:Engineering textbook pages}}, {{bad link|Category:Languages textbook pages}}, {{bad link|Category:Science textbook pages}}, etc. All book categories should be in one of these categories (and no other).

== [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] ==

Hi Adrignola,

Thanks for adding the Dewey/LOC cats to [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  That project has been a major part of my life for the past 3.5 years.  I would have added it long ago, but I could not decide how it would be classified.  I guess 000 is general works (such as encyclopedias?) - I guess that fits.

For a while I had considered breaking this into nine books instead of having it as one - that would have made it easier to classify.  It's just nice to have someone &quot;be bold&quot; like that.  Thanks again. 

I've also noticed that you have done a lot of other categorization work.  I was especially pleased that you added a few of my transcluded modules to my transcluded category.  From that I can tell you are really digging into things before making changes.  That too is very much appreciated. 

--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:30, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:I saw those pages that I added to the transcluded modules when I first started trawling the uncategorized pages listing.  It was then that I realized I would have a hard time figuring out where to categorize books without a bit more order to the current system.  One thing led to another, so now I'm trying to do what you see in the paragraph above your comment.  You've made an impressive number of pages in your book.  It certainly reflects the time you've spent on it.  Given the classification under religious organization, {{tlx|DDC|200}} or {{tlx|LOC|B}} may also be possibilities.  The important thing is that it shows up somewhere for people browsing via any method.  Take care.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:12, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

== University level mathematics, a better way? ==

Is there some other way math books could be categorized? All mathematic books could likely be considered university level because at what point in a person's education subjects are taught can depend on the school and where you are in the world. Also unless someone has gone to public schools or a university they may not know which category to look for a book in using this approach. A similar problem was [[Wikibooks talk:Reading Levels|previously discussion]] and subsequent [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Reading Levels|diff=1162055&amp;oldid=1147197}} change] made to [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels]] because of this issue. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:44, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
: Probably?  I was just following the subjects that were already there.  The items in University level mathematics were already targetted for University Level Mathematics.  I was just changing case.  I don't know enough about math to classify them under, say Calculus or Geometry, etc.  Maybe Jomegat could help with that and then [[:Category:University level mathematics]] and {{bad link|Subject:University level mathematics}} can be deleted.  It is a bad category to have, I agree, but I'm not in a good position knowledge-wise about math to fix it. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:48, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
: I'll see what I can do for the ones that are more obvious, to empty out that category.  I do indeed like to not have redundant categories. I was too focused on actually creating a category to go with the subject without looking at the bigger picture. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:55, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
:: I sometimes use Wikipedia to quickly read up on a subject I don't know anything about, to help me figure out ways to improve categorization. If something doesn't make sense to you, by all means don't follow it. Sometimes its not a category that needs updating but subject pages or books, because people do make improvements to categories while not making the same improvements to subject pages or books. Being focused isn't necessary a bad thing. I appreciated the work you've been putting into improving the category system. I hope realizing there is a bigger picture won't cause you to slow down any, but will rather help you to see new possibilities. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:38, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
::: Wikipedia's a good suggestion.  Looking at the big picture I do see more possible redundancies.  If University level mathematics is no good, [[Subject:Introductory Mathematics]] might be for the same reason.  Also, I'm curious about the differences between [[Subject:Mathematical analysis]] and [[Subject:Calculus and analysis]].  However, Whiteknight did write way above that he made these off the top of his head and they may need to be changed.  I do think I'll go back to working on Computing and save Mathematics for last since it will be the most difficult.  I'm thinking [[Subject:Programming language]] and its contents will need to be filed under [[Subject:Compiled languages]]  to differentiate the content from [[Subject:Scripting languages]] and a possible Subject to match with [[:Category:Markup languages]], all at the same level under [[Subject:Programming]]. I still haven't fully sorted everything under Computing either.  So that's my plan of attack for later today. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
:::: Programming is an area I know something about. I don't really care for the current approach to categorization for some things, but at the same time I'm not always sure what can be done to improve it. There are languages that can be interpreted and compiled for instance. Programming languages may need to be treated similar to how [[:Category:Languages]] needs to be treated, by using a lot of intermediate categories so people can find what they are looking for by following many different paths. Like maybe &quot;Programming languages by family&quot; and &quot;Programming languages by paradigm&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:40, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

== Programming languages by paradigm ==

Can't be correctly implemented since several languages do cover several paradigms (some don't).
Simple examples C evolved from an imperative programming language model but today it supports objects. C++ is by definition a multiparadigm language so to be rightly classified it would have to be present in most categories even as a functional programming language. Going that way will be painfully hard.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not stating my opposition to any of the changes. Since your opinion is as valid as mine and we still haven't got a community shared vision on the issue, I do consider the changes in the scale you are going a bit premature (a better way to go about it is to get the community backing for a static proposal/system, since the visions are too diverse).&lt;br&gt;
I confess I don't particularly like or agree with some of the changes, but if you can manage to commit to maintain and work on some better model that the chaos it is today, you will have all my support even if I don't appreciate all the changes.&lt;br&gt;Good luck to you on this endeavor...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:54, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

== [[:Category:WMOG plant finder categories]] ==

You said that you think this category and its subcategories were never used in its speedy deletion. However when I checked yesterday they were used. I think you must of made some changes since than, perhaps to some templates that caused those categories to suddenly become empty. A quick look suggests     [[Template:Horticat (add &quot;y&quot; where applicable)]] and [[Template:Horticat-topic (add &quot;y&quot; where applicable)]] are at least two of the templates you changed that might be responsible for it. I also notice you renamed a few of the category more general categories rather than in as Category:Horticulture/subcategory. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:59, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

:You're probably right about that.  I forgot I changed those two templates along with the example, profile, and box templates.  I'm not entirely sure what you mean by the &quot;category more general categories&quot;, but I think you are talking about ones link &quot;Soil-related topics&quot;.  That and others that are sentence-case (which do in fact conflict with the standard we've been following for subject categories) were already created and I wasn't sure I wanted to endeavor to reclassify all the pages into ones of the form &quot;Horticulture/Subcategory&quot;.

== Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter ==

Yeah, I'm going to ask you to back out that change to the categories. The purpose of the category, I believe, is to have a common place to keep everything related to a book (or a subject &amp;mdash; though in the case of the subject it's enough to have the landing page there, and everything else in the book can go off that one landing page). The fact that there are 900 pages in the category is a good thing, in my not-so-humble opinion. Additionally, if all the pages are in the one category, you can see any changes to the book by going to the category page and looking for changes on anything in the category.

On tabs and titles, that seems like a useful innovation; we can try that, though I don't know how the PDF tool will handle it. It will, of course, have to be done to all 199 chapter pages... but perhaps we can try it on PS first, and take a look at that before we go hog-wild.

As far as the PDF tool goes, like so much else on any Wiki, it is maintained by volunteers, and as such maintenance can be sketchy. The fact that it doesn't handle relative links is a minor issue, apparently, as it can be worked around, and so a fix for that is low-priority.

:On the categories, I think I'm going to have to argue with you a bit. Right now, the page [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets]] is in the category &quot;Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books&quot;. If you go to the category page for &quot;Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter&quot;, it is not in the pages listed as being in that category; rather, it shows up as one of the pages in a related category, &quot;Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books&quot;. If you expand that category, you can see the books, but not the chapters within the books; to see the chapters, you have to go to the Books subpage, and then expand the related category Chamber of Secrets. If you really want to go in that direction, it is possible, and may be useful; but I would strongly suggest retaining the base category, as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category: Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets]][[Category:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

: Well, the subject categories have been getting standardized to sentence-case to avoid conflicts with books of the same name, like [[:Category:First aid]] (subject category) and [[:Category:First Aid]] (book category), to name one that comes to mind.  If you put aside the name case, it does appear that [[:Category:US law]] actually is already a subcategory of [[:Category:Law]], unless I'm missing something? The subjects also appear to match that same structure, with Law being a parent of US law.

::My opinion on the name collision is that books should avoid generalist titles like US Law or Law in this case, a book per definition shouldn't overcrowd a generalist namespace like First Aid, but I see your point and I don't think that the solution to accommodate the issue is the best one. I disagree with having a book named only &quot;The US Law&quot;, as it is, is just as bad.
::The issue here is that the books names should be addressed/fixed, so that other works on the same fields can be created and read on a even plain field, keeping the practice will probably centralize people in the more general titles, this was an issue with the Programming:&lt;language&gt; books (and other) titles that was a reason for the last change. This to me is the same issue.  
::As for the structure, I haven't examined it, just noticed US law and Law and didn't particularly like it, since you were working on this subject I refrained messing things.
::In any case I still dislike the standardization to sentence-case to avoid conflicts with books, since it looks funny and is just as scheme to avoid the real issue.
::The other and also related thing I have an opinion regarding categories is the use of plurals in some topic it seems fine but a standardization on the singular would be best. For instance Art, Architecture and Law could all be pluralized.    --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:38, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

:::Books starting with &quot;A&quot;, &quot;An&quot;, or &quot;The&quot; don't sort well, so I would agree that &quot;The US Law&quot; is bad.  Plus, there's more than one law in the US.  The category and subject Art were both renamed to Fine arts a bit ago, so that is now plural.  I've not heard &quot;Architectures&quot; used and &quot;Law&quot; would be better to cover the entire legal field as compared to &quot;Laws&quot; which could be interpreted as the legislative items.  Most of the categories do work well pluralized.  (I'm not sure where you stand on that, as you wrote &quot;singular would be best&quot;, but then added &quot;...could be pluralized&quot;.  I certainly agree that specific titles are a good way to avoid confusion, especially for those that don't pay attention to small details like whether that second word is capitalized or not.  The many C++ books do a good job of that.  

:::Sentence-case, title-case, singular, plural.  Unfortunately, like many hot-button issues of the day, there's only one side or the other.    I have been leaning toward the style Wikipedia uses for its categories, namely, sentence case and plural, when it makes sense.  I've noticed Darklama follows this pattern, which is good, in that we don't work against each other.  Since books are usually given a title in title case, following Wikipedia's lead in that respect avoids conflicts, though it may indeed look funny.  Truth is, we could go one way or the other on title/sentence case and singular/plural and no matter what somebody would not be entirely satisfied.  There's a cleanup tag on [[Subject:Major_Subjects|the top-level subject]] to this day. I read over the [[Subject_talk:Major_Subjects|discussions]] on title versus sentence case on the top-level subject page before I started working on things to try to decide which way to go.  They didn't seem to reach a consensus there on the issue.   I had to make a decision at that point how to proceed, otherwise I could not proceed.  My bottom line is, at least, a goal of consistency.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:15, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

I agree that books should use better names rather then generic titles, but we have to deal with what the situation is rather than what the ideals are. Panic if you would like to see that change, you could create and propose a new policym or create an unstable branch of the naming policy, that tries to address this concern. I would likely support a policy that required books (and even chapters) to use more descriptive names, but until then using casing and plurals to differentiate subjects from books is as good a method as any.

As for &quot;US law&quot; I would like to see that expanded to &quot;United states laws&quot; or &quot;Laws of the united states&quot;. One of my things has been an attempt to reduce the use of abbreviations and acronyms as well, not everyone may be familiar with abbreviations and acronyms used and Wikibooks should strive to be as geographically/location-neutral and age-neutral as possible with categories. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:30, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

The templates are not designed to be transcluded like normal templates, they're supposed to be substituted in order to create other templates. Here's a quick rundown:
# The [[User:Whiteknight/Simple Header]] template is substituted at Template:Foo/Page. The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags disappear, leaving the complete &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags in Template:Foo/Page.
# Template:Foo/Page is transcluded into the pages in the book, and the stuff in the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags is not displayed on the book pages.
So it's complicated and very ugly, but intentional. I have a few other templates in my namespace that use this same trick (or trices that are even worse!) to do some fancy-schmance stuff. I'll fix up the weird tags, but I'll try to keep your XHTML fixes in place.

== [[w:Fine arts|Fine arts]] ==

The wikipedia article says this type of art is often expressed in the production of art objects using '''visual''' and '''performing art''' forms, including ''painting'', ''sculpture'', ''music'', ''dance'', ''theatre'', ''architecture'', ''photography'' and ''printmaking''. Schools, institutes, and other organizations still use the term to indicate a traditional perspective on the art forms, often implying an association with classic or academic art.

I figured the best option is to keep visual and performing arts under fine arts, but have fine arts be under humanities, since the arts are considered to be a field of humanities. This should also keep the humanities category from growing too big. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:17, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
: Okay, I see where you're going with that.  I'll work toward that end goal and straighten this all out.  It would end up with Fine arts having two children of visual arts and performing arts, performing arts having music, singing, and dance, and visual arts including the others.  I had been working based on [[w:Humanities|Humanities]] on Wikipedia.  Guess they should consult each other when writing their articles. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:24, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Education]] ==

Seems like your having some trouble deciding how best to categorize books under there. Like with study guides, all books are educational if you really think about it. The education category should probably have a very limited scope. Like for books about:

* Learning or teaching methods/approaches that aren't subject specific,
* Educational institutes (colleges, universities, etc),
* Financial aid programs (grants, tuitions, etc), and
* School life

Categories like &quot;Tertiary education&quot; should IMO be avoided due to being dependent on location. If there are ever enough books, I would suggest breaking things down by country instead like &quot;education in the united states&quot;, &quot;schools of the united states&quot;, &quot;financial aids programs in the united states&quot;, etc. How does that sound to you? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
: Bullet one will be Education theory, then.  Bullet two would be Educational institutions.  Bullet three would be Financial aid.  Bullet four would be School life.  You're right about the study guides and books being educational.  I keep getting stuck in the existing subjects instead of &quot;being bold&quot;.  I'll work to reduce the redundancy to books that are about education, rather than ones that simply educate.  I might have to move some of them back into Education temporarily to keep track of them, just to let you know. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:25, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

: After reading up on education theory and education psychology on Wikipedia, I think education theory is broader subject area that includes education psychology and other subject areas. Education psychology seems to be concerned with the study of how students learn. I guess you could say its also like the difference between theory and psychology. Theories are based on any/general observations, and Psychology is about observation of human behavior, which is a more specific type of observation. Teaching and instruction is likely more about doing rather then understanding the whys and hows, or if you will, applying what education theory and education psychology teaches, turning theory into practice. Does that sound right to you? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:24, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

:: It does.  Thanks for taking the time to look into that.  I'll have to make sure books in those categories match up with their subjects.

== Programming categories ==

I think we should use &quot;X programming language&quot; for the category names to reduce ambiguity. Take python, ruby, cocoa, and java as examples. Python is also the name of a snake. Ruby is also the name of gemstone,, cocoa is also the name of a drink or the seed extract of the cocoa bean, and java is a type of coffee. Oh also why have you decided to abandon the paradigm approach? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:50, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

:: On paradigms, I'm seeing what Panic stated a while back: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Can't be correctly implemented since several languages do cover several paradigms (some don't). Simple examples C evolved from an imperative programming language model but today it supports objects. C++ is by definition a multiparadigm language so to be rightly classified it would have to be present in most categories even as a functional programming language. Going that way will be painfully hard.&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The languages, from what I've seen, have evolved from one type to another, and so seeing their presence under one paradigm you'd have to wonder &quot;at what time in the lifespan of the language does this apply?&quot;.  Also, since most are multiparadigm, you end up with the multiparadigm category having nearly as many subcategories as [[:Category:Programming languages by family]] has right now.  In addition, categorizing them will be difficult, as Wikipedia does not have consistency.  [[w:List of programming languages by category]] doesn't often match what the pages for the individual programming languages say, making it hard to determine which is correct.  And most people looking for a book will have a specific language in mind, the way I look at it.  I do believe your other idea on categorizing by operating system would be more useful to those newer programmers and it would be less ambiguous as well, if anything other than families is implemented at all.  If you were really set on paradigms, I could reverse that, but the above constitutes the line of thinking I've been on since the idea was first proposed. 

:: I can recategorize the books into X programming languages later today.  I was just matching the existing subcategories for families for consistency, but I can go the other way because you make a good argument. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:54, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

::: By operating system would have similar problems, but I do think there needs to be ways to compare languages to help new users make an informed decision when deciding what programming language(s) to learn without having to do a lot of research first. By operating system would be more friendly for new users than paradigms. By family was really intended to identify languages with a common ancestry. Like there are many variants of the Basic programming language that share a common history despite being widely different from each other. There are also variants of Lisp. Each architecture has its own assembly language but tend to share some common history as well. OTOH languages like C, C++, and Java while having similar grammar aren't really part of the same language family. Looking at [[w:Comparison of programming languages]], I'm thinking maybe &quot;by operating system&quot;, &quot;by intended use&quot; and &quot;by standards&quot; could be useful to a general audience in addition to &quot;by family&quot; which is likely more useful for an intermediate or advanced audience. So if you plan to substitute &quot;by paradigm&quot; with something else I can accept its deletion, just keep in mind the alternatives may not be any better or worse then it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:45, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

== Are you sure speedy-delete is the right thing? ==

I'm not a regular anymore, but won't deleting a page turn all the links to the ACT-test page into red-links and someone will have to manually fix all the broken links?  Isn't a merge-tag better suited?  I don't have any experience with wikibooks, but just wanted to comment since i'm one of the few who contribute to the content geared for high schoolers.  I just don't want anybody to be unaware that the page is moved, since it will come up as having been deleted.  Doesn't [[move]] and [[redirect]] work better for this?

: I nominated [[:Category:ACT]] for deletion because I filed the books in [[:Category:ACT test]].  The [[ACT]] book was moved to [[ACT Study Guide]] and so won't need it for a book category and no pages link to the category of the same name.  No pages link to [[Subject:ACT]] either.  Unless you're talking about something else. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:24, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

== BookCat ==

I've noticed that you use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; rather than {{tlx|BookCat}}.  Any particular reason?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:03, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

: You're not the first person to ask that.  BookCat evaluates whether it's placed on a subpage or not to determine what code is used to categorize.  Since the main book page is automatically put in the book's category when {{tlx|Subjects}} is used, BookCat should never be used in a situation where it's on the main book page.  I know they have that additional code in there just in case, but I feel there's no need to involve parser functions on the page when I can just paste in the code that BookCat would evaluate to anyways and save some processing when the page is viewed. {{tlx|BookCat}} is only linked to from [[Using Wikibooks/Cleanup and Maintenance]] and it says &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If you do not know what book category to use, or how to use it, tag every page in the book with {{tlxs|BookCat}}. This will automatically add the book pages to the proper categories.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It's commonly transcluded and not substituted.  But, if I follow guidelines and substitute it, I'll have all the code in the template put on the page.  As I said above, it has more than is needed when I'm aware of the page I'm working on, so pasting in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; also saves length as compared to the documented method of using it via substitution. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:16, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

:: That's very helpful perspective; thanks.  The suggestion from Whiteknight to use subst with BookCat is certainly based on a different set of priorities from mine; one of the things I always liked about BookCat is that it simplifies administrative code on content pages, which is only true if it's transcluded.  Of course, I actually don't use it directly in the book I mainly contribute to, because I've built it into the [[Template:Navlist/Doc|Navlist]] /Top and /Bottom templates &amp;mdash; but then again, the Navlist templates are themselves a pretty spectacular exercise in preferring intensive transclusion over visible content-page complexity.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:16, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for creating Category:Effective Student Organization for our course project book. Any ideas of higher order categories it may fit within? --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|talk]]) 18:06, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
: You are quite welcome.  I'm doing quite a bit of categorizing lately. Both your book's main page and the category of the same name are filed in [[:Category:School life]], which is a category in [[:Category:Education]], which is a category in [[:Category:Social sciences]], which is a category in [[:Category:Books by subject]].  Rather than filing a book at every level of the hierarchy, books have been filed at the lowest level possible given their subject matter. 
 
:It sounds and appears that your book is a class project, so I'll also put it in [[:Category:Class projects]], which is a category in [[:Category:Standard curricula]], which is a category in [[:Category:Books by subject]].  I hadn't done so at first because you are doing well in designing the book to be accessible to a general audience as opposed to students at any particular school.  I've only categorized a few other class projects in areas other than class projects for that very reason, so you should take pride in your work. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:14, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
== Cats ==

Great work and a huge patience...
Some requests for consideration:
*Simplify Computer programming (and others like Console game programming into the same category Programming).
*Simplify Computer software as Software (move open source as a sub-category there).
*Simplify Computer science and Computer engineering as Computing (this can be tricky but will simplify overall categorization without a specific loss of metadata information, I understand that it attempts to classify some areas as scientific but the classification is not as exact when dealing in computation).
*I miss the Programming category, for instance &quot;Algorithms and data structure&quot; or &quot;Software reverse engineering&quot; would best fit there. The clean/small title and specific languages categories is also very much missed. (in a Programming languages as a subcategory).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:35, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

: Well, the move towards longer category titles makes it so that two-word category titles that are sentence case will avoid conflicts with two-word books that are title case.  Merging Computer science and Computer engineering in Computing would be problematic.  Right now Computing is a top-level category, so that would cause it to become very large with all the books currently in those two categories. That move would have to be part of a larger reorganization to be successful. You can find programming language categories in [[:Category:Programming languages by family]].  And the longer names in there were created because things like Cocoa, Java, and Ruby, can reference things other than programming languages.

: As for Programming, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Category%3AProgramming&amp;diff=1503675&amp;oldid=1496111 this revision] of it should prove that it was actually Darklama who initiated the move to [[:Category:Computer programming]] and [[:Category:Computer engineering]].  I just followed through to make that happen.  Darklama's area of expertise is computer science/programming and has made several changes under Computing.  Even if Programming would be better than Computer programming, it'd be contrary to the direction Darklama wanted to go in and things work more smoothly when we work together.

: I am certainly open to suggestions and do not intend for anyone to think the current organization is firm, but since Darklama has played such a key role in shaping how Computing looks today, he needs to be brought in on this discussion before any massive changes can be made. I see from both your user pages that you are both interested in computer science/programming, so I think discussions would more fruitful involving you two primarily. I'll leave him a note asking for input on your ideas, so stay tuned. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

: Actually Whiteknight first started Computer Engineering in 2006, I merely moved it to a lowercase name to be consistent with other subject categories. I don't think the categories should be simplified. First the longer names can reduce the possibility of conflicting with book titles. Second if people do a search using &quot;computer&quot; they can find the engineering, programming, software, etc. categories with the longer names, but not with the shorter names. Third computer science and computer engineering shouldn't be merged into computing because there distinctly separate fields. Fourth if you look at [[:Category:Computing]] you can see that computer science, computer programming and computer software are already listed as related categories so there is no need to merge the categories. Software reverse engineering right now is in computer engineering, but at some point I hope to make a [[w:Software engineering|Software engineering]] category. Algorithms and data structure are in a related category link to from the computer programming category. I thought I had put computer engineering into computing but apparently I didn't that is one change I can make to improve that situation. [[:Category:Computer programming languages]] replaces the programming languages category. I would also like to replace the console game programming category with an electronic games programming category to compliment [[:Category:Electronic games]], which brings up another point. Fifth &quot;programming&quot; can also refer to television programming, radio programming, music programming, and other sorts of programming that has nothing to do with computers. Sixth a subject page can be created to list books from the many categories to compensate for these changes, while combining categories would result in a loss of useful information. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:01, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
== Administrator ==

Hi Adrignola,

If I were to nominate you for admin rights, would you accept?  The work you've done here has clearly demonstrated your thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and general knowledge not only of the MediaWiki software, but also of how the Wikibooks community operates.  Having you as an admin here would do nothing but enhance this project. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:08, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
: I am pleased that you think so highly of me.  I have a website I operate for an open-source game being developed where had I set up and now manage the MediaWiki installation there so I had a certain amount of knowledge of MediaWiki before I started becoming active here.  However, that site is quite inactive because the game is not finished yet, so it's been a learning experience seeing it in action here.  Wikibooks does feel like a community and that gave me the inspiration and confidence to attempt the significant categorization effort you've no doubt noticed.  I can't think of any reason not to accept, so yes, I would accept.  I hope my efforts so far and efforts to come will benefit the project, regardless of the outcome. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:23, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

== Enhancing subject pages ==

I've been working on and off in my userspace on ways to improve subject pages. [[User:Darklama/Subject]] has what I've been working on. I plan to eventually turn it into several templates. I think this sort of thing would be good for the computer programming, education and languages subject pages and with some changes for a lot of other pages too. Any thoughts? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:03, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

: I think some might be disappointed that featured books aren't shown on the page.  Recategorizing would be more difficult. Right now you only have to change the subject and category of the same name.  This layout requires you to change all the parent subjects that include that subject you're recategorizing on the same page as the books filed into the parent subject itself. Then there's the question of what sub-subjects get top billing on the top-level subject page.  For instance, computer science isn't listed on the page for Computing.  And what if someone's interested in computer programming libraries but sees the pages listed under the computer programming heading and thinks that's all there is, when libraries are actually filed in a subcategory of computer programming?

: Those are ''constructive'' criticisms.  Some things I especially like are the use of color beyond purple and the elimination of collections, which I've yet to see done for any books and of which I've yet to fully grasp the use of.  I wasn't involved in the decision to move to subjects, so I don't know if there were any additional goals beyond the dynamic listing of books in a subject to know how close the current subjects are to their vision. I do believe there's room for improvement and so I encourage experimentation since creative design is not a strong point of mine. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:25, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I plan to include featured books in it, just haven't yet. This layout is only intended for some subject pages. For most subject pages there would be one list of books like now. I know some people prefer the layout of the Languages bookshelf over the Languages subject page, which is where the idea of using multiple book listing comes into play for some subject pages.
:: Beyond moving toward a more flexible system than bookshelves and departments there aren't really any specific community goals or visions for the subject pages. Experimentation is suppose to be fine. For myself I prefer to think of the subject pages as a web rather then as a hierarchy and how I'd like other people to see it if I can. Which is part of why I replaced &quot;Subtopics&quot; with &quot;Related Subjects&quot; at one point in Whiteknight's template. Another part of that goal that isn't apparent from my subject page is that instead of using back links, subject pages like Subject:Computing would also be categorized in each of its related categories too, so that it would show up in the related subjects list, resulting in a more dynamic two way link between subject pages that requires even fewer changes to update.
:: Collections are intended to provide an easy way to generate PDF files for books, so might eventually replace the PDF list. Collections can also be printed and generate other formats, so they might also eventually replace the print versions books have as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:14, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
== Categorizing pages that don't have their own identities ==

There are three pages in the [[Conlang]] book that are effectively sections of the book's main page.  Each of them manifests as part of the main page and can be edited via an edit button in that part of the main page &amp;mdash; and each of them should not be edited or viewed outside of that context.  I deliberately didn't categorize them because I didn't want any categories pointing to these inherently non-independent pages.  As part of your heroic efforts at cleaning up categorization, though, you added the usual book-category code to each of them.  Rather than knee-jerk decategorizing them again, I thought I'd check with you first.  Is there some additional factor that interferes with my reason for not categorizing them?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 06:34, 16 June 2009 (UTC)
: Having a category on them prevents them from showing up in [[Special:UncategorizedPages]], allowing for easier viewing of new books/pages and also double-checking to make sure new pages weren't accidentally created as standalone instead of subpages.  Could we put the pages you mention in, say, [[:Category:Conlang/Structural]] (or your choice), where that category is filed in [[:Category:Conlang]] and holds all the pages that are structural and not content-related? I do that for books with a lot of templates using Bookname/Templates or images using Bookname/Images. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:33, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

== [[Using Wikibooks]] ==

Hi Adrignola,

I was wondering if I could interest you in writing a section of [[Using Wikibooks]] covering subjects and categories and their proper use.  It could answer questions like:
*What's the difference between subjects and categories?
*What subject should I file a book under, and how do I do that?
*What sort of subcategories should a book have?
I'm sure you can think of other aspects that elude me ATM.  If you're ambitious, you could even help us catch the clue train about DDC and LOC.  My thinking is that the better people understand what you're doing and what the logic is, the smaller the messes they will make and the better off the project will be.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:31, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

== Uncreated &quot;book&quot; category of template-space pages ==

My [[Template:Navlist]] suite has an accidental, uncreated, sporadically populated &quot;book&quot; category, [[:Category:Template:Navlist]] &amp;mdash; which comes about because some templates in the suite invoke {{tl|BookCat}} to automatically categorize the calling page, and some pages in the suite invoke those templates.  Is this category as-is apt to cause some sort of problem down the road, or is it harmless as-is?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:55, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

== A quick question ==

I ran across something I thought was odd and I thought I would ask you what to think about it.  Some pages (I'll take as an example [[Functional_Analysis/Hilbert_spaces]]) place themselves in the Category corresponding to the book by having a tag like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subject|Functional_Analysis/Hilbert_spaces}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This is a bit different then things I have usually seen and I was curious if it had undesired results.  But before I started reading the template to figure out exactly what it would do I thought I would ask someone a bit more knowledgeable then myself.

:Just as {{tlx|BookCat}} is intended for subpages, but will alter what it does if accidentally placed on the main page of a book, {{tlx|Subjects}} is intended for the main page of a book, but will alter what it does if placed on a subpage of a book. Someone cleverly designed the code so that, no, there are no unintended consequences. It does leave at least three different methods to categorize a book's subpages: {{tlx|BookCat}}, {{tlx|Subject}}, and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Which one to use really depends on personal preference, since they produce the same result. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:55, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
:: A bot could parse uses of the subjects template on subpages for its own purposes, making there use on subpages a form of meta data.

== Categories of non-mainspace pages ==

I'm trying to suss out some grand-scale issues in arrangement of categories of non-mainspace pages; most of this I've been thinking about just recently with regard to template space, but one part of it I've also been mulling over for some time with regard to Wikijunior.  (I do apologize for springing this on you when you've already got more than enough on your plate already; but it seemed like a good idea to try to clear these broad issues out of the way sooner rather than later.)

You'll recall that since {{tl|BookCat}} was being incidentally applied to several pages in my Template:Navlist suite anyway, I categorized all of them by simply adding {{tl|BookCat}} to the rest and creating [[:Category:Template:Navlist]].  I had initially worried that it would seem anomalous to have a category whose name begins with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, but in the event it seems to me to work out well, because when you look at {{nowrap|[[:Category:Navigational templates]]}}, this way ''everything'' belonging to it starts with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &amp;mdash; both member category and member pages.

Now, the vast majority (I think) of template-space pages are actually specific to particular books; and in your Using Wikibooks write-up, you've recommended putting such templates in a subcategory of the book category called&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;.  But, logically, should all pages in template space be somewhere under [[:Category:Templates]]?  Because if they should, then these template subcategories of book categories should have a place in the hierarchy depending from &lt;tt&gt;Category:Templates&lt;/tt&gt;.  (And if not, then &lt;tt&gt;Category:Templates&lt;/tt&gt; should probably be called something else, like&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Generic templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}.)

: ''(A side problem at this point is where in the hierarchy to put them that won't swamp the existing categories of generic templates.  For example, there are probably a lot of book-specific navbox templates, but putting them directly in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Navigational templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would make the generics hard to find.  Perhaps one could just throw all the subcategories of book categories into a&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}?  If more precision is needed, one could also have subcategories like&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific navigational templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}, though that seems liable to get out of hand.)''

There seems to be at least some merit, though, to giving these book-specific categories names starting with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;tt&gt;&quot;, thus&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Category:Template:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; rather than&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;.  Besides the straightforwardness of prefixing space-specific category names with the name-prefix of the space, this also means that ''if'' the book-specific templates for {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}} are given names of the form {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Some template&lt;/tt&gt;}}, then generic categorization techniques such as {{tl|BookCat}} could be used.  Were we to go with the &lt;tt&gt;Category:Template:&lt;/tt&gt; form, we'd want to recommend the {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Some template&lt;/tt&gt;}} form.  (I might actually have seen a semi-recommendation of that naming scheme, somewhere or other.)

A similar situation exists with Wikijunior pages:  the book categories there, that I've seen, always have to be written out manually because they are prefixed with &lt;tt&gt;Wikijunior_&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;Wikijunior:&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g. {{nowrap|[[:Category:Wikijunior The Elements]]}} rather than {{nowrap|[[:Category:Wikijunior:The Elements]]}}, so that techniques like {{tl|BookCat}} cannot be used.

Looking over all that, there seem to be three distinct possibilities raised.
* Put book-specific templates in a catch-all&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}.
* Give template subcategories of book categories names of the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Cagetory:Template:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}.
* Give Wikijunior book categories names of the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Wikijunior:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}.

Thoughts?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:13, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

: I noticed that with Wikijunior. Historically the categories matched the books' names &amp;mdash; they were moved to the Wikijunior namespace later when it was created. I'd have to recategorize all the Wikijunior pages to correct that (though it wouldn't be any more work than categorizing an uncategorized page).  I would agree with the effort to create new Wikijunior categories and correct their books' pages' categories.

: I would prefer book-specific templates be filed in their book's category, regardless of what the name of their container category is. The generic category would get too cluttered otherwise.

: Supporting the above, I would agree that [[:Category:Templates]] needs to have a name change. Wikipedia has [[w:Category:Wikipedia templates]], so the top-level category for generic templates on Wikibooks can be [[:Category:Wikibooks templates]]. It's blue because it's a redirect to [[:Category:Templates]]. (That should be reversed).

: I do agree that using the form &lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Template Blah&lt;/tt&gt; would enable easier categorizing using {{tlx|BookCat}}. The container category would be &lt;tt&gt;Category:Template:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;, yes.  You'd have to manually specify your book's category when filing your template category, still. That would differ from using &lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt; where you have to manually specify the category on the templates ''and'' the template category. I happen to like the look of &lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;, though, but since it's something unique to each book, authors can use whatever they feel is best. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:31, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree the Wikijunior categories should be renamed to Category:Wikijunior:Book. I also don't like a catch-all category for all book-specific templates. Keeping track of templates would become more difficult. Personally I think a lot of book-specific templates don't need to be book-specific. I think the only templates that need to be book specific are templates that provide navigation between pages, and even that isn't really necessary for books that only care to have back, forward, and table of content links. Books are required by policy to use the &lt;tt&gt;Book/Page&lt;/tt&gt; form for any pages of the book, and I think sticking with that form for any templates and categories for the book creates consistency and is a good idea. Other forms have been discussed in the past on the talk pages for Naming convention, Hierarchy and Naming policy, and rejected by the community. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:55, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

::: Okay,&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; was a daft idea; it would serve no useful organizational purpose.  Renaming&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Catetory:Templates&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; to {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Wikibooks templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; appeals to me.

::: I agree, actually, about the look/uniformity of&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  Also, because we are only filing this category under the book category, and not at all under the&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Category:Templates&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; hierarchy, mnemonic sense is all for prefixing the category name with the book name rather than with&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt;.  It occurs to me that if the templates are called&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Template Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}}, one could exploit that naming scheme with a template alternative to&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Template:BookCat&lt;/tt&gt;, call it&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Template:BookTemplateCat&lt;/tt&gt;, that would automatically add&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Template Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}.

::: I too think that most book-specific templates don't have to be book-specific, but categorizing what we already have seems both simpler than, and a facilitator to, thoughtfully reforming detailed template tactics across the whole of Wikibooks.  Sufficient unto the day is the colossal task thereof.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:33, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

(reset)

I don't focus on [[:Category:Templates]] as the root. I see ''[[:Category:Categories]]'' as the root. If you want an alphabetical index to search for a specific book's templates, wouldn't [[Special:PrefixIndex]] with the template namespace do?  If filing template categories in {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}} would result in a category tree like that for the subject categories that books are put in, in order to organize them, then why not leave them filed in their book's category, which is itself part of the main category tree and allows the templates to move with the book if the book is refiled?

: Here is the arrangement I'm now talking about.
:* Each book-specific template has a name of the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}}, and contains markup &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{BOOKNAME}}/Templates|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;br/&gt;(which might be generated by a template call&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookTemplateCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).  Presumably, calls to this template from within the book would have the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKNAME}}/Blah|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}.
:* {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; contains markup &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{BOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Book-specific templates|{{BOOKNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;br/&gt;(which might be generated by a template call, perhaps&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book-specific templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).
:* {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; contains markup &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Templates]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
:* As an alternative for a given book, if one didn't want to have a separate&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}, one could have each&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:My Book/Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; call&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book-specific templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, instead of&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookTemplateCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  (These may not be the ideal names for the two categorizing templates, after all...)
:* It would also be possible for book-specific templates that don't conform to the naming convention to manually put themselves into the appropriate category(-ies).  Wikijunior book-specific templates would probably always be non-conformant; I don't see any natural way to extend the book-specific-template naming convention to cover Wikijunior.
:Under this arrangement,
:* Every book-specific template would belong either directly to its book category, or to a child of its book category.  This is just as in the flat- and deep-filing arrangements you recommended in Using Wikibooks, so I assume that this would be fine when renaming a book.
:* Every book-specific template would belong either directly to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}, or to a child of that category.  This would not clutter the pre-existing categories of templates, because all the book-specific templates and book-specific template categories would be tucked away under&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book-specific templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}; the only effect on&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Category:Templates&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; would be the addition of one child category, and there would be no effect at all on any of the other pre-existing categories of templates.  It would provide us with a convenient way of finding all book-specific templates; it would clarify the status of these templates ''as'' book-specific; and it would guarantee that, to the extent that everything is conformant, &lt;tt&gt;Category:Templates&lt;/tt&gt; is the root/top of all templates and categories of templates &amp;mdash; that is, every template-space page, and every category of only template-space pages, occurs somewhere in the hierarchy of categories descending from&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}.

== Undefined FULLCHAPTERNAME variable ==

There are two problems I see with your placement of chapter names as part of the category system, and that is for most of these older books, FULLCHAPTERNAME is not defined, and also, the way you are using the category command is not the way it wants to be used. The Category command does not take two fields the way it is written so that even if you did, have a valid variable it would not result in a change in the category. The way I have managed to get chapter to work is to put it after a &lt;nowiki&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt; character then you get &lt;nowiki&gt;Bookname/Chaptername&lt;/nowiki&gt; as its category.

Debugging was probably the only chapter moved into the book so far that makes sense. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:11, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

== BookCat ==

What would you think of the following changes to {{tlx|BookCat}}?

* When called from a template with no slash in its name (such as&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;[[Template:Wikijunior:Languages]]&lt;/tt&gt;}}), the sort key would be &quot;&amp;nbsp;&quot; (same sort key as when called from the main page of a book).  This is what got me started thinking about changes to BookCat, when I saw how [[Template:Wikijunior:Languages]] was sorted in [[:Category:Wikijunior:Languages/Templates]].

* When called from a category whose name has a slash in it but is ''not'' of the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Templates&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}, would put that category into the category named by removing the last part of the name (from the last slash on).  Thus,&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book/Images&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would be put into&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}, while&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book/Chapter/Section&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would be put into&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book/Chapter&lt;/tt&gt;}}.
:: I considered adding a&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;filing=deep&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; option, but wasn't sure whether it would be worth it.  Presumably it would change the behavior everywhere except in category space, where there might be a&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;filing=flat&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; option.

* When called from a category with no slash in its name, would do nothing (hence, no harm).

I've set up a version of BookCat with these changes (and my attempt at appropriately modified documentation) at [[User:Pi zero/BookCat]], and tested all the cases I could think of off hand (I thought of thirty six cases, 6x3x2).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:08, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

== Categorizing Goodbook templates ==

Should the Goodbook templates that advertise featured books,
:{{fullurl:Special:PrefixIndex|prefix=Goodbook&amp;namespace=10}},
belong to the book categories of the books they advertise?  Or, for that matter, to their books' template categories?  I wouldn't have put them in the &lt;tt&gt;/Templates&lt;/tt&gt; categories, because they aren't book-specific &amp;mdash; they are used outside their books and not inside those books.  As templates that aren't book-specific, I wouldn't have put them in the book categories at all; but it looks like about ten out of eighty of them have been individually added to their book categories (e.g., [[Template:Goodbook/Ada Programming]]).

I've been crafting a surgical change to {{tl|Goodbook}} that would automatically add all of the Goodbook templates to {{nowrap|[[:Category:Wikibooks featured-book templates/Goodbook]]}}.  (Not without trepidation; beside the sensitivity of {{tl|Goodbook}} itself, I'm paranoid about my own absent-mindedness.)  The change could be modified to automatically add them to their book categories as well (or instead), ''if'' the Wikijunior ones are renamed from&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:Goodbook/Wikijunior My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:Goodbook/Wikijunior:My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}.

As is, the change is right at the interface between the &lt;tt&gt;includeonly&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;noinclude&lt;/tt&gt; blocks; it would replace
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Templates|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
with
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;{{#ifeq:&quot;{{FULLBOOKNAME}}&quot;|&quot;Template:Goodbook&quot;|[[Category:Wikibooks featured-book templates/Goodbook|{{CHAPTERNAME}} ]]}}&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

:Shouldn't that be &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;{{#ifeq:&quot;{{FULLBOOKNAME}}&quot;|&quot;Template:Goodbook&quot;| |[[Category:Wikibooks featured-book templates/Goodbook|{{CHAPTERNAME}} ]]}}&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (extra pipe to put category in false evaluation)? Otherwise I think not having them in the books' categories is fine. The featured book template on the books' main pages has a link to the goodbook template if someone wants to edit it. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:19, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:: No, you want it in the true evaluation, so that it will apply just to those pages that transclude {{tl|Goodbook}} and, additionally, have names that start with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Template:Goodbook&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  That's Goodbook itself and all its subpages.  Otherwise, it wouldn't categorize any of those pages, but it ''would'' put (for example) the [[Main Page]] into the /Goodbook category since {{tl|Goodbook}} does get transcluded there (which is why {{tl|Goodbook}} falls under the cascading protection of the Main Page).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 03:37, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

::: I understand your logic, and also see why you couldn't put the code in the template yourself (cascading protection). I've added your code to the template. Since the majority are ''not'' put in the books' categories, I think that ''none'' of them should be put in the books' categories.  Looks like all the goodbook templates need null edits to show up in your category. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:46, 24 June 2009 (UTC)
== Wikijunior categories ==

Question (but at least it's a well-defined one this time).

When naming a book-specific template associated with a Wikijunior book, it would be messy to call it&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:Wikijunior:My Book/Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}}, because then you'd always have to include the&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; prefix when calling it, i.e., {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Template:Wikijunior:My Book/Blah}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; rather than&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikijunior:My Book/Blah}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; (because the latter looks in Wikijunior space instead of template space).

Should we, perhaps, use a slash in place of the internal colon, thus&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:Wikijunior/My Book/Blah&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;?  This could be detected and compensated for by {{tl|BookCat}}.

If we do that, we might also want to apply the same transformation to the category names (more work for {{tl|BookCat}}).  That is, {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Wikijunior/My Book&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; and&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Wikijunior/My Book/Templates&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  That ''would'' be in the spirit of the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:01, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

: To be clear: I'm actually of two minds about this, myself.

BookTemplate should support passing parameters through to the book's template; I noticed this when, in field testing it on [[Wikijunior:Languages]], I encountered [[:Template:Wikijunior:Languages/Box]].  How about
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;{{Template:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}{{#if: {{{1|}}} |/{{{1}}}}}|{{{2|}}}|{{{3|}}}|{{{4|}}}|{{{5|}}}}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This works for passing parameters to the book's main template as well, via &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookTemplate||...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:20, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Alas.  Looks like {{tl|BookTemplate}} needs to support a larger number of parameters; I'd suggest going all the way up to &lt;nowiki&gt;|{{17|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, to be safe.  I thought I was being cautious by providing for 4.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:59, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

== ROOTBOOKNAME ==

I've created a template {{tl|ROOTBOOKNAME}}.
* I suggest {{tl|BookTemplate}} should use ROOTBOOKNAME instead of FULLBOOKNAME (in both the documentation and the code).  This would allow BookTemplate to work right when viewing book templates that use it, and when using those book templates on talk pages, and when using it to call book templates from talk pages.
* It could also be used in documenting book and book-template categories, as in
::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;This category contains templates used in the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}]] book.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
* I'm not sure there isn't a better name than ROOTBOOKNAME, that I'm just not thinking of.
* I don't ''think'' there are any other cases that ROOTBOOKNAME should handle separately.

== Limitations of BookTemplate ==

Although I do think {{tl|ROOTBOOKNAME}} is primordial enough that it's The Right Thing, this might not be true of {{tl|BookTemplate}}.  ''Maybe'' it isn't actually the Wrong Thing, but it may be only a tool for the majority of light applications, with a second, heavy-duty tool needed for special occasions.  In field-testing (on the seriously stressful case of False Friends of the Slavist), I'm now looking at a book-specific template with 171 unnamed parameters and 9 named parameters ({{tl|False Friends of the Slavist/MapConstructor}}).  That deserves some careful thought before acting.

Here's an idea I'm mulling over:  a higher-order template that generates as output the name of a book template, i.e., {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;Template:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  For example, if its name were&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;bt&lt;/tt&gt;, one would write&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{bt|MapConstructor}}|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  Choosing a name for this device is something of a challenge; it should probably have a very short name (at worst, no longer than &quot;BookTemplate&quot;), and it may want to avoid having &quot;meta&quot; in its name lest that been confused with [[m:|Meta]].  I'm even half tempted by&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;bt&lt;/tt&gt;, despite my basic agreement with Darklama about initialisms.    --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:55, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

: Yes, that book you're dealing with is quite the challenge. I understand what your higher-order template would do, yet I don't see what its goal is. What would its advantage be over the code currently in {{tlx|BookTemplate}}? I wouldn't want to make things too complicated for the people who have to use these. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:00, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

:: Using {{tl|BookTemplate}}, the only parameters that will reach the target (in this case, {{nowrap|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/MapConstructor&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}) are those that are explicitly passed on by BookTemplate.  Right now that's nineteen unnamed parameters.  There's no point in just upping the number of unnamed parameters passed on, because there are still ''named'' parameters that don't get passed on, and the only way to pass them on would be to explicitly hardwire their names into the central facility {{tl|BookTemplate}}.

:: (BTW, I see I muffed the markup for my hypothetical higher-order template:  I used it as if it took a parameter for the chaptername of the book template, but the markup doesn't provide for that.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:34, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

: This is why its better to call/use templates directly. If your still bent on trying to make this work, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BookTemplate}}/Foobar|blah|blah|what=blah}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would avoid the limitations of having only a fixed number of parameters and not being able to use named parameters. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:03, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

:: (Lot's of unnecessary and possibly missing-the-point discussion of &quot;using templates directly&quot; deleted here... --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:39, 26 June 2009 (UTC))

I've created a template {{tl|BOOKTEMPLATE}}, that simply generates the main book-template name for the current book, i.e., {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Template:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  My notion is that an editor reading markup sees the all-caps and expects a device that generates part of a page name, because that's what all the other all-caps names do (pre-existing naming convention).  The notation for calling the main book template of a book would then be
: {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}|one|two|what=something}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}
and for calling a book template&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;/Foobar&lt;/tt&gt;,
: {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Foobar|one|two|what=something}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}
If this works out as well as I'm hoping, we can convert all of the existing {{tl|BookTemplate}} calls to use {{tl|BOOKTEMPLATE}} instead, and then delete {{tl|BookTemplate}}.  It's simple, one-stop shopping for editors using book templates.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:34, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

:: To get the book's template of its own name, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not working.

::: Ya that is the draw back to that approach. The mediawiki parser thinks there is a template parameter named either {BOOKTEMPLATE} or BOOKTEMPLATE with {}'s placed around the result.

== Another reason to noinclude BookCat ==

You asked a while back (over on my talk page) about removing the noincludes around {{tl|BookCat}}.  My answer has changed, a bit: I now recommend noincluding BookCat for pretty much every template that doesn't generate a complete table.  The reason is that, as I was gradually forced to remember by wrestling with [[Template:False Friends of the Slavist/MapLegend4]], category links have a tendency to prevent paragraph breaks (though I don't remember exactly how that works, if I ever really understood it).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:06, 27 June 2009 (UTC)

: I think that's a bad idea. Using noinclude defeats the main reason why its usually included to begin with. To make it easy to categorize pages of a book without having to manually categorize each page separately. I think having templates with the only difference being the number of arguments passed are bad ideas too, so I went and fixed that. I think the MapConstructor template needs improved too, because all the images overlap each other based on the positioning, making any obscured images loaded a waste of bandwidth and slows down the time it takes to load pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:11, 27 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I did notice your technical fix for the problem with MapLegend.  Admitting such technical fixes on a case-by-case basis somewhat expands the range of templates that can include BookCat.  Recalling a key element from the earlier discussion, though, BookCat neessarily must be noincluded on templates that could be used inside links (which is most of the templates for Friends of the Slavist &amp;mdash; and also the /Navlist files used to specify book contents, as we were forcibly reminded when adding included category markup to Conlang/Navlist broke all the navbox links in the Conlang book).  Likewise, BookCat must be noincluded on templates that generate fragments of template names.  As a rule of thumb, I'd still noinclude BookCat on any template that generates a small text fragment without embedded markup.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:59, 27 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

|description =This is another plant easily confused with the [[../Taraxacum officinale|Dandelion]].  The easiest way to tell the difference is by looking at its leaves.  The edges do not have any lobes or indentations, and the surface of the leaf is covered with hair.  It does not grow as tall as [[../Hieracium pratense|Yellow Hawkweed]], and it has only one flower at the top of the stem.  In fact, the whole plant, with the exception of the flower parts, is covered in hairs, usually whitish, but sometimes reddish on the stem.  This is another plant that grows in waste places, such as along roadsides and railroad tracks.  It thrives in dry, infertile soil.
|facts = People once believed that any blade covered in this plant's juices would be able to cut through stone as easily as through wood.

|image2=Hieracium aurantiacium.jpg

|image3 =Hieracium aurantiacum Saarland 03.jpg
|caption3=Cluster of flowers
|description =This plant is very similar to [[../Hieracium pilosella|Mouse-ear Hawkweed]], except that the flower is ''bright'' orange, and it can form a cluster of several flowers on one stem.  Because of its bright orange color, Orange Hawkweed is sometimes called ''The Devil's Paintbrush''.  Orange Hawkweed is a low-growing plant, with a cluster of hairy leaves growing around the base of the stem, and one or more flowers blooming at the top.  
|facts = Orange Hawkweed is not native to North America, but was brought here to grow in flower beds.  It has since escaped from gardens, and now grows wild in many places.  In New Zealand and Tasmania, it grows so well that it crowds out native species, and those governments have banned it.

|description =Common Yellow Woodsorrel is a plant commonly confused with clover.  It has pretty little yellow flowers with five petals.  The leaves grow in threes and are shaped like hearts.  When the plant is young, the stems stand up and hold the leaves and flowers high.  As the summer wears on though, the stems lay down and the plant creeps along on the ground.  In the daytime, the leaves open wide to catch the sun, but at night, the plant folds them up.  Do you put ''your'' things away at night?  Do you?
|facts = All parts of the Common Yellow Woodsorrel are edible and have a ''very'' tangy taste.  Just be careful, because too much of it will cause an upset stomach.  It is high in vitamin C.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Newton_fractal|newton fractal]] is calculated by iterating the [[Fractals/Mathematics/Newton method|Newton-Raphson root finding method]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacobs-university.de/phd/files/1153304134.pdf Newton’s Method as a Dynamical System by Johannes Ruckert]&lt;/ref&gt;, and coloring the sample point in various ways based on various properties of how the point is attracted to the various 'roots' or 'solutions' to the method. For example how fast or at what angle the [[Fractals/Orbit|orbit]] is attracted.

==Newton Family of fractals==
[[File:ButterflyPhoenixDoubleNova wing dotdotdot uhuhhuhhh ovalOrifice.jpg|256px|right|thumb|An example showing the PhoenixDoubleNova Fractal, in a complex composite by Dan Wills]]

There has been much development using this method to develop fractal formulae in the [http://formulas.ultrafractal.com/ UltraFractal formula database], and in other fractal-rendering software. One notable family of newton style fractals is the '''[[w:Nova fractal|Nova fractal]] family''', with formulae that combine aspects of other well known fractals such as Mandelbrot, Phoenix and Halley's fractal - which is another fractal that is similar to the newton in that it implements a root finding method known as [[w:Halley's method|Halley's method]].

An entire family of fractal formulae have been derived this way and given names that reflect their parent formulae, for example:

* Nova Julia
* Nova Mandelbrot
* Phoenix Nova
* Halley Nova
* Phoenix Double Nova
* Phoenix Halley Nova

As the development of these fractal formula authors has been quite prolific, there are a great many variations and combinations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Iterated Function Systems (or IFS) is the name given to a method for calculating fractals based on a number of contractive affine transformations.

==Researchers==

Michael Barnsley did a lot of work on this type of fractal, including naming it. 

Australian mathematician John Hutchinson (who called the system a &quot;Multiple Reduction Copy Machine&quot; or MRCM), also contributed to the field.

==The Basic Method==

There are quite a few variations on this method, but the basic idea is still the same.

# Define a number of '''contractive''' affine transformations in the unit square (these are also known as &quot;Hutchinson Operators&quot;).
# Insert points at random positions into the unit square (or another initializing region of R2)
# Make a random selection from the list of transformations, and apply it to the point.
# After some run-up number of iterations, begin drawing the points into an accumulation buffer.
# Continue inserting points until the desired coverage (or quality) is achieved.
# The accumulated values will usually need a log-transform to bring them into good viewing range.
# Sorting the positions of, and resampling the points into an image using a filter kernel can give a better resulting image but is a lot more costly in terms of memory and computation.

==Affine Transformations==
Affine transforms are a geometrical construct that comprises translation, rotation, scaling and shear in 2 or more dimensions. A 2-dimensional affine transform can be conveniently stored in a 3x3 matrix for the transformation of homogeneous 2D points. These transforms are applied by simply multiplying the point's position by the matrix.

==Related Fractals==

The [[../Flame fractals|flame fractal]] is quite similar to IFS but adding non-linear transformations, not just affine ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Flame fractals are a relative of [[IFS Fractals]], that extend the concept to include more complicated transformations.

==Author==
Flames were first invented by Scott Draves, he has also authored the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seti_at_home SETI-at-home]-style flame fractal screensaver called [http://electricsheep.org/ 'Electric Sheep'].

==Apophysis==
A now open-source project to allow editing and rendering of flame fractals, with some interesting developments into 3d flame fractals with extended geometry such as surfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section an overview in the simulation of processing done by the early levels of the visual system will be given. The implementation to reproduce the action of the visual system will thereby be done with [[MATLAB]] and its toolboxes. The processing done by the early visual system was discussed in the section before and can be put together with some of the functions they perform in the following schematic overview. A good description of the image processing can be found in (Cormack 2000).

As we can see in the above overview different stages of the image processing have to be considered to simulate the response of the visual system to a stimulus.
The next section will therefore give a brief discussion in Image Processing. But first of all we will be concerned with the Simulation of Sensory Organ Components.

===Simulating Sensory Organ Components===

====Anatomical Parameters of the Eye====

The average eye has an anterior corneal radius of curvature of &lt;math&gt;r_C&lt;/math&gt; = 7.8 mm , and an aqueous refractive index of 1.336. The length of the eye is &lt;math&gt;L_E&lt;/math&gt; = 24.2 mm. The iris is approximately flat, and the edge of the iris (also called limbus) has a radius &lt;math&gt;r_L&lt;/math&gt; = 5.86 mm.

====Optics of the Eyeball====

The optics of the eyeball are characterized by its 2-D spatial impulse response function, the Point Spread Function ([[W:Point_spread_function|PSF]])

&lt;math&gt;
h(r) = 0.95\cdot \exp\left( -2.6\cdot |r|^{1.36} \right) + 0.05\cdot\exp\left( -2.4\cdot |r|^{1.74} \right) ,
&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radial distance in minutes of arc from the center of the image.

=====Practical implementation=====
Obviously, the effect on a given digital image depends on the distance of that image from your eyes. As a simple place-holder, substitute this filter with a Gaussian filter with height 30, and with a standard deviation of 1.5.

In one dimension, a Gaussian is described by

&lt;math&gt;
g(x) = a \cdot \exp \left( -\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) .
&lt;/math&gt;

====Activity of Ganglion Cells====

Ignoring the
*temporal response
*effect of wavelength (especially for the cones)
*opening of the iris
*sampling and distribution of photo receptors
*bleaching of the photo-pigment
we can approximate the response of ganglion cells with a '''Difference of Gaussians''' (DOG, Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_gaussians])

&lt;math&gt;
f(x;\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma_1\sqrt{2\pi}} \, \exp \left( -\frac{x^2}{2\sigma_1^2} \right)-\frac{1}{\sigma_2\sqrt{2\pi}} \, \exp \left( -\frac{x^2}{2\sigma_2^2} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; have a ratio of approximately 1:1.6, but vary as a function of eccentricity. For midget cells (or P-cells), the Receptive Field Size (RFS) is approximately

&lt;math&gt;RFS \approx 2 \cdot \text{Eccentricity} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the RFS is given in arcmin, and the Eccentricity in mm distance from the center of the fovea (Cormack 2000).

====Activity of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1)====

Again ignoring temporal properties, the activity of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) can be modeled with the use of Gabor filters (Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter]). A Gabor filter is a linear filter whose impulse response is defined by a harmonic function (sinusoid) multiplied by a Gaussian function. The Gaussian function causes the amplitude of the harmonic function to diminish away from the origin, but near the origin, the properties of the harmonic function dominate

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,y;\lambda,\theta,\psi,\sigma,\gamma)=\exp\left(-\frac{x'^2+\gamma^2y'^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\cos\left(2\pi\frac{x'}{\lambda}+\psi\right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;x' = x \cos\theta + y \sin\theta\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;y' = -x \sin\theta + y \cos\theta\, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the wavelength of the cosine factor, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents the orientation of the normal to the parallel stripes of a Gabor function (Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_function]), &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the phase offset, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the sigma of the Gaussian envelope and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the spatial aspect ratio, and specifies the ellipticity of the support of the Gabor function.

[[File:GaborFilter wParams.png|thumb|350px|Gabor function, with sigma = 1, theta = 1, lambda = 4, psi = 2, gamma = 1]]

This is an example implementation in [[MATLAB]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
function gb = gabor_fn(sigma,theta,lambda,psi,gamma)

  sigma_x = sigma;
  sigma_y = sigma/gamma;

  % Bounding box
  nstds = 3;
  xmax = max(abs(nstds*sigma_x*cos(theta)),abs(nstds*sigma_y*sin(theta)));
  xmax = ceil(max(1,xmax));
  ymax = max(abs(nstds*sigma_x*sin(theta)),abs(nstds*sigma_y*cos(theta)));
  ymax = ceil(max(1,ymax));
  xmin = -xmax;
  ymin = -ymax;
  [x,y] = meshgrid(xmin:xmax,ymin:ymax);

  % Rotation
  x_theta = x*cos(theta) + y*sin(theta);
  y_theta = -x*sin(theta) + y*cos(theta);

  gb = exp(-.5*(x_theta.^2/sigma_x^2+y_theta.^2/sigma_y^2)).* cos(2*pi/lambda*x_theta+psi);

end
&lt;/source&gt;

Makes 6 servings 


==Ingredients==

* Stewing lamb or beef, 500 grams 
* Okras, 750 grams 
* Potatoes, 500 grams (optional) 
* 3-4 onions 
* Fresh Lime juice, 2-3 spoons 
* Tomato paste, 3-4 spoons 
* Cooking oil 
* Salt 
* Black pepper 

==Procedure==

#Peel and thinly slice onions, then fry in oil until slightly golden. 
#Wash and cut meat into small pieces and fry in onions until color changes. 
#Add 3 glasses of hot water and bring to boil. Turn heat down and let boil slowly for about 45 minutes, adding more hot water during cooking if needed. 
#Wash okras and cut their stems only but do not cut the bases. 
#Add okras, salt, pepper and tomato paste to the meat and cook for another 10-15 minutes. Take care not to overcook the okras so that they do not become slippery. 
#Add lime juice and adjust seasoning. Cook for another 3-4 minutes. 

Khoresht Bamieh should be served with white rice. 

If desired, potatoes can also be added to Khoresht Bamieh. In that case, 500 grams of potatoes should be washed, peeled and cut into small pieces, and added in with 500 grams of okras (or slightly earlier; required cooking time depends somewhat on the size of the cut pieces).</text>

==Image Processing==
One major technical tool to understand is the way a computer handles images. We have to know how we can edit images and what techniques we have to rearrange images.

===Image Representation===

====Grayscale====
For a computer an image is nothing more than a huge amount of little squares. These squares are called &quot;pixel&quot;. In a grayscale image, each of this pixel carries a number n, often it holds
&lt;math&gt;0\leq n \leq 255&lt;/math&gt;. 
This number n, represents the exactly color of this square in the image. This means, in a grayscale image we can use 256 different grayscales, where 255 means a white spot, and 0 means the square is black.
To be honest, we could even use more than 256 different levels of gray. In the mentioned way, every pixels uses exactly 1 byte (or 8 bit) of memory to be saved. (Due to the binary system of a computer it holds: 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;=256)
If you think it is necessary to have more different gray scales in your image, this is not a problem. You just can use more memory to save the picture. But just remember, this could be a hard task for huge images. Further quite often you have the problem that your sensing device (e.g. your monitor) can not show more than this 256 different gray colors.

====Colour====
Representing a colourful image is only slightly more complicated than the grayscale picture. 
All you have to know is that the computer works with a additive colour mixture of the three main colors '''Red, Green''' and '''Blue'''. This are the so called RGB colours.

Also these images are saved by pixels. But now every pixel has to know 3 values between 0 and 256, for every Color 1 value. So know we have 256&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;= 16,777,216 different colours which can be represented. Similar to the grayscale images also here holds, that no color means black, and having all color means white. That means, the colour (0,0,0) is black, whereas (0,0,255) means blue and (255,255,255) is white.

===Image Filtering===

====1D Filter====
In many technical applications, we find some primitive basis in which we easily can describe features. In 1 dimensional cases filters are not a big deal, therefore we can use this filters for changing images. The so called &quot;Savitzky- Golay Filter&quot; allows to smooth incoming signals. The filter was described in 1964 by Abraham Savitzky and Marcel J. E. Golay. It is a impulse-respond filter (IR).

For better understanding, lets look at a example. In 1d we usually deal with vectors. One such given vector, we call x and it holds: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) \; with \; n \; \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
Our purpose is to smooth that vector x. To do so all we need is another vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf(w) = (w_1,w_2,\dots,w_m) \; with \; n&gt;m \; \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, this vector we call a weight vector.

With &lt;math&gt;y(k)=\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^m w(i)x(k-m+i)&lt;/math&gt; we now have a smoothed vector y. This vector is smoother than the vector before, because we only save the average over a few entries in the vector. These means the newly found vectorentries, depends on some entries right left and right of the entry to smooth.
One major drawback of this approach is, the newly found vector y only has n-m entries instead of n as the original vector x.

Drawing this new vector would lead to the same function as before, just with less amplitude. So no data is lost, but we have less fluctuation.

====2D Filter====

Going from the 1d case to the 2d case is done by simply make out of vectors matrices. As already mentioned, a gray-level image is for a computer or for a softwaretool as MATLAB nothing more, than a huge matrix filled with natural numbers, often between 0 and 255.

The weight vector is now a weight-matrix. But still we use the filter by adding up different matrix-element-multiplications.
&lt;math&gt;y(n,m)=\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^l w_{ij}\times x(n-1+i,m-1+j)&lt;/math&gt;

===Dilation and Erosion===

For linear filters as seen before, it holds that they are [[W:Commutativity|commutativ]]. Cite from wikipedia: &quot;One says that x commutes with y under ∗ if:
:&lt;math&gt; x * y = y * x \,&lt;/math&gt;&quot;
In other words, it does not matter how many and in which sequence different linear filters you use. E.g. if a Savitzky-Golay filter is applied to some date, and then a second Savitzky-Golay filter for calculationg the first derivative, the result is the same if the sequence of filters is reversed.
It even holds, that there would have been '''one''' filter, which does the same as the '''two''' applied.

In contrast '''morphological operations''' on an image are non-linear operations and the final result depends on the sequence.
If we think of any image, it is defined by pixels with values x&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;. Further this image is assumed to be a black-and-white image, so we have 
:&lt;math&gt; x_{ij}= 0\;or\;1, \forall i,j &lt;/math&gt;
To define a morphological operation we have to set a '''structural element''' SE. As example, a 3x3-Matrix as a part of the image.

The definition of '''erosion''' E says:
:&lt;math&gt;E(M)=\left\{ \begin{align}
        &amp; 0,\; if \sum_{i,j=0}^3 (se)_{ij} &lt;9 \\
        &amp; 1,\; else 
       \end{align}
       \right. \; \; ,with\; (se)_{ij},M \in SE  
&lt;/math&gt;.
So in words, if '''any''' of the pixels in the structural element M has value 0, the erosion sets the value of M, a specific pixel in M, to zero. Otherwise E(M)=1

And for the '''dilation''' D it holds, if '''any''' value in SE is 1, the dilation of M, D(M), is set to 1.
:&lt;math&gt;D(M)=\left\{ \begin{align}
        &amp; 1,\; if \sum_{i,j=0}^3 (se)_{ij} &gt;=1 \\
        &amp; 0,\; else 
       \end{align}
       \right. \; \; ,with\; (se)_{ij},M \in SE  
&lt;/math&gt;.


====Compositions of Dilation and Erosion: Opening and Closing of Images====

There are two compositions of dilation and erosion. One called '''opening''' the other called '''closing'''.
It holds:
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     opening &amp; = &amp; dilation \circ erosion \\
     closing &amp; = &amp; erosion \circ dilation 
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Special:PrefixIndex/Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery|This book]] has been blanked by the principle author, [[User:Recovery Psychology]]. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:31, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

*: Not really. I guess the timing, relative to the [[A Textbook on Recovery Psychology]] saga could help shed some light on that. But right now, the weather is too good, and I should be outside... --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:42, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

&lt;del&gt;I asked regarding the deletion of [[A Textbook on Recovery Psychology]] if the content taken from [[Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery]] could be rolled back since Psychiatric Rehabilitation is an already existing subject; the answer I got was not very clear.  The field of Psychiatric Rehabilitation (Psychosocial Rehabilitation) is actual a sub-category of social work or behavioral health or rehabilitation.  I felt it would fit in &quot;recovery psychology&quot; as much as the social work content (which is 90%...) of a psychology of developmental disability textbooks.  As a critic of textbooks; I find that the psychology part of such textbooks (psychology of developmental disability) or that 10% is not really psychology, but humanistic philosophy, history, politics and the statements which declare: what the word disability means.  The material in this text [[Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Recovery]] was absolutely boring and dull; but factual...It was the one thing I can assert I am credentialed in. (if you even care about expertise; If we were to discuss expertise)  It would be far more redeemable by the standards that [[A Textbook on Recovery Psychology]] was decided to be deleted on.--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 07:14, 21 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;ins&gt;Delete it...never mind--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 01:54, 4 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/ins&gt;

: Sorry, but I don't understand the bit above. Anyone able to interpret it? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:52, 30 April 2009 (UTC)
:: I don't understand it fully either. To move things along though: This book seems to meet the criteria for speedy deletion, since blanking the page, leaving &quot;delete&quot; in the edit summary, and supporting the delete here qualifies as a request by the original author where there are no other contributors. Do you have any reasons why Wikibooks should not honor this request, since you brought it up here rather then speeding deleting it? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:07, 1 June 2009 (UTC)
:::Yes, and given the decision on the other closely-related book by the same author...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Other Visual Implants ==
In addition to the stimulation of the retina, also other elements of the visual system can be stimulated

=== Stimulation of the Optic Nerve ===
With cuff-electrodes, typically with only a few segments.

''Advantages:''
* Little trauma to the eye.
''Challenges:''
* Not very specific.

=== Cortical Implants ===
[[Image:ImplantSawan.JPG‎|thumb|alt=Visual cortical implant designed by Mohamad Sawan|The Visual Cortical Implant ]][http://www.polymtl.ca/recherche/rc/en/professeurs/details.php?NoProf=108/ Dr. Mohamad Sawan], Professor and Researcher at [http://www.polystim.ca/ Polystim neurotechnologies Laboratory] at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, has been working on a visual prosthesis to be implanted into the human cortex. The basic principle of Dr. Sawan’s technology consists in stimulating the visual cortex by implanting a silicium microchip on a network of electrodes made of biocompatible materials and in which each electrode injects a stimulating electrical current in order to provoke a series of luminous points to appear (an array of pixels) in the field of vision of the sightless person. This system is composed of two distinct parts: the implant and an external controller. The implant lodged in the visual cortex wirelessly receives dedicated data and energy from the external controller. This implantable part contains all the circuits necessary to generate the electrical stimuli and to oversee the changing microelectrode/biological tissue interface. On the other hand, the battery-operated outer control comprises a micro-camera which captures the image as well as a processor and a command generator which process the imaging data to select and translate the captured images and to generate and manage the electrical stimulation process and oversee the implant. The external controller and the implant exchange data in both directions by a powerful transcutaneous radio frequency (RF) link. The implant is powered the same way. (Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_prosthesis])

''Advantages:''
* Much larger area for stimulation: 2° radius of the central retinal visual field correspond to 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the retina, but to 2100 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the visual cortex.
''Challenges:''
* Implantation is more invasive.
* Parts of the visual field lie in a sulcus and are very hard to reach.
* Stimulation can trigger seizures.

|description =Buttercups are a bright yellow flower with five petals.  The flowers usually grow at the top of a long stem.  The leaf shape depends on the species, but they usually have wavy edges that zig and zag deeply back and forth.
There are nearly a hundred species of Buttercups growing in the United States, and four hundred species world-wide.  All Buttercups are poisonous when eaten fresh by cattle, horses, and other livestock, but their acrid taste and the blistering of the mouth caused by their poison means they are usually left uneaten. 
|facts = In Pacific Northwest of the United States the buttercup is called &quot;Coyote’s eyes&quot;. In the the Nez Perce Indian legend, Coyote was tossing his eyes up in the air and catching them again when Eagle snatched them. Unable to see, Coyote made eyes from the buttercup.

It would be good to decide on some editing policy beforehand. I propose at least the following guidelines:

* single-slash flat namespace for subpages. In other words, '''Artificial Intelligence/Introduction to Neural Networks'''
* Code fragments in pseudocode. We could set up an appendix with example code in C/Lisp/Prolog, but basic code fragments in the chapters should be pseudocode.

|description =Celandine is a bushy plant with yellow flowers.  Each flower has four petals, each about a half inch long (making the whole flower about one inch across).  The leaves look a little bit like an oak leaf, with scalloped edges.  It makes a yellow sap that can stain the hands and clothes, so be careful if you handle it.  Sometimes the sap will cause a skin rash too.  The plant has many medicinal uses.
|facts = Europeans brought Celandine with them to North America so they could use it to treat warts.  It is still used for that in Russia today.

|description =Saint John's Wort is a plant that grows about three feet high.  It has yellow flowers with five petals, and lots and lots of stamens ('''stay'''-mins) which are like little threads coming out of the center of the flower.  The leaves are very interesting too, and can help you be absolutely sure that the plant really is Saint John's Wort.  Each leaf has several tiny see-through dots on it. If you pluck a leaf and hold it up to the light, you should be able to see them.  The dots around the edges sometimes turn black.  

The scientific name ''Hypericum'' means &quot;over picture&quot;, because people used to pick the plant and hang it ''over'' the ''picture'' of a saint to ward off evil.  The other part of its name, ''perfoliatum&quot; means ''leaf with holes'' (remember that the holes along the edge of a piece of paper are called ''perforations'', and leaves are also called ''foliage'').

Now days, people use Saint John's Wort to treat depression (deep sadness).  
|facts = People used to harvest Saint John's Wort on Saint John's Day, which is June 24.  ''Wort'' is a very old word that means ''plant''.

A Windows application written in C# consists of ''control'' objects that are all derived from the &lt;code&gt;System.Windows.Forms.Control&lt;/code&gt; class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;code&gt;System.Windows.Form&lt;/code&gt; class is the key graphical building block of Windows applications. It provides the visual frame that holds buttons, menus, icons, and title bars together.  Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual C# and SharpDevelop can help create graphical applications, but it is important to know how to do so manually:  

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|using}} System.Windows.Forms;
 {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|class}} ExampleForm : Form    // inherits from System.Windows.Forms.Form
 {
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|static}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Main()
    {
        ExampleForm wikibooksForm = new ExampleForm();
        wikibooksForm.Text = &quot;I Love Wikibooks&quot;;// specify title of the form
        wikibooksForm.Width = 400;              // width of the window in pixels
        wikibooksForm.Height = 300;             // height in pixels
        Application.Run(wikibooksForm);         // display the form
    }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

The example above creates a simple Window with the text &quot;I Love Wikibooks&quot; in the title bar.  Custom form classes like the example above inherit from the &lt;code&gt;System.Windows.Forms.Form&lt;/code&gt; class.  Setting any of the properties &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Width&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Height&lt;/code&gt; is optional.  Your program will compile and run successfully if you comment these lines out, but they allow us to add extra control to our form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to my page.

I am now trying to build up the [[C_Sharp_Programming/The_.NET_Framework/Windows_Forms|Windows Forms]] section of the C# programming book. Generally, I love the topic of Windows programming and hope to contribute to writing some brilliant prose :) on the matter.

In the future I also hope to expand on the manuals for PHP and ASP.net, but unfortunately I know a lot less about them. BTW imho it's a pity that even for widely known programming environments the level of editor enthusiasm and consequently the amount of work done is a lot smaller than what is found in the mainstream Wikipedia. It sure would have helped if some of the sort of passion that went into documenting [[w:Atlas Shrugged]] and [[w:Star Trek]] could have also contributed to documenting popular programming frameworks :) [[User:Watcher|Watcher]] ([[User talk:Watcher|talk]]) 12:25, 20 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most strains of bees are super-hard-working, but they are also sensible and will take their food from easier sources than they usually favour if it is up to standard. This includes some forms of human food and sometimes brings them into conflict with us. But, some bees take this &quot;alternative food source&quot; thing to extremes and even rob food, i.e. honey and pollen etc. from neighbouring hives. These hives will usually defend their stocks vigorously, but not always successfully. It has also been noted that the different species of honey bees differ greatly in their tendencies to rob and their ability to defend the hive.

Here are tips for cooking a good steak.

== Cuts ==
The tenderest cuts come from the short loin and rib primal. Good steaks to start out with are strip steaks, top sirloins, T-bones, Porterhouses, and ribeyes. Tenderloin cuts are pretty tender, but if you overcook them they can be dry.

== Seasoning ==
Keep it simple. I like just salt and pepper, or a nice rub, but you can use anything that won't overpower the meat.

Rub the steak with a little olive oil and sprinkle on your seasoning.

== Cooking ==
Grilling, broiling, and pan roasting are classics, but feel free to use any dry heat method you want, such as sauteing. Also, at at least one point, you'll want to use enough heat to brown it. That makes all the difference.

== Slicing ==
Ever just sliced a steak as is and it turns out to be so tough you can't eat it? I admit that this has happened to me. But now I know how to keep this from happening. You know those lines on the meat? Slicing as thin as you can at a 45 degree angle will keep those short, which will mean tenderness. The only exceptions are tenderloin, which is so tender already, and cuts from the flank like skirt and flank which have a different grain structure.

== Marinating ==
Marinating can do a lot of things, but I'll tell you what it won't do. It won't ''tenderize''. Commercial tenderizers use enzymes like papain, not acids! Okay, we got that over with. Now, when you pick a steak for marination, pick a steak with high surface to mass ratio, like inside skirt. Try to balance your marinade with salt, acidity, spicy, herby (if that's a word), and flavor. You're probably thinking, &quot;What's the difference between a brine and a marinade?&quot; One of the differences is that most marinades contain acids and not the huge amounts of salt like in a brine.

I hope you learned a lot about good steak.</text>

== Basics == 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
?Arithmetic
?Special
&lt;/source&gt;

== Linear Algebra ==

=== Vectors ===

==== The inner product ====

The inner product is also called the ''dot product'' or the ''scalar product''. It is the sum of the item-by-item product.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; u &lt;- rep(3,3)
&gt; v &lt;- 1:3
&gt; u%*%v # the inner product
     [,1]
[1,]   18
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The outer product ====


The outer product is also called the ''cross product'' or the ''vector product''. It is a matrix resulting from the product of the elements of the two vectors.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; v &lt;- matrix(1:3,1,3)
&gt; u &lt;- matrix(1:3,3,1)
&gt; u%*%v
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    2    4    6
[3,]    3    6    9
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Matrix Algebra ===

If you want to create a new matrix, one way is to use the &lt;tt&gt;matrix()&lt;/tt&gt; function. You have to enter a vector of data, the number of rows and/or columns and finally you can specify if you want R to read your vector by row or by column (the default option) with &lt;tt&gt;byrow&lt;/tt&gt;. You can also combine vectors using &lt;tt&gt;cbind()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;rbind()&lt;/tt&gt;. The dimension of a matrix can be obtained using the &lt;tt&gt;dim()&lt;/tt&gt; function or alternatively &lt;tt&gt;nrow()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ncol()&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; matrix(data = NA, nrow = 5, ncol = 5, byrow = T)
&gt; matrix(data = 1:15, nrow = 5, ncol = 5, byrow = T)
&gt; v1 &lt;- 1:5
&gt; v2 &lt;- 5:1
&gt; cbind(v1,v2)
&gt; rbind(v1,v2)
&gt; dim(X)
&gt; nrow(X)
&gt; ncol(X)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Some special matrix ===

The identity matrix has ones on the diagonal and zeros outside the diagonal. 
* &lt;tt&gt;eye()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''matlab''')
* &lt;tt&gt;diag(1,nrow=10,ncol=10)&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;diag(rep(1,10))&lt;/tt&gt;

J matrix is full of ones
* &lt;tt&gt;ones()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''matlab''')

A matrix full of zeros 
* &lt;tt&gt;zeros()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''matlab''')
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(matlab)
&gt; eye(3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0
[3,]    0    0    1
&gt; ones(3)

[1,]    0    0    0
[2,]    0    0    0

[1,]    1    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0
[3,]    0    0    1
&lt;/source&gt;

Upper triangular

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; round(upper.tri(matrix(1, n, n))) 

for n=3
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    0    1    1
[2,]    0    0    1
[3,]    0    0    0

If you also need the diagonal of one's 

&gt; round(upper.tri(matrix(1, 3, 3), diag = TRUE))

      [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    1    1
[2,]    0    1    1
[3,]    0    0    1

&lt;/source&gt;

Lower triangular

Same as upper triangular but using lower.tri instead


* create an Hilbert matrix using &lt;tt&gt;hilbert()&lt;/tt&gt; (fUtilities).

=== Matrix calculations ===


* compute a [[w:Matrix multiplication|matrix multiplication]] &lt;tt&gt;X%*%Y&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;

&gt; b &lt;- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2, c(1, 2, 3, 4))
&gt; a &lt;- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2, c(1, 0, 0, -1))
&gt; a
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    0
[2,]    0   -1
&gt; b
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
&gt; a%*%b
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]   -2   -4
&gt; b%*%a
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1   -3
[2,]    2   -4

&lt;/source&gt;

* compute the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product Kronecker] product using &lt;tt&gt;%x%&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;kron()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''fUtilities''').

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; M &lt;- matrix(rep(2,4),nrow = 2) 
&gt; M
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    2
[2,]    2    2
&gt; I &lt;- eye(2) 
&gt; I
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    0
[2,]    0    1
&gt; I %x% M 
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    2    2    0    0
[2,]    2    2    0    0
[3,]    0    0    2    2
[4,]    0    0    2    2
&gt; library(fUtilities)
&gt; kron(I,M)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    2    2    0    0
[2,]    2    2    0    0
[3,]    0    0    2    2
[4,]    0    0    2    2
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Matrix transposition ===

* Transpose the matrix
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; t(M)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    0    1
[2,]    0    1    2

&lt;/source&gt;

=== The trace and determinant of a matrix ===

* compute the trace of a matrix using &lt;tt&gt;tr()&lt;/tt&gt; (fUtilities)
* returns the rank of a matrix using &lt;tt&gt;rk()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''fBasics:''')

=== Matrix inversion ===

* Invert a matrix using &lt;tt&gt;solve()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;inv()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''fUtilities'''). We can also compute the generalized inverse using &lt;tt&gt;ginv()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''MASS''' package.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; M &lt;- cbind(c(1,0,1),c(0,1,2),c(0,0,1))
&gt; solve(M)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]

* See also the '''matrix''', '''matlab''', '''matrixcalc''', '''matrixStats''' packages.

== Analysis == 

=== Logarithm and Exponents ===

We have the power function &lt;tt&gt;10^3&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt; 10**3 &lt;/tt&gt;, the logarithm and the exponential &lt;tt&gt;log(2.71)&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;log10(10)&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;exp(1)&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; 10^3 # exponent
[1] 1000
&gt; 10**3 # exponent
[1] 1000
&gt; exp(1) # exponential
[1] 2.718282
&gt; log(2.71) # natural logarithm
[1] 0.9969486
&gt; log10(1000) # base 10 logarithm
[1] 3
&gt; log(1000,base = 10) # base 10 logarithm
[1] 3
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Polynomial equations ===

To solve &lt;math&gt; a x^k + bx^{k-1} +\cdots+ n=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a,b,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; are given numbers, use the command

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; polyroot(c(n,...,b,a))
&lt;/source&gt;

So, for example, to calculate the roots of the equation &lt;math&gt; 2x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; one would do as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; polyroot(c(-3,-5,2))
 [1] -0.5+0i  3.0-0i
&lt;/source&gt;

and the solution can be read to be &lt;math&gt;x_1 = -0.5 \land x_2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;.

See also '''polynom''' and '''multipol''' packages

=== Derivatives ===

==== Symbolic calculations ====

R can give the derivative of an ''expression''. You need to convert your function as an expression using the &lt;tt&gt;expression()&lt;/tt&gt; function. Otherwise you get an error message.

Here are some examples : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; D(expression(x^n),&quot;x&quot;)
x^(n - 1) * n
&gt; D(expression(exp(a*x)),&quot;x&quot;)
exp(a * x) * a
&gt; D(expression(1/x),&quot;x&quot;)
-(1/x^2)
&gt; D(expression(x^3),&quot;x&quot;)
3 * x^2
&gt; D(expression(pnorm(x)),&quot;x&quot;)
dnorm(x)
&gt; D(expression(dnorm(x)),&quot;x&quot;)
-(x * dnorm(x))
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Numerical approximation ====

* '''numDeriv''' package

=== Integration ===  

R can perform one dimensional integration. For example we can integrate over the density of the normal distribution between &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; integrate(dnorm,-Inf,Inf)
1 with absolute error &lt; 9.4e-05
&gt; integrate(dnorm,-1.96,1.96)
0.9500042 with absolute error &lt; 1.0e-11
&gt; integrate(dnorm,-1.64,1.64)
0.8989948 with absolute error &lt; 6.8e-14
# we can also store the result in an object
&gt; ci90 &lt;- integrate(dnorm,-1.64,1.64)
&gt; ci90$value
[1] 0.8989948
&gt; integrate(dnorm,-1.64,1.64)$value
[1] 0.8989948
&lt;/source&gt;

see the adapt package for multivariate integration.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(adapt)
&gt; ?adapt
&gt; ir2pi &lt;- 1/sqrt(2*pi)
&gt; fred &lt;- function(z) { ir2pi^length(z) * exp(-0.5 * sum(z * z))}
&gt; 
&gt; adapt(2, lo = c(-5,-5), up = c(5,5), functn = fred)

&lt;/source&gt;

* See also &lt;tt&gt;integrate.gh()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''ecoreg''' package.

== Arithmetics ==

=== The factorial function ===

&lt;tt&gt;factorial&lt;/tt&gt; returns the factorial of an integer. This can also be computed using the &lt;tt&gt;prod()&lt;/tt&gt; (product) applied to the vector of integers between 1 and the number of interest. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; factorial(3)
[1] 6
&gt; prod(1:3)
[1] 6
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that by convention &lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;factorial()&lt;/tt&gt; returns 1 in 0. This is not the case with the &lt;tt&gt;prod()&lt;/tt&gt; functions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; factorial(0)
[1] 1
&gt; prod(0)
[1] 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Factorial numbers can be very large and cannot be computed for high values. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; factorial(170)

&lt;/source&gt;

=== The modulo function and euclidian division ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; 5%%2

&gt;5%/%2

&lt;/source&gt;

Note that for some unknown reason, there is a problem with non integer numbers and euclidian divisions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; .5%/%.1 # we get 4 instead of 5
[1] 4

===Introduction===
South Carolina is not a stranger to using technology or experimenting with laptops in the classroom.  In 1997 South Carolina provided 300 middle school students in Beauford County with laptop computers for use in the classroom.  The equipment and software was provided by Microsoft and Toshiba.  In January 1998 an article about their experience was published in ''Learning and Leading with Technology''.  Although the article does not report specific statistical results it appears as though the laptops were received very enthusiastically by teachers and students.  The focus on their usage appears to have been in expediting the writing process from the brainstorming stages to the final product.  It is also interesting to note that the role of the teacher seemed to change in the classrooms participating in the program.  The author reports &quot;''Teachers' roles in technology-rich classrooms can be flexible and interactive - and change constantly.  Teachers may start out acting solely as instructors, giving students the required information for their assignments.  But then they most quickly switch to other roles, such as facilitators, passive managers and active managers''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LLT&quot;&gt;Gottfried, J., &amp; McFeely, M.G. (1997-1998, December/January) Learning all over the place. Learning and Leading With Technology, 25, 6-17.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Fast forward a decade.  In 2007, a five million dollar state-funded program provided ninth-grade students at six high schools with laptops.  The goals of the program included improving student achievement and training students for a competitive workplace in which most jobs require working with technology&lt;ref name=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;South Carolina Pilots iAm Laptop Program (2007). Retrieved June 20, 2009, from http://www.k12blueprint.com/k12/blueprint/story_south_carolina_pilots_iam_laptop_program.php&lt;/ref&gt;.  In addition South Carolina hoped that test scores, grades and graduation rates would improve as well.  The students in the program kept their laptops throughout their high school years&lt;ref name=&quot;techReport&quot;&gt;

In South Carolina's 2008 K-12 Technology Initiative progress report they explain that currently two classes have received laptops as part of this pilot but additional funding is needed to continue the program.  They describe the use of an independent company hired to evaluate this initiative.  The evaluation will look at grades, teacher’s use of technology and district costs for technology and professional services&lt;ref name=&quot;techReport&quot;&gt;

The 2008 report also shows that South Carolina's progress in providing computer access to students has steadily dropped from 1999 to 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;techReport&quot;&gt;
South Carolina K-12 Technology Initiative 2008 Progress Report (2008).  Retrieved June 20, 2009 from http://www.sck12techinit.org/documents/2008AnnualReportFORWEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, in 2008 a new initiative was undertaken.  South Carolina launched a “one laptop per child pilot” distributing 500 XO Learning Laptops to elementary school students.  From there, the laptop program has grown to distributing 2,300 laptops in fourteen schools across the state&lt;ref name=&quot;oneLaptop&quot;&gt;One XO Learning Laptop Per South Carolinian School Child (5/7/2009). Retrieved June 20, 2009 from http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/usa/olpc_south_carolina_school_child.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the Spring of 2009 they secured a $500,000 donation from Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield .  They plan to order five thousand more laptops over the Fall of 2009 and possibly up to 50,000 laptops by the Spring of 2012&lt;ref name=&quot;oneLaptop&quot;&gt;One XO Learning Laptop Per South Carolinian School Child (5/7/2009). Retrieved June 20, 2009 from http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/usa/olpc_south_carolina_school_child.html&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not reported  where further funding will come from for the project expansion.

===2008 Initiative - Project Background===
The XO laptop program got off the ground in South Carolina when a Charleston technology entrepreneur was inspired by the laptops he saw during a 2005 United Nations World Summit on Information Society hosted in Tunisia.  In 2007 the State of South Carolina teamed up with a local non-profit organization (The Palmetto Project) to begin their initial pilot.  Just two short years later, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield joined their partnership with their half million dollar donation.  Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield is hoping that this donation will help to better train the next generation of the South Carolina workforce to have a strong knowledge of technology&lt;ref name=&quot;bcbs&quot;&gt;

===About the Technology===

[[File:XO-Beta1-mikemcgregor-2.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]
The &quot;XO Laptops&quot; were developed by One Laptop per Child which is a non-profit organization.  Their goal in developing this spill-proof and drop-proof laptop was to get technology into the hands of children all over the world.  This equipment allows children to connect to modern education and to each other&lt;ref name=&quot;laptopsc&quot;&gt;One Laptop per Child/SC pilot project gives personal computers to state’s youngest students (5/12/2008) Retrieved June 20, 2009 from http://laptopsc.org/?p=17&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Early Results===
Despite the fact that the laptop program is in a very early stage, South Carolina has begun to track results which look very positive.  After the initial pilot of 500 XO laptops distributed to Marion School District Seven they were used by students in the classroom and at home during the 2008-2009 school year.  During this time the teaching staff was given support by a district level technology coach and a technology coordinator.  At the end of the 2008-2009 school year the students took South Carolina's Technology Proficiency Test&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.  A staff member of the South Carolina Department of Education took the time to provide some of their successes and surprises as they analyzed their evaluation results from the initial pilot.  The following results were submitted via email correspondence.

===Successes===
*'''Student Enthusiasm'''
**&quot;Teachers reported that 86% of students exhibited enthusiasm at the thought of and when actually using the XO Laptop&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;
*'''Increased Usage'''
**&quot;In school year 2007-2008 teachers reported they had from three to 10 computers in the classroom.  In school year 2008-2009 every student in the classroom had a laptop.  During the school year 2008-2009 student use of computers was estimated by teachers to be 50% more than the previous year &lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;
*'''Academic Achievement'''
**&quot;Based on teacher professional opinion, 75% saw some to a substantial gain in academic achievement that can be contributed to the use of the XO&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;
*'''Social Interaction'''
**&quot;Based on teacher professional opinion, 68% saw some to a substantial gain in student social interaction in the classroom that can be contributed to the use of the XO&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;


In addition, teachers saw improvements in motivation and test results show substantial gains in student technology skills&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Surprises===
When asked about the practices in the pilot which failed to produce the expected results, the South Carolina staff member indicated that while the laptops were used for science, social studies, math and music they were largely used for research.  South Carolina plans to brainstorm and develop other ways to use the XO laptops in the classroom&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;M. Ruzga (personal communication, June 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Conclusion===
Early success, community support and corporate participation are excellent early indicators that the South Carolina one-to-one laptop program will be a program to watch and learn from!

== Ingredients ==
* 1 center cut beef tenderloin roast
* Salt and black pepper
* Extra virgin olive oil for serving
* Lemon wedges for serving
* Shaved Parmiggiano-Reggiano cheese
* Basil chiffonade for serving

== Procedure ==
#Cover tightly with plastic wrap then freeze the meat for up to two hours to help slicing (no more than that or else it'll be mushy).
#Slice thinly and remove plastic wrap.
#Place five slices in a rough circle and put 1 in the center. Lift to a lightly water-spritzed sheet of plastic wrap. Spritz another sheet with water and place on top. Place a pie pan on top and lightly pound with a food can.
#Remove and sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper. Serve with extra-virgin olive oil, lemon wedges, shaved Parmiggiano-Reggiano cheese, and basil chiffonade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Politics?==
Politics is the process by which groups of people make decisions. The term is generally applied to behaviour within [[w:civil governments|civil governments]], but politics has been observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. It consists of social relations involving authority or power, the regulation of political units, and the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply social policy.

==Power, Authority, and Violence==

[[File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|right|thumb|150 px| Barack Obama, President of the United States, derives his authority from a rational-legal system of laws outlined in a formal document, the Constitution of the United States of America.]]

===Power===
Political power is a type of power held by a group in a society which allows that group to administrate the distribution of public resources, including labour, and wealth. Political powers are not limited to heads of states, however the extent to which a person or group such as an insurgency, terrorist group, or multinational corporation possesses such power relates to the amount of societal influence they can wield, formally or informally.  Power, then, is often defined as the ability to influence the behavior of others with or without resistance.

[[File:King Abdullah bin Abdul al-Saud Jan2007.jpg|right|thumb|150 px| King Abdullah bin Abdul al-Saud, King of Saudi Arabia, derived his authority from tradition.]]

===Authority===
In government, authority is often used interchangeably with the term &quot;power&quot;. However, their meanings differ. Authority refers to a claim of legitimacy, the justification and right to exercise power. For example, while a mob has the power to punish a criminal, for example by lynching, people who believe in the rule of law consider that only a court of law to has the authority to order capital punishment.

[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|right|thumb|150 px| Joseph Smith, Jr., founder of Mormonism, derived his authority from his charisma.]]

Max Weber identified and distinguished three types of legitimate authority.
*The first type discussed by Weber is '''Rational-legal''' authority. It is that form of authority which depends for its legitimacy on formal rules and established laws of the state, which are usually written down and are often very complex. The power of the rational legal authority is mentioned in a document like a constitution or articles of incorporation. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials, like the [[w:President of the United States|President of the United States]] are good examples of this form of authority.
*The second type of authority is '''Traditional''' authority, which derives from long-established customs, habits and social structures. When power passes from one generation to another, then it is known as traditional authority. The right of hereditary [[w:monarchy|monarchs]] to rule like the [[w:King_of_Saudi_Arabia|King of Saudi Arabia]] is an example. 
*The third form of authority is '''Charismatic''' authority. Here, the [[w:charisma|charisma]] of the individual or the leader plays an important role. Charismatic authority is that authority which is derived from a gift of grace, the power of one's personality, or when the leader claims that his authority is derived from a &quot;higher power&quot; (e.g. God) that is superior to both the validity of traditional and rational-legal authority. Followers accept this and are willing to follow this higher or inspired authority in the place of the authority that they have hitherto been following. Clear examples of charismatic leaders are often seen in the founders of religious groups.  [[w:Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith Jr.]], the founder of [[w:The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormons)]] was considered charismatic. Another person who used his charisma to gather followers, ultimately for rather nefarious purposes, was [[w:Jeffrey Lundgren|Jeffrey Lundgren]].

===Violence===
In most modern nation-states, the government has authority, which gives it power. Intriguingly, the fact that the government has authority gives it the right to use power to force citizens to do what the government deems appropriate.  In other words, the government has the right, based on its authority, to force people to behave in certain ways.  Refusal to follow the dictates of the government can result in the government using violence to coerce individuals into compliance.

At the same time, the fact that the government of a country has the right to use violence, theoretically a near-exclusive right (others can use violence only when officially sanctioned, such as when one purchases a hunting license or if one belongs to a government sanctioned fighting league like the [[w:Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]]), reinforces the government's claim to authority.  Thus, you have something of a paradox: Do governments have authority if they do not have the right to use violence?  And, do governments derive their authority from their right to use violence?  Another way to think about this quirk of politics is to ask yourself: Would you follow the law if there were no repercussions to your behavior.  While you may for other reasons (e.g., a Hobbesian [[w:Social_contract|social contract]]), ultimately it is the threat of the legitimate use of violence that makes government authority compelling.

==Types of Governments==
In addition to there existing various legitimate means of holding power, there are a variety of forms of government.

===Monarchy===

[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch of the United Kingdom.]]

A [[w:Monarchy|monarchy]] is a form of government in which supreme power is absolutely or nominally lodged with an individual, who is the head of state, often for life or until abdication. The person who heads a monarchy is called a monarch. It was a common form of government in the world during the ancient and [[w:medieval|medieval]] times. There is no clear definition of monarchy. Holding unlimited political power in the state is not the defining characteristic, as many constitutional monarchies such as the [[w:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[w:Thailand|Thailand]] are considered monarchies yet their monarchs have limited political power. Hereditary rule is often a common characteristic, but elective monarchies are also considered monarchies (e.g., [[w:The Pope|The Pope]]) and some states have hereditary rulers, but are considered republics (e.g., the [[w:Dutch Republic|Dutch Republic]]). Currently, 44 nations in the world have monarchs as heads of state, 16 of which are [[w:Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] realms that recognise the monarch of the United Kingdom as their head of state.

===Democracy===
[[w:Democracy|Democracy]] is a form of government in which the right to govern or sovereignty is held by the majority of citizens within a country or a state.  In political theory, democracy describes a small number of related forms of government and also a political philosophy. Even though there is no universally accepted definition of 'democracy', there are two principles that any definition of democracy includes. The first principle is that all members of the society (citizens) have equal access to power and the second that all members (citizens) enjoy universally recognized freedoms and liberties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahl2003&quot;&gt;R. Alan Dahl, I. Shapiro, J. A. Cheibub, The Democracy Sourcebook, MIT Press 2003, ISBN 0262541475&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedoms for their citizens than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaus2004&quot;&gt;G. F. Gaus, C. Kukathas, Handbook of Political Theory, SAGE, 2004, p. 143-145, ISBN 0761967877&lt;/ref&gt; However, if any democracy is not carefully legislated to avoid an uneven distribution of political power with balances, such as the separation of powers, then a branch of the system of rule could accumulate power and become harmful to the democracy itself. The &quot;majority rule&quot; is often described as a characteristic feature of democracy, but without responsible government it is possible for the rights of a minority to be abused by the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. An essential process in representative democracies are competitive elections, that are fair both substantively and procedurally. Furthermore, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech and freedom of the press are essential so that citizens are informed and able to vote in their personal interests.

===Totalitarianism===
Totalitarianism (or totalitarian rule) is a political system that strives to regulate nearly every aspect of public and private life. Totalitarian regimes or movements maintain themselves in political power by means of an official all-embracing ideology and propaganda disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that controls the state, personality cults, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of free discussion and criticism, the use of mass surveillance, and widespread use of state terrorism.

===Oligarchy===
An [[w:Oligarchy|oligarchy]] is a form of government in which power effectively rests with a small elite segment of society distinguished by royalty, wealth, family, military or religious hegemony. Such states are often controlled by politically powerful families whose children are heavily conditioned and mentored to be heirs of the power of the oligarchy. Oligarchies have been tyrannical throughout history, being completely reliant on public servitude to exist.

[[Image:Communist countries.PNG|300px|thumb|right|Map of countries that declared themselves or were declared to be socialist states under the Marxist-Leninist or Maoist definition at some point in their history. The map uses present-day borders. Note that not all of these countries were Marxist-Leninist or Maoist at the same time.]]

===Communist State===
A Communist state is a state with a form of government characterized by single-party rule of a Communist party and a professed allegiance to an ideology of [[w:Communism|communism]] as the guiding principle of the state. Communist states may have several legal political parties, but the Communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government, often by statute or under the constitution. Consequently, the institutions of the state and of the Communist party become intimately entwined, such as in the development of parallel institutions.

While almost all claim lineage to Marxist thought, there are many varieties of Communist states, with indigenous adaptions. For Marxist-Leninists, the state and the Communist Party claim to act in accordance with the wishes of the industrial working class; for Maoists, the state and party claim to act in accordance to the peasantry. Under Deng Xiaoping, the People's Republic of China proclaimed a policy of &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics.&quot; In most Communist states, governments assert that they represent the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat.

===Theocracy===
[[w:Theocracy|Theocracy]] is a form of government in which a god or deity is recognized as the state's supreme civil ruler, or in a broader sense, a form of government in which a state is governed by immediate divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided. Theocratic governments enact theonomic laws. Theocracy should be distinguished from other secular forms of government that have a state religion, or are merely influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held &quot;By the Grace of God&quot;. Theocratic tendencies have been found in several religious traditions including Judaism, Islam, Confucianism, Hinduism, and among Christianity: Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and Mormonism. Historical examples of Christian theocracies are the Byzantine Empire (A.D. 330-1453) and the Carolingian Empire (A.D. 800-888).

===Types of Government Thought Question===
While there are many more [[w:Forms_of_government|types of government]], based on what you've just read, do you think there is a type that is better than the others?  If so, why do you think that?

==Political Parties==
A political party is a political organization that seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in electoral campaigns. Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.

===USA===
The United States Constitution is silent on the subject of political organizations, mainly because most of the founding fathers disliked them.  Yet, major and minor political parties and groups soon arose. In partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independent. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot.  Typically, major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party representatives and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process.

The complete [[w:list of political parties in the United States|list of political parties in the United States]] is vast. However, there are two main parties in presidential contention:
*[[w:Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] 
*[[w:Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] 

Each of these two parties shares a degree of national attention by attaining the mathematical possibility of its nominee becoming President of the United States - i.e., having ballot access - for its presidential candidate in states whose collective total is at least half of the [[w:U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College votes]].

American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries. The two major parties, in particular, have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership, activities, or policy positions, though some state affiliates do. Thus, for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or Republican party, is quite different from a Briton's stating that he or she is a member of the [[w:Labour party|Labour party]]. In the United States, one can often become a &quot;member&quot; of a party, merely by stating that fact. In some U.S. states, a voter can register as a member of one or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another party, but such participation does not restrict one's choices in any way; nor does it give a person any particular rights or obligations with respect to the party, other than possibly allowing that person to vote in that party's primary elections (elections that determine who the candidate of the party will be). A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next day. The sole factor that brings one &quot;closer to the action&quot; is the quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility.

Party identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, and it is often difficult to tell who is going to do the voting.

The result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. A party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that person. Once in office, an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent.

At the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (See, [[w:Democratic National Committee|Democratic National Committee]], [[w:Republican National Committee|Republican National Committee]]) that acts as the hub for much of the fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties, affiliated organizations, and other individuals important to the party. However, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of individual members of the party.

The map below shows the results of the [[w:United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]] in the United States, illustrating the strength of the two major parties varies by geographic region in the U.S., with Republicans stronger in the South, Midwest, and some Mountain states while Democrats are stronger along the coasts.

[[File:ElectoralCollege2008.svg|center|600px|thumb|The Electoral College results of the 2008 Presidential Election in the U.S.]]

===Sweden===
Sweden has a [[w:List of political parties in Sweden|multi-party system]], with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.  A multi-party system is a system in which three or more political parties have the capacity to gain control of government separately or in coalition.

Unlike a single-party system (or a non-partisan democracy), it encourages the general constituency to form multiple distinct, officially recognized groups, generally called political parties. Each party competes for votes from the enfranchised constituents (those allowed to vote). A multi-party system is essential for representative democracies, because it prevents the leadership of a single party from setting policy without challenge.

If the government includes an elected Congress or Parliament the parties may share power according to Proportional Representation or the First-past-the-post system. In Proportional Representation, each party wins a number of seats proportional to the number of votes it receives. In first-past-the-post, the electorate is divided into a number of districts, each of which selects one person to fill one seat by a plurality of the vote. First-past-the-post is not conducive to a proliferation of parties, and naturally gravitates toward a two-party system, in which only two parties have a real chance of electing their candidates to office. This gravitation is known as [[w:Duverger's_law|Duverger's law]]. Proportional Representation, on the other hand, does not have this tendency, and allows multiple major parties to arise.

[[File:Piratpartiet.svg|thumb|right|150px| The symbol of the Pirate Party.]]

This difference is not without implications. A two-party system requires voters to align themselves in large blocs, sometimes so large that they cannot agree on any overarching principles. Along this line of thought, some theories argue that this allows centrists to gain control. On the other hand, if there are multiple major parties, each with less than a majority of the vote, the parties are forced to work together to form working governments. This also promotes a form of centrism.

The United States is an example of where there may be a multi-party system but that only two parties have ever formed government. Germany, India, France, and Israel are examples of nations that have used a multi-party system effectively in their democracies (though in each case there are two parties larger than all others, even though most of the time no party has a parliamentary majority by itself). In these nations, multiple political parties have often formed coalitions for the purpose of developing power blocs for governing.

The multi-party system of proportional representation has allowed a small third party, [[w:Pirate Party|The Pirate Party]], to come to prominence in Sweden, something that would be very unlikely in the United States.  The Pirate Party strives to reform laws regarding copyright and patents. The agenda also includes support for a strengthening of the right to privacy, both on the Internet and in everyday life, and the transparency of state administration. The Party has intentionally chosen to be block independent on the traditional left-right scale to pursue their political agenda with all mainstream parties. The Pirate Party is the third largest party in Sweden in terms of membership. Its sudden popularity has given rise to parties with the same name and similar goals in Europe and worldwide.

==Voting Patterns and Inequality==
In any political system where voting is allowed, some people are more likely to vote than others (see this Wikipedia article on [[w:Voter turnout|Voter turnout]] for more information on this).  Additionally, some people are more likely to have access to political power than are others.  It is in teasing out the stratification of political participation and political power that the sociological imagination is particularly useful.

===Politics and Gender===
While women are generally as likely to vote (or even more likely to vote; see figure below) in developed countries, women are underrepresented in political positions.  Women make up a very small percentage of elected officials, both at local and national levels.  In the U.S., for instance, in the 109th Congress (2005-2007) there were only 14 female Senators (out of 100) and 70 Congressional Representatives (out of 435).  This is illustrated in the graph below:

[[File:Women in Congress 1977-2006.png|thumb|600px|center|This figure breaks down women's participation in Congress in the U.S. by year and by political party.  Women are more likely to be elected as Democrats than as Republicans, but remain underrepresented among both parties relative to their percentages in the population as a whole.]]
In 2010 things had improved slightly; 17.2% of the House and 17% of the Senate were women, though a substantial imbalance remained between the two political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2010&quot;&gt;Roberts, Sam. 2010. “Congress and Country: Behold the Differences.” The New York Times, February 10 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/us/politics/10congress.html (Accessed February 10, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;


One of the factors that predicts how people vote is attitudes toward gender equality.&lt;ref name=&quot;McVeigh2007&quot;&gt;McVeigh, Rory, and Juliana M. Sobolewski. 2007. “Red Counties, Blue Counties, and Occupational Segregation by Sex and Race.” American Journal of Sociology 113:446-506.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. counties with sex segregated occupations are 11% more likely to vote Republican than counties that have mixed-sex occupations.  McVeigh and Sobolewski (2007) argue that the white males in sex segregated counties are more likely to vote for conservative candidates because they feel their occupational security is threatened by women and racial minorities.

===Politics and Age===
Young people are much less likely to vote than are older people and are less likely to be politicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2010&quot;/&gt;  This is illustrated for young people in the U.S. in the graph below (which also illustrates sex differences in voting rates): 

[[File:Voter Turnout by Sex and Age, 2008 US Presidential Election.png|center|thumb|600px|Young people are much less likely to vote than are older people.  Also, women are generally about as likely as men to vote, but are underrepresented in political positions.]]

The lower voting rates of young people in the U.S. help explain why things like Medicare and Social Security in the U.S. are facing looming crises - the elderly will retain many of the benefits of these programs and are unwilling to allow them to be changed even though young people will be the ones to suffer the consequences of these crises.  Older people are also more organized, through organizations like the [[w:AARP|AARP]] and are more likely to vote as a block on issues that affect them directly.  As a result, older individuals in the U.S. have more power than younger people.

===Politics and Race===
Generally, racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to vote in elections and are also underrepresented in political positions.  The graph below illustrates the disparate voting rates between racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. in the 2008 Presidential Election:

[[File:Voter Turnout by Race-Ethnicity, 2008 US Presidential Election.png|thumb|600px|center|Racial and ethnic minorities are generally less likely to vote than the majority population.  In the U.S., this means whites are more likely to vote than are blacks, Asians, and Hispanics.]]

Racial and ethnic minorities are also less likely to hold political positions.  If blacks were represented in proportion to their numbers in the U.S., there should be 12 Senators and 52 Members of the House.  In 2009 there was 1 black Senator ([[w:Roland Burris|Roland Burris]]) and 39 Members of the House.  In 2010 the number in the House increased slightly to 41 (7.8%), but remained at just 1% of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2010&quot;/&gt;

===Politics and Class===
Another way that political power is stratified is through income and education.  Wealthier and more educated people are more likely to vote (see figures to the right).  Additionally, wealthier and more educated people are more likely to hold political positions.  A good illustration of this is the 2004 Presidential Election in the U.S.  The candidates, [[w:John Kerry|John Kerry]], and [[w:George W. Bush|George W. Bush]] are both [[w:Yale University|Yale University]] alumni.  John Kerry is a lawyer and George W. Bush has an [[w:MBA|MBA]] from Harvard.  Both are white, worth millions of dollars, and come from families that have been involved in politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing ==
Installation of user scripts is done in 3 easy steps: locate your personal userscripts page, add the script to it, and bypass your cache.  Each step is detailed below.

=== Log-in and locate your personal userscripts page ===
First, make sure you are logged in.  Only logged-in users can install scripts by modifying a personal userscripts page.  This page can be located as follows:
* If you use default Monobook skin, this special link &quot;[[Special:Mypage/monobook.js|your monobook.js]]&quot; points to this page. 
* If you set some other skin in your [[Special:Preferences|Preferences]], see [[Wikipedia:Skin]] for corresponding subpage name. 
*: Note that many scripts are designed with Monobook skin in mind. Such scripts should also work in Chick, Simple and Myskin, and are less likely to work in Classic, Nostalgia and Cologne Blue. If you use Modern skin, try enabling a special &quot;compatibility&quot; gadget in your preferences.

=== Add the script to your personal userscripts page ===
One way to install a script is to simply copy the whole script code into your monobook.js. You will thereafter have your own copy of the script, which will not be updated automatically; you must do it yourself. 

Importing is a preferred and most popular way to install a userscript. It makes your monobook.js more readable and automatically keeps you up to date with script updates and fixes.

This is done by adding &lt;code&gt;importScript('full_page_name')&lt;/code&gt; to your [[monobook.js]].

For example, to install [[Wikipedia:WikiProject User scripts/Scripts/Watchlist since|Watchlist since]] script, you add the following line to your monobook.js:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
importScript('Wikipedia:WikiProject User scripts/Scripts/Watchlist since');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Bypass your cache ===
As a final step, you need to [[Wikipedia:bypass your cache|bypass your cache]] after installation.

To express your thank to the developer, you may want to add a [[WP:USERBOX|userbox]] to your personal page.  Feel free to use the predefined &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:Userscripts|Userscripts]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; userbox.  

=== Gadgets ===
Some userscripts are made into [[Wikipedia:Gadget|gadgets]], you can install them simply by selecting a checkbox in your [[Special:Preferences|Preferences]].

=== Some notes ===
Not all scripts are subpages of WikiProject User scripts; many scripts are stored in the userspace of the user who maintains them; check the destination of the links in the list below to see where a script is stored, and use that location as the argument to the importScript function.

Note that importing requires the script to have its own page which is entirely valid [[Javascript]] (all explanatory text is /* inside comments */), as most scripts do. If you import a file which is not valid Javascript, nothing serious is likely to happen, but your Javascript, and any Javascript you have below that, will not work. If your browser is set to inform you about Javascript errors, you will see these errors; otherwise you will see nothing except that the scripts you have tried to add do not work.

Last note: if you see &quot;&amp;dontcountme=s&quot; in a userscript URL then this part can be removed. It is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28technical%29&amp;oldid=128295924#dontcountme.3Ds.3F no longer needed].

==Re: Opening theory in chess/ECO_index==
I just finished section &quot;A&quot; of the ECO index. I did not realize how many lines there were in the Dutch Defence.

[[User:Anonymouse|Anonymouse--nerd and proud of it]] ([[User talk:Anonymouse|talk]]) 23:22, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
==Hello==
I just popped up here after seeing who edited my half-done book on chess strategy, and just thought I might like to tell you that I'll be around every once in a while to work on [[Wikibooks:Chess|the project]].
== re: Hello ==

hi ChessCreator,
Thanks for your welcome! Actually, I've been involved with this book since 2005 but repeatedly gave up out of frustration at apparently being the only one here, so I'm extremely glad to see some new names on board. As you'll see from the main discussion page, it was me that turned Opening Theory in Chess into a stand-alone book. My contributions so far have been mostly in the Ruy, also the first few moves of the Frankenstein-Dracula and the intro page. My plan now is to bring the Sveshnikov up to scratch. 

Maybe I'll also make a general survey of the book that tells us which main lines are here already and which urgently need adding. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] ([[User talk:Chi Sigma|talk]]) 17:02, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
: Excellent news to learn of your desire to contribute. I've been gradually upgrading a number of things and only recently finally got all page put into the [[Opening theory in chess]] category. So now you(or anyone else interested) can watch for new edits by clinking [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/Category:Opening_theory_in_chess here].
:There are some of my thoughts, questions and idea on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Opening_theory_in_chess/Organization organisation] page.

== {{tlx|Chesscreator/Invite1}} ==

This template should be subst'ed. Instead of {{tlx|Chesscreator/Invite1}}, use {{tlxs|Chesscreator/Invite1}}. I will go back and change this. The difference is that the message on people's talk pages won't change when the template is edited, and its easier on the servers. Keep up the good work and good luck getting that project off the ground! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:17, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:Wow, I really like your idea for a WikiProject-sort of thing. I think I'll create one for History. Very cool idea.

== [[English Defence]] ==

This currently redirects to a page which doesn't exist; would you fix that? I don't know where it should point. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User

:I think it would go to either [[Opening theory in chess/1. c4|English Opening]] or [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c5/2. Nf3/2...d6/3. d4/3...cxd4/4. Nxd4/4...Nf6/5. Nc3/5...a6/6. Be3|English Attack]]. To the best of my knowledge there is no such opening as the English Defence (de Firmian, MCO-15)

Hey CC, I deleted those redirects, could you see if there's anything I've messed up? Also, let me know and I'll be glad to delete/fix any more stuff if you need admin help.

== Re:Bot Help ==

Actually, the number of pages is 533 :). I've got the page list loaded up, let me set up the bot and I'll get it running. Just for clarification, you want it to say

 &lt;nowiki&gt;==Theory table==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

with no spaces between the &quot;==&quot; and the text, an uncapitalized second-word? Ie, my bot is going to print out exactly that text that you see above, is that correct? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:53, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, that is correct. Looks like you've bot has started. Thank You! [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 15:23, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
::Started and finished. I did some random checking, and everything looks right. Let me know if you find any problems. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:25, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Queen's Indian Defense ==

I saw it written that way somewhere, I should have copied down my source and left a proper reference. I can't, for the life of me, find that page again. 

I was trying to look up an opening, or more specifically a response to an opening. An opponent of mine played 1. d4, Nf6 2. c4, e6 3. a3?. This move, apparently, is such a bumble that i can't find it listed anywhere. While trying to look it up in the chess book, i saw the page in question and thought the choice of name for that was a little odd. I may be mistaken, I'm certainly no grand master! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:52, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

== [[List of chess topics]]‎ ==

The list of chess topics page looks like to me like an article that would be written on Wikipedia. On Wikibooks this isn't really appropriately because its not a book. This should really be either an appendix inside one of the chess books or moved to [[Subject:Chess]] and cleaned up to list only the book titles and perhaps link to the related categories for each book for a complete listing of pages for each book. Subject pages sort of function as lists for a specific topic and should in my opinion also function as the Wikipedia equivalents of disambigious pages for books rather than articles, as Wikiproject pages for books rather than articles, and as Portals for books on a subject. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:50, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Bot Help ==

I'm not able to use my bot right now, but I should be able to make all those changes by monday night. Also, my bot is not currently able to move pages, although that is functionality that I've been meaning to implement for a long while now. Maybe next week I can start writing up a mass-move bot to help with this kind of task. 

Keeping the [[Chess]] and [[Opening theory in chess]] book separate is probably a good thing. Imagine trying to merge together the ECO and Nimzowitsch's &quot;My System&quot;. One discusses openings, the other discusses gameplay. We don't need to force mergers about books that are about a single subject but which are distinct. Of course, if you believe that they are better merged together, that's fine too. 

I'll set up and run my bot on monday evening, possibly tuesday morning. I'll also see what I can come up with for page moves, in case you still want to go through with that change. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:08, 17 May 2008 (UTC)

== Can you double check my work? ==

Its my first time doing a ton of work using templates, and I started at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...Nc6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...d6/6._Bg5 and added two pages (the top move of the top variation) [[User:Sentriclecub|Sentriclecub]] ([[User talk:Sentriclecub|talk]]) 20:49, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

== Ahoy ==

If you're still around, I've posted something on the front page's discussion page that I hope will get folks thinking. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] ([[User talk:Chi Sigma|talk]]) 23:42, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}8. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}9. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|3}}10. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|3}}11. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|3}}5. For the avoidance of doubt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|8}}1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|8}}2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|8}}3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

&lt;p&gt;4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the &quot;Applicable License&quot;), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Termination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Miscellaneous&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}Creative Commons Notice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark &quot;Creative Commons&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of the License.&lt;/p&gt;

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{indent|4}}* O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.&lt;/p&gt;

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING

&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A &quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is &quot;eligible for relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
    Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with … Texts.&quot; line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.</text>

#Remove steaks from marinade and discard extra. Place Rub in a pie pan and add steaks, pressing lightly to help adhesion on both sides.
#Spray cold grill grate with nonstick cooking spray. Set up for direct and indirect heat and add some soaked mesquite chips to the coals.
#Place steaks on hottest part of grill and cook for 2-3 minutes per side. Move to the cooler part of the grill and cook, turning once, until internal temperature reaches 10° cooler than your preferred doneness. Remove and let rest for 7 minutes. Slice thinly across the grain on a bias and serve.

== Note ==
Despite what you have probably heard, the marinating will '''''not''''' turn the steaks into mush. As you have probably heard me say, commercial tenderizers do '''''not''''' use acids, but enzymes, to tenderize.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">
{{closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - Works of Fiction and Original Research are beyond the scope of Wikibooks. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 05:24, 21 June 2009 (UTC)}}
Original research.  More suitable for http://conlang.wikia.com/, however, the author keeps removing speedy deletion notices and the suggestion to transwiki to another page. Nomination also includes [[Extra Pulvis Letters]] and [[Extra Näräävi Letters]] [[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 19:50, 13 June 2009 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' - move to Wikiversity.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:16, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
: [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' - This work certainly qualifies for a speedy.  I tagged it with a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{query}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; which was deleted.  Then I tagged it with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Impending Doom}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Also deleted.  Someone else tagged it with a suggestion that it be moved.  Also deleted.  Since this guy wasn't willing to listen, I deleted the page.  That got his attention (though not in a good way as one might imagine).  Even though the author then began levelling threats and has since been blocked (by another admin), I thought it would be decent to undelete to allow him a second chance to move the data elsewhere.  I am willing to let that stand for a day or two, but not much longer.  Unless the consensus here is different. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 11:29, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
:: I imagine that if it was transwikied, the author might still be offended and want to continue to work on it at Wikibooks. I agree that it doesn't belong here. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:58, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' The work doesn't belong here because it appears to be unestablished conlang with no defined grammar and vocabulary that can be verified. That along with &quot;Eeke is a group of constructed languages created by me&quot; is what makes it appear to be original research. If that is not the case, then some references to some reliable sources would help. Also this work could be interpreted as self-promotion, if the conlang(s) does actually exist, but is not well known yet. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:26, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Certainly does not belong here... we are not designed to be a home for vanity pages. This is one person's set of constructed languages, and has no utility outside his own world. While I would normally agree with Sigma 7 and Panic that this should be transwikied, I am unsure whether there is enough here to merit that. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:43, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Self-constructed, not a book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:11, 20 June 2009 (UTC)
: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''.  Given there was no more activity from the author, it's safe to delete.  Since it appears he managed to write a sentence and its translation, it's unlikely that he lost too much data (and anything he did &quot;lose&quot; can be reconstructed in a school day.) --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:19, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

      <comment>outline for the first chapter</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter we will look at some very simple GTK+ examples. Theory will be at the bottom of this chapter, it should be much easier to digest once you have written some code.

== An empty window ==
In this example we create a single window, set its title and size and connect an event that allows the application to close.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;

int
main (int   argc,
      char *argv[])
{
  GtkWidget *window;

  /* Initialise GTK+ and  */
  gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  /* create a new window, set values */
  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), &quot;Hello World&quot;);
  gtk_widget_set_size_request (window, 200, 200);
  /* connect the windows &quot;destroy&quot; event */
  g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (window), &quot;destroy&quot;,
                    G_CALLBACK (gtk_main_quit), NULL);  

  /* set the window as visible */
  gtk_widget_show (window);

  /* run the GTK+ main loop */
  gtk_main ();
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Congratulations, you have created your first GTK+ window. You may not completely understand the code you have written yet, thats allright eventually you will. GTK+ is object oriented, as C is not designed as an object oriented language you must explicitly upcast and downcast objects, this will occur most often with the paramater passed to a function. You first cast window from a GtkWidget to a GtkWindow when you wrote GTK_WINDOW (window).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
&lt;/source&gt;
This call initialise GTK+ and hands to it a list of command line arguments the program recieved when initialising.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
&lt;/source&gt;
This line creates a new GtkWindow down cast as a GtkWidget
: '''GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL''' A gtk window that registers itself to the window manager as a window.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), &quot;Hello World&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
this function sets the title of a GtkWindow.
: '''GTK_WINDOW (window)''' the main window, cast from a GtkWidget to a GtkWindow
: '''&quot;Hello World&quot;''' the new title of the window

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
gtk_widget_set_size_request (window, 200, 200);
&lt;/source&gt;
we are setting the windows '''size request''', as the name suggests a size request does not guarantee you will get a specific size, you will learn more about this later.
:'''window''' a GtkWidget
:'''200''' width
:'''200''' height

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (window), &quot;destroy&quot;,
                  G_CALLBACK (gtk_main_quit), NULL); 
&lt;/source&gt;
we are connecting a callback (function) to be called when the &quot;destroy&quot; event is emitted from window.
: '''G_OBJECT (window)''' window cast as a G_OBJECT
: '''&quot;destroy&quot;''' the signal that is being connected to
: '''G_CALLBACK (gtk_main_quit)''' the function that is called when the signal is sent
: '''NULL''' an empty gpointer, for data that could be passed to the function

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
gtk_widget_show (window);
&lt;/source&gt;
show the widget window, all widgets must be shown including all parent widgets.
: '''window''' the widget that is being made visible

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
gtk_main ();
&lt;/source&gt;
we rest in GTKs main loop until gtk_main_quit () is called; we have connected gtk_main_quit () to the windows &quot;destroy&quot; event.

This worksheet will help practice with order of operations. As a reminder, the following rules apply:
# Do the equations in parentheses/brackets first. If the question has nested brackets like [] and {}, do the equations in inner bracket first. Inner equations symbolized as ().
# Do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.
# Do the equation in order from left to right.

There are two worksheets, based on whole numbers or fractions:

      <text xml:space="preserve">A bank object encapsulates a block of memory you can use to store arbitrary data.

Banks are useful for storing data that is of no fixed type - for example, the contents
of a binary file.

To create a bank, use the [[BlitzMax/Modules/Miscellaneous/Banks#CreateBank|CreateBank]] command.

To write data to a bank, use one of 'Poke' style commands, such as [[BlitzMax/Modules/Miscellaneous/Banks#PokeByte|PokeByte]].

To read data from a bank, use one of the 'Peek' style commands, such as [[BlitzMax/Modules/Miscellaneous/Banks#PeekByte|PeekByte]].

In addition, banks can be loaded or saved using [[BlitzMax/Modules/Miscellaneous/Banks#LoadBank|LoadBank]] or [[BlitzMax/Modules/Miscellaneous/Banks#SaveBank|SaveBank]].

=Functions=

==CreateBank==
''Function CreateBank:TBank( size=0 )''

'''Description''': Create a bank

'''Returns''': A bank object with an initial size of '''size''' bytes

'''Information''':
[[BlitzMax/Modules/Miscellaneous/Banks#CreateBank|CreateBank]] creates a Bank allocating a specified amount of memory that
can be used for storage of binary data using the various Poke and
Peek commands.

'''Comment''':
Banks are blocks of memory assigned to a TBank, they are assigned like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
Global MyVar:TBank = CreateBank( SizeInBytes )
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will create a bank of SizeInBytes and store the pointer to it in MyVar.

Banks are brilliant for conversion work converting between types and compression techniques, for example.
&lt;pre&gt;
Function LongToStr:String( Value:Long )
	Local TempBank:TBank = CreateBank( 8 ) ' On eight bytes for the long (ints are 4 bytes)
	Local TempString:String = &quot;&quot;
	
	PokeLong( TempBank,0,Value ) ' Poke Value into TempBank at offset 0, the first byte for the eight bytes of the long value
	For Li:Int = 0 To 7
		TempString :+ Chr( PeekByte( TempBank,Li ) ) ' Read the bytes from the bank
	Next
	Return TempString
End Function
&lt;/pre&gt;

This simple function converts a long int to an eight byte representation of it. This is good for networking systems, etc. so instead of sending 640000000000 it would send just eight bytes. There are other uses for banks, their uses are seemingly endless.

==CreateStaticBank==
''Function CreateStaticBank:TBank( buf:Byte Ptr,size )''

'''Description''': Create a bank with existing data

If your grill or smoker has retreated from your use, this is the guide to get you started again.

== Meats and Cuts ==

If you're either cooking low and slow, or hot and fast, you'll want to pick a cut that's got a good amount of marbling. Good chicken cuts include:
Whole leg quarters, thighs, drumsticks, wings, and whole butterflied chickens. Breasts can be dry and flavorless. Nice beef cuts: Tender steaks, flank, inside skirt, and briskets. Pork isn't that lucky though. See, before the fitness craze came, pigs were fat. In fact, the average pig had more fat than 50 chicken leg quarters. I actually got to taste that meat before it was gone. But, people crazy about fitness turned from pigs to poultry. Undaunted, pig breeders made the once juicy hog dry. Anyways, cuts that have the right stuff include Boston butts, ribs, and chops.

== Cooking ==

The type of barbecue cooking that you choose for a cut matters almost as much as the cut you pick. Cuts that like a long cook time in the smoker are Boston butts, ribs, beef brisket, chicken thighs and legs, wings, and whole chickens. Try to do a long smoke time with things like filet mignons, and you'll get something extremely mushy, like cat food. Cuts that like it hot and fast are: Pork chops, chicken breasts, steaks like ribeyes and strips, ahi tuna, fish, and shrimp.

'''Some recipes that use a smoker:'''

[[Cookbook:Pulled Pork Sandwiches|Pulled Pork]]

[[Cookbook:Memphis-Style BBQ Ribs|Memphis-Style BBQ Ribs]]

[[Cookbook:North Carolina-Style BBQ Ribs|North Carolina-Style BBQ Ribs]]

== Woods ==

Think all smoking woods are the same? Wrong! Each wood has its own flavor and character. However, if you use softwoods like cedar, pine, and spruce, you'll get toxic tars, resins, and creosote, which can kill! That's why you'll want to use hardwoods. I have a chart concerning flavor of smoke.
:Alder: Classic European smoking wood, doesn't overtake, complements meats with mild flavor and seafood such as trout.
:Applewood: Adds a cider-like flavor to meats and fish. Nicely complements items with honey, or meats such as chicken, pork, and lamb.
:Cherry: Fruity, tad bitter smoke that complements pork.
:Hickory: Classic American wood. Adds a sharp, woodsy flavor. Complements pork, chicken, seafood, and shrimp.
:Maple: Sweet maple syrup flavor. Complements almost everything.
:Mesquite: Gives a spicy Southwestern flair to beef. However, mesquite can overtake mild flavored meats like pork and chicken.
:Peachwood: Sweet fruity flavor. Complements pork, chicken, salmon, trout, and shrimp.

I hope we've inspired you to take your grill or smoker out of the shadows and fire it up.

A spice rub is a mixture of salt, herbs, and spices. A spice rub can be as simple as a large amount of pepper, like in Steak au' Poirve, or as complex as 100 spices. (and yes, that many spices do exist) My formula for a good spice rub is a base, such as paprika, and then add on from there. However, beware commercial spice mixtures. Many of them are salt-based because: 1. Salt fills volume. 2. Salt is cheap. 3. Salt fills in for spices they can't get.

In order to make a successful rub, you need to balance flavors. I like to build my rubs in bulk because spices last close to forever and also I won't have to make another batch every 2 days because trust me, when you find a good rub, you will use it often. Also, if you're making a rub for one certain item, you'll want to pick flavors that work well with what you're making it for. Pork likes brown sugar, rosemary, and chipotles. Chicken pretty much likes the same things as pork and things like lemon, lime, orange, cayenne pepper, and dry mustard powder. Beef likes all of these. Also, paprika seems to work with just about everything.

Here is a recipe for an all-purpose rub.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup paprika
* 1/4 cup salt
* 1/4 cup black pepper
* 1/2 cup chipotle powder
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 3/4 cup dehydrated lemon peel
* 1/4 cup dried rosemary
* 2 tbsp cayenne pepper

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in an airtight container. Stored in a cool, dark place this will last until your family tree ends. And everybody else's.

For those of you that believe all those guys that say acids in marinades supposedly tenderize meats, that's false. Tenderizers use enzymes like papain, not acids. Peace I know Alton Brown's address!

      <text xml:space="preserve">I made this book because I felt that a lot of people don't know basic food safety and there are a large amount of illnesses caused by contaminated food registered by the CDC in America.

In Chapter One, I wrote about how to be careful not to cross-contaminate by poor storage and unwashed tools.

In Chapter Two, I wrote about cooking meats to an appropriate temperature before consumption.

In Chapter Three, I wrote about how to properly store items meant for consumption.

In Chapter Four, I wrote about common food safety myths.

I hope you learn a lot from this book.

|number = 4002
|logic_type = Combinatorial
|func_family = Logic
|description = Dual 4-Input NOR Gate
|pins = 14
}}

The 4002 is a member of the [[Practical_Electronics/IC/4000 Series|4000 Series]] [[Practical_Electronics/CMOS|CMOS]] range, and contains two independent [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#NOR|NOR gates]], each with four inputs. The pinout diagram, given on the right, is the standard four-input CMOS logic gate IC layout:

:*Pin 7 is the ground supply (GND)
:*Pin 14 is the positive supply (V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;)
:*Pins 2-5 and 9-12 are gate inputs for the two gates
:*Pin 1 and 13 are gate outputs
:*Pin 6 and 8 are not connected

The truth table for one of the two gates is shown below. For more infomation about the NOR gate in general, see this [[Practical Electronics/Logic#NOR|module]].

{{center|'''Truth Table for a Single Gate'''}}
{{Truthtable4
|A|B|C|D|Q|1|0|0|0 |0|0|0|0 |0|0|0|0 |0|0|0|0}}

This chip is widely available, and usually comes in a [[Practical_Electronics/IC/DIL|DIL]]-14 or [[Practical_Electronics/IC/SOIC|SOIC]]-14 package.

This chip is different in pinout to the TTL [[Practical_Electronics/IC/7425|7425]], but can fulfill its function if the wiring is modified.</text>

'''[[w:Computer programming|Computer Programming]]''' is the process of writing, testing, troubleshooting, debugging and maintaining of a computer program. Good programming practices mix art, craft and engineering discipline. This book will teach you the basic principles of computer programming and good programming practices. What this book will not do is teach you to use a specific programming language. This book may also be useful as part of a course on computer theory, computer engineering, or software engineering, along side learning a programming language, or as part of an advanced programming course.

I'm nominating this for deletion because it's now been merged into [[Introduction to Psychology]] where appropriate.  Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 have been merged while Chapter 2 and 4 remain.  However, 2 and 4 are only a collection of links to Wikipedia articles and do not contain actual content.  On a more subjective note, the book was apparently named after its creator, which is pretty anathema to the concept of an open wiki. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:04, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Problem ==

Most software programs are made because there is a problem that needs to be addressed or solved. Before a problem can be addressed, you need to clearly identify the problem or problems that need to be addressed. In this section you will learn basic skills to identifying problems.

=== Problem Statement ===

A problem statement is a description of the issues that need to be addressed. A good problem statement answers:

# What is the problem? This should help explain why a program is needed.
# Who has the problem? This should help identify who is likely to use the program.

If the answers are too general, thinking and creativity may be required.

I'm sorry, but I don't believe this book is within the scope of Wikibooks.  It's not a textbook intended to teach a topic.  Additionally, I feel it puts us at risk for copyright violation for the lyrics you've posted for songs that are not public domain.  And if the lyrics were public domain, they'd be a better fit at [[s:|Wikisource]] instead. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:27, 6 February 2010 (UTC)

== Why use Stata ? ==

* It includes the very latest methods in econometrics
* It is a portable software (ie you can install it on your USB stick) 
* It is widely used in economics/econometrics.
* It is commercial but it can utilize user-written functions.
* It has a nice Graphical User Interface

== Stata Basics ==

Stata Windows
* Command
* Review
* Variables 
* Variables Manager
* Results
* Data Editor 
* Data browser 
* Graph editor
* Do-file editor 

=== Main Windows ===

* All the results appears in the '''Results''' window.
* The '''Command''' window can be used to interactively give instructions to Stata. This is an alternative to using the dialog boxes accessed via Stata drop-down menus or running Stata in batch mode using a do-file or ado-file.
* The '''Variables''' window lists all variables and labels of the dataset in memory. You can click on the name of a variable and it appears in the command window.
* The  '''Variables Manager''' allows the user to quickly view and edit all the variable names, variable labels, formats, value labels, and notes.
* The '''Review''' window shows a list of past instructions. It can be useful if you want to quickly do things again. You just have to click on an instruction and it will appear again in the ''command window''. 
* You can also have a look at your data by typing in the command window -browse- or -edit-.
** -edit- allow you to change your datasets by hand, exactly as in excel. However this is not recommanded.
** -browse- may be a safer option. If you want to have a look at a specific list of variables, you can specify it to Stata by typing in the command window :
&lt;pre&gt;browse var1 var2 var3&lt;/pre&gt;
* The '''viewer''' window displays any SMCL (Stata Markup Control Language) file, such as help documentation.
* The '''do-file editor''' allows users to create and edit do-files and ado-files.

=== Keyboard shortcuts ===

* Ctrl + D : do a program (selected text or whole do file)
* ⌘ + Shift + D : do a program (Mac OS 10+)

=== Basic commands ===

* -help- (or -h-) : gives the help file of a command in a Viewer window.
&lt;pre&gt;
h reg
&lt;/pre&gt; 

* -search- : search local help files for a keyword. 
&lt;pre&gt;
search covariance
&lt;/pre&gt; 

* -findit- : search a keyword across local and net-based files.
&lt;pre&gt;
findit covariance
&lt;/pre&gt;

* -cd- : change working directory
&lt;pre&gt;
cd  &quot;~/Desktop&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* -pwd- : displays the print working directory. 
&lt;pre&gt;
pwd
&lt;/pre&gt;

* -dir- or -ls- :  list all the files in the working directory
&lt;pre&gt;
ls /* Lists all files in the directory */
ls , w /* the 'w' option simplifies the output*/
ls *.dta, w /* lists all files ending with '''.dta''' */
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Stata Do-files ===

The command -doedit- opens a new do-file editor. 
 . doedit

== Stata Programming Style ==

* Most command can be abbreviated. For instance: 
** g or gen stands for generate
** h for help
** su for summarize
** gr for graph
** sc for scatter
** etc
* No brackets  
* * at the beginning of a line stands for comment
* Stata is case sensitive.

== Updates, News, etc ==


 . view news

&lt;pre&gt;
. news
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
. update
&lt;/pre&gt;

This book was apparently created for a class project.  Human Resources Management is what I assume the HRM stands for.  If you look at [[:Category:Hot Topics in HRM 2007]] you might see a great number of pages.  However, look at any of those pages and they have, at most, a link to rate the page.  Given the 2007 in the title and the main contributor's last efforts made in December 2006, it would appear the book is no longer relevant to any class and stands little hope of going anywhere or serving any purpose. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:37, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Funds defines several “functional” data structures for Common Lisp.  Functional data structures, also sometimes known as persistent data structures, are data structures that are immutable, or do not modify their contents.  Instead of modifying, they creates a new object which has some changes in it, but is otherwise the same as the old.  This may seem inefficient, but the new object is created in such a way that it shares much of its contents with the old object, making this a cheap operation.  By using these techniques, functional data structures can come close to providing the same performance as mutable data structures but without the added complexity of mutable state.

One functional data structure that every Lisp programmer is familiar with is the list.  While a list can be destructively modified, it isn't in standard usage, and operations on lists produce new lists that share structure with the original list.  For instance, you can CONS an element onto the head of a list and the list returned shares the entire old list but with a new head tacked in front of the old one.

Functional data structures are particularly useful for multiprocessing applications as they can remove the danger of one process changing a shared data structure in a way that invalidates that structure for another processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

'''[[w:Software testing|Software testing]]''' is used to gain valuable information about a program's quality and can be used to uncover problems. Software testing is only as good at the conditions tested for. Untested conditions can still cause a program to function in unexpected ways. Knowing what requirements and priorities the program has is a major step in preparation for software testing. Software testing can help you find answers to:

* Are the requirements for the program satisfied?
* Are there any gaps in the program's requirements?
* Are there defects or failures in the program's designed?
* Are there any unexpected errors?
* Does the program work as expected?

== Build scripts ==

Try to set up [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OneButtonTesting &quot;one-button testing&quot;].
That makes it much more convenient to type a little, then hit that button which
* saves the file you just edited,
* compiles the application with all the appropriate options (such as &quot;-fno-emit-frame&quot;, if necessary), and
* runs a few quick tests, to make sure your &quot;improvements&quot; don't accidentally break something else.

Spending an hour to code up a few tests and set up one-button testing may *seem* like it is more hassle than it is worth. Manually compiling the file, and manually run through the various parts of the application to make sure they work, may take far less than an hour.
But trust me, most programs you are going to edit-compile-test many, many times.
And a year from now, when you make just one tiny little change, wouldn't you much rather push-the-button and be done with it, rather than
* manually compile the file
* manually run through the application and see that it suddenly it doesn't work any more
* pull out your hair until
* hours later, you remember you needed to include &quot;-fno-emit-frame&quot;
* manually re-compile the file, this time with &quot;-fno-emit-frame&quot;
* start testing all over from the beginning.

{{wikipedia|Continuous integration}}
There are lots of ways to set up an [[Wikipedia:Make_(software) | automated build system]].

One-button testing is just one part of the continuous integration recommended by some programmers.

Even lawyers can see the advantages of automated build scripts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/compliance-guide.html#x1-70003.4 'Avoid the “Build Guru”']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure==
[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_Programming_Principles&amp;diff=1543769&amp;oldid=1543592 a change] to the book's contents for a flat structure, using [[Help:Editing#Subpage links]] as justification. Seeing as [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] initially set up the book with a hierarchical structure just recently, I feel discussion would be prudent before such a change is made. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:14, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe a hierarchical structure is necessary with the current page naming. You'll notice that the sections under The Problem, Solutions, Identifying The Approach, and Quality Requirements have identical pages. The flat structure will result in name conflicts, while a structure using chapters will allow pages of the same names that are associated with each chapter. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:14, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

: The flat structure also allows pages of the same name to be associated with more than one chapter.
: The flat structure allows a page called &quot;Trial And Error&quot; to be placed in more than one chapter.
: [http://www.communitywiki.org/en/HierarchyConsideredHarmful HierarchyConsideredHarmful] discusses some flaws of deep hierarchy that are fixed by using the flat structure, as suggested by [[Help:Editing#Subpage links]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:12, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I'm very disappointed that you didn't wait for the ''original author'' of the book to comment before completely changing the structure of the book '''again'''. Did Darklama want &quot;Trial and Error&quot; to be in more than one chapter? From the original structure it would appear to be &quot;no&quot;; but that is why I began a discussion on this, to get his input. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:22, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

The flat approach only makes since if the intent was to identify problems, solutions and approaches in one go, which is not the intent. While a problem solving approach is intended to be used in the first three units/sections, breaking it down is intended to make the process easier for people new to the process, keep people focused on doing one step at a time, and also help people to see what the similarities and the differences are in each step on their own without forcing too much information on them at once. This has nothing to do with hierarchy, but rather separating concepts. Too little separation can also be considered harmful and can lead to its own problems. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:16, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

'''Maple sugar''' is basically [[cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]] boiled until it crystallizes into something like [[cookbook:Turbinado Sugar|turbinado sugar]], and has a maple flavor good in dishes where you don't want to use any liquid.

== writing from right to left ==

How I can write from right to left in wikibook?

: You may not be able to. Writing from right to left in a system that is left-to-right oriented is not easy to program, I think you would need a parser extension to do it. The problem is that wiki-langauge does not have substrings. You might be able to get the same effect by Using a right justification and writing everything backwards, but frankly that seems a bit ridiculus. Am I wrong about it being difficult?--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 05:05, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

:: &lt;div dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;gnorw ruoY&lt;/div&gt;
:: To write from right to left use the attribute dir=&quot;rtl&quot; on any block xhtml element such as div. The only reason what I wrote is backwards is because English is a left to right language. For languages that are naturally written from right to left it wouldn't actually be considered backwards. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:26, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

:Well color me surprised div is a block xhtml statement but you still have to put it into a system typing from left to right, if you are writing on a standard browser. So you still have to write it backwards...;) Oh, and does our PDF converter understand block xhtml? I tried to format a page using Div statements and my font sizes disappeared in the pdf. Same thing happened when I tried to size a picture, the size disappeared.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 05:13, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

:: Some &quot;standard&quot; browsers are quiet capable of typing from right to left as well. I think the PDF converter ignores a lot of things. You could try filling a bug report to get those bugs fixed. Although the PDF converter could be ignoring those things on purpose, so as to comply with the publish company's requirements. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:10, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
== Can't silence &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag error message with display:none style ==

I am running into a problem with the cite extension. The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag will tell you if you fail to put a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag at the end of a page. This is very unhelpful if you want to use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags in templates. One way around this is to embed the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:none&quot;;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; sections. This seems to work if the group parameter is null. But, if it isn't, the error magically bleeds out of the display:none section. For example, the following does not generate a visible error:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Name&quot; group=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;cite class=&quot;book&quot; style=&quot;font-style:normal&quot; &gt;Blah blah blah.&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, the following markup results in a visible error:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot; group=&quot;fn&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=footnote&gt;footnote text 1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;second&quot; group=&quot;fn&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=footnote&gt;footnote text 2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;third&quot; group=&quot;fn&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=footnote&gt;footnote text 3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Since the second example works on my local mediawiki installation (i.e., the error does not appear), there appears to be a configuration issue on Wikibooks that causes the error message leakage. If so, to whom should I report this? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 16:18, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

: You should report it here, which you've done. I'll go change the relevant mediawiki message now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:08, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
: Ok I've fixed it so using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; without &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references group=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; won't report any error now, so there is no need to use &quot;display:none;&quot; now or use any other sort of work around. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:19, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

Great. Thanks. I'll probably keep the display:none sections, since I am working on a template that may be useful on other mediawiki installations. I have not completed unit testing, but if you want a preview, see [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples | Bref template examples]]. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 17:28, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

: Well if your looking for a solution that will work on all projects, don't use &quot;display:none&quot;. The simplest solution is to include &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;references group=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the template. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:32, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

Unfortunately, that won't work. The template is designed to allow references to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tagged data on pages other than those where the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; data appears. It does this using citation lists, which are pages containing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tagged data. Citation lists are transcluded silently on pages that reference citations. Silence is imposed by the display:none style attribute. Using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;references group=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; would eliminate the error message on the template page, but not on the pages where the template is used.

== Generating a .pdf of a whole book? ==

Hi. I'm wondering if there is a way to generate a .pdf with the entire content of a book. Using the &quot;generate .pdf&quot; tool on the left menu, you only get the current page, so if the chapters are in subpages, you don't get them. :/ Is there a way around that? -[[User:Brutulf|Brutulf]] ([[User talk:Brutulf|talk]]) 23:03, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
:Yes, there is, but it's a little bit of a manual process (though not that bad, and the output is really pretty good).  If you look in the side panel on the left, you should see a section called &quot;Create a book&quot; with two links in it.  Navigate to the first chapter of the book you want a pdf of, and then click the link that says &quot;Add wiki page.&quot;  Then go to the next chapter and click it again.  Repeat until you have added every module in the book you want.  Finally, click on &quot;Show collection page.  From there you can rearrange, delete, etc.  When you're satisfied with your collection, save it, and then generate a pdf from that. If you have more questions, visit [[Help:Collections]], or ask again here. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:15, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks, I'll try that. -[[User:Brutulf|Brutulf]] ([[User talk:Brutulf|talk]]) 17:40, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

== Congratulations on starting a new book! ==

This is a continuation of an archived discussion.  See the archival trail of the discussion at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2008/December#Congratulations_on_starting_a_new_book.21].
In summary, I questioned the practice of labelling a book &quot;Congratulations on starting a new book!&quot; for all users to see, not just the creator.  The replies convince me as to the usefulness of this function, but I suggest rephrasing the text to genericise it.  For example:
:This is the new book &lt;whatever&gt;!
:'''To all readers:''' Keep this template for at least 2 weeks to advertise the book. Do not remove this template until the book has been properly categorized.  
: '''To the author:''' Please properly categorize your book using &lt;Subject&gt;. Read The Wikibooks Writer for more information about starting books. Ask questions in the Reading Room.
: For categorization help see WB:AS for ideas and WB:CHAT for assistance.
--[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 05:20, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

: The notice isn't for just readers or just the author, this is a wiki anyone can help to categorize the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:02, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
== *.swf files ==

Hi all. For the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual|Wings 3D User Manual]] I would want to add some *.swf files with instructions, that are easy to follow even by newbies. These flash files are created with [http://debugmode.com/wink/ Wink], look a little bit like a video, but in essence are some carefully choosen screenshots with the added value of text explanations/bubbles, navigation buttons and the video impression achived by animating the cursor movement. Here a selfmade [http://tugendbol.de/wings3d/tuts_wink/group_scale/group_scale.htm sample] of what I plan to do (be sure to have read the following, before you click ... you have to trust me and the Wink author and the vendor of the Flash player).

One problem with *.swf is, that it may contain ActionScript, a derivative of ECMA aka JavaScript and thus may be a security risk principally. On the other hand, the needed player runs in sort of a &quot;sandbox&quot; and can by default only write to a very limited area on the users file system (it's cookies somewhere). But then again, even that limited feature is known to be exploited, e.g. by YouTube to keep record of the users sound volume settings (regardless of the domain, where the video is played) ... and who knows, what else is possible with just that limited access?

Other problems:

* *.swf is NOT accepted by Commons, because it is a proprietary format (though widespread)
* Wink is free, but ''is not'' Open Source

Nevertheless I think, such tutorial sequences would help the Wings3D book a lot. Wings3D itself IS Open Source and my tut's will be licensed under the GFDL (the above one/link IS GFDL, though not noted in the file itself).

Any hint/suggestion is very welcome -- [[User:Deerwood|Deerwood]] ([[User talk:Deerwood|talk]]) 03:18, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

: Like Wikimedia Commons, Wikibooks only supports uploading free formats. So no .swf files can't be uploaded and Wikibooks has no control over that. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:26, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks Darklama for your quick answer. I spent several hours tonight to find a working converter from *.swf to *.svg for the Wink output without success so far, search phrase 'convert swf to svg', from the most prominent links then: the one free online service isn't alive any more and 'Flash Exploit' seems to be unable to do that. Illustrator might be able to do it, but is ruled out because it's not free at all (and I don't have it). If onyone has another hint for a converter or some other way (including some scripting solution) to produce *.svg I would like to hear about it. -- [[User:Deerwood|Deerwood]] ([[User talk:Deerwood|talk]]) 03:56, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

::: With bookshelves, each bookshelf must be edited. With subject pages, editing the book is all that is required in most cases. Some bookshelves have already been turned into redirects to subject pages. More are likely to follow as more books currently listed on bookshelves are listed on subject pages. By following the new system and not editing bookshelves, bookshelves can be more quickly phased out or replaced. The links on the main page will likely be updated once people can use subjects to find all the books they use to be able to find on bookshelves. The less people use the bookshelves to list new books the sooner they can be phased out or replaced IMO. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:16, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

Hi!

I am writing with regard to

This falls under the aegis of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, NDLTD, www.ndltd.org.  One version of the Guide was developed with NDLTD and UNESCO financial support. Some of the students working with me revised this and put it into Wikibooks.  I serve as Executive Director for NDLTD.

Can someone explain that?

== Subject pages. ==

Since bookshelves are being depricated, it has lead me to wonder if there is a nice way to make to make the development stages appear on the subject page. Does anyone know of one? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:01, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

: I can't think of any. In the past there has been discussion on whether or not the development stages even make sense because books can continue to be developed indefinitely. The &quot;development stages&quot; aren't really stages of development either, there signs of progress towards completion. 0% complete, 25% complete, 50% complete and 100% complete. When I think of &quot;development stages&quot; I think of a development life cycle, which goes something like: drafting/outlining, expanding, refining, correcting, and repeat by rewriting. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:57, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

:: Is the plan to also deprecate putting the development stage next to the books title on what ever page we list books on? All your comments about what a development stage are are interesting.  I just find it handy to know how complete the authors feel the book is when I am opening it up.  Somehow I always felt that was one of the strengths of the project.  Maybe nothing was perfect, but the books themselves often let you know how imperfect. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:28, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
::: I think that would be the result yes. What about featured books? Isn't that useful for knowing what the community feels is ready? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:46, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
:::: Featured books are wonderful! But almost all of the books I have read here have not been featured books.  For me the development stages doesn't tell me about how great a book is, it tells me about where the book is (good or bad).  Featured books being a substitute for development stages would be rather like asking students to submit lists of classes where they received A's instead of submitting their transcript.  It is nice information, but not a substitute.

I suppose as a follow question, is it also necessary to only use automatically generated lists on the subject pages as well? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:29, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

: No its not considered absolutely necessary right now, but its one of the things people wanted to help book contributors. Instead of editing X pages only the main page of the book needs to be edited. Less time spent worrying about organization is more time that book contributors can spend writing. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:46, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

::So one could in theory copy over the information from the book shelf page onto the subject page, leaving the automatically generated lists below, but not necessarily losing the information that is on the book shelf page. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:36, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

::: That would be inadvisable, as subject pages were designed to be dynamically generated.  That would require editing subject pages themselves every time a book's status is changed.  You said yourself that you often have read books that were not featured, so whether a book is at 50% or 100% doesn't even factor into the decision to click the link or not.  If a book's author wants to indicate its progress, they can do so on the title page.  Listing every book manually on the subject pages would be no different than moving the bookshelves from the Wikibooks namespace to the Subject namespace. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:41, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

(unindent) Sure you'd like that information before the level of clicking on the book.  As an editor I seek out books on the list the need improvement, and I look down the list for things that are around 50% complete and try to help.  As a reader I search for things that are further along, since I probably will not benefit if it is not at least 75% of the way.  The fact of the matter is if it is not at a stage I am interested in (such as 0%) I don't click. (Not to mention a book can be 100% complete and not worthy of being featured)  For example, if someone shows up and wants to read about algebra: they may either end up looking at [[Mathematics_bookshelf#Algebra]] or [[Subject:Algebra]].  Which is more helpful?  I would say the Mathematics bookshelf currently gives you some idea of how mature the books are, what level of reader they are for, etc.  I am not trying to make argue we should keep bookshelves, just trying to get people to talk about ideas.

For example, we could create a category for each of 0 25% ... 100% and add books to that category.   Also, I believe some amount of manual editing of subject pages might be necessary.  I thought that wasn't a bad thing, as it was explained to me the point of moving to subjects was more psychological, to free us from the idea that books had to be on one and only one bookshelf, etc.  Weren't we able to automatically generate lists for a while using categories? 

Maybe I should remind myself, why are we moving from bookshelves to Subjects?  And although I am just moaning at this point, why do we still call categories subjects in the links at the bottom of pages? (I am not against these things, I will just be a more effective editor if I understand.) [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:32, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

: Contributors can also feel a book is 100%, while still not being mature enough to benefit readers. Contributors can also feel a book is only 5%, while having enough information to benefit readers. Percentages can be misleading to both readers and contributors. To modify an old saying &quot;Don't judge a book by its percentages&quot;. If you want to know what books need help look at [[:Category:Wikibooks maintenance]] and the related categories. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:48, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

:: To modify another saying, development stages are the worst of all possible systems until you look at what else is available.  Sure the system has faults, but it just seems like we are scrapping it because we would rather not think about a method for implementing it on subject pages.  Books requiring maintenance is nice, it is great when you want to kill some spare time.  But when it comes to books I can realistically contribute content to, I am only interested in one (or possibly two) subjects.  I would like to contribute to everything, but I am not able to.  Hence, lists sorted by subject are helpful. (The same is true when one is looking for a book to read.)  The pages you point to get to be unwieldy.  Yes, some books will always be mis-categorized as to how far along they are, but maintenance tags are arguably in a worse state of affairs.  Realistically, how many books/modules that need to be expanded have a tag?  (If, after hard work, we had every module tagged appropriately the fore mentioned pages would be very difficult to sift through.) Perhaps my experience is skewed, but many books I look at have no tags at all, but still need a lot of work. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:54, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

:I kinda like the idea of having categories for completeness.  Now I'm going to continue the brainstorming (read that as I'm about to propose some lunatic ideas).  Using DPL it would then be easy to sort the books by completeness in a given subject.  Actually, I've been doing this with chapters in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] for maybe two years now, but it's a binary decision - an honor is either done, or it's not.  When a chapter is &quot;done&quot; I tag it with [[:Category:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Completed Honors]], and I have a few pages that sort them by that.  For instance, [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Completed Honors Needing Work]] lists chapters that have instruction for teaching enough of an honor that it could be awarded, but the honor still doesn't provide instruction for meeting every optional requirement.  It would be pretty easy to create a template that transcluded a stage icon based on what category a module is in.  Maybe percentages are the wrong metric, and maybe that would be the real use of the multi-dimensional flagged-revs settings.  Not suggesting that a book's flagged-revs setting be used to sort the books, but rather that books be placed in categories along those lines.  Food for thought.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:54, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I must admit my ignorance and ask:  What is DPL? A multidimensional measure also could work, but it would need to be in a very small dimensional space.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:54, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
:::I don't remember what DPL stands for other than that the D is for dynamic.  It's a way of listing pages (dynamic page listings?) based on the categories they belong to (or do not belong to).  Take a look at [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Completed Honors Needing Work]] (including the markup).  Also see [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Honors Not Yet Complete]] for an example of how to include a page that is in one category but ''not'' in another.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:50, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

::: It's a nice idea, but I have to say that it would be a true ordeal tagging every book with [[:Category:00%]] or a template with a category like that in it.

== Legal/copyright Question: exclusive or non-exclusive transfer of copyright? ==

I have a question about the transfer of my own copyright works into Wikibooks; I looked at the FAQ and did a google search but have not seen the answer elsewhere, and request that the answer be added to the FAQ.

My question is this: when I transfer my own copyright work into Wikibooks, am I granting to the GFDL/Wikibooks an ''exclusive'' or ''non-exclusive'' right to copy (in the sense described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyrights#Transfer_and_licensing)?

I would like to transfer paragraphs/examples from other documents I have written and for which I own the copyright, while still being able to distribute these documents (possibly in large numbers or for money) without inclusion of the GFDL. If I am transferring an exclusive right (as I would to most publishers), then I believe I would have to live within the GFDL as if I had copied the material ''from'' Wikibooks. If I am granting a non-exclusive right to copy, then I can still do what I like with my pre-upload copies that I send ''to'' Wikibooks (even sell the pre-uploaded version, as long as I don't sell an exclusive right to it). With either transfer, the material I upload can be &quot;edited mercilessly and redistributed at will&quot;, which is fine with me.

I could make this point moot by just re-creating fresh variants of the examples I would be uploading, but of course that is slower, and my time is valuable.

Thanks for any answer you can provide. Apologies in advance if this is already clearly stated somewhere and I missed it.
[[User:Davew haverford|Davew haverford]] ([[User talk:Davew haverford|talk]]) 12:20, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

: GFDL lets anyone profit from the work, as well as use it, modify it, etc. Its a non-exclusive right. As the copyright holder you can continue to use the work any way you want. By granting Wikibooks a license you are letting anyone else use it under the GFDL. Businesses could be less willing to pay you though if they know its available for free on Wikibooks, unless you can provide some other benefit(s). Due to a recent decision, you will also have to be willing to grant Wikibooks the right to use the work under the terms of the CC-BY-SA license, and under a combined dual licensing GFDL/CC-BY-SA model, otherwise once Wikibooks copyright model is updated the work will most likely have to be deleted, since it was not available on a wiki under the GFDL prior to November of 2008.

== Image licensing enforcement ==

As I'm categorizing pages and images, I come across many images that people have put on their user pages, especially if I look through [[Special:UncategorizedFiles]].

: In the past I think some have urged that people should be able to include images of themselves on their user page and shouldn't have to use copyleft licenses.

== Force Page Breaks ==

I recently started on a new project, [[Wikijunior:Summer Flowers of Northern New England]].  Having taken up the hobby of photographing wildflowers a couple of years ago, I was asked to put together a small pamphlet for a children's program which will take place at the end of this month.  Thanks to the work I've done over on the [[v:Bloom Clock]], gathering pictures and providing text for all the flowers that bloom around my stomping grounds will not be a problem.  Getting it to print decently '''will'' be though, at least for me.  I'm planning to use the MediaWiki collections feature, but right now it's breaking my tables across mutiple pages.  I would really like to be able to force a page break between each table.

I hacked together a template [[:Template:WJ Flower]] for this project, so any page break stuff would be easiest there.  I guess.  If anyone wants to pretty up my template a bit, I would certainly welcome such efforts.  One thing I still want to do is use the &quot;color&quot; field to paint a stripe across the top of the page (table?) and along the left margin.  Actually, I will need the stripe on the left margin for half, and on along the right margin for the other half.  Or maybe it would be easier to do both (then I can rearrange and add extra flowers without re-justifying the margins on all subsequent pages).

Are page breaks even possible?  Should I be looking at a different solution?  Latex? (I don't have time for that learning curve). Import html into OpenOffice and then fiddle with it?

Any help is greatly appreciated. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:30, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

:Page breaks are possible with the traditional way of printing (the link &quot;printable version&quot; in the &quot;toolbox&quot; and then you would use the functionality of your browser for printing) and the template {{tlx|Newpage}}. Collections don't support page breaks as far as I know. An alternative would be to have each table on its own wiki page, wouldn't it? LaTeX and OpenOffice would also be feasible alternatives. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:30, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

:::Thanks Martin.  Making each plant its own chapter did force page breaks.  Unfortunately, the output is still not what I'm looking for.  The pdf generator insists on putting the full page name at the top of each chapter.  Couple that with the WB naming policy, and you get one ugly mess.  It's also making some &quot;chapter&quot; cross page boundaries in awkward places and overlapping blocks of text.  I'm probably going to import this into OpenOffice and work with it that way.  Or maybe Inkscape, I dunno.  It sure would have been nice to be able to buy a hardcopy from PediaPress. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:56, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

Heya Jim. Have a look at the layout on [[Organic_Horticulture_in_the_Mid-Atlantic/Chenopodium_album]]. It's designed so that you can transclude all of the pages so that it shows the header differently (like [[Organic_Horticulture_in_the_Mid-Atlantic/Print_version_6.16.08-001]]). The template at the bottom of the page includes a directive not to print the interwiki boxes. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:41, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

::Heh, I'm around, just not on WV ;-). The top of the pages in that book have a separate &quot;title&quot; (the large centered text), so when the page is transcluded, that serves as the title rather than the actual page title. I make my pdfs by just &quot;printing&quot; on my own computer, but then saving as a pdf rather than putting on paper and then uploading that file. Might be a MacOS thing though, not sure.

== Need some (minimal) help testing ==

Several days ago I [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance#Request_for_test | asked for some help]] on the Administrative Assistance part of the Reading room, but so far no one has stepped forward. Perhaps that was the wrong forum. So, let me try here.

I have created a [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js |helper script]] that removes useless back links in reference and footnote data created by the [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/doc |Bref template]], which I also wrote. Since this template and helper script is located in my user namespace, I wish to confirm that it works in someone else's namespace as well. I am pretty sure it will, but a test will confirm it. I could create a dummy user on Wikibooks and do the test myself, but I thought that would be both a waste of Wikibooks resources and perhaps contravene the '''no sockpuppets''' policy.

Testing should take no more than 5 minutes or less. First, look at the [[User:Dnessett/Bref Examples/Example1/References | Example 1 References]] and the [[User:Dnessett/Bref Examples/Example4/References | Example 4 References]]. You should see back links at the beginning of each reference. Then do one of two things. Create a personal per-book page for the examples (which should be named User:&lt;your user name&gt;/per_book/Bref_Examples.js) and add the following to it: importScript('User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js'). If you do not wish to create a personal per book page for the test, simply place importScript('User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js') in your skin's javascript file (e.g., User:&lt;your user name&gt;/monobook.js for the Monobook skin). The go to both [[User:Dnessett/Bref Examples/Example1/References | Example 1 References]] and [[User:Dnessett/Bref Examples/Example4/References | Example 4 References]]. The back links should no longer appear. You can then delete the importScript('User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js') from the page where you put it. Let me know the results. Thanks in advance. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 15:15, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

== Wikipedia style link? ==

I recently came across [[Quaternion]] which seems to be a wikipedia style link to something else on the subject.  It seems prudent to me to recommend this page for deletion, for many reasons but the simplest of which would be naming conversions.  But I thought I would check and make sure I understand how things are usually done first. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:08, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

: The author moved the page above to [[Fractals/Quaternion Fractals]], so it's now part of a book. They could have created the page at the current location and created a redirect at the first location, but it's the same result. They did this so that if someone types &quot;quaternion&quot; in the search box to the left, they will go to [[Quaternion]], which then directs them to the relevant page in the [[Fractals]] book. This allows the use of Wikibooks subpages, with Wikipedia ease of use in obtaining information on a subject just by typing it in the box. The only time this doesn't work is if two books cover the same topic. Then, who gets the use of the prime main-space redirect?  Hopefully that clarifies what was being done. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:22, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
: A lot of pages similar to that were recently created and moved into the Fractals book. Given that there new some time should be given for them to develop. In general such pages would qualify for speedy deletion because they aren't textbook material. The redirects caused by the moves qualify for speedy deletion once they are orphaned. There isn't really any benefit when searching because pages in books containing a search term will be found. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:58, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
:: True, Darklama. To play Devil's Advocate, though, people might say they prefer having those redirects remain in order to bypass the search results page.

== Request for comments. ==

I had recently attempted to go about improving the Subject page for Mathematics.  My idea was to set up something which looked a bit more specialized then the standard template which many of the subject pages have (No offense to WhiteKnight or anyone involved with creating this template, who have done terrific work).  The layout of the mathematics bookshelf page gives a rough idea about how advanced various mathematical texts are.  I thought this was an excellent idea, and wanted to do something similar with the Subject page.  My idea was to set up categories which gave books based on the difficulty of the book and use these to set up automatically generated lists.  A simple mock up, which is by no means meant to be complete, can be found at my [[User:Thenub314/sandbox|sandbox]]   As I started this I discovered there was a feeling that this couldn't be done.  In particular, Darklama and I have been deep in discussion about how feasible an idea this was. This may be read at my [[User talk:Thenub314#University_level_mathematics|talk page]].  (The conversation starts off as a bit of an argument but gets more peaceful as time goes on.) We have seemed to reach nearing some consensus on the one category I have created so far, apart from the proper name for it.  

When it became clear that I intended to create other categories Darklama felt I had gone far enough and I should involve the reading room before creating any more categories.  That about gets us up to present. I would love to hear any comments that people have. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:31, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

: Wikibooks' history of using levels for the math bookshelf only extends back 3 years. What levels to use or even whether to use levels at all doesn't seem to have ever been really discussed on the talk page for the math bookshelf. However I notice some past comments on the talk page for math bookshelf where people have voiced there views that there approach would be better without generating any discussing. If there has been discussion over the past 3 years it seems to have been done elsewhere. I think Thenub313 and I have gotten stuck on how to move forward. Rather then leaving the situation as it has happened in the past I think what to do or how to organize the math books could benefit from some more community input and involvement. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:59, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

I think in general organizing math books by difficulty is going to be difficult to achieve. I think this is why this approach was never adopted for other subjects. How can books be organized by difficulty in a way that isn't dependent on how a specific country rates a subject's difficulty or a person's personal opinion on how difficult learning a specific subject is? I can understand and see how doing so could be useful, but how can Wikibooks make it useful for a general audience or so it is useful for most people? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:59, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

: It was adopted for books on languages, using [[Language Learning Difficulty for English Speakers]] to file them in subcategories of [[:Category:Languages by category]]. This was not difficult, however, as the differences and even the filing of specific books was defined by an outside party. It would be nice if there were an outside source to classify mathematical topics difficulty-wise, as one person doing it will be tainted by either personal opinion or nationality. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:13, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

:: That book also admits the rankings are specific to a specific institute in the US, and that many people may disagree with a language's ranking. So even the difficulty of learning a language is tainted by nationality. I think it would be a good for Wikibooks to have some consensus on using difficulty rating in general. If the Wikibooks community decides that difficulty ratings are a good idea, I think it would be good for Wikibooks to have some consensus or even a guideline on how best to categorize books by difficulty. Like is using the US standard for Languages acceptable? Would it be acceptable to use a US standard for Math books too? Should multiple standards to be used instead? Should Wikibooks come up with its own definition of difficulty levels? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:31, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

::(this may be redundant because of an edit conflict, but including it anyways) Perhaps it is worth playing devil's advocate and pointing out that it is not clear this would alleviate all of Darklama's concerns. The outside party that created this list of difficulty was a US government body. It is not immediately clear to what extent their numbers reflect all native English speakers, or if this is strongly skewed toward Americans. To quote him this page represents how &quot;a specific country rates a subject's difficulty&quot;. My question would be should we get rid of this page because it may be biased? (And should I not attempt to categorize because I may be biased?) [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:50, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

::: Yes, to what extent the rankings reflect all or most native English speakers is not clear. Probably the only way to ensure clarity is to ensure that whatever approach is used for ranking difficulty levels is backed up by community consensus and a community process. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:24, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

:::: For mathematics, I would think that rather than rating by difficulty, texts should be rated by prerequisites?  So Algebra should not be attempted until Arithmetic has been mastered, and Calculus should not be attempted before Algebra is.  This approach would eliminate the subjective standards.  In my experience, the thing that makes mathematics difficult is a poor foundation.  If the prerequisites are not met, it's going to be tough-going.  It might ''still'' be tough going with the prerequisites in place, but IMO, it's a lot easier once they are met.  No idea how to translate this thought into a wiki structure though. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:34, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

::::: That is actually the approach I suggested to begin with. Wikibooks has {{tlx|prerequisite}} for that. However that doesn't seem to be enough to satisfy what Thenub314 wants. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:00, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

:::::: I actually like the idea of getting the books to state more clearly what the prerequisites are.  There are a few subjects where it is not the end of the story.  Let me give a few examples of what I think issues are.  The topic of algebra at the moment has several texts at various levels of difficulty.  These books would have the same set of prerequisites, but it may be useful to explain which is geared toward a more advanced audience.  

:::::: A second issue is that many subjects do not have clear prerequisites (notice the books here may disagree with me on this point).  Examples here might include Group Theory, Topology, Formal logic, Euclidean Geometry.  Any mathematical subject that starts with the axioms and then goes forward could be thought of as facing this kind of issue.  So it would be nice to have a way to describe if a book is written for elementary school students or college students. If such a range seems absurd, I could simply point to Euclidean Geometry as a subject that has books at every level.  The Formal Logic book handles this issue by stating explicitly at the beginning it is for a college level audience and looking through the book I agree.  At the end of the the day, I would like to categorize Formal logic that way.  I should point out though that Darklama has already made the comment that this sentence is inappropriate and should be removed from the book because of cultural concerns as to what college or university means. 

:::::: The only last comment I would make about prerequisites is that we should probably encourage people not to point to other wikibooks to say &quot;You should know the contents of this book&quot;.  On the one hand, very few math books here have matured enough to actually cover the topics they intend to.  On the other hand books also go through very drastic overhauls every once and a while, so it is not a very stable piece of information.  The abstract algebra points to Linear algebra and Algebra as things one should know before starting this book, the reader may be left wonder what exactly it is he or she should know. Because both Algebra and Linear Algebra have (for a while) been in a state that is halfway merged with other books and are not particularly readable at the moment.  (Though I am doing what I can as quickly as I can to correct this.)  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 18:52, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

::::::: Difficulty levels aren't any more stable due to books being overhauled. Books can also start with Arithmetic and work up to Trigonometry or some other branch of mathematics, or touch on each major branch of mathematics. Such books might have varying degrees of difficulty. The mathematics bookshelf only tries to make a distinction between introductory books and higher education books. Consider that a higher education book could also be introductory. Difficulty levels won't tell you why a book is considered easy or hard, while prerequisites can give you some idea of why you may have difficulty understanding what a book covers and can point readers in the right direction. I think it would be far more useful to say &quot;If you have trouble understanding or following this algebra book, try these algebra books&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:02, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

:::::::: I never meant to imply difficulty levels were were stable under major overhauls, just that it seems a bad practice to use the books here to describe prerequisites.  I disagree with that the book shelf simply has two categories and no further distinctions.  The subject of algebra is clearly subdivided between elementary and intermediate.  Perhaps more subtlety is the sequence that books appear in more or less follows the usual sequence of prerequisites.  Let me state more explicitly that I think mathematics texts should have clearly defined prerequisites.  I agree that the information &quot;If you have trouble understanding this book...&quot; is helpful, I would just like to attempt to convey this information in a clear and consistent manner.  And as I stated above, (and I will provide article references if you desire), there are not clear prerequisites for every subject.  Furthermore, with some of these subjects we have multiple books at different levels. Prerequisites themselves do not solve he problem. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:16, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

: Perhaps it would be difficult. Thankfully some of the work categorizing has been done before at the bookshelf page, and we have that to learn from. While books moved from one place to another from time to time, at no point did it seem to cause much controversy. While no one can guarantee that they are 100% neutral, this is not quite a reason not to try to make things better. I think the bookshelf page is more useful the the current subject page, regardless of nationality. And I would like to keep that from disappearing.

:: To me the discussion page looks like people have tried to avoid problems or controversy by avoiding discussions when people have tried to initiate discussion. I think the bookshelf might suffer from apathy rather than the organization lacking controversy. I don't think there is much that can be gleaned or learned from the way the bookshelf is organized because of the absence of discussion over its organization. Basejumper123 mention the reorganization was for easier reference, but doesn't provide any insight explaining why [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Mathematics_bookshelf|diff=456999&amp;oldid=456991}} further reorganization] was done. [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf|diff=1161890&amp;oldid=1156043}} the current approach] also was explained but not discussed. On the talk page [[Wikibooks talk:Mathematics bookshelf#Catalogue for High School|High School Cataloging]] is suggested,  on [[Wikibooks talk:Mathematics bookshelf#Reorganize Bookshelf|reorganizing the bookshelf]] someone suggests that general, advance and special be replaced by grade levels, and another person suggested that [[Wikibooks talk:Mathematics bookshelf#We need a dependency tree.21|we need a dependency tree]]. I'm not criticizing the changes or absence or discussion, but rather pointing out that it makes it difficult to understand why the current approach is used and not some other approach. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:24, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

::: I do not see apathy, and I find the suggestion a bit insulting. I was around in 2006 shortly after Basejumper123 categorized the books and if I hadn't liked what I saw, I would have left a comment.  The posts you point to seem to be people requesting further categorization, which I think speaks to the fact that this is something users would find helpful.  Instead of apathy, what I see reflected is the a small group of editors, whose interest was not piqued by the suggestion of further categorization as a new project to take on.

== Strange behavior of the subject template? ==

Probably this is not very interesting, but here goes anyways. While attempting to categorize some pages from the list of uncategorized pages I came across [[Grab_a_Screen_/_Edit_Screen_Grab_-_Paint]], allow me not to state my opinion of its contents.  I wanted to put this under [[Subject:Computer software]]. I noticed after adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subject|Computer software}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; that computer software did not appear on the category list at the bottom of the page.  It occurred to me that this page has a slash in its title, which may have thrown off the template.  Prehaps it did not add the Computer software category because this page appears to be title &quot;_Edit_Screen_Grab_-_Paint&quot; and part of the book &quot;Grab_a_Screen_&quot;  It seems that the Wikimedia software didn't parse this title in the same way because there was no redlink pointing back up to &quot;Grab_a_Screen_&quot; at the top of the page.  After double checking [[WB:NP]] there doesn't seem to be any policy preventing someone from placing a slash in the title of a book, so I thought that this may be a minor bug in the subject template. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:08, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

== TextBox Template ==

In some of my work on the Linear algebra book I have come across the rather annoying problem.  If anyone could explain why this happens to me I would be grateful.  The {{tlx|TextBox}} template seems to respect the last line break of the last &quot;paragraph&quot; but no other.  To explain what I mean in the two text boxes below there are two &quot;paragraphs&quot;, the first paragraph is the same in both text boxes and all line breaks are ignored.  The second paragraph on the first text box is contained all on one line, and displays correctly.  In the second text box there are many line breaks but only the one that occurs between the bold words '''LINE''' and '''BREAK''' appears (At least on my browser.)  Questions I have: Is it a user issue (meaning am I doing something wrong?) Is this dependent on browser? Is there a nice way to stop that line break from occurring?

Assume that &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in\mathcal{R}_\infty(t)\cap\mathcal{N}_\infty(t) =\mathcal{R}(t^n)\cap\mathcal{N}(t^n) &lt;/math&gt;,
to prove that &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt; \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt; is in the nullspace, &lt;math&gt; t^n(\vec{v})=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;.
On the other hand, because &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{R}(t^n)=\mathcal{R}(t^{n+1}) &lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt; t:\mathcal{R}_\infty(t)\to \mathcal{R}_\infty(t) &lt;/math&gt;
is a dimension-preserving homomorphism and therefore is one-to-one. A composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, and so
&lt;math&gt; t^n:\mathcal{R}_\infty(t)\to \mathcal{R}_\infty(t) &lt;/math&gt;
is one-to-one. But now&amp;mdash; because only &lt;math&gt; \vec{0} &lt;/math&gt; '''LINE'''
'''BREAK''' is sent by a one-to-one linear map to &lt;math&gt; \vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash; the fact that &lt;math&gt; t^n(\vec{v})=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

I've fixed the problem with the template. The problem may seem odd, but the problem was that the closing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; was on the same line. MediaWiki is suppose to suppress paragraph breaks (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) for two lines of text without any intermediate line breaks, however at the same time MediaWiki is also suppose to put paragraph breaks around the start and end of text if there is tag, while trying to predict if that is appropriate. I think there is a bug because its suppose to suppress a paragraph break if the div is on the same line which it does, but it seems to be depending on there being a line break so finds the previous line break, which it shouldn't do, and puts the paragraph break there. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:54, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

: In case it is of interest, there is no line break between '''LINE''' and '''BREAK''' in either of the two paragraphs on my browser (Safari 4.0, Mac OS X 1.4.11) (Perhaps because the template is fixed?). [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 14:32, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks Darklama, that does indeed fix the problem, which will speed up my processing a great deal.

== Very confused while trying to upload image ==

I've spent bits of several days trying to figure out how to upload and make use of an image in a wikibook I'm starting (specifically, [[Visualizing Computation]]).

I have learned to use Inkscape and discovered and dealt with some obscure issues (such as why you don't want to have a non-integer canvas size), and now am just trying to install the image on the wikimedia commons and use it in on wikibooks.

I have uploaded an [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/wiki/File:Power_log_med.svg image to wikimedia commons] and tried to refer to it from the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visualizing_Computation/Memory_Evolution_Diagrams appropriate wikibooks page], but I seem to be getting the old version of the file (which has the same name, but lives on wikibooks instead of the commons).

Can someone please (a) take a look at the wikibooks page and tell me if the reference is being done in the right way, and also (b) delete the Power_log_med.svg file from wikibooks so that my reference will reach the one on wikimedia commons (telling me how to do (b) is even better, but my understanding is that this requires administrator access).

(note that I'm planning to add [[Visualizing Computation]] to the list of new books once I've got at least ''one'' good page made).

Thanks,
[[User:Davew haverford|Davew haverford]] ([[User talk:Davew haverford|talk]]) 19:54, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

(Upon re-checking, I've noticed that I ''do'' seem to be getting the current version of the image, but it looks oddly pixellated on my screen; I'd still be happy to have the wikibooks version of the image deleted, and be interested in advice about how to improve the image visual quality, which as I understand it should ''never'' be poor with an SVG. [[User:Davew haverford|Davew haverford]] ([[User talk:Davew haverford|talk]]) 19:59, 19 June 2009 (UTC))

(p.p.s. the image looks fine on my Mac running Firefox, but pixellated on Ubuntu Linux running Firefox. This may be a platform-dependent rendering issue. I'm going to stop worrying about technology and focus on uploading good content when I get back to this on Monday.

I just tried adding the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to a new users page.

[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:31, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

== How to start?? ==

I guess I'm a little lost about how to &quot;CREATE&quot; a &quot;BOOK&quot;?  Under the tab &quot;create a book&quot; I click &quot;add page to book&quot; and it just adds a book to a collection.  Is that how you begin a book?  Maybe someone can lead me to the appropriate place on the site where I can begin creating my own Wikibook.

Thanks in advance...
~Uber Lost

: Well, long story short, you can search for the title you want.  If a book by this title doesn't already exist then it will show you a list of possible matches. Just above this list there will be a message There is no page titled .... You can create this page. You can click on the &quot;create this page&quot; redlink to do exactly that.  You can find this, and possibly other useful information, in the book [[Using Wikibooks]].  Have fun! [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:47, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

== Software help ==

Is wikibooks a good place to software documentation such as [http://www.geogebra.org/help/docuen/ GeoGebra Help 3.2]? The application has the [http://www.geogebra.org/download/license.txt source code under GNU General Public License v2] but the Documentation Files are (currently and unfortunately) under Creative Commons Attribution-'''NonCommercial-NoDerivs''' 3.0. So, I a user of GeoGebra and a pt.wikibooks collaborator I would like to contact Markus Hohenwarter (markus at geogebra org) asking about his interest in using Wikibooks for future versions of the documentation. What do you think? [[pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]20:21, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

: Wikibooks would be a good place to write a book documenting that software program. You would have to document the program from scratch though, unless the person or persons who owns the copyright to the help docs agrees to relicense. As you might of guessed, works submitted to Wikibooks must allow commercial uses and derivatives. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:32, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
:: Right! I will ask them about this... Some time ago Markus gave us permission to use screen shots of GeoGebra in Wikimedia projects, via OTRS (for example, this one: [[:File:Geogebra.png|Geogebra.png]]). So, maybe they can also extend the permission for Documentation... This would be a lot better than start the book from scratch =)

:: By the way, how to delimit when such a wikibook documenting the software is a derivative work of the original documentation and when it is a new work that uses that documentation as reference? [[pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]21:12, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
:: Another question: what do you think about [http://www.geogebra.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=1893 this discussion] at GeoGebra forum, related to Wikibooks? Leave a comment there too... =) [[pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]21:03, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

:::In a nutshell...
:::'''Derivative work''' uses previously produced content.
:::'''references''' are used when a few snippets of content (phrases) are used in the resulting work or to give credits to the original content authors if the new work is build on ideas, concepts or discoveries made elsewhere. They are also useful to provide the reader with other related sources of content or to extend the usefulness of the book without extensible overlapping previously produced content that doesn't fall perfectly in the scope of the new book, or can't be copied verbatim. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:07, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

::: For derived works there is no standardized way to do it exactly. A common practice is to create an authors or copyright page to list the attributions. &quot;This book contains ''work'' written by ''who'' and is released under ''what''&quot;. You could also add that to the talk page for each page in which you derived works from. You could also use the edit summary to include a link to the work your copying from. You could do all three for completeness and to be thorough. A bibliography-like page is often used to link to or list works used as a reference. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:26, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

Folding in unsweetened whipped cream makes it light and airy.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound cooked macaroni
* 1 cup mascarpone cheese
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream, beaten to soft peaks
* 3 tbsp sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour
* 2 cups heavy cream

== Procedure ==
#Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook until light blond color is achieved.
#Add remaining ingredients except for macaroni and beaten cream. Bring to a boil until reduced by half. Remove from heat and gently fold in cream.
#Place macaroni in the bottom of a 9x13 square baking pan. Pour cheese mixture over and bake in a 350° oven for 25 minutes or until bubbly on top and puffed up. Remove and serve.</text>

}}

The 4072 is a member of the [[Practical_Electronics/IC/4000 Series|4000 Series]] [[Practical_Electronics/CMOS|CMOS]] range, and contains two independent [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#OR|OR gates]], each with four inputs. The pinout diagram, given on the right, is the standard four-input CMOS logic gate IC layout:

:*Pin 7 is the ground supply (GND)
:*Pin 14 is the positive supply (V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;)
:*Pins 2-5 and 9-12 are gate inputs for the two gates
:*Pin 1 and 13 are gate outputs
:*Pin 6 and 8 are not connected

The truth table for one of the two gates is shown below. For more information about the OR gate in general, see this [[Practical Electronics/Logic#OR|module]].

{{center|'''Truth Table for a Single Gate'''}}
{{Truthtable4
|A|B|C|D|Q|0|1|1|1 |1|1|1|1 |1|1|1|1 |1|1|1|1}}

This chip is widely available, and usually comes in a [[Practical_Electronics/IC/DIL|DIL]]-14 or [[Practical_Electronics/IC/SOIC|SOIC]]-14 package.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Wings3D file format (version 2). ==

See http://wings3d.com/ for the Open Source modeller written in Erlang.

Important source files to look at: .../src/wings.hrl and .../src/wings_ff_wings.erl.

One more reference is the [http://www.servechilled.de/ogrestuff/w2o.zip exporter implemented in Perl] which is outdated.

Please note, that there is '''current development of Wings''' in progress ''changing also the file format'', so it is advisable to stall work on this document, until the file format stabilized again.

=== Overall structure ===

A *.wings file has 3 main parts:

; 1. Header:
: The header is 15 bytes long and essentially ASCII, formed by the human readeable string &quot;#!WINGS-1.0&quot; followed by the hex bytes 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x04 aka &quot;\r\n^Z^D&quot; aka CR, LF, SUB and EOT (Ctrl-Z being the &quot;end of input&quot; char in Windows and Ctrl-D the same in UNIX).
; 2. Length of data:
: A 4 byte unsigned integer giving the size of the entire file, stored in big-endian format. This value should match the size of the file on disk, otherwise the file is missing data.
; 3. Data:
: The main part of the file in Erlang's [http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html External Term Format] as of section 8.1; specifically it is a ''Zlib-compressed'' term as indicated by the first two bytes 131, 80. The next 4 bytes thus are an unsigned integer giving the size of the uncompressed data. The rest of the file is the actual compressed data/term.

: When processing *.wings files with Erlang or a language having a full blown interface (in the Erlang distribution exists a [http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erl_interface/index.html C interface] and a [http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/index.html Java interface], there is also a [http://www.lysator.liu.se/~tab/erlang/py_interface/ Python interface] elsewhere) you just feed the whole data part to the appropriate function/method.

: But when dealing with *.wings files in some other language, these 6 bytes might be seen as additional header information, the rest must be uncompressed and then further be handled to reconstruct the nested structure of the term.

To get an impression of how a simple Wings model looks in Erlang syntax (after uncompressing; manually reindented and commented/linked to emphasize structure and help):

                { emission,  { 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0 } },
                { shininess, 1.0 },
                { specular,  { 1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 } }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ], [[#Materials|% Materials end]]
      [  [[#Props|% Props]]
        { scene_prefs, [] },
        { plugin_states, [] }
      ]  [[#Props|% Props end]]
    }
  }

You'll spot the two essential compound Erlang datatypes '''tuple''' (indicated by braces as in {something,someother,somemore}) and '''list''' (indicated by square brackets [elem1,elem2,...], some '''atoms''' (the all lower case strings without quotes in this sample, e.g. wings, edge, plugin_states), a string (&quot;tetrahedron1&quot;), some binary data (indicated by double angle brackets with byte values inbetween &lt;&lt;0,1,2,3&gt;&gt;) and some integer and float values. And you see, this is all heavily nested (e.g. a list of lists of tuples).

=== External Term Format ===

When you can't use an existing interface (or want to write a new one), you have to know the ''external'' format of Erlang terms, which is [http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html very well documented here]. Note, that you then have to deal with a stream of bytes and must reconstruct the nested structure yourself somehow. For reference, the Erlang/OTP source code has a module called &quot;jinterface&quot; that gives a Java implementation of a set of classes that can read this format.

To process *.wings files you should be prepared to at least be able to deal with

* 8.4  SMALL_INTEGER_EXT
* 8.5  INTEGER_EXT
* 8.6  FLOAT_EXT
* 8.7  ATOM_EXT
* 8.11 SMALL_TUPLE_EXT
* 8.13 NIL_EXT
* 8.14 STRING_EXT
* 8.15 LIST_EXT
* 8.16 BINARY_EXT

=== The Topmost Tuple ===

The topmost data structure after expanding is a ''tagged'' tuple with 3 elements:

# The atom 'wings', identifying this as a wings file.
# The integer (2) indicating the file version.
# another tuple having 3 elements, namely ''[[#Shapes|Shapes]]'', ''[[#Materials|Materials]]'' and ''[[#Props|Props]]''.

A compliant loader should check for the presence of the first 2 elements, and verify that the third element is a 3-tuple.

=== Shapes ===

The Shapes section consists of a ''list'' of objects, each of which is a quadruple (4-tuple) describing every separate object. The object quadruple has the following format:

# The ''tag'' atom 'object'.
# A string with the name of the object, such as &quot;tetrahedron1&quot;
# Another quadruple containing the object's actual data, tagged by the atom 'winged' (as in the winged-edge data structure). This tuple is described in the next section.
# A list containing information about plug-in states and selection mode for this object. Generally, this isn't used in an importer/exporter.

==== The Winged Edge Datastructure ====

'''Wings3D''' uses the [http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/model/winged-e.html winged edge data structure] enabling it to be exceptionally fast on all operations involving ''neighborhood'' operations (e.g. edge looping). The *.wings file format stores these winged edge data structures directly, therefore the majority of the data is stored within the edges themselves rather than in tables (such as *.3ds or *.X file formats).

The tagged tuple 'winged' contains all of the data required to define the object's geometry. It takes the following format:
# The atom 'winged' (tag)
# A list containing a series of lists, each defining an edge.
# A list containing a series of lists, each defining a mapping between a face and a material.
# A list containing a series of lists, each defining a vertex.
# A list, usage unknown as of now -- nil in examples.

In the first list (edge data), a series of lists is found, with each list defining an edge. In each edge's list, the following tuples may appear. Note that a tuple may not appear more than once in each edge's list or else Wings will be unable load it, and the order in which they appear does not matter.
 
* Tagged 9-tuple 'edge': Defines the winged edge data structure and must be present. Has the format of:
*# The atom 'edge' (tag)
*# Start Vertex
*# End Vertex
*# Left Face
*# Right Face
*# Left Predecessor
*# Left successor
*# Right predecessor
*# Right successor
* Tagged 2-tuple 'color_rt': Defines right vertex edge color. Has the format of:
*# The atom 'color_rt' (tag)
*# 12-byte binary blob representing the color value in RGB notation. Each component is stored as a 32-bit single precision floating point value.
* Tagged 2-tuple 'color_lt': Defines left vertex edge color. Has the format of:
*# The atom 'color_lt' (tag)
*# 12-byte binary blob representing the color value in RGB notation. Each component is stored as a 32-bit single precision floating point value.
* Tagged 2-tuple 'uv_rt': Defines right vertex UV coordinate. Has the format of:
*# The atom 'uv_rt' (tag)
*# 16-byte binary blob representing the UV coordinate, with 8-byte floating point values for each number.
* Tagged 2-tuple 'uv_lt': Defines left vertex UV coordinate. Has the format of:
*# The atom 'uv_lt' (tag)
*# 16-byte binary blob representing the UV coordinate, with 8-byte floating point values for each number.

As of Wings 1.1.15, both UV and vertex colors may be found in this list. Previously, only one or the other could be found.

In the second list (material data), there is an entry for every face defined by the previously read winged edge structures.
* If the face has no material (the default material), then the item in the list is nil.
* If the face has a material, the entry is a list containing a tagged 2-tuple in the format of:
*# The atom 'material' (tag)
*# The atom of the material name, such as 'tetrahedron1_auv'. This is a reference to the materials section.

==Introduction==
When the purchase of new equipment or construction exceeds the amount of $10,000 a school district must purchase the equipment through a competitive public bid.  For a technology director a bid might be required for the following items:
:*Creating, maintaining, and Updating Networks
:*Laptop purchasing for school buildings
:*Large Scale software purchasing
:*Any construction associated with the development of technology infrastructure
The bid process has many steps and can last for 4 to 6 months from creating the bid to final school board approval.  In the end the proposed bid will go to the lowest bidder that meets all of the bid specifications.  The bidding process is dominated by detailed specifications that aim to protect the school district and potential vendors.  These specifications and conditions govern every aspect of bidding from creation to completion.   While bidding is an important part of a Technology Directors position, it is becoming less frequently used for hardware purchases due to &quot;state contracts&quot; or cooperative purchasing agreements such as PEPPM and CoStars.  Bidding is still an essential part of technology construction.  The first part of this page will look at putting together a bid proposal, followed by alternate ways to get around the bid process.  The following information is a general guideline for the bid process, however a technology director would need to look into specific district and state regulations on bidding.  

==How to Put Together a Bid==
[[File:puzzlepiece.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]
&lt;h5&gt;'''Step 1: Generating the Bid Proposal or Bid Spec'''&lt;/h5&gt;

Before a bid can be created a school district needs to assess their needs and figure out what equipment will work best in their situation or what construction is required.  There are many ways a district can gather this information.  
A need can be identified through (More about planning can be found in [[Directing Technology/Purchase]]):
:*Faculty interviews
:*Site visits to other schools
:*Administrative request
:*Curriculum needs
The need for new technology or construction can be the vision of a few people or the need of the whole district.  The planning process is especially important in creating specifications for a bid.  Specifications are the specific details of technology or construction that the district needs.  At the end of the bid process the school district will need to accept the lowest submitted bid that meets all the outlined specifications, so it is imperative that the specifications outline exactly what the district wants.  On the other end, the district cannot become so specific as to request certain brands or companies.  In the specifications the school district will also need to outline the time frame for the bid.  Specifications are a reason why many technology departments will use alternatives (discussed below) to bidding for the purchase of hardware.  If specifications are too general a district might end up with an inferior product that does not meet their needs or if the specifications are too specific they can actually drive away suitable bidders&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, T.(personal communication, June 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;. 
For smaller purchases or equipment, the tech director might write the bid on their own, however for larger items or construction, a consultant or engineer might be hired to assist in creating the specifications.  This can assure that the bid accurately reflects the needs of the school district.  Specifications can range from memory and screen size in the purchase of laptops, to the specific types of wires and jacks used in construction.

In addition to creating a detailed set of specifications that describe the item or service needed, a bid should also include &quot;Conditions&quot; that protect the school district during the bidding, purchasing, receiving and installation process.  These Conditions cover everything from providing clearly marked samples, to completing the bid in the given time specifications, to what documents need to be submitted to meet the bid requirements.  A school district should have a list of general Conditions for the bidding procedure, however individual bids may have special conditions that are unique to that project.  
{|cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 border=5
|-
|These are a few Conditions from a bid put out by the Wissahickon School District:
:*The Board has the right to accept or reject all or any portion of the bids submitted and to make the award in the best interest of the School District.
:*The Bidder agrees that if the contract is awarded to him, he will not assign. transfer, or sublet it, unless specific permission to do so is granted in writing by the School District.
:*The bidder agrees, if awarded the contract, to furnish and deliver the said items at such times, at such places and in such quantities as herein specified, and that all of the items shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the board.
The complete Bid Invitation and Specifications can be found at the [http://www.wsdweb.org/Portals/0/Schools/WSD_DO/Bid%20Form%20and%20Instructions%20March2009.pdf Wissahickon School District Website].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsdweb.org/Portals/0/Schools/WSD_DO/Bid%20Form%20and%20Instructions%20March2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
|}


Once the technology director has put together a bid proposal that clearly states what the district needs, outlined the time table for the completion of the bid, and created additional conditions to protect the district, it is time time move onto the next step.

&lt;h5&gt; Step 2: Publicly Advertise the Bid&lt;/h5&gt;

Many school districts have a section of their websites dedicated to posting bids.  This is one way to publicly advertise the bids for vendors and contractors.  District bid pages are not limited to technology related bids, but rather contain all district bids ranging from food services to new construction.  These are a few examples of district bid pages: 
:*[http://www.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/procurement/bidschedule.htm Philadelphia School District]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/procurement/bidschedule.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[http://www.soudertonsd.org/district/finance/bids/ Souderton Area School District]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soudertonsd.org/district/finance/bids/&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[http://www.npenn.org/5577902321255/blank/browse.asp?a=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;c=52181&amp;5577902321255Nav=|140|&amp;NodeID=286 North Penn School District]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npenn.org/5577902321255/blank/browse.asp?a=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;c=52181&amp;5577902321255Nav=|140|&amp;NodeID=286&lt;/ref&gt;

Some districts will also post bid advertisements on sites such as [http://www.eschoolmall.com/ESM/default.aspx eschoolmall.com]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eschoolmall.com/ESM/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  This is a website that links schools and vendors in the bidding process, and also helps manage the bid process for the school district.

In the state of Pennsylvania it is required that a school advertise the bid in at least two local newspapers.  The newspaper bid notice should include several details about the bid including:
:* Where and when the sealed bid proposals are due
:* Where bid documents can be picked up and associated costs for documents
:* Items or construction that is up for bid
:* Time and location of pre-bid meetings
:* Any additional conditions that apply to the bid
:* Contact information for person issuing bid&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, S. (2009, May 13)Bidding notice.'' Souderton Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the bid has been advertised in a local newspaper, the district needs to get a Proof of Publication notice for file.  This proves the bid was properly advertised to the public.  This document will contain a copy of the ad, name of newspaper, and the dates it appeared in the newspaper.  It will also need to be notarized.

&lt;h5&gt;Step 3: Release Request for Proposal(RFP)&lt;/h5&gt;
After making the public aware of the bid, an RFP will be handed out to potential vendors or contractors.  This can be done in person, at a pre-bid meeting, through a district website, or through a third part website.  The RFP will contain all of the specifications and conditions created during the initial step of the bid process.  A basic template for an RFP can be on the Planning page or [http://www.netdynasty.com/articles/business/rfp/rfp_template/ here]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netdynasty.com/articles/business/rfp/rfp_template/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Completed examples of RFPs can be found on many district websites such as [http://web.beaufort.k12.sc.us/education/components/docmgr/default.php?sectiondetailid=565&amp;catfilter=7&amp;PHPSESSID=7e1b321129b43a13992d9001f46eeb50#showDoc Beaufort County School District]&lt;ref&gt;http://web.beaufort.k12.sc.us/education/components/docmgr/default.php?sectiondetailid=565&amp;catfilter=7&amp;PHPSESSID=7e1b321129b43a13992d9001f46eeb50#showDoc&lt;/ref&gt;  A complete RFP should contain district information, bid specifications, time frame for bid submission and notification, submission process, proposed time frame for project completion, and contact information.  

&lt;h5&gt; Step 4: Receive and Publicly Open Bids &lt;/h5&gt;
All details surrounding the submission process should be clearly defined in the RFP.  Specific dates and time, and recipient of the submission should be included.  It should be mentioned that bids not submitted in the proper manner will not be opened. Bids are usually submitted in a sealed envelope with a label specified in the RFP.  Districts can require a paper submission, electronic submission or both.  Electronic submissions can take the form of diskettes, CD-ROMs, emails, or submission through a third party website.

Immediately after the stated deadline of submitting bids, all bids will be publicly opened

&lt;h5&gt;Step 5: Reviewing the Bids&lt;/h5&gt;
Once bids have been publicly opened, they are reviewed by the involved district members.  This can be a matter of comparing apples to oranges.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, T.(personal communication, June 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, the lowest qualified bid will need to be selected.  A technology director will need to look closely at whether the proposed bids meet all the set specifications.  This is where well thought out and detailed specifications can make or break a bid.   A technology director cannot choose a bid based on a preferred brand or company.  A bid can only be selected for low costs and meeting bid conditions.  Reviewing bids is a complicated task and depends on the bids submitted and the quality of the bid specifications.  The final decision can be difficult since it needs to ensure the district receives a quality product or service that meets all of its needs, and also meets the legal aspects of the bidding process.     

&lt;h5&gt;Step 6: Submit Recommendation to Submit Bid for Final Approval&lt;/h5&gt; 
After a bid proposal has been selected by the technology director or involved parties, it is placed on the school board agenda for final approval.  During the school board meeting it is possible that further discussion about the bid selection will occur.  To complete the process the school board will need to accept the bid proposal.

&lt;h5&gt;Step 7: Purchasing or Construction&lt;/h5&gt;
Upon approval of the bid proposal, items can be purchased or construction can begin.  In the RFP there should be time frames for the completion of the bid.  Conditions of the bid will outline what will happen if a vendor or contractor cannot meet deadlines or bid specifications.  RFP conditions will also dictate the payment for items or services by the school district.  The entire process of bidding can take as few as two months, but usually lasts up to six.

==Alternates to the Bid Process==
Since the bid process can be complicated and may not yield desired results, there are alternatives that a technology director might want to consider.  The following sites work best for the purchase of technology hardware and do not offer the best alternative to technology construction.  Each state has different options, however most are programs that have pre-negotiated prices on common pieces of technology.  Selected vendors submit prices for items, and those prices are available to the district without bidding. Some programs may include construction costs.  This eliminates the need for a bid and guarantees the district will receive exactly want they want.  Without having to go through the bid process, a district can save time and money that can be spent on other things.  

[http://www.peppm.org/pa/default.htm PEPPM]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peppm.org/pa/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt; PEPPM is a multi-state program that allows the purchase of products at pre-negotiated prices from different vendors.  PEPPM acts as a mediator, accepting orders and giving them to selected vendors.  Ordering can be done online or off-line by faxing a purchase order.  Purchase orders will follow individual vendor instructions, but will be sent to PEPPM.  E-rates can also be applied to purchases.

This allows local public procurements, such as schools to purchase items at a lower price.  Vendors submit bids to COSTARS for review, and reduced prices are then opened up to public procurements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SwisTrack supports a headless mode, that runs without a GUI for batch processing.  It lives in swistrack/Code/batch as a separate application binary. To use it, compile it by running &quot;make&quot; in that directory.  Run it by passing the configuration file on the command line. 

Here's an example:
&lt;code&gt;

$ cd swistrack/Examples/leurre/

$ ../../SwisTrackEnvironment/SwisTrack-batch ./leurre.swistrack

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}

This chapter illustrates the various steps in the design of an embedded system by means of a concrete example: an automated [[w:people mover|People Mover]].

==Introduction==
[[Image:BPLRT-ExtMid-CX100.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A [[w:Bombardier_CX-100|Bombardier_CX-100]] people mover in Signapore's [[w:Light Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Light Rapid Transit]].]]

To get a better understanding of the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process|Design Process]] an example of an ECS is studied.
The various phases of the design process are discussed with regard to the example. 

The selected ECS for the example is the ''[[w:People mover|(automated) people mover]]''. Information of what a people mover is can be found on its [[w:People mover|wikipedia]] page.

==Phases of the design process==
This chapter discusses the different phases of the design process. Please note that the design process is not black and white but gray. That is there are many different ways to get to a design and there most certainly is no ultimate design process in which no interpretation or intellect is necessary.

These discussions give you an idea of what kind of information is necessary in which phase of the design process.

The chapter [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Design_criteria|Design Criteria]] explains the approach of a design on a system level. It's useful to read this chapter first before you read further on.

===Requirements definition===
Goal of this phase is the ''product requirements'' document. It is a list of important requirements that can't be omitted.
In this example, the product requirement document is:
* Railway is given by client, specifications are known.
* Lay-out of the people mover is 1 locomotive with 1 (or more) carriages.
* Vehicle is driven by electric motor.
* Power for the motor comes through the rails.
* The railroad needs to by equipped with beacons at known locations.
* Locomotive is equipped with a beacon sensor.
* Every beacons yields its own reaction. 3 kinds of reactions exist:
** Speeding up with a certain amount.
** Slowing down with a certain amount.
** Stopping with a given deceleration.
* Safety measures.
* Headlights and internal illumination must switch on when it's dark.
* A control tower:
** must know the speed and position of the people mover at all times.
** must be able to take over control of the people mover when necessary.

===System specifications===
Here the requested behaviour of the system is described. Some specifications are:
* Wanted speeds dependent of the position (every corner has a different speed).
* What to do in case of certain scenario's (i.e. a fire, a rail block, ...).
* How fast to stop.
* Where are the different stops.
* ...

===Functional design===
The functional design phase defines which subprocesses and subsystems are necessary in the system.
[[Image:subsystems_peoplemover.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 1: Subsystems for the vehicle system of an automated peoplemover]]
[[Image:subsystems_communication.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 2: Interaction between subsystems]]
The system can be divied into three main parts:
* Traffic command system
* Control command system (= wireless communication)
* Vehicle command system

The vehicle command system can be divided further into subsystems. In the end it leaves a total of 7 subsystems:
* Wireless communication: Implements the transfer of information from the control tower to the train and vice versa.
* CPU: Is the brain of the people mover. All information is centralized and afterwards divided over the different subsystems. 
* Power: Is responsible fot the motor, its management system, ... 
* Control loop: Makes the control loop of the drive. 
* Sensors: Gathers information of the environment.
* Mechanical design.
* Esthetic design.

Figure 1 gives a schematic overview of the subsystems. The interaction between the different subsystems is presented in figure 2.

===Detailed design===
This phase results in a concrete structure of all modules from which the system must be made. The functional design is worked out on the component level. After this phase the only thing left is the implementaton. This phase can be thought of as the translation of the functional requirements into technical specifications.

===Implementation===
Building and testing prototypes of the system. Eventually leading to the production model. This phase needs no further explanation.

==Design context==
The chapter [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process#Design_contexts|Design Contexts]] explains the different contexts of a design.

The people mover is either a ''from scratch environment'' or an ''adapting environment'', depending on the presence of a previous model. The implications of a certain design context also are discussed in the section [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process#Design_contexts|Design Contexts]].

==System complexity==
The chapter [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Categories_of_system_complexity|System Complexity]] explains the different categories of systems as a function of their complexity as well as the definition of complexity itself.

Using this chapter it's clear that the people mover is a system of type 2: '''Distributed hardware - Centralized control'''.
Perhaps in the future, when different autonomous people movers (of different companies) all use the same railroad system, the necessity of distributed control becomes obvious and this ''system of systems'' would be of the complexity class type 3. Note the analogy with [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Aviation#Air_Traffic_Control|air traffic control]].

==Process vs system control==
[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Process_control_vs_system_control|Process vs System control]] describes 2 types in which ECS can be divided.
The people mover, with its clear subsystems, is clearly of the type '''system control'''.</text>

      <comment>Created page with '{{Logic_IC |number = 4068 |logic_type = Combinatorial |func_family = Logic |description = 8-Input NAND/AND Gate |pins = 14 }}  The 4068 is a member of the [[Practical_Electronics...'</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Logic_IC
|number = 4068
|logic_type = Combinatorial
|func_family = Logic
|description = 8-Input NAND/AND Gate
|pins = 14
}}

The 4068 is a member of the [[Practical_Electronics/IC/4000 Series|4000 Series]] [[Practical_Electronics/CMOS|CMOS]] range, and contains a single 8-input [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#NAND|NAND gate]], and, on some models the inverted output (i.e. an [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#AND|AND gate]]). The pinout diagram, given on the right, is the standard eight-input CMOS logic gate IC layout:

:*Pin 7 is the ground supply (GND)
:*Pin 14 is the positive supply (V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;)
:*Pins 2-5 and 9-12 are gate inputs for the gate
:*Pin 1 and 13 are gate outputs. Pin 1 is not always available.
:*Pin 6 and 8 are not connected.

The NAND gate gives a high output for any combination of inputs, except when all inputs are high. The AND gate only gives a high when all inputs are high.

::&lt;math&gt; Q = \overline{A \cdot B \cdot C \cdot D \cdot E \cdot F \cdot G \cdot H } &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \overline{Q} = A \cdot B \cdot C \cdot D \cdot E \cdot F \cdot G \cdot H  &lt;/math&gt;

This chip is widely available, and usually comes in a [[Practical_Electronics/IC/DIL|DIL]]-14 or [[Practical_Electronics/IC/SOIC|SOIC]]-14 package.

An 8-input NAND gate is available as the TTL [[Practical_Electronics/IC/7420|7430]], but no AND gate is available.</text>

|description =This wildflower likes sunny, open spaces, and can survive in dry, sandy soils.  It grows to a height of three to eight feet.  The yellow rays of the flower surround the yellow florets in the center disk, making a flower about 3 inches in diameter.  The leaves are shaped like a tear-drop, and range from one to four inches long.  The leaves are sessile ('''Sess'''-ile) meaning they attach directly to the stalk without a stem.  
|facts = Native Americans used the root of this plant to rid themselves of worms.

|description =The word ''Cinquefoil'' means ''five leaves''.  There are about 500 species of cinquefoil worldwide, and several of them grow in New England.  Some are tall, and some are very short.  Most have leaves with five leaflets on them, with the leaflets having toothed edges.  Some have stems that creep along the ground and plant their own roots.  Some have fruits that look very much like wild strawberries.  The ones in New England have yellow flowers ranging from birght yellow to a creamy yellow.
|facts = Some people eat Cinquefoil leaves in salads.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Use margin: 0 auto on elements with a defined width to horizontally center block level containers 

Use margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; instead of margin:0 auto; on elements with a defined width in HTML emails to horizontally center block level containers

Use margin: 0 auto; display: table; to horizontally center content that has an undefined width in standards compliant browsers

Use text-align: center; for the container and text-align: left, display:inline-block, and display:inline (in a separate declaration to trigger hasLayout) on the block element to horizontally center content that has an undefined width in IE6 and IE7. 

Use text-align: center for the container, display:inline-block(-moz-inline-box for Firefox 2) for the wrapper div, and display:inline for the content div to horizontally center content that has an undefined width across browsers. 

Set the wrapper div to display:inline in a subsequent IE specific declaration to trigger hasLayout. 

Set the content div to display:-moz-inline-box in a subsequent declaration to trigger the Firefox 2 experimental layout. 

In case the centered content wraps, use width:99% for the wrapper div to avoid issues in Firefox 3+ and Webkit browsers (Safari, Iron, Chromium, Chrome, etc). Add a fixed width div nested in the wrapper to address this in Firefox 2. The final cross-browser CSS follows this pattern:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.container { text-align:center; }

/* Use width of less than 100% to avoid Firefox 3+ and Webkit wrapping issues */
.wrapper { width: 99%; }

/* Use inline-block for wrapper and placeholder */
.wrapper { display:-moz-inline-box; display: inline-block; }

.ie67 .wrapper, .content { display:inline; }

.content { display:-moz-inline-box; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&gt;
  &lt;body class=&quot;ie67&quot;&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;![if (!IE) | (gt IE 7 )]&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
&lt;![endif]&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;fff&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;ggg&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Use display: table; height: 100%; for the container and display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; for the content to vertically center content that has an undefined height in standards compliant browsers. Use height:100%; for the html and body tags as well if the container is the first child of the body.

Use position: relative; top: 50%; for the container and position: absolute; top: -50% for the content to vertically center content that has an undefined height in IE6 and IE7

Use line-height equal to the height of the container to vertically center images. Use font-size equal to the the height of the container as well in IE6 and IE7.

Use position:relative; and top:-50%; left:-50%; to center content that as an undefined width and height inside an absolutely positioned container with a defined width and height

Use height:100% for the html tag, body tag, container and an empty placeholder element plus display:inline-block; (-moz-inline-box for Firefox 2) and vertical-align: middle for the content and placeholder to vertically center content that has an undefined height across browsers. If an empty inline-block element (for example a span) is added inside the container and it is assigned height: 100%; vertical-align: middle then it allows to precisely get what we want: a line box with the desired height. The placeholder element is given 100% height to prop up the line box, so that vertical-align: middle has the desired effect. This will avoid the need for the aforementioned IE specific relative positioning workaround due to the lack of cross-browser support for display:table compared to display:inline-block. If the content is a block element, add display:inline in a separate declaration for IE6 and IE7 to trigger the hasLayout behavior. The final cross-browser CSS follows this pattern:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
html, body, #container, #placeholder { height: 100%; }

#content, #placeholder { 
display:inline-block; 
vertical-align: middle; 
}

*#content{display:inline;}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
        Vertically centered
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;span id=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Use the aforementioned vertical centering pattering with display:inline for the content div and display:inline-block to an extra nested wrapper div to vertically center an image gallery in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome(no change needed in IE or Opera). Make sure the width of the wrapper is less than 100% to avoid the inline-block bugs in those browsers as well. Here is the cross-browser pattern:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
html, body, .container, .placeholder { height: 100%; }

img { width:16px; height:16px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px; }

/* Use width of less than 100% for Firefox and Webkit */
.wrapper { width: 99%; }

.placeholder, .wrapper, .content { vertical-align: middle; }

/* Use inline-block for wrapper and placeholder */
.placeholder, .wrapper { display: inline-block; }

.ie67 .wrapper, .content { display:inline; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&gt;
  &lt;body class=&quot;ie67&quot;&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;![if (!IE) | (gt IE 7 )]&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
&lt;![endif]&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://microsoft.com/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://mozilla.com/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://webkit.org/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://userbase.kde.org/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.srware.net/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://build.chromium.org/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.apple.com/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;http://opera.com/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;
            ...
            ...
       &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Specify the line height to be the same as the height of the containing element to vertically center inline text

Use margin-top: xxx (where xxx is equal to the height of the container div minus the height of the centered element). Divide this value by two to vertically center a block element

Use margin-left: xxx (where xxx is equal to the width of the container div minus the width of the centered element). Divide this value by two to horizontally center a block element  

Use top: 50% and margin-top: -xxx(where -xxx is equal to half of the defined height in pixels) to center absolutely positioned content vertically

Use left: 50% and margin-left: -xxx(where -xxx is equal to half of the defined width in pixels) to center absolutely positioned content horizontally

Use a rel pos span with display:inline-block and top:-50%; left:-50% and a higher z-index than the abs pos parent to center content inside an abs pos container. This uses an IE bug where a container's computed height is used for positioning instead of its height value

Use vertical-align to center images and text on the same line. Use pixel or percentage values if top, middle, or bottom are inconsistent. The sub, super, text-top, or text-bottom values are unreliable for cross browser consistency

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a terrific compilation, and a good model for ABC books that I have my kindergarten students make.  Just two of the flower pictures raised questions for me: The nasturtium pictured is  a nasturtium by genus, but its common name (from what I discovered on several websites) is watercress.  What gardeners know as nasturtium is in the genus Tropaeolum.  It is common, beloved, edible, and would make more sense here.  Similarly (and this is more of a quibble), yarrow may look like this to some folks, but most of us think of it as white or yellow.

Has not been updated since April 2006.  Main contributor stopped contributing at that time as well.  Even disregarding the limited scope of a book on Merrimack, New Hampshire election results, there are only two pages other than the title page.  The first (for 2002) is an outline with only a smidgen of information filled in and the other (for 2005) is a tiny stub.  I can't imagine anyone else coming along to document information that is of such a limited scope.  Should someone really need to know who was elected in 2002-2006 in Merrimack, New Hampshire, I have great confidence that they will find it in the public domain.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:23, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

I'm ready to support every word I say. again the book isn't ready yet. I will work on it. if what I mentioned was true would you accept it? your organization (like HRW and Amnesty) is claiming that we violate the human rights and keep moaning about it and they don't stop trying to change our systems, can't I write about that? can't I write what is mentioned in our books?

Change the scope of the book with the intent to cover every religion's perspective, or change the name of the book to better reflect its scope and audience. You previously suggested the book should be renamed and the only contributor seems to be open to changing the name, so that solution should probably be done. &quot;Islam In The World&quot;, &quot;Understanding The Islamic World&quot; and &quot;Understanding The Rights Of Islamics&quot; would all probably better reflect the scope of the book.

As stated by Darklama, this book will be treading a thin line on NPOV unless it takes on all of the Muslim views, not just author's view/interpetation of the Koran.

== Needs help ==

This book needs help.  I've started on the [[../Netherlands]] portion, but I do not have the expertise to keep going.   There's problems with lack of NPOV, Islam websites in English (so it can't be easily verified by a mostly English speaking audience), and lack of substance. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 10:28, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

:There are some unbalanced points but the book is being watched very carefully here since it was VFD (the issues it raises and the need to clarify them makes it well worth the trouble), this subject is very prone to ruffle some feathers but the scope of the book is very interesting and any lingering issues are due mostly because of lack of knowledge as you state.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:12, 22 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Post Effects are image alterations applied to an image after it has been rendered but before it is saved. For example, the &quot;FrameBurn&quot; Post Effect will add a frame number to the upper right corner of a rendered image

In Animation:Master Post Effects are applied to a [[../Camera/]] in a [[../Choreographies|Choreography]].

== Loading a Post Effect ==

In the Project Workspace (PWS) window:

'''Post Effects folder&gt;RMB&gt;New&gt;Post Effect'''

A new &quot;Post Effect&quot; will appear in Post Effects folder. Then:

'''Post Effect&gt;RMB&gt;Change Type to&gt;Hash Inc.&gt;'''''select a post effect from list''

== Using a Post Effect ==

A post effect must be applied to a Camera in a Choreography. 

Either drag the Post Effect from the Post Effects folder onto the desired camera, or '''select the camera&gt;RMB&gt;New&gt;Post Effect&gt;'''''select a post effect from list''

When going to render, '''Buffers&gt;Apply camera's Post Effects to renderings''' must be ON in the Render Settings dialog.

== Obtaining Help ==
For each package you have a ''reference manual'' available as an HTML file from within R or as a PDF on the CRAN website. You also often have ''Vignettes'' or comprehensive articles in the R Journal, the Journal of Statistical Software, etc.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt;library(help=&quot;package_name&quot;)
&gt;vignette(&quot;np&quot;,package=&quot;np&quot;)
&gt;vignette(all=FALSE) # vignettes for all attached packages
&gt;vignette(all=TRUE) # vignettes for all packages on the computer
&lt;/source&gt;
You can search for help inside all loaded packages using &lt;tt&gt;help()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;. Usually you do not need to add quotes to function names but for sometimes it can be useful. &lt;tt&gt;args()&lt;/tt&gt; gives the full syntax of a function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; help(lm)
&gt; ?lm
&gt; ?&quot;for&quot;
&gt; ?&quot;[[&quot;
&gt; args(&quot;lm&quot;)
function (formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = &quot;qr&quot;, 
    model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE, 
    contrasts = NULL, offset, ...) 
NULL
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;apropos()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;find()&lt;/tt&gt; looks for all the functions in the loaded packages containing a keyword or a regular expression&lt;ref&gt;If you want to know more about regular expressions, have a look at the [[R_Programming/Text_Processing#Regular_Expressions | Regular expressions]] section in the [[R_Programming/Text_Processing | Text Processing]] page.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; apropos(&quot;norm&quot;)
  [1] &quot;dlnorm&quot;         &quot;dnorm&quot;          &quot;plnorm&quot;        
  [4] &quot;pnorm&quot;          &quot;qlnorm&quot;         &quot;qnorm&quot;         
  [7] &quot;qqnorm&quot;         &quot;qqnorm.default&quot; &quot;rlnorm&quot;        
 [10] &quot;rnorm&quot;          &quot;normalizePath&quot; 
&lt;/source&gt;

You can search for help in all installed packages using &lt;tt&gt;help.search()&lt;/tt&gt; or its shortcut &lt;tt&gt;??&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; ??&quot;lm&quot;
&gt; help.search(&quot;covariance&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;RSiteSearch()&lt;/tt&gt; looks for help in all packages and in the R mailing lists. The '''sos''' package improves the &lt;tt&gt;RSiteSearch()&lt;/tt&gt; function with the &lt;tt&gt;findFn()&lt;/tt&gt; function. &lt;tt&gt;???&lt;/tt&gt; is a wrapper for &lt;tt&gt;findFn()&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; RSiteSearch(&quot;spline&quot;)
&gt; library(&quot;sos&quot;)
&gt; findFn(&quot;spline&quot;, maxPages = 2)
&gt; ???&quot;spline&quot;(2)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;hints()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''hints''' package suggests what to do with an object.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fit &lt;- lm(y ~ x)
&gt; library(&quot;hints&quot;)
&gt; hints(fit) # returns a list of function using lm objects.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Conditional execution == 

* Help for programming : 
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; ?Control
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; accepts a unidimensional condition.
&lt;pre&gt;
if (condition){
     statement  
     } 
else {
     alternative
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;ifelse()&lt;/tt&gt; command takes as first argument the condition, as second argument the treatment if the condition is true and as third argument the treatment if the condition is false. In that case, the condition can be a vector. For instance we generate a sequence from 1 to 10 and we want to display values which are lower than 5 and greater than 8. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- 1:10 
&gt; ifelse(x&lt;5 | x&gt;8, x, 0)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  0  0  0  0  9 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Loops ==

R provides three ways to write loops: for, repeat and while. The &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; statement is excessively simple. You simply have to define index (here k) and a vector (in the example below the vector is 1:5) and you specify the action you want between braces. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; for (k in 1:5){
+ print(k)
+ }
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
&lt;/pre&gt;
When it is not possible to use the for statement, you can also use break or while by specifying a breaking rules. One should be careful with this kind of loops since if the breaking rules is misspecified the loop will never end.
In the two examples below the standard normal distribution is drawn in as long as the value is lower than 1. The cat() function is used to display the present value on screen.
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; repeat { 
+ 	g &lt;- rnorm(1) 
+ 	if (g &gt; 1.0) break 
+ 	cat(g,&quot;\n&quot;)
+ 	} 
-1.214395 
0.6393124 
0.05505484 
-1.217408 
&gt; g &lt;- 0
&gt; while (g &lt; 1){
+ 	g &lt;- rnorm(1) 
+ 	cat(g,&quot;\n&quot;)
+ 	}
-0.08111594 
0.1732847 
-0.2428368 
0.3359238 
-0.2080000 
0.05458533 
0.2627001 
1.009195
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Implicit loops === 

Loops are generally slow and it is better to avoid them when it is possible. 
* &lt;tt&gt;apply()&lt;/tt&gt; can apply a function to elements of a matrix or an array. This may be the rows of a matrix (1) or the columns (2).
* &lt;tt&gt;lapply()&lt;/tt&gt; applies a function to each column of a dataframe and returns a list. 
* &lt;tt&gt;sapply()&lt;/tt&gt; is similar but the output is simplified. It may be a vector or a matrix depending on the function.
* &lt;tt&gt;tapply()&lt;/tt&gt; applies the function for each level of a factor.

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x2 &lt;- rnorm(N) + x1 + 1
&gt; male &lt;- rbinom(N,1,.48)
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x1 + x2 + male + rnorm(N)
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2,male)
&gt; lapply(mydat,mean) # returns a list
$y
[1] 3.247

$x1
[1] 0.1415

$x2
[1] 1.29

$male
[1] 0.5

&gt; sapply(mydat,mean) # returns a vector
     y     x1     x2   male 
3.2468 0.1415 1.2900 0.5000 
&gt; apply(mydat,1,mean) # applies the function to each row
 [1]  1.1654  2.8347 -0.9728  0.6512 -0.0696  3.9206 -0.2492  3.1060  2.0478  0.5116
&gt; apply(mydat,2,mean) # applies the function to each column
     y     x1     x2   male 
3.2468 0.1415 1.2900 0.5000 
&gt; tapply(mydat$y,mydat$male,mean) # applies the function to each level of the factor
    0     1 
1.040 5.454 
&lt;/pre&gt;

* See also &lt;tt&gt;aggregate()&lt;/tt&gt; which is similar to &lt;tt&gt;tapply()&lt;/tt&gt; but is applied to a dataframe instead of a vector.

=== Iterators ===

* Loops in R are generally slow. &lt;tt&gt;iterators&lt;/tt&gt; may be more efficient than loops. See this entry in the [http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/07/counting-with-iterators.html Revolution Computing Blogs]

== Standard linear model ==
In this section we present estimation functions for the standard linear model estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS). Heteroskedasticity and endogeneity are treated below. The main estimation function is &lt;tt&gt;lm()&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Fake data simulations ===
We first generate a fake dataset such that there is no hetereoskedasticity, no endogeneity and no correlation between the error terms. Therefore the ordinary least square estimator is unbiased and efficient. We choose a model with two variables and take all the coefficients equal to one. 

&lt;math&gt;
y_i = 1 + x_{1,i} + x_{2,i} + u_i
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x2 &lt;- 1 + x1 + rnorm(N)
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x1 + x2 + u
&gt; df &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Least squares estimation ===
* The standard function to estimate a simple linear model is &lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;lsfit()&lt;/tt&gt; performs the least square procedure but the output is not formatted in fashionable way.
* &lt;tt&gt;ols()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Design''') is another alternative.

We estimate the model using &lt;tt&gt;lm()&lt;/tt&gt;. We store the results in &lt;tt&gt;fit&lt;/tt&gt; and print the result using &lt;tt&gt;summary()&lt;/tt&gt; which is the standard function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fit &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
&gt; summary(fit)
&lt;/source&gt;

There are some alternative to display the results. 
* &lt;tt&gt;display()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''arm''' package is one of them. 
* &lt;tt&gt;coefplot()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''arm''') graphs the estimated coefficients with confidence intervals. This is a good way to present the results. 
* &lt;tt&gt;mtable()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''memisc''' package can display the results of a set of regressions in the same table. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;arm&quot;)
&gt; display(fit)
&gt; coefplot(fit)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;fit&lt;/tt&gt; is a list of objects. You can see the list of these objects by typing &lt;tt&gt;names(fit)&lt;/tt&gt;. We can also apply functions to &lt;tt&gt;fit&lt;/tt&gt;.

We can get the estimated coefficients using &lt;tt&gt;fit$coeff&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;coef(fit)&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fit$coeff
(Intercept)          x1          x2 
  1.2026522   0.8427403   1.5146775
&gt; coef(fit)
(Intercept)          x1          x2 
     0.7541      1.7844      0.7222 
&gt; output &lt;- summary(fit)
&gt; coef(output) 
             Estimate Std. Error  t value    Pr(&gt;|t|)
(Intercept) 1.1945847  0.2298888 5.196359 0.001258035
x1          0.6458170  0.3423214 1.886581 0.101182585
x2          0.6175165  0.2083628 2.963660 0.020995713
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;se.coef()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''arm''') returns the standard error of the estimated coefficients.

The vector of fitted values can be returned via &lt;tt&gt;fit$fitted&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;fitted(fit)&lt;/tt&gt; or the &lt;tt&gt;predict()&lt;/tt&gt; function.
The &lt;tt&gt;predict()&lt;/tt&gt; function also returns standard error  and confidence intervals for predictions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
&gt; fit$fitted
&gt; fitted(fit)
&lt;/source&gt;

The vector of residuals:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fit$resid
&gt; residuals(fit)
&lt;/source&gt;

The number of degrees of freedom :

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fit$df
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Confidence intervals ====
We can get the confidence intervals using &lt;tt&gt;confint()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;conf.intervals()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''alr3''' package.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; confint(fit, level = .9)
                   5 %     95 %
(Intercept) -0.7263261 1.200079
x1          -0.5724022 1.909924
x2           0.6185011 2.475079
&gt; confint(fit, level = .95)
                 2.5 %   97.5 %
(Intercept) -0.9652970 1.439050
x1          -0.8803353 2.217858
x2           0.3881923 2.705388
&gt; confint(fit, level = .99)
                 0.5 %   99.5 %
(Intercept) -1.5422587 2.016012
x1          -1.6237963 2.961319
x2          -0.1678559 3.261436
&gt; library(alr3)
&gt; conf.intervals(fit)
                 2.5 %   97.5 %
(Intercept) -0.9652970 1.439050
x1          -0.8803353 2.217858
x2           0.3881923 2.705388
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Tests ====
&lt;tt&gt;coeftest()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''lmtest''') performs the Student t test and z test on coefficients. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;lmtest&quot;)
&gt; coeftest(fit) # t-test
&gt; coeftest(fit,df=Inf) # z-test (for large samples)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;linear.hypothesis()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''car''') performs a finite sample F test on a linear hypothesis or an asymptotic Wald test using &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2&lt;/math&gt; statistics.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;car&quot;)
&gt; linear.hypothesis(fit,&quot;x1 = x2&quot;) # tests Beta1 = Beta2
&gt; linear.hypothesis(fit,c(&quot;(Intercept)&quot;, &quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;),rep(1,3)) # Tests  Beta0 = Beta1 = Beta2 = 1
&gt; linear.hypothesis(fit,c(&quot;(Intercept)&quot;, &quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;),rep(0,3)) # Tests  Beta0 = Beta1 = Beta2 = 0
&gt; linear.hypothesis(fit,c(&quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;),rep(0,2)) # Tests Beta1 = Beta2 = 0
&lt;/source&gt;

See also &lt;tt&gt;waldtest()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''lmtest''') for nested models.

==== Analysis of variance ==== 
We can also make an analysis of variance using &lt;tt&gt;anova()&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; anova(fit)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Model Search and information criteria ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; # Akaike Information Criteria
&gt; AIC(fit)
[1] 26.72857
&gt; # Bayesian Information Criteria
&gt; AIC(fit,k=log(N))
[1] 27.93891
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''stats4''' package includes &lt;tt&gt;AIC()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;BIC()&lt;/tt&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(stats4)
&gt; ?BIC
&gt; lm1 &lt;- lm(Fertility ~ . , data = swiss)
&gt; AIC(lm1)
[1] 326.0716
&gt; BIC(lm1)
[1] 339.0226
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;step()&lt;/tt&gt; functions performs a model search using the Akaike Information Criteria. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10^3
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x2 &lt;- rnorm(N) + x1
&gt; x3 &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; y &lt;- 1+ x1 + x2 + u
&gt; fit &lt;- lm(y~x1+x2 + x3)
&gt; step.fit &lt;- step(fit)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Zelig ====
* The method is also supported in '''Zelig'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x + u
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x)
&gt; z.out &lt;- zelig(y ~  x, model = &quot;ls&quot;, data = mydat)
&gt; x.out &lt;- setx(z.out, x = 10)
&gt; s.out &lt;- sim(z.out, x.out)
&gt; summary(s.out)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Bayesian estimation ===
* &lt;tt&gt;MCMCregress()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''MCMCpack''')
* &lt;tt&gt;BLR()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''BLR''')
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x + u
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x)
&gt; 
&gt; posterior &lt;- MCMCregress(y ~ x, data = mydat)
&gt; summary(posterior)
&gt; plot(posterior)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Heteroskedasticity ==
* See the '''lmtest''' and '''sandwich''' packages.
* &lt;tt&gt;gls()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''nlme''') computes the generalized least squares estimator.
* See &quot;Cluster-robust standard errors using R&quot; [http://people.su.se/~ma/clustering.pdf (pdf)] by Mahmood Arai. He suggests two functions for cluster robust standard errors. &lt;tt&gt;clx()&lt;/tt&gt; allow for one-way clustering and &lt;tt&gt;mclx()&lt;/tt&gt; for two-way clustering. They can be loaded with the following command &lt;tt&gt;source(&quot;http://people.su.se/~ma/clmclx.R&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10 # 10 people
&gt; T &lt;- 5 # 5 times
&gt; id &lt;- rep(1:N,T)
&gt; f &lt;- rep(rnorm(N),T) # is individual specific
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N*T)
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N*T) 
&gt; x2 &lt;- rnorm(N*T) + x1
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x1 + x2 + f + u
&gt; fit &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 )
&gt; source(&quot;http://people.su.se/~ma/clmclx.R&quot;)
&gt; clx(fit, 1, id)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;
See also &lt;tt&gt;outlier.t.test()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''alr3''' package.

* &lt;tt&gt;inf.index()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''alr3''' package computes all the robustness statistics (Cook's distance, studentized residuals, outlier test, etc)
* &lt;tt&gt;rlm()&lt;/tt&gt; performs a robust estimation 

* See [http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/rreg.htm UCLA example]

* &lt;tt&gt;tsls()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''sem''' package.
* It is also possible to use the &lt;tt&gt;gmm()&lt;/tt&gt; command in the '''gmm''' package. See [[R Programming/Method of Moments|Methods of moments]] for an example.

=== Fake data simulations ===
We first simulate a fake data set with x correlated to u, z and u independant and x correlated with z. Thus x is an endogenous explanatory variable of y and z is a valid instrument for x. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; z &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N) 
&gt; x &lt;- 1 + z + u + rnorm(N) # x is correlated with the error term u (endogeneity) and the instrument z
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x + u
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Two stage least squares ===
Then we estimate the model with OLS (&lt;tt&gt;lm()&lt;/tt&gt;) and IV using z as an instrument for x.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; ols &lt;- lm(y ~ x)
&gt; summary(ols) # ols are biased
&gt; library(&quot;AER&quot;)
&gt; iv &lt;- ivreg(y ~ x | z)
&gt; summary(iv) # IV estimates are unbiased
&gt; library(&quot;sem&quot;)
&gt; iv2 &lt;- tsls(y  ~ x, instruments = ~ z)
&gt; summary(iv2)
&gt; library(&quot;gmm&quot;)
&gt; iv3 &lt;- gmm(y ~ x, z)
&gt; summary(iv3)
&lt;/source&gt;

We plot the results : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; plot(y ~ x, col = &quot;gray&quot;)
&gt; abline(a  = 1,b = 1, lty = 1, col = 1, lwd = 2)
&gt; abline(ols,  lty = 2, col = 2 , lwd = 2)
&gt; abline(iv, lty = 3, col = 3, lwd = 2)
&gt; legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;True values&quot;,&quot;OLS&quot;,&quot;IV&quot;), col = 1:3, lwd = rep(2,3), lty = 1:3)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Panel Data ==
&lt;tt&gt;plm()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''plm''') implements the standard random effect, fixed effect, first differences methods&lt;ref&gt;Yves Croissant, Giovanni Millo (2008). Panel Data Econometrics in R:  The plm Package. Journal of Statistical Software 27(2). URL http://www.jstatsoft.org/v27/i02/.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is similar to Stata's &lt;tt&gt;xtreg&lt;/tt&gt; command.

Note that &lt;tt&gt;plm&lt;/tt&gt; output are not compatible with &lt;tt&gt;xtable()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;mtable()&lt;/tt&gt; for publication quality output. 

* '''lme4''' and '''gee''' implements random effect and multilevel models.  
* See also '''BayesPanel'''

=== Random effects model ===
To implement a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model random effects model] we generate a fake data set with 1000 observations over 5 time periods.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; T &lt;- 5
&gt; library(mvtnorm)
&gt; sig &lt;- diag(rep(1,T))
&gt; r &lt;- rmvnorm(N, sigma = sig)
&gt; wide &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:N,f = rnorm(N), u = r)
&gt; long &lt;- reshape(wide, varying = list(3:7), v.names = &quot;u&quot;, direction = &quot;long&quot;, timevar = &quot;year&quot;)
&gt; long$x1 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N*T) 
&gt; long$x2 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N*T) + long$x1
&gt; long$y &lt;- 1 + long$x1 + long$x2 + long$f + long$u
&gt; head(long[order(long$id),])
&lt;/source&gt;

We estimate the random effect model with the &lt;tt&gt;plm()&lt;/tt&gt; function and the &lt;tt&gt;model = &quot;random&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; option.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;plm&quot;)
&gt; panel &lt;- plm.data(long, index = c(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;year&quot;))
&gt; # panel &lt;- pdata.frame(long,c(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;year&quot;))
&gt; eq &lt;- y ~ x1 + x2
&gt; re &lt;- plm(eq, model = &quot;random&quot;, data=panel)
&gt; summary(re)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Fixed effects model ===
For a [[:w:Fixed_effects_model|fixed effects model]] we generate a fake dataset and we correlate the fixed effects f with covariates : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; T &lt;- 5
&gt; library(mvtnorm)
&gt; sig &lt;- diag(rep(1,T))
&gt; r &lt;- rmvnorm(N, sigma = sig)
&gt; wide &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:N,f = rnorm(N), u = r)
&gt; long &lt;- reshape(wide, varying = list(3:7), v.names = &quot;u&quot;, direction = &quot;long&quot;, timevar = &quot;year&quot;)
&gt; long$x1 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N*T) + long$f
&gt; long$x2 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N*T) + long$x1
&gt; long$y &lt;- 1 + long$x1 + long$x2 + long$f + long$u
&gt; head(long[order(long$id),])
&lt;/source&gt;

We first transform our data in a plm data frame using &lt;tt&gt;plm.data()&lt;/tt&gt;.
We estimate the fixed model using &lt;tt&gt;plm()&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;model = &quot;within&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; as an option.
Then, we compare the estimate with the random effect model and perform an Hausman test. 
At the end, we plot the density of the fixed effects.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;plm&quot;)
&gt; panel &lt;- plm.data(long, index = c(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;year&quot;))
&gt; #panel &lt;- pdata.frame(long,c(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;year&quot;))
&gt; eq &lt;- y ~ x1 + x2
&gt; fe &lt;- plm(eq, model = &quot;within&quot;, data=panel)
&gt; summary(fe)
&gt; re &lt;- plm(eq, model = &quot;random&quot;, data=panel)
&gt; summary(re)
&gt; phtest(fe, re)
&gt; plot(density(fixef(fe)))
&gt; rug(fixef(fe))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Dynamic panel data ===
* &lt;tt&gt;pgmm()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''plm''') implements the Arellano Bond estimation procedure&lt;ref&gt;
M Arellano, S Bond &quot;Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations&quot;  - The Review of Economic Studies, 1991
&lt;/ref&gt;. It is similar to &lt;tt&gt;xtabond2&lt;/tt&gt; in Stata&lt;ref&gt;David Roodman, XTABOND2: Stata module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator, http://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s435901.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Sweave ==

{{Wikipedia|Sweave}}

'''Sweave'''&lt;ref&gt;The Sweave Homepage http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/ &lt;/ref&gt; is a ''literate programming'' language which integrates LaTeX and R code. The Sweave file generates a LaTeX file and an R file which can in turn be compiled. Roger Koenker&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/repro.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Meredith and Racine (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, E. and J.S. Racine (2009), “Towards Reproducible Econometric Research: The Sweave Framework,” Journal of Applied Econometrics, Volume 24, pp 366-374.&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Charles Geyer &quot;Why Reproducible Research is the Right Thing&quot; http://www.stat.umn.edu/~charlie/Sweave/&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Sweave favors reproducible econometric/statistical research.

There are some alternatives to Sweave for [[w:literate programming|literate programming]]. One of them is Babel which is included in Emacs Orgmode&lt;ref name=&quot;babel&quot;&gt;Babel in Emacs Orgmode http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This tool allow export to LaTeX and HTML. It is also possible to include code chunks for various programming languages (R, Ruby, etc).

=== Syntax === 

The main idea is that you write a file which includes LaTeX and R code. LaTeX code begins with &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; and R code with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (some options can be included between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
@
% Some LaTeX code
\section{Results}
I show that ...
&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=
# Some R code
qnorm(.975)
@
% Some LaTeX code
$$
\Phi^{-1}(.975) = 1.96 
$$
&lt;/source&gt;

The file is stored with extension &lt;tt&gt;.Rnw&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;.rnw&lt;/tt&gt;. At the end, you extract from this file an R file using &lt;tt&gt;Stangle()&lt;/tt&gt; and a LaTeX file using &lt;tt&gt;Sweave()&lt;/tt&gt;. Here is an example with a file called &lt;tt&gt;file.Rnw&lt;/tt&gt; which generates &lt;tt&gt;file.tex&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;file.R&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; Sweave(&quot;file.Rnw&quot;)
Writing to file file.tex
Processing code chunks ...
 1 : echo keep.source term verbatim pdf
 2 : echo keep.source term verbatim pdf
&gt; Stangle(&quot;file.Rnw&quot;)
Writing to file file.R 
&lt;/source&gt;

Then you can run LaTeX on your file.tex. This can be done using the &lt;tt&gt;system()&lt;/tt&gt; function or &lt;tt&gt;texi2dvi()&lt;/tt&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
# Example under Windows :
system(&quot;pdflatex.exe -shell-escape file.tex&quot;) # runs pdflatex
system(&quot;open file.pdf&quot;) # opens the pdf 
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you may need to download Sweave.sty from the internet since it is not part of the standard MikTeX distribution. 

You can also add your results in your text using the &lt;tt&gt;\Sexpr{}&lt;/tt&gt; function. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
$
\Phi^{-1}(.975) = \Sexpr{qnorm(.975)} 
$
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Options ===

There are some options. These options can be included for each code chunk or in the Sweave command. 

* For figures, you can either include them in the tex file using &lt;tt&gt;fig=T&lt;/tt&gt; or not include them using &lt;tt&gt;fig=F&lt;/tt&gt;.
By default, figures are exported as pdf and eps files. 
If you only want one format suppress the other one with &lt;tt&gt;pdf=F&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;eps=F&lt;/tt&gt; option.
* The R code can be displayed in the tex file using &lt;tt&gt;echo=T&lt;/tt&gt;. If you don't want to include it in the tex file, use  &lt;tt&gt;echo=F&lt;/tt&gt;.
* The R code can be evaluated using &lt;tt&gt;eval=T&lt;/tt&gt;. If you don't want to evaluate the R code, use &lt;tt&gt;eval=F&lt;/tt&gt;.
* The results : 
** &lt;tt&gt;results=tex&lt;/tt&gt; treats the output as LaTeX code
** &lt;tt&gt;results=verbatim&lt;/tt&gt; treats the output as Verbatim (the default)
** &lt;tt&gt;results=hide&lt;/tt&gt; does not include the results in the LaTeX output

These options can be passed to the &lt;tt&gt;Sweave()&lt;/tt&gt; function. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
Sweave(&quot;file.Rnw&quot;, pdf = T, eps=F, echo = F, results = &quot;verbatim&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

They can also be passed to each code chunk. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&lt;&lt;fig=T,pdf=T,eps=F&gt;&gt;=
plot(rnorm(100), col = &quot;red&quot;)
@
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Text editor for Sweave ===

The main issue with Sweave is that few text editors include syntax highlighting for Sweave. Here are some exceptions : 
* [[R_Programming/Settings#RStudio|RStudio]] is a very good solution. It is easy to install and use and it includes buttons to run Sweave files.
* [[Learning the vi Editor|Vim]] provides syntax highlighting for Sweave file (''R no web syntax'')
* [[wikipedia:Emacs|Emacs]] + ESS ([[wikipedia:Emacs Speaks Statistics|Emacs Speaks Statistics]]) provides full support for Sweave file. It includes a keyboard shortcut to run Sweave files and syntax highlighting switching between LaTeX and R.
* [[R_Programming/Settings#Eclipse_with_StatET|Eclipse StatET]] plugin provides support for Sweave (LaTeX/R) documents with all basic features (syntax highlighting, bracket matching, toggle comment, ...) and with detection of R chunks.

== Export to [[LaTeX]] ==

R has lots of functions which allow it to export results to LaTeX&lt;ref&gt;See the [[LaTeX]] Wikibook if you want to learn about LaTeX&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== General functions ===

&lt;tt&gt;toLatex()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''utils''' package. 
* Note that &lt;tt&gt;toLatex()&lt;/tt&gt; does not handle matrices. 
* &lt;tt&gt;toLatex()&lt;/tt&gt; has been adapted to handle matrices and ftables in the '''memisc''' package.

==Introduction==

Maximum likelihood estimation is just an [[R Programming/Optimization|optimization]] problem. You have to write down your log likelihood function and use some optimization technique. Sometimes you also need to write your score (the first derivative of the log likelihood) and or the hessian (the second derivative of the log likelihood). 

== One dimension == 

If there is only one parameter, we can optimize the log likelihood using &lt;code&gt;optimize()&lt;/code&gt;. 

=== Example with a type 1 Pareto distribution ===

We provide an example with a type 1 [[w:Pareto distribution|Pareto distribution]]. Note that in this example we treat the minimum as known and do not estimate it. Therefore this is a one-dimensional problem.

We use the &lt;code&gt;rpareto1()&lt;/code&gt; ('''actuar''') function to generate a random vector from a type 1 Pareto distribution with shape equal to 1 and minimum value equal to 500. We use the &lt;code&gt;dpareto1()&lt;/code&gt; ('''actuar''') function with option &lt;code&gt; log = TRUE&lt;/code&gt; to write the log likelihood. Then we just need to use &lt;code&gt;optimize()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;maximum=TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. We provide a minimum and a maximum value for the parameter with the &lt;code&gt;interval&lt;/code&gt; option.

&gt; library(actuar)
&gt; y &lt;- rpareto1(1000, shape = 1, min = 500)
&gt; ll &lt;- function(mu, x) { 
+    sum(dpareto1(x,mu[1],min = min(x),log = TRUE)) 
+   } 
&gt; optimize(f = ll, x = y, interval = c(0,10), maximum = TRUE)
&lt;/source&gt;


== Multiple dimension ==

* &lt;tt&gt;fitdistr()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''MASS''' package) fits univariate distributions by maximum likelihood. It is a wrapper for &lt;code&gt;optim()&lt;/code&gt;.  
* If you need to program yourself your maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) you have to use a built-in optimizer such as &lt;tt&gt;nlm()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;optim()&lt;/tt&gt;. R also includes the following optimizers :
* mle() in the '''stats4''' package
* The '''maxLik''' package


=== Example with a logistic distribution ===

For instance, we draw from a logistic distribution and we estimate the parameters using .
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; # draw from a gumbel distribution using the inverse cdf simulation method
&gt; e.1 &lt;- -log(-log(runif(10000,0,1))) 
&gt; e.2 &lt;- -log(-log(runif(10000,0,1)))
&gt; u &lt;- e.2 - e.1  # u follows a logistic distribution (difference between two gumbels.)
&gt; fitdistr(u,densfun=dlogis,start=list(location=0,scale=1))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example with a Cauchy distribution ===

For instance, we can write a simple maximum likelihood estimator for a Cauchy distribution using the &lt;tt&gt;nlm()&lt;/tt&gt; optimizer.
We first draw a vector x from a Cauchy distribution. Then we define the log likelihood function and then we optimize using the &lt;tt&gt;nlm()&lt;/tt&gt; function. Note that &lt;tt&gt;nlm()&lt;/tt&gt; is minimizer and not a maximizer.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; n &lt;- 100
&gt; x &lt;- rcauchy(n)
&gt; mlog.1 &lt;- function(mu, x) { 
+   - sum(dcauchy(x, location = mu, log = TRUE)) 
+   } 
&gt; mu.start &lt;- median(x)
&gt; out &lt;- nlm(mlog.1, mu.start, x = x) 
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Example with a beta distribution ===

Here is an other example with the Beta distribution and the &lt;tt&gt;optim()&lt;/tt&gt; function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; y &lt;- rbeta(1000,2,2)
&gt; loglik &lt;- function(mu, x) { 
+    sum(-dbeta(x,mu[1],mu[2],log = TRUE)) 
+    } 
&gt; 
&gt; out &lt;- optim(par = c(1,1), fn=loglik,x=y,method = &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;,lower=c(0,0))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Tests ==

=== Likelihood Ratio Test ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In this section,  we deal with methods to read, manage and clean-up a data frame. 

In R, a dataframe is a list of vectors of the same length. They don't have to be of the same type. For instance, you can combine in one dataframe a logical, a character and a numerical vector. 

== Reading and saving data ==

If data are already in an R format (&lt;code&gt;.Rda&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.Rdata&lt;/code&gt;), you can load them in memory using &lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt;. 
You can save data to the R format using &lt;code&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
load(&quot;mydata.Rda&quot;)
save(mydata,file=&quot;mydata.Rda&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Datasets ==
* Most packages include example datasets to test the functions.
* The &lt;code&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; function without argument gives the list of all example datasets in all the loaded packages. 
* If you want to load them in memory, you just need to use the data function and include the name of the dataset as an argument. 
* &lt;code&gt;str_data()&lt;/code&gt; ('''sfsmisc''') gives the structure of all datasets in a package. 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; data() # lists all the datasets in all the packages in memory
&gt; data(package=&quot;datasets&quot;) # lists all the datasets in the &quot;datasets&quot; package
&gt; data(Orange) # loads the orange dataset in memory
&gt; ?Orange # Help for the &quot;Orange&quot; Datasets
&gt; str_data(&quot;datasets&quot;) # gives the structure of all the datasets in the datasets package.
&lt;/source&gt;

* Some packages includes lots of datasets.
** The '''datasets''' package
** The '''AER''' package &lt;ref&gt;The AER Package http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; includes replication datasets for some important textbooks in econometrics.
**The '''EcDat''' package &lt;ref&gt;The EcDat Package http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ecdat/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; includes replication archive for the Journal of Applied Econometrics, the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, etc

== Building your own data frames ==

You can create a dataframe using vectors.
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
u &lt;- rnorm(N)
x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
x2 &lt;- rnorm(N)
y &lt;- 1 + x1 + x2 + u
mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2)
&lt;/source&gt;

R has a spreadsheet-style data editor. One can use it to enter the data into a spreadsheet.
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
mydat &lt;- edit(data.frame())
&lt;/source&gt;
Read table from the clipboard :
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; mydat &lt;- read.table(&quot;clipboard&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also read space delimited tables in your code using &lt;code&gt;gsource()&lt;/code&gt; ('''Zelig'''). Here is an example with Yule 1899 data&lt;ref&gt; &quot;An investigation into the causes of changes in pauperism in England, chiefly during the last two intercensal decades (Part I.)&quot; - GU Yule - Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, June 1899, p 283&lt;/ref&gt;. 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
mydat &lt;- gsource(var.names = &quot;id union pauperism out old  pop&quot;, 
variables = &quot;
1 Kensington 27 5 104 136
2 Paddington  47 12 115 111
3 Fulham 31 21 85 174
&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Describing a data frame ==
{{...}}
* &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; gives a very brief description of the data.
* &lt;code&gt;names()&lt;/code&gt; gives the name of each variables
* &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; gives some very basic summary statistics for each variable

== Browsing data ==
* You can browse your data in a spreadsheet using &lt;code&gt;View()&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on your operating system, this option is not always available and the result is not always the same.
* You can print the first lines using &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; and the last lines using &lt;code&gt;tail()&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
View(mydata)
head(mydata, n = 20) # n = 20 means  that the first 20 lines are printed in the R console
&lt;/source&gt;

* [[R_Programming/Settings#RStudio|RStudio]] has a nice data browser (&lt;code&gt;View(mydata)&lt;/code&gt;).  
* RKward has also a nice data browser
* Paul Murrell is currently developping the '''rdataviewer''' package ([http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/Talks/viewer.pdf pdf]).

== Attaching data ==
One of the big advantage of R over [[Stata]] is that you can deal with multiple datasets at the same time. You just need to specify the name of the dataset and a &quot;$&quot; symbol before each variable name ( for instance &lt;code&gt;mydat1$var1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mydat2$var1&lt;/code&gt;). If you only work with one dataset and you don't want to write again and again the name of the dataset as a prefix for each variable, you can use &lt;code&gt;attach()&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
mydata$var1
attach(mydata)
var1
detach(mydata)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Detecting duplicates ==
When you want to clean up a data set, it is very often useful to check if you don't have the same information twice in the data. R provides some functions to detect duplicates.

* &lt;code&gt;duplicated()&lt;/code&gt; looks at duplicated elements and return a logical vector. You can use &lt;code&gt;table()&lt;/code&gt; to summarize this vector. 
* &lt;code&gt;Duplicated()&lt;/code&gt; ('''sfsmisc''') generalizes this command. &lt;code&gt;Duplicated()&lt;/code&gt; only marks unique values with &quot;NA&quot;.
* &lt;code&gt;remove.dup.rows()&lt;/code&gt; ('''cwhmisc''').
* &lt;code&gt;unique()&lt;/code&gt; keep only the unique lines in a dataset.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(&quot;Zelig&quot;)
mydat &lt;- gsource(
variables = &quot;
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 2 2
1 2 3 2&quot;)
unique(mydat) # keep unique rows
library(cwhmisc)
remove.dup.rows(mydat) # similar to unique()
table(duplicated(mydat)) # table duplicated lines
mydat$dups &lt;- duplicated(mydat) # add a logical variable for duplicates
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating and removing variables ==

To create a new variable 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
mydata$newvar &lt;- oldvar
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to delete a variable in a dataset, you can assign NULL to that variable : 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
# Delete the x variable in the df data frame.
df$x &lt;- NULL 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Renaming variables ==

* It is possible to rename variable by redefining the vector of names of a data frame. 
* There is also a &lt;code&gt;rename()&lt;/code&gt; function in the '''reshape''' package.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
df &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 21:30)
names(df)
names(df) &lt;- c(&quot;toto&quot;,&quot;tata&quot;)
names(df)
names(df)[2] &lt;- &quot;titi&quot;
names(df)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating a subset of the data ==

One can subset the data using &lt;code&gt;subset()&lt;/code&gt;. The first argument is the name of the dataset, the second argument is a logical condition which say which lines will be included in the new dataset and the last argument is the list of variable which will be included in the new dataset. 

In the following example, we generate a fake dataset and we use the &lt;code&gt;subset()&lt;/code&gt; command to select the lines and columns of interest. We choose the lines such that x1 &gt; 0 and x2 &lt; 0 and we only keep x1 and x2 as variables.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
N &lt;- 100
x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
x2 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N) + x1
x3 &lt;- rnorm(N) + x2
mydat &lt;- data.frame(x1,x2,x3)
subset(x = mydat, subset = x1 &gt; 0 &amp; x2 &lt; 0, select = c(x1,x2))
subset(x = mydat, subset = x1 &gt; 0 &amp; x2 &lt; 0, select = - x3) # the same. 
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to reorder the columns using the &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; option.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
subset(x = mydat, subset = x1 &gt; 0 &amp; x2 &lt; 0, select = c(x1,x2))
subset(x = mydat, subset = x1 &gt; 0 &amp; x2 &lt; 0, select = c(x2,x1))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sorting and ordering ==

* &lt;code&gt;order()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
mydat[order(var1,var2),]
&lt;/source&gt;

Suppose you want to randomize the order in a data set. You just need to generate a vector from a uniform distribution and to sort following that vector.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
df[order(runif(nrow(df))),]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Detecting missing values ==
* &lt;code&gt;is.na()&lt;/code&gt; returns a logical vector equal to TRUE if any of the variable in a dataset is missing and to FALSE otherwise.
* &lt;code&gt;complete.cases()&lt;/code&gt; returns a logical vector indicating TRUE if all cases are complete and FALSE otherwise.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; table(complete.cases(df))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Reshaping a dataframe ==

This topic is important if you deal with panel data. [[w:Panel data|Panel data]] can be stored in a wide format with one observation per unit and a variable for each time period or in a long format with one observation per unit and time period. &lt;code&gt;reshape()&lt;/code&gt; reshapes a dataset in a wide or long format.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; country &lt;- c(&quot;'Angola'&quot;,&quot;'UK'&quot;,&quot;'France'&quot;)
&gt; gdp.1960 &lt;- c(1,2,3)
&gt; gdp.1970 &lt;- c(2,4,6)
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(country,gdp.1960,gdp.1970)
&gt; mydat # wide format
  country gdp.1960 gdp.1970
1  Angola       1       2
2      UK       2       4
3  France       3       6
&gt; reshape( data = mydat, varying = list(2:3) , v.names = &quot;gdp&quot;, direction = &quot;long&quot;) # long format
    country time gdp id
1.1  Angola    1   1  1
2.1      UK    1   2  2
3.1  France    1   3  3
1.2  Angola    2   2  1
2.2      UK    2   4  2
3.2  France    2   6  3
&lt;/source&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;varying&lt;/code&gt; gives the numbers of the columns which are time-varying
* &lt;code&gt;v.names&lt;/code&gt; gives the prefix of the time-varying variables
* &lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt; gives the direction, either &quot;long&quot; or &quot;wide&quot;. 

* See also : 
** &lt;code&gt;reShape()&lt;/code&gt; ('''Hmisc''')

== Expanding a dataset ==

Sometimes we need to duplicate some lines in a dataset. For instance, if we want to generate a fake dataset with a [[w:Panel data|panel data]] structure. In that case, we would first generate time invariant variables and then duplicate each line by a given scalar in order to create time-varying variables. 

It is possible to use the &lt;code&gt;expand()&lt;/code&gt; function in the '''epicalc''' package. This will multiply each line by a given number. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
N &lt;- 1000
T &lt;- 5
wide &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:N,f = rnorm(N),  rep = T)
library(&quot;epicalc&quot;)
long &lt;- expand(wide,index.var = &quot;rep&quot;)
long$time &lt;- rep(1:T,N)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also use the ''do it yourself solution'' or create our own function. The idea is simple. We create a vector which igives for each line the number of times it should be replicated (dups in the following example). Then we use the &lt;code&gt;rep()&lt;/code&gt; function to create a vector which repeats the line numbers according to what we want. The last step creates a new dataset which repeats lines according to the desired pattern.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
expand &lt;- function(df,dups){
	df$dups &lt;- dups
	pattern &lt;- rep(1:nrow(df), times=df$dups)
	df2 &lt;- df[pattern,]
	index &lt;- function(x){
		1:length(x)
		}
	df2$year &lt;- unlist(tapply(df2$dups, df2$id, index))
	df2$dups &lt;- NULL 
	return(df2)
	}

df &lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(3), id = 1:3)
dups = c(3,1,2)
expand(df,dups)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Merging dataframes ==

Merging data can be very confusing, especially if the case of multiple merge. Here is a simple example : 

We have one table describing authors : 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; authors &lt;- data.frame(
+     surname = I(c(&quot;Tukey&quot;, &quot;Venables&quot;, &quot;Tierney&quot;, &quot;Ripley&quot;, &quot;McNeil&quot;)),
+     nationality = c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;US&quot;, &quot;UK&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;),
+     deceased = c(&quot;yes&quot;, rep(&quot;no&quot;, 4)))
&gt; authors
   surname nationality deceased
1    Tukey          US      yes
2 Venables   Australia       no
3  Tierney          US       no
4   Ripley          UK       no
5   McNeil   Australia       no
&lt;/source&gt;
and one table describing books
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; books &lt;- data.frame(
+     name = I(c(&quot;Tukey&quot;, &quot;Venables&quot;, &quot;Tierney&quot;,
+              &quot;Ripley&quot;, &quot;Ripley&quot;, &quot;McNeil&quot;, &quot;R Core&quot;)),
+     title = c(&quot;Exploratory Data Analysis&quot;,
+               &quot;Modern Applied Statistics ...&quot;,
+               &quot;LISP-STAT&quot;,
+               &quot;Spatial Statistics&quot;, &quot;Stochastic Simulation&quot;,
+               &quot;Interactive Data Analysis&quot;,
+               &quot;An Introduction to R&quot;),
+     other.author = c(NA, &quot;Ripley&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA,
+                      &quot;Venables &amp; Smith&quot;))
&gt; books
      name                         title     other.author
1    Tukey     Exploratory Data Analysis             &lt;NA&gt;
2 Venables Modern Applied Statistics ...           Ripley
3  Tierney                     LISP-STAT             &lt;NA&gt;
4   Ripley            Spatial Statistics             &lt;NA&gt;
5   Ripley         Stochastic Simulation             &lt;NA&gt;
6   McNeil     Interactive Data Analysis             &lt;NA&gt;
7   R Core          An Introduction to R Venables &amp; Smith
&lt;/source&gt;
We want to merge tables books and authors by author's name (&quot;surname&quot; in the first dataset and &quot;name&quot; in the second one). We use the merge() command. We specify the name of the first and the second datasets, then by.x and by.y specify the identifier in both datasets. all.x and all.y specify if we want to keep all the observation of the first and the second dataset. In that case we want to have all the observations from the books dataset but we just keep the observations from the author dataset which match with an observation in the books dataset. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; final &lt;- merge(books, authors, by.x = &quot;name&quot;, by.y = &quot;surname&quot;, sort=F,all.x=T,all.y=F)
&gt; final
      name                         title     other.author nationality deceased

In this section, we present descriptive statistics, ie a set of tools to describe and explore data. This mainly includes univariate and bivariate statistical tools.

== Generic Functions ==

We introduce some functions to describe a dataset.

* &lt;tt&gt;names()&lt;/tt&gt; gives the names of each variable
* &lt;tt&gt;str()&lt;/tt&gt; gives the structure of the dataset
* &lt;tt&gt;summary()&lt;/tt&gt; gives the mean, median, min, max, 1st and 3rd quartile of each variable in the data.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; summary(mydat)
&lt;/source&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;describe()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Hmisc''' package) gives more details than &lt;tt&gt;summary()&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;Hmisc&quot;)
&gt; describe(mydat)
&lt;/source&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;contents()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Hmisc''' package)
* &lt;tt&gt;dims()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Zelig''' package.
* &lt;tt&gt;descr()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''descr''' package gives min, max, mean and quartiles for continuous variables, frequency tables for factors and length for character vectors.
* &lt;tt&gt;whatis()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''YaleToolkit''') gives a good description of a dataset.
* &lt;tt&gt;describe()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''psych''' package also provides summary statistics:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x = runif(100)
&gt; y = rnorm(100)
&gt; z = rt(100,1)
&gt; sample.data = x*y*z
&gt; require(psych)
Loading required package: psych
&gt; describe(cbind(sample.data,x,z,y))
            var   n  mean   sd median trimmed  mad    min   max range  skew kurtosis   se
sample.data   1 100  0.37 3.21   0.00    0.07 0.31  -9.02 24.84 33.86  4.79    36.91 0.32
x             2 100  0.54 0.28   0.56    0.55 0.35   0.02  1.00  0.98 -0.12    -1.13 0.03
z             3 100  0.12 6.28   0.02   -0.01 1.14 -30.40 37.93 68.33  1.49    22.33 0.63
y             4 100 -0.01 1.07   0.09   -0.02 1.12  -2.81  2.35  5.16  0.00    -0.30 0.11
&lt;/source&gt;

== Univariate analysis ==

=== Continuous variable ===

==== Moments ====

* &lt;tt&gt;mean()&lt;/tt&gt; computes the mean
* the variance : &lt;tt&gt;var()&lt;/tt&gt;.
* the standard deviation &lt;tt&gt;sd()&lt;/tt&gt;.
* the skewness &lt;tt&gt;skewness()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''fUtilities''', '''moment''' or '''e1071''')
* the kurtosis : &lt;tt&gt;kurtosis()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''fUtilities''', '''moment''' or '''e1071''')
* all the moments : &lt;tt&gt;moment()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''moment''') and &lt;tt&gt;all.moments()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''moment''').
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(moments)
&gt;  x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
&gt; moment(x,order = 2) # the variance
[1] 0.999782
&gt; all.moments(x, order.max = 4) # mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis
[1] 1.000000000 0.006935727 0.999781992 0.062650605 2.972802009
&gt; library(&quot;e1071&quot;)
&gt; moment(x,order = 3) # the skewness
[1] 0.0626506
&lt;/source&gt;


==== Order statistics ====

* the range, the minimum and the maximum : &lt;tt&gt;range()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the range of a vector (minimum and maximum of a vector), &lt;tt&gt;min()&lt;/tt&gt; the minimum and &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt; the maximum.
* &lt;tt&gt;IQR()&lt;/tt&gt; computes the interquartile range. &lt;tt&gt;median()&lt;/tt&gt; computes the median and &lt;tt&gt;mad()&lt;/tt&gt; the median absolute deviation.
* &lt;tt&gt;quantile()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;hdquantile()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Hmisc''' package and &lt;tt&gt;kuantile()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''quantreg''' packages computes the sample quantiles of a continuous vector. &lt;tt&gt;kuantile()&lt;/tt&gt; may be more efficient when the sample size is big.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(Hmisc)
&gt; library(quantreg)
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
&gt; seq &lt;- seq(0, 1, 0.25)
&gt; quantile(x, probs = seq, na.rm = FALSE, names = TRUE)
         0%         25%         50%         75%        100% 
-3.07328999 -0.66800917  0.02010969  0.72620061  2.92897970 
&gt; hdquantile(x, probs = seq, se = FALSE, na.rm = FALSE, names = TRUE, weights=FALSE)
       0.00        0.25        0.50        0.75        1.00 
-3.07328999 -0.66901899  0.02157989  0.72378407  2.92897970 
&gt; kuantile(x, probs = seq(0, 1, .25), na.rm = FALSE, names = TRUE)
         0%         25%         50%         75%        100% 
-3.07328999 -0.66800917  0.02010969  0.72620061  2.92897970 
attr(,&quot;class&quot;)
[1] &quot;kuantile&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;


==== Inequality Index ====

* The gini coefficient : &lt;tt&gt;Gini()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''ineq''') and &lt;tt&gt;gini()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''reldist'''). 
* &lt;tt&gt;ineq()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''ineq''') gives all inequalities index.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(ineq)
&gt; x &lt;- rlnorm(1000)
&gt; Gini(x)
[1] 0.5330694
&gt; RS(x) #  Ricci-Schutz coefficient
[1] 0.3935813
&gt; Atkinson(x, parameter = 0.5)
[1] 0.2336169
&gt; Theil(x, parameter = 0)
[1] 0.537657
&gt; Kolm(x, parameter = 1)
[1] 0.7216194
&gt; var.coeff(x, square = FALSE)
[1] 1.446085
&gt; entropy(x, parameter = 0.5)
[1] 0.4982675
&gt; library(&quot;reldist&quot;)
&gt; gini(x)
[1] 0.5330694
&lt;/source&gt;


* Concentration index 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(ineq)
&gt; Herfindahl(x)
[1] 0.003091162
&gt;  Rosenbluth(x)
[1] 0.002141646
&lt;/source&gt;


* Poverty index 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(ineq)
&gt; Sen(x,median(x)/2)
[1] 0.1342289
&gt; ?pov # learn more about poverty index
&lt;/source&gt;


==== Plotting the distribution ====

We can plot the distribution using a box plot (&lt;tt&gt;boxplot()&lt;/tt&gt;), an histogram (&lt;tt&gt;hist()&lt;/tt&gt;), a kernel estimator (&lt;tt&gt;plot()&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;density()&lt;/tt&gt;) or the empirical cumulative distribution function (&lt;tt&gt;plot()&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;ecdf()&lt;/tt&gt;). See the [[R Programming/Nonparametric Methods|Nonparametric]] section to learn more about histograms and kernel density estimators. &lt;tt&gt;qqnorm()&lt;/tt&gt; produces a normal QQ plot and &lt;tt&gt;qqline()&lt;/tt&gt; adds a line to the QQ plot which passes through the first and the third quartile. 

* A box-plot is a graphical representation of the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile and the maximum. 
* &lt;tt&gt;stripchart()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;stem()&lt;/tt&gt; are also availables. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(10^3)
&gt; hist(x)
&gt; plot(density(x))
&gt; boxplot(x)
&gt; plot(ecdf(x)) # plots the empirical distribution function
 
&gt; qqnorm(x)
&gt; qqline(x, col=&quot;red&quot;) # it does not do the plot but adds a line to existing one
&lt;/source&gt;


==== Goodness of fit tests ====

[[w:Kolmogorov Smirnov test|Kolmogorov Smirnov Test]] : 

The KS test is one sample goodness of fit test. The test statistic is simply the maximum of the absolute value of the difference between the empirical cumulative distribution function and the theoritical cumulative distribution function. &lt;tt&gt;KSd()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''sfsmisc''') gives the critical values for the KS statistic.
As an example, we draw a sample from a Beta(2,2) distribution and we test if it fits a Beta(2,2) a Beta(1,1) and a uniform distribution.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; y &lt;- rbeta(1000,2,2) # Draw y in a Beta(2,2) distribution
&gt; ks.test(y,&quot;pbeta&quot;,2,2) # Test if it fits a beta(2,2) distribution
&gt; ks.test(y,&quot;pbeta&quot;,1,1) # Test if it fits a beta(1,1) distribution
&gt; ks.test(y,&quot;punif&quot;) # Test if its fit a uniform distribution (in fact the beta(1,1) is a uniform distribution)
&lt;/source&gt;


Some tests are specific to the normal distribution. The Lillie Test is an extension of the KS test when the parameters are unknown. This is implemented with the &lt;tt&gt;lillie.test()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''nortest''' package. &lt;tt&gt;shapiro.test()&lt;/tt&gt; implements the [[w:Shapiro Wilk Normality Test|Shapiro Wilk Normality Test]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 100
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; library(&quot;nortest&quot;)
&gt; lillie.test(x)

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Discrete variable ===

We generate a discrete variable using &lt;tt&gt;sample()&lt;/tt&gt; and we tabulate it using &lt;tt&gt;table()&lt;/tt&gt;. 
We can plot using a pie chart (&lt;tt&gt;pie()&lt;/tt&gt;), a bar chart (&lt;tt&gt;barplot()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;barchart()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''lattice''')) or a dot chart (&lt;tt&gt;dotchart()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;dotplot()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''lattice''')). 

* &lt;tt&gt;freq()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''descr''') prints the frequency, the percentages and produces a barplot. It supports weights.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- sample(c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;),100,replace=T)
&gt; tab &lt;- table(x)
&gt; tab
&gt; prop.table(tab)
&gt; pie(tab)
&gt; barplot(tab)
&gt; dotchart(tab)
&gt; library(&quot;descr&quot;)
&gt; freq(x) 
x 
      Frequency Percent
A            32      32
B            34      34
C            34      34
Total       100     100
&lt;/source&gt;



== Multivariate analysis ==

=== Continuous variables ===

* Covariance : &lt;tt&gt;cov()&lt;/tt&gt;
* Pearson's linear correlation : &lt;tt&gt;cor()&lt;/tt&gt;. 
* Pearson's correlation test &lt;tt&gt;cor.test()&lt;/tt&gt; performs the test.
* Spearman's rank correlation : 
** &lt;tt&gt;cor()&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;method = &quot;spearman&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. 
** &lt;tt&gt;spearman()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Hmisc''')
* Spearman's rank correlation test : 
** &lt;tt&gt;spearman2()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Hmisc''')
** &lt;tt&gt;spearman.test()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Hmisc''')
** &lt;tt&gt;spearman.test()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''pspearman''' package) performs the Spearman’s rank correlation test with precomputed exact null distribution for n &lt;= 22.
* Kendall's correlation : &lt;tt&gt;cor()&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;method = &quot;kendall&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. See also the '''Kendall''' package.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 100
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x2 &lt;- rnorm(N) + x1 + 1
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x1 + x2 + rnorm(N)
&gt; plot(y ~ x1 ) # Scatter plot 
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2)
&gt; cor(mydat)
&gt; cor(mydat, method = &quot;spearman&quot;)
&gt; cor(mydat, method = &quot;kendall&quot;)
&gt; cor.test(mydat$x1,mydat$x2, method = &quot;pearson&quot;)
&gt; cor.test(mydat$x1,mydat$x2, method = &quot;spearman&quot;)
&gt; cor.test(mydat$x1,mydat$x2, method = &quot;kendall&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Discrete variables ===

* &lt;tt&gt;table()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;xtabs()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;prop.table()&lt;/tt&gt; for contingency tables.
* &lt;tt&gt;assocplot()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;mosaicplot()&lt;/tt&gt; for graphical display of contingency table.
* &lt;tt&gt;CrossTable()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''descr''') is similar to [[SAS]] Proc Freq. It returns a contingency table with Chi square and Fisher independance tests.
* &lt;tt&gt;my.table.NA()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;my.table.margin()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''cwhmisc''')
* &lt;tt&gt;chisq.detail()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''TeachingDemos''')

=== Discrete and Continuous variables ===

* &lt;tt&gt;bystats()&lt;/tt&gt; Statistics by Categories in the '''Hmisc''' package
* &lt;tt&gt;summaryBy()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''doBy''')
* Multiple box plots : &lt;tt&gt;plot()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;boxplot()&lt;/tt&gt; 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 100
&gt; x &lt;- sample(1:4,N, replace = T) 
&gt; y &lt;- x + rnorm(N)
&gt; plot(y ~ x) # scatter plot
&gt; plot(y ~ as.factor(x)) # multiple box plot
&gt; boxplot(y ~ x) # multiple box plot
&gt; bystats(y , as.factor(x), fun = mean) 
&gt; bystats(y , as.factor(x), fun = quantile)
&lt;/source&gt;


* Equality of two sample mean &lt;tt&gt;t.test()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;wilcox.test()&lt;/tt&gt;,  Equality of variance &lt;tt&gt;var.test()&lt;/tt&gt;, equality of two distributions &lt;tt&gt;ks.test()&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
N &lt;- 100
x &lt;- sample(0:1,N, replace = T) 
y &lt;- x + rnorm(N)
t.test(y ~ x )
wilcox.test(y ~ x)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This page show how to install R, customize it and choose a working environment. Once you have installed R, you may want to choose a working environment. This can be a simple text editor (such as Emacs, Vim or Gedit), an integrated development interface (IDE) or graphical user interface (GUI). RStudio is now a popular option. 

== Installation ==
=== Linux ===
Installing R on Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian itself) is as simple as to type in &lt;code&gt;sudo aptitude install r-base&lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install r-base&lt;/code&gt; (don't forget that this is have to be done as root), or installing the package &lt;code&gt;r-base&lt;/code&gt; using your favourite package manager, for example Synaptic.

There is also a bunch of packages extending R to different purposes. Their names begin with &lt;code&gt;r-&lt;/code&gt;. Take a closer look at the package &lt;code&gt;r-recommended&lt;/code&gt;. It is a metapackage that depends on a set of packages that are recommended by the upstream R core team as part of a complete R distribution. It is possible to install R by installing just this package, as it depends on &lt;code&gt;r-base&lt;/code&gt;.

Installation with apt-get (Debian, Ubuntu and all linux distributions based on Debian)
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install r-base
sudo apt-get install r-recommended
&lt;/pre&gt;

Installation with aptitude (Debian, Ubuntu and all linux distributions based on Debian)
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo aptitude install r-base
sudo aptitude install r-recommended
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Mac OS ===
Installation : 
Visit the R project website (http://r-project.org/), select the &quot;CRAN&quot; page and choose mirror. Download the disk image (dmg file) and install R. 

The default graphical user interface for Mac is much better than the one for Windows. It includes 
* a dataframe manager, 
* a history of all commands, 
* a program editor which supports syntax highlighting.

=== Windows ===
(Section source &lt;ref&gt;This section was imported from the Wikiversity project [[v:How_to_use_R/Installation|Installation, How to use R course]]&lt;/ref&gt;)
==== Download ====
To install R under Windows operating system you have to download the binaries from the web. First go to [http://www.r-project.org/ r-project.org] and click ''CRAN'' under download section on the left panel and select a mirror site, from where you could download the required content. The best idea is pick a mirror closest to your actual geographical location, but other ones should work as well. The click ''Windows'' and in subdirectories ''base''. The windows binary is the exe file, in form R-''x''.''x''.''x''-win32.exe, where ''x'' denotes the actual version of the program. Regardless of the version the setup has the same steps. 

==== Setup ====
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:R setup1.JPG
Image:R setup2.JPG
Image:R setup3.JPG
Image:R setup4.JPG
Image:R setup5.JPG
&lt;/gallery&gt;

As usual in Windows, if you just keep clicking the ''Next'' button, you will install the program without any problems. However, there are few things that you can alter.

# On the welcome screen click ''Next''.
# Read or just notice the GNU license, and click ''Next''.
# Select the location, where R should be installed. In case you don't prefer a particular location on your hard disc, the default choice will be OK for you.
# During the next step you can specify which parts of R you want to install. Choices are: User installation, Minimal user installation, Full installation and Custom installation. Notice the required space under the selection panel (varies between 20 and 66 MB). In case you are a beginner in R, choose the default ''User installation''.
# In this step you can choose between 2 ways. If you accept defaults, you skip the 3 &quot;extra&quot; steps during installation (see lower). 
# You can specify the ''Start menu'' folder.
# In the next step you can choose, between shortcut possibilities (desktop icon and/or quick launch icon) and specify registry entries.


With these steps you can customize the R graphical user interface.
* You can choose if you want an R graphic user interface covering the whole screen (MDI) or a smaller window (SDI).
* You can select the style, how the Help screen is displayed in R. You will use help a lot, so this may be an important decision. It is up to you, which style you prefer. Please note, that the content of help file will be the same regardless of your choice. Here you specify just the appearance of that particular window.
* In the next step you can specify, whether you want to use internet2.dll. If you are a beginner, pick the ''Standard'' option here.

==== Update ====
Updating R on Windows requires several steps:
# Downloading/installing the latest version of R
# Copying your packages from the library folder to the one in the new R installation

Both of these steps can easily be done using the ''[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/installr/ installr]'' package, by running the following command (which would both install the package, and update R)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-statistics.com/2013/03/updating-r-from-r-on-windows-using-the-installr-package/ Updating R from R (on Windows) – using the {installr} package]&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
# installing/loading the package:
if(!require(installr)) { 
install.packages(&quot;installr&quot;); require(installr)} #load / install+load installr
updateR() # updates R
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also the possibility of using a &quot;global&quot; package library, see [http://www.r-statistics.com/2010/04/changing-your-r-upgrading-strategy-and-the-r-code-to-do-it-on-windows/ here] for more details.

=== Portable R for Windows ===

You have a portable version if you want to install R on your USB stick&lt;ref name = &quot;portableR&quot;&gt; Portable R http://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/&lt;/ref&gt;. This is useful if you don't have admin rights on a computer. The basic installation requires something like 115 mb but you may need more if you want to install add-on packages.

== Working environment ==

Once you have installed '''R''', you need to choose a working environment. 
In this section, we review all possible working environment. This include a basic terminal as well as [[wikipedia:Integrated_development_environment|integrated development environment]] (therefore IDE), text editors or [[wikipedia:Graphical user interface|graphical user interface]] (therefore GUI).
* A graphical user interface provides some menu which makes it possible to run R without writing code. This is a good solution for beginners.
* A text editor makes it easy to write code.
* An integrated development environment provides a text editor and a compiler which makes it easy to write R scripts, to run them and to correct them. 

Note that there are some task specific GUIs. For instance '''speedR''' provides a GUI to import data into R. 

=== Terminal ===
[[File:R Terminal.png|thumb|upright=1.3|R in a Terminal window on Linux.]]

For Linux and Mac OS users it is possible to use R from the terminal. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
$ R
&gt; q(&quot;no&quot;) # to leave R and return to the terminal
&lt;/source&gt;

=== R Gui ===

For Mac OS and Windows users, there is a graphical user interface. In Mac OS, the GUI includes a package manager, a program editor with syntax highlighting and a data browser. In Windows, the GUI is not better than a [[w:System console|Terminal]].


=== Graphical User Interface ===

This section includes material for beginners (eg people who are not familiar with computing).

==== Poor Man's GUI (pmg) ====

A simple GUI for learning R. It is recommanded for beginners. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; install.packages(&quot;pmg&quot;, dependencies=TRUE)
# Windows users may also run the following scripts to install required libraries
&gt; source(&quot;http://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/pmg/installpmg.R&quot;) 
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(pmg)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Jaguar : Java GUI for R ====

{{Wikipedia|Java GUI for R}}

* '''Jaguar : Java GUI for R'''&lt;ref&gt;http://jgr.markushelbig.org/JGR.html&lt;/ref&gt; is available for Linux, Mac and Windows ([http://www.rforge.net/JGR/screenshots.html screenshots]). 
* It is good for beginners.

==== R commander ====

* '''[[w:R Commander|Rcommander]]'''&lt;ref&gt;http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/&lt;/ref&gt; developed  by John Fox provides a menu in the standard Graphical User Interface ([http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/Rcmdr-screenshot.html screenshots]). 
* It works on Linux, Mac and Windows. 
* It is a good interface for beginners and for people who are not used to script editing.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; install.packages(&quot;Rcmdr&quot;) # installation
&gt; library(&quot;Rcmdr&quot;) # usage
&lt;/source&gt;

* Ubuntu users can also install R Commander from the software center.


=== Integrated development environment ===

==== RStudio ====
[[File:Rstudio.png|thumb|upright=1.5|RStudio on Ubuntu 12.10.]]
[http://www.rstudio.com/ RStudio] is an integrated development interface for R&lt;ref name = &quot;rstudio&quot;&gt;[http://www.rstudio.org/ rstudio.org]&lt;/ref&gt;.  
* It works on Mac, Windows and Linux platforms. 
* It supports [[R_Programming/Publication_Quality_Ouput#Sweave|Sweave]] and [[LaTeX]]. 
* It includes syntax highlighting for R, LaTeX and Sweave.
* It includes a way to view variables and dataframes.
* It makes it easy to load and install package, to navigate in the help files and to manage your workspace.
* It supports code and file name completion.
* It can be installed on a USB stick.
John Verzani has written a book dedicated to this new interface, ''Getting Started with RStudio''&lt;ref name = &quot;verzani&quot;&gt;John Verzani &quot;Getting Started with RStudio
An Integrated Development Environment for R&quot;, O'Reilly Media, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeffrey Racine recommand RStudio for Sweave&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Racine, (forthcoming), &quot;RStudio: A Platform Independent IDE for R and Sweave,&quot; Journal of Applied Econometrics.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== RKward ====

[[w:RKward|RKward]] is an IDE and a GUI for Linux (KDE) ([http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/rkward/index.php?title=Screenshots Screenshots]). RKWard aims to provide an easily extensible, easy to use IDE/GUI for R. RKWard tries to combine the power of the R-language with the (relative) ease of use of commercial statistics tools.

==== Eclipse with StatET ====

[[w:Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] with the StatET plugin&lt;ref name = &quot;statet&quot;&gt;StatET : http://www.walware.de/goto/statet&lt;/ref&gt; provides an IDE for R. 
* It supports Sweave.

==== Rattle GUI ====

* '''[[w:Rattle GUI|Rattle]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Rattle : http://rattle.togaware.com/&lt;/ref&gt; for Linux, Windows and Mac ([http://rattle.togaware.com/rattle-screenshots.html screenshots])&lt;ref&gt;Graham J Williams. Rattle: A Data Mining GUI for R. The R Journal, 1(2):45-55, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Tinn R ====

* For Windows only
* Tinn R&lt;ref&gt;Tinn stands for ''Tinn Is Not Notepad'' http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/&lt;/ref&gt; is a good IDE for Windows users. One can easily define keyboard shortcuts to execute selected R code from Tinn R.

==== Notepad++ and NpptoR ====


* For Windows only.

[[w:Notepad++|Notepad++]]&lt;ref&gt;Note that Notepad++ can be installed on a USB stick http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepadpluspe/&lt;/ref&gt; and NPPtoR&lt;ref&gt;NPPtoR is also a portable software http://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/&lt;/ref&gt; provides syntax highlighting and hotkeys (by default F8) to send lines of code to R. Syntax highlighting can be easily modified using the dialog box to manage user define languages ('''Menu/View/Use Define Dialog...'''). NPPtoR provides a method to generate syntax highlighting dynamically (depending on all the available packages in the R environment).

==== Vi, Vim and GVim ====

{{Wikipedia|Vim}}{{Wikibooks|Learning the vi Editor}}

* Vim and GVim provides syntax highlighting
* Vim is for advanced users only
* The [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628 Vim-R-plugin] allows the communication between Vim and R

==== Emacs and ESS ====

{{Wikibooks|Emacs}}
{{Wikipedia|Emacs}}
{{Wikipedia|Emacs Speaks Statistics}}
 
* Emacs with ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)&lt;ref&gt;ESS : http://ess.r-project.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* Emacs is for advanced users only.

* For Linux users, you just have to install emacs and ESS using your standard package manager (synaptic, aptitude, yum, etc)
* For Mac and Windows user, you can have a look at Vincent Goulet's page which has binary with Emacs and ESS&lt;ref&gt; Vincent Goulet Emacs page http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/emacs&lt;/ref&gt;.
* For Mac users, Aquamacs Emacs is a good solution. It is an enhancement of the standard Emacs editor.
* For Windows users, XEmacs is a good solution.


* Once the installation of Emacs and ESS is done, you just have to open Emacs and open or create a file with extension '''.R''' (C-x C-f). ESS will be automatically loaded. 
** C-c M-j evaluates the current line
** C-c M-r evaluates the current region
** C-c M-b evaluates the current buffer 

* See John Fox webpage http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/ESS/ess-xemacs.pdf to learn about Emacs and ESS

==== WinEdt ====

* ''How to use R for Windows with the RWinEdt extension ?'' by Andy Eggers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~aeggers/RWinEdt_installation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* WinEdt is not open source
* WinEdt is for Windows only.
* Install the '''RWinEdt''' package.

==== gedit with gedit-r-plugin ====

* For Linux users only.
* There is also a plugin for '''gedit''' called '''gedit-r-plugin'''. This can be installed using Synaptic or any other package manager on a linux platform.

== Customizing R ==

=== R profile ===

R can be customized using the Rprofile file. 
On Linux, this file is stored in the home directory. You can edit it by running the following command in a terminal :
&lt;pre&gt;
$ gedit ~/.Rprofile
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you use some packages very often, you can load them systematically using the Rprofile file. You can also change the default options.

=== Options ===

The function &lt;code&gt;options()&lt;/code&gt; without any argument show all options

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; options()
&lt;/source&gt;

The linguistic and encoding options can be modified using &lt;code&gt;Sys.setlocale()&lt;/code&gt; :
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; Sys.setlocale()
[1] &quot;fr_FR.UTF-8/fr_FR.UTF-8/fr_FR.UTF-8/C/fr_FR.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, error messages are in the local language. However, it is possible to set them in English using &lt;code&gt;Sys.sentev()&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE='en')
&lt;/source&gt;

== Random Number Generators ==

To a very high degree computers are deterministic and therefore are not a reliable [[:w:/dev/random|source of significant amounts of random values]].  In general [[:w:Pseudorandom_number_generator|pseudo random number generators]] are used.
The default algorithm in R is [[:w:Mersenne twister|Mersenne-Twister]] but a long list of methods is available. See the help of RNGkind() to learn about random number generators.

&lt;pre&gt;
?RNGkind
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to use true random numbers. Some of them are collected on ''random.org'' ([http://www.random.org/ link]). The '''random''' ([http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/random.html link]) package gives an access to them.

=== Randu ===

Randu is an old linear congruential pseudorandom number generator. 
There is a dataset generated with Randu in the '''datasets''' package. The function which is used to generate the dataset is in the help of this page. 
&lt;pre width=80&gt;
library(&quot;datasets&quot;)
?randu
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Seed ==

A pseudo random number generator is an algorithm based on a starting point called &quot;seed&quot;. If you want to perform an exact replication of your program, you have to specify the seed using the function set.seed(). The argument of set.seed has to be an integer.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; set.seed(1)
&gt; runif(1)
[1] 0.2655087
&gt; set.seed(1)
&gt; runif(1)
[1] 0.2655087
&lt;/pre&gt; 

== Sampling in a vector ==

Toss 10 coins 
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; sample(0:1,10,replace=T)
 [1] 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
Roll 10 dice
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; sample(1:6,10,replace=T)
 [1] 4 1 5 3 2 5 5 6 3 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
play lottery (6 random numbers out of 49 without replacement)
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; sample(1:49,6,replace=F)
[1] 18 35 29  1 33 11
&lt;/pre&gt;


You can sample in a multinomial distribution : 
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;mydat &lt;- sample(1:4,1000,rep=TRUE,prob=c(.2,.3,.2,.3))
&gt;table(mydat)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Sampling in a standard univariate distribution ==

You can use rnorm, rt, etc. 

=== Misspecified argument ===

Note that if you put as argument of rnorm a vector instead of a number, R takes by default the length of the vector instead of returning an error. Here is an example : 

&lt;pre&gt;
x &lt;- rnorm(10) # Sample a normal random vector
set.seed(1) # use the seed
z &lt;- rnorm(x) # put a vector instead of a number as an argument of rnorm
set.seed(1) # initalize the seed again
z2 &lt;- rnorm(length(x)) # sample in a vector with the same length as x
plot(z2,z) # check that z and z2 are the same
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Inverse CDF method ==

* If you know the inverse CDF (quantile function), you can generate the random variable by sampling in the standard uniform distribution and transforming using the CDF.

For instance, if you want to simulate from a standard normal distribution, you can simulate from a standard uniform and transform it using the quantile function of the normal distribution. 

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
N &lt;- 100
qnorm(runif(N))
&lt;/pre&gt;

This gives the same results as the &lt;tt&gt;rnorm()&lt;/tt&gt; function but the computing time is higher : 

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10^7
&gt; system.time(qnorm(runif(N)))
   user  system elapsed 
   1.67    0.00    1.70 
&gt; system.time(rnorm(N)) 
   user  system elapsed 
   1.50    0.00    1.51 
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Importance sampling ==

* See Jeff Gill's [http://artsci.wustl.edu/~jgill/papers/sir4.txt routine]

== Metropolis algorithm ==

== Gibbs algorithm ==

* '''rgs''' package ([http://code.google.com/p/rgs-package/ link])

== Quasi random numbers ==

Sometimes you need to generate [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuasirandomSequence.html quasi random sequences]. The '''randtoolbox''' library provides several quasi random number generators. 

See also &lt;tt&gt;sHalton()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;QUnif()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''sfsmisc''').

* [[Wikipedia | Halton Sequence]] 

&lt;pre width=80&gt;
&gt; library(randtoolbox)
&gt; halton(10, dim = 2, init = TRUE, normal = FALSE, usetime = FALSE)
        [,1]       [,2]
 [1,] 0.5000 0.33333333
 [2,] 0.2500 0.66666667
 [3,] 0.7500 0.11111111
 [4,] 0.1250 0.44444444
 [5,] 0.6250 0.77777778
 [6,] 0.3750 0.22222222
 [7,] 0.8750 0.55555556
 [8,] 0.0625 0.88888889
 [9,] 0.5625 0.03703704
[10,] 0.3125 0.37037037
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can compare Halton draws with the standard R (pseudo) random number generator. 
Halton draws are much more systematic.

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
&gt;random &lt;- cbind(runif(1000),runif(1000))
&gt;halton &lt;- halton(1000, dim = 2, init = TRUE, normal = FALSE, usetime = FALSE)
&gt;par(mfrow=c(2,2))
&gt;plot(halton[,1],halton[,2])
&gt;plot(random[,1],random[,2])
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>/* Histogram */ reign in very long comments</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This page deals with a set of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics non-parametric methods] including the estimation of a cumulative distribution function (CDF), the estimation of probability density function (PDF) with histograms and kernel methods and the estimation of flexible regression models such as local regressions and generalized additive models. 

For an introduction to nonparametric methods you can have a look at the following books or handout : 
* ''Nonparametric Econometrics: A Primer'' by Jeffrey S. Racine&lt;ref name=&quot;primer&quot;&gt;Jeffrey S. Racine ''Nonparametric Econometrics: A Primer'' http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/racine/ECO0301.pdf and at the R code examples http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/racine/primer_code.zip&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* Li and Racine's handbook, ''Nonparametric econometrics''&lt;ref name =&quot;liracine&quot;&gt;Qi Li, Jeffrey S. Racine, ''Nonparametric econometrics'', Princeton University Press - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Larry Wasserman ''All of Nonparamatric Statistics''&lt;ref name = &quot;wasserman&quot;&gt;Wasserman, Larry, &quot;All of nonparametric statistics&quot;, Springer (2007) (ISBN: 0387251456)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical distribution function ==
* The easiest way to estimate the empirical CDF uses the &lt;tt&gt;rank()&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;length()&lt;/tt&gt; functions.
* &lt;tt&gt;ecdf()&lt;/tt&gt; computes the empirical cumulative distribution function. 
* &lt;tt&gt;ecdf.ksCI()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''sfsmisc''') plots the empirical distribution function with confidence intervals.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; edf &lt;- rank(x)/length(x)
&gt; plot(x,edf)
&gt; plot(ecdf(x),xlab = &quot;x&quot;,ylab = &quot;Distribution of x&quot;)
&gt; grid()
&gt; library(&quot;sfsmisc&quot;)
&gt; ecdf.ksCI(x1)
&lt;/source&gt;


== Density Estimation ==

=== Histogram ===

* &lt;tt&gt;hist()&lt;/tt&gt; is the standard function for drawing histograms. If you store the histogram as an object the estimated parameters are returned in this object. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
&gt; hist(x, probability = T) # The default uses Sturges method.
&gt; # Sturges, H. A. (1926) The choice of a class interval.
&gt; # Journal of the American Statistical Association 21, 65–66. 
&gt; hist(x, breaks = &quot;Sturges&quot;, probability = T)
&gt; 
&gt; # Freedman, D. and Diaconis, P. (1981) On the histogram as a density estimator: L_2 theory.
&gt; # Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und verwandte Gebiete 57, 453–476. 
&gt; # (n^1/3 * range)/(2 * IQR).
&gt; hist(x, breaks = &quot;FD&quot;, probability = T)
&gt; 
&gt; # Scott, D. W. (1979). On optimal and data-based histograms. Biometrika, 66, 605–610. 
&gt; # ceiling[n^1/3 * range/(3.5 * s)].
&gt; hist(x, breaks = &quot;scott&quot;, probability = T)
&gt; 
&gt; # Wand, M. P. (1995). Data-based choice of histogram binwidth.
&gt; # The American Statistician, 51, 59–64. 
&gt; library(&quot;KernSmooth&quot;)
&gt; h &lt;- dpih(x)
&gt; bins &lt;- seq(min(x)-h, max(x)+h, by=h)
&gt; hist(x, breaks=bins, probability = T)
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to choose the break points. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
&gt; hist(x, breaks = seq(-4,4,.1))
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;tt&gt;n.bins()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''car''' package) includes several methods to compute the number of bins for an histogram.
* &lt;tt&gt;histogram()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''lattice''')
* &lt;tt&gt;truehist()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''MASS''')
* &lt;tt&gt;hist.scott()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''MASS''') plot a histogram with automatic bin width selection, using the Scott or Freedman–Diaconis formulae. 
* '''histogram''' package.

=== Kernel Density Estimation ===
* &lt;tt&gt;density()&lt;/tt&gt; estimates the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Density_Estimation kernel density] of a vector. 
** Choose the bandwidth selection method with &lt;tt&gt;bw&lt;/tt&gt;.
** Check the sensitivity of the bandwidth choice using &lt;tt&gt;adjust&lt;/tt&gt;. The default is one. It is good practice to look at &lt;tt&gt;adjust=.5&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;adjust=2&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(10^3)
&gt; plot(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = 1, kernel = &quot;gaussian&quot;), col = 1)
&gt; lines(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = .5, kernel = &quot;gaussian&quot;), col = 2)
&gt; lines(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = 2, kernel = &quot;gaussian&quot;), col = 3)
&gt; legend(&quot;topright&quot;, legend = c(&quot;adjust = 1&quot;, &quot;adjust = .5&quot;, &quot;adjust = 2&quot;), col = 1:3, lty = 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
** Choose the kernel function with &lt;tt&gt;kernel&lt;/tt&gt; : &quot;gaussian&quot;, &quot;epanechnikov&quot;, &quot;rectangular&quot;, &quot;triangular&quot;, &quot;biweight&quot;, &quot;cosine&quot;, &quot;optcosine&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(10^3)
&gt; plot(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = 1, kernel = &quot;gaussian&quot;), col = 1)
&gt; lines(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = 1, kernel = &quot;epanechnikov&quot;), col = 2)
&gt; lines(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = 1, kernel = &quot;rectangular&quot;), col = 3)
&gt; lines(density(x,bw = &quot;nrd0&quot;, adjust = 1, kernel = &quot;triangular&quot;), col = 3)
&gt; legend(&quot;topright&quot;, legend = c(&quot;gaussian&quot;, &quot;epanechnikov&quot;, &quot;rectangular&quot;,  &quot;triangular&quot;), col = 1:4, lty = 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;tt&gt;tkdensity()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''sfsmisc''') is a nice function which allow to dynamically choose the kernel and the bandwith with a handy graphical user interface. This is a good way to check the sensitivity of the bandwidth and/or kernel choice on the density estimation.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x  &lt;- rnorm(10^3)
&gt; library(&quot;sfsmisc&quot;)
&gt; tkdensity(x)
&lt;/source&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;kde2d()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''MASS''') estimates a bivariate kernel density.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 1000
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x^2 + rnorm(N)
&gt; dd &lt;-  kde2d(y,x) # estimate the bivariate kernel
&gt; contour(dd) # plot the bivariate density
&gt; image(dd) # another plot the bivariate density
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Examples ====

File:R-US state areas-density.svg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Local Regression ==

* &lt;tt&gt;loess()&lt;/tt&gt; is the standard function for local linear regression.
* &lt;tt&gt;lowess()&lt;/tt&gt; is similar to &lt;tt&gt;loess()&lt;/tt&gt; but does not has a standard syntax for regression &lt;code&gt; y ~ x  &lt;/code&gt;.This is the ancestor of loess (with different defaults!).
* &lt;tt&gt;ksmooth()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''stats''') computes the Nadaraya–Watson kernel regression estimate. 
* &lt;tt&gt;locpoly()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''KernSmooth''' package)
* &lt;tt&gt;npreg()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''np''' package)
* '''locpol''' computes local polynomial estimators
* '''locfit''' local regression, likelihood and density estimation


=== Examples ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;


== Generalized additive semiparametric models (GAM) ==

* &lt;tt&gt;gam()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''gam''')
* &lt;tt&gt;gam()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''mgcv''')

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10^3
&gt; u &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
&gt; x2 &lt;- rnorm(N) + x1
&gt; y &lt;- 1 + x1^2 + x2^3 + u
&gt; 
&gt; library(gam)
&gt; g1 &lt;- gam(y ~ x1 + x2 ) # Standard linear model
&gt; par(mfrow=c(1,2))
&gt; plot(g1, se = T)
&gt; 
&gt; g1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x1) + x2 ) # x1 is locally estimated
&gt; par(mfrow=c(1,2))
&gt; plot(g1, se = T)
&gt; 
&gt; g1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x1) + s(x2) ) # x1 and x2 are locally estimated
&gt; par(mfrow=c(1,2))
&gt; plot(g1, se = T)
&gt; 
&gt; library(mgcv)
&gt; g1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x1) + s(x2) ) # x1 and x2 are locally estimated

[[w:Quantile regression|Quantile regression]] is a very old method which has become popular only in the last years thanks to computing progress. One of the main researcher in this area is also a R practitioner and has developped a specific package for quantile regressions ('''quantreg''')&lt;ref&gt;Roger Koenker (2010). quantreg: Quantile Regression. R package version 4.50. http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quantreg&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/rq/rq.html Roger Koenker's personal webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In theory, Quantile regression are also linear and thus could have been included in the Linear regression page. However, this is a very specific topic and we think that it is worth writing a specific page for this topic.

== Simple quantile model ==
We simulate from a simple quantile model. We first generate a uniform error term u and a covariate x. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
N &lt;- 10^3
u &lt;- runif(N)
x &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N)
y &lt;- qnorm(u, mean = 0, sd = 2) + qnorm(u, mean = 1, sd = 1) * x
&lt;/source&gt;

We estimate the quantile model for some values of tau (the quantile) and plot the coefficients : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
q1 &lt;- rq(y ~ x, tau = seq(.1,.9,.1))
summary(q1)
plot(q1)
&lt;/source&gt;

We then plot the scatterplot, the predicted values using a standard linear model and the predicted values using a quantile linear model : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x,y, col = &quot;grey&quot;)
abline(m1, col = &quot;red&quot;)
taus &lt;- seq(.1,.9,.1)
for (i in 1:length(taus)){
	abline(rq(y ~ x, tau = taus[i]), col = &quot;blue&quot;)
	}
grid()
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also estimate the model for all quantiles in the same time : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
q2 &lt;- rq(y ~ x, tau = -1)
plot(q2, nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Computing time ===

For large data sets it is better to use the &quot;fn&quot; or &quot;pfn&quot; method. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10^5
&gt; u &lt;- runif(N)
&gt; x &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N)
&gt; y &lt;- qnorm(u, mean = 0, sd = 2) + qnorm(u, mean = 1, sd = 1) * x
&gt; system.time(rq(y ~ x, tau = .5, method = &quot;br&quot;))
   user  system elapsed 
   1.48    0.00    1.48 
&gt; system.time(rq(y ~ x, tau = .5, method = &quot;fn&quot;))
   user  system elapsed 
   0.60    0.00    0.61 
&gt; system.time(rq(y ~ x, tau = .5, method = &quot;pfn&quot;)) 
   user  system elapsed 
   0.30    0.00    0.29 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Factor analysis}}
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Introduction ==

[[Wikipedia|Factor analysis]] is a set of techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The goal is to describe the dataset with a smaller number of variables (ie underlying factors). Factor Analysis was developed in the early part of the 20th century by L.L. Thurstone and others.  Correspondence analysis was originally developed by [[w:Jean-Paul_Benzécri|Jean-Paul Benzécri]] in the 60's and the 70's. Factor analysis is mainly used in marketing, sociology and psychology. It is also known as '''data mining''', '''multivariate data analysis''' or '''exploratory data analysis'''.

There are three main methods. ''Principal Component Analysis'' deals with continuous variables. ''Correspondence Analysis'' deals with a contingency table (two qualitative variables) and ''Multiple correspondence analysis'' is a generalization of the correspondence analysis with more than two qualitative variables.
The major difference between Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis is that in FA, only the variance which is common to multiple variables is analysed, while in PCA, all of the variance is analysed.
Factor Analysis is a difficult procedure to use properly, and is often misapplied in the psychological literature. One of the major issues in FA (and PCA) is the number of factors to extract from the data. Incorrect numbers of factors can cause difficulties with the interpretation and analysis of the data.

There are a number of techniques which can be applied to assess how many factors to extract. The two most useful are parallel analysis and the minimum average partial criterion. Parallel analysis works by simulating a matrix of the same rank as the data and extracting eigenvalues from the simulated data set. The point at which the simulated eigenvalues are greater than those of the data is the point at which the &quot;correct&quot; number of factors have been extracted. The Minimum Average Partial criterion uses a different approach but can often be more accurate. Simulation studies have established these two methods as the most accurate. Both of these methods are available in the &lt;tt&gt;psych&lt;tt&gt; package under the &lt;tt&gt;fa.parallel&lt;tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;VSS&lt;tt&gt; commands.

Another issue in factor analysis is which rotation (if any) to choose. Essentially, the rotations transform the scores such that they are more easily interpretable. There are two major classes of rotations, orthogonal and oblique. Orthogonal rotations assume that the factors are uncorrelated, while oblique rotations allow the factors to correlate (but do not force this). Oblique rotations are recommended by some (e.g. MacCallum et al 1999) as an orthogonal solution can be obtained from an oblique rotation, but not vice versa. 

One of the issues surrounding factor analysis is that there are an infinite number of rotations which explain the same amount of variance, so it can be difficult to assess which model is correct. In response to such concerns, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), which is also known as Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was developed by Joreskeg in the 1970's. The essential principle of SEM is that given a model, it attempts to reproduce the observed covariance matrix seen in the data. The ability of a model to reproduce the data can be used as a test of that model's truth. SEM is implemented in R in the &lt;tt&gt;sem&lt;tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;lavaan&lt;tt&gt; packages, as well as the OpenMx package (which is not available on CRAN).

==Introduction==
We mainly use following packages to demontrate network analysis in R: '''statnet''', '''sna''', '''igraph'''. They are however not representing a complete list. See [http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/gR.html Task view of ''gR'', graphical models in R] for a complete list.

==Creating simple graphs with igraph==

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
&gt; # load the appropriate library
&gt; library(igraph)
&gt; # now create a few simple graphs
&gt; g &lt;- graph.empty(10,directed=FALSE)
&gt; g2 &lt;- graph.ring(10,directed=TRUE)
&gt; g3 &lt;- graph.full(10,directed=FALSE)
&gt; # now get information about these graphs
&gt; summary(g)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Creating graphs from data==

First load the igraph package
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(igraph)
&lt;/source&gt;
then you can choose your preferred format. Below are examples of data provided as edge list and as adjacency matrix. 

=== Creating graph from an edge list ===

An edge list is formed by a two-column matrix, with each row defining one edge. An edge is drawn from each element in the first column to the corresponding element in the second one.
Use the &lt;code&gt; graph.edgelist() &lt;/code&gt; function to import your data.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
# producing some random data in edge list form
el &lt;- cbind(sample(1:10, 10), sample(1:10, 10))

# creating and plottig the graph from the edge list
gr &lt;- graph.edgelist(el)
plot(gr)	
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Creating graph from an adjacency matrix ===

An adjacency matrix is a ''n'' × ''n'' matrix containing ''n'' vertices and where each entry ''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the number of edges from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j''. To import your adjacency matrix, use the &lt;code&gt; graph.adjacency()  &lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
# producing a random adjacency matrix
adj &lt;- matrix(sample(0:1, 100, replace=T), 10, 10)

# creating and plottig the graph from the adjacency matrix
gr &lt;- graph.adjacency(adj)
plot(gr)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Model Representation ==

The coordination of a system can be modeled as a discrete-event system (DES). The behaviour of these systems is governed by discrete events occurring asynchronously over time. To model this discrete behaviour one can use Finite State Machines (FSM) or Petri Nets (PN). FSM are used where the decision making is centralized, instead PN are used where the decision making is distributed (multiple agents) (more on centralized vs. distributed: view a previous chapter).These two modelling tools are sufficient to model every DES.  Every PN can be converted to an FSM and vice versa. These modeling tools can be used to visualize, analize, designing and optimizing the coordination of a system.

=== Finite State Machines (FSM) ===

FSM models a discrete-event system as a combination of these model primitives: a set of states and a set of transitions. 
To go from a state to another, one has to satisfy the approriate condition (the occurrence of an event) between the two states. For more elaborated documentation: view the [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Finite State Machines and Petri Nets|corresponding section]] in this Wikibook, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net the wikipedia page], or [http://users.vtk.be/~s0170766/1e%20Master/2e%20semester/Embedded%20Control%20Systems/Appendix_FSM_PN_MDP.pdf the appendix].

[[Image:primitivesFSM.jpg|center|thumb|500px|FSM model primitives]]

The idea of FSM can be expanded; when the outcome of events are not deterministic but stochastic, this can be moddeled by a Markov Decision Process (MDP)

=== Petri Nets (PN) ===

PN models a discrete-event system as a combination of these model primitives: a set set of places, a set of transitions and a set of tokens. Places represent conditions and transitions represent events. The state of a PN is described by the marking of the PN. A marking is an assignment of tokens to places in the net. These tokens represent the conditions indicated by particular places which hold at a moment of time. A transition can only fire when it is enabled. A transition is enabled if each of its input places has at least one token in it. When it fires one token from each input place will be taken and one token will be put in each output place of the transition. For more a more detailed explanation: view the [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Finite State Machines and Petri Nets|corresponding section]] in this Wikibook, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine the wikipedia page], or [http://users.vtk.be/~s0170766/1e%20Master/2e%20semester/Embedded%20Control%20Systems/Appendix_FSM_PN_MDP.pdf the appendix].

== Descrete Event System Properties ==

This section handles the general properties of discrete event systems.

=== Discrete ===

In nature everything is a continuous process. When modelling a system with a discrete-event system, one assumes that certain behaviour doesn't change through time. This constant behaviour is represented by a state.

=== Asynchronous nature ===

Because FSM and PN are discrete models, time isn't measured. Consequently, one doesn't know how long a transition from one state to another takes. Only the order of event occurrence is important. In reality transitions take time, so during a transition the system will be in an undefined state because instantaneous transitions are assumed. These timing aspects can be modelled but this makes the model more complex and harder to understand.

=== Deadlocks ===

When modelling distributed systems, one must taken account for the occurrence of never being able to  fire a transition because there are no tokens left to fill the empty transition inputs (because alle other tokens are also waiting on a transition). This situation of mutual waiting is called a deadlock.

=== Uninterpreted model ===

The states and transitions in FSM and PN are labeled with statements. These labels make clear what the state represents and what fysical condition will trigger an transition. If one would change the name of these labels, this wouldn't affect the execution of the models. That's why PN and FSM are uninterpreted. The same FSM or PN can describe many systems.

=== Hierarchy ===

Every FSM can be a sub-FSM of another, bigger FSM. The same is true for PN. The sub-FSM is represented by a separate state, while a sub-PN is replaced by one transition or one place. Hierarchy makes a model better to understand.

== Design lessons ==

From the previous properties one can derive some design rules. These are summarised in this section.

=== General ===
When designing the coordination of a system as a discrete event system, one should always keep the timing aspects in mind. Transitions in DES take no time at all, in contrast to real life. Outputs could for example take some time to emerge and neglecting this could make your model behave in an unpredictable way. Always model time when it's an important property of your system.

Other concerns are the starting-up and the shutting down behaviour.  Often FSM and PN are represented as if they never have to boot up or to shut down, while real-life systems do encounter these conditions.  Neglecting these conditions can cause the system to behave unpredictable and maybe even hazardous. The start and end procedures could be modelled as a separated FSM or PN.

Always use a hierarchical structure to clearify your design. With hierarchy it is also easy to model starting and ending. Starting for example is a state of a system. When all conditions are met, the system can go to its next state, the normal behaviour. When the system needs to shut down, it can go to its last state, the shut-down-state.

=== Design of FSM ===

FSM are widely used to design control systems. However, there are no general indications as to which type of FSM model (Moore vs. Mealy) is best to use in your design. Choice of a model depends on the application, execution means (for instance, hardware systems are usually best realised as Moore models) and preferences of a designer or programmer ([http://www.stateworks.com/technology/TN10-Moore-Or-Mealy-Model/ Moore or Mealy Model?]). The most simple model to understand and to program is the Moore model. The exit actions of the Mealy model should be treated as an auxiliary feature to simplify design or to reduce the number of states. This way you'll get a mixed model of both Moore and Mealy structure. However, be careful to mix synchronous Mealy and Moore models when synchronising two FSM. From experience it appears that this can cause the FSM to receive inputs from each other at unpredicted moments in time.

There are many programming tools like Xilinx to convert state charts to electrical circuits, to program an FPGA for example. VHDL, a programming language to design synchronous FSM, is also used. Matlab Simulink is also a useful tool to design FSM.

=== Design of Petri nets ===

Petri nets are less intuitive but very useful to check a system for deadlocks. A PN should be used to model a system when an FSM behaves unpredictable or when there appears to be a synchronisation problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Usage of Scottish Gaelic==
===Past usage===
Prior to the Statutes of Iona and the religious Reformation in the sixteenth century, Gaelic was the main spoken language of the northwest half of Scotland and Lowland Scots was the main spoken language of the southeast half of Scotland.  From around that time, up until relatively recent times, successive governments sought to discourage the use of Gaelic and the language went into decline.

*Ref [[Wikipedia:Scots Gaelic]]
*Ref [[Wikipedia:Scotland]]
*Ref [[Wikipedia:Statutes of Iona]]
*Ref [[Wikipedia:Scottish Reformation]]

===Present day usage===
By the 1970s the Gaelic language was largely confined to the northwest islands of Scotland but most families in the Western Isles continued to use it as part and parcel of everyday family life.  Since then many families in the Western Isles have stopped speaking in Gaelic and many parents there are no longer passing their native language on to their children.

Many Gaelic speakers have great difficulty in understanding some Gaelic radio programmes (especially news and current affairs programmes) because their knowledge of Gaelic vocabulary is to some extent limited.  Additionally, many Gaelic words have fallen into relative disuse and Gaelic speakers often cannot understand all of the words in traditional poems and songs without the aid of a dictionary.  

A large percentage of Gaelic-speaking people are, relatively speaking, socially isolated from fellow Gaelic-speakers and seldom have the opportunity to make use of their skill in Gaelic.  Many Gaelic-speaking people live outside of the Gaelic-speaking areas such as in the cities, for example, and in such areas the social networks of Gaelic-speaking people are relatively poor.

Recently, however, the government and the education system have become more favourable towards Gaelic, and some schools in Scotland offer to educate children in Gaelic.  Many of the children in Gaelic schools and Gaelic units within schools, however, tend to confine their use of Gaelic to school hours and tend to speak English at home, particularly in families which are not in frequent contact with other Gaelic-speaking families.

Although more people are now learning Gaelic, and attitudes towards the Gaelic language are gradually improving, relatively few learners of Gaelic are achieving fluency.  As a result, very few learners of Gaelic are passing the language on to their children or grandchildren.

*Ref: [[Wikipedia:Western Isles]]

===Looking to the future===

Recently the government set up a department in Scotland called B&amp;ograve;rd na G&amp;agrave;idhlig whose responsibility is to encourage the increased use of Gaelic.  B&amp;ograve;rd na G&amp;agrave;idhlig has laid a strong emphasis on consultation with the Gaelic speaking population - giving some room for optimism for the future continued use of the language.

Understanding the signs indicating whether the language is likely to recover and increase in usage is a complicated matter and requires a good understanding of the principles of language revival ''(see [[Wikipedia:language revival]])''.

While it has to be said that a high proportion of Gaelic speakers are now socially isolated from other Gaelic speakers, giving them few opportunities to avail themselves of their skill in the language, there are increasing opportunities to learn Gaelic, and some of the Gaelic learning groups and societies encourage learners of Gaelic to speak in Gaelic as much as possible in order to make the learners feel more comfortable when speaking Gaelic.  

In recent years there was a tendency at Gaelic arts festivals for people to speak in English rather than Gaelic.  For instance prizegiving at M&amp;ograve;d competitions started to become conducted in English rather than Gaelic.  In recent festivals, however, it is said that the usage of spoken Gaelic has increased again and that some of these festivals are becoming, once again, social occasions where people are encouraged to use the language not only in poetry and song recital but in general conversation as well.

With such mixed indications it seems that the future of the Gaelic language hangs very much in the balance.

==Sustainability==

In our world, where English is used and understood by roughly a quarter of its entire population, it is becoming increasingly the case that local languages such as Gaelic can subsist alongside global languages such as English without one negating the importance of the other.  Indeed the use of English has increased enormously in recent years despite the fact that, as a proportion of the world's population, its number of mother-tongue speakers is actually decreasing.  Global languages facilitate international communication and business while local languages provide community cohesion, social stability and confidence as well as access to local forms of literature and culture.  A global language and a local language can live side by side provided they are each given specific roles or niches and provided each are afforded due respect.  Providing people with adequate opportunities to learn both a local and a global language and ensuring that such persons can be given the opportunity to be well integrated into the societies that use these languages is, in my view, a small price to pay for securing the personal, social and economic benefits of being sustainably and confidently bilingual.  The global and the local both matter and language is part-and-parcel of each.

===Making Gaelic sustainable===

The number of people with an ability to speak, read or write Scottish Gaelic has declined in the past few centuries and the number is now well under 50,000.  Many of the people who are able to speak Gaelic are not in the habit of using it and many Gaelic-speaking parents are not in the habit of speaking in Gaelic to their children.  Many of those who are able to speak Gaelic are scattered and effectively isolated from other Gaelic speakers and they seldom obtain opportunities to avail themselves of their skill in Gaelic.  There are also few occasions or situations where people are positively
encouraged or required to use Gaelic.  In addition, some Gaelic-speaking people have a negative attitude towards their language and
prefer not to make use of their ability to speak it, and discourage others from speaking it too.
This raises long-term questions about the sustainability of the language.  Wikipedia has useful information on language revival relating to the sustainability of languages like Scottish Gaelic (see [[Wikipedia:language revival]]).  

Research into sociolinguistics and related fields suggests that the following could be helpful towards the promotion and well-being of a lesser-used language:

*people in the dominant community have positive attitudes towards (and speak well of) those people who regularly use the lesser-used language
:(for more detail see David Crystal's book, Language Death)
*the community who regularly use the lesser-used language are relatively free from dangers such as war, persecution, famine, epidemics, poverty and crime
:(for more detail see David Crystal's book, Language Death)
*there are schools available which teach using the lesser-used language AND the use of the lesser-used language is also reinforced outside of school hours
:(for more detail see Joshua Fishman's book, Can Threatened Languages be Saved)
*the people who regularly speak the less-used language are also able to read and write in the less-used language
:(based on writings by both Joshua Fishman and David Crystal)
*the people who regularly use the less-used language are also able to make use of electronic (e.g. computer) technology
:(for more detail see David Crystal's book, Language Death)
*there is a general awareness of the potential benefits of being bilingual, including in particular the cognitive benefits and the potential benefits to the person's self-esteem and confidence
*there is some degree of general awareness of the social consequences of language shift (see [[Wikipedia:language shift]])
*those who have a working knowledge of the language have a strong presence in the education system
:(for more detail see David Crystal's book, Language Death)
*there are opportunities for people to enter into Gaelic language apprenticeships
:(for more detail see the research by Jon Reyhner at the University of Northern Arizona)

===Social consequences of language shift===

For the sustainability of a language it may be helpful if there is a general awareness of the consequences of language shift.  

Language shift can be detrimental to at least parts of the community associated with the language which is being lost. Sociolinguists such as Joshua Fishman, Lilly Wong Fillmore and Jon Reyhner report that language shift (when it involves loss of the first language) can lead to cultural disintegration and a variety of social problems including increased alcoholism, dysfunctional families and increased incidence of premature death.

For example, Ohiri-Aniche (1997) observes a tendency among many Nigerians to bring up their children as monolingual speakers of English and reports that this can lead to their children holding their heritage language in disdain and feeling ashamed of being associated with the language of their parents and grandparents. As a result of this some Nigerians are said to feel neither wholly European nor wholly Nigerian.

*Ref: Ohiri-Aniche, C (1997) Nigerian languages die.  ''Quarterly Review of Politics, Economics and Society 1(2),73-9''.

===Advantages of being able to communicate in more than one language===

For the purposes of making a lesser-used language sustainable it is probably helpful for people to be aware of the benefits of being able to communicate in more than one language.  There are several advantages in being able to communicate in more than one language.  It broadens a person's experiences, provides cognitive advantages and, provided each of the person's languages are afforded due respect, can contribute to a person's self-esteem and confidence.

People who are able to communicate well in more than one language can have a greater breadth of experiences, and often a greater tolerance of cultural differences. A person who is communicative in more than one language is often accepting of those who are culturally different and is often welcoming of those who speak other languages and have different customs.

People who are fluent in more than one language get to know which language to use with which person in which situation. Through this experience they appear to learn how to be more sensitive to the needs of listeners than people who can only communicate in one language.

People who can read and write in more than one language are able to enjoy two or more literatures, opening up different literary traditions, ideas, ways of behaving and ways of thinking. The pleasures of reading poems, novels and magazines and the enjoyment of writing to relatives and friends are all increased for people who have the ability to communicate proficiently in more than one language.

Where parents have different preferred languages, children learn how to communicate in each parent's language. This can allow a close and special relationship with each parent to develop.

Having two or more words for every object and idea can be an advantage to creativity. Sometimes corresponding words in different languages have different associations or connotations. When slightly different associations are attached to each word, the person with two or more languages may be able to think more creatively.

===Reversing language shift===

Joshua Fishman proposes an eight-stage model for reversing language shift and recommends that efforts should concentrate on the earlier stages until they have been consolidated before proceeding to the later stages.  The eight stages are as follows:

* Acquisition of the language by adults, who may effectively act as language apprentices (recommended where most of the remaining speakers of the language are elderly and socially isolated from other speakers of the language).

* Create a socially integrated population of active speakers of the language, thereby creating a community of people who use the language frequently (at this stage it is usually best to concentrate mainly on the spoken language rather than the written language).

* In localities where there are a reasonable number of people habitually using the language, encourage the informal use of the language among people of all age groups and within families and bolster its daily use through the establishment of local neighbourhood institutions in which the language is encouraged, protected and (in certain contexts at least) used exclusively. (At this stage it may be useful for speakers to be aware of the personal advantages of being bilingual).

* In areas where oral competence in the language has been achieved in all age groups encourage literacy in the language but in a way that does not depend upon assistance from (or goodwill of) the state education system.

* Where the state permits it, and where numbers warrant, encourage the use of the language in lieu of compulsory state education. (at this stage it may be useful for speakers of the language to be aware of the benefits of bilingual education).

* Where the above have largely been achieved encourage the use of the language in the workplace (lower worksphere).

* Where the above have largely been achieved encourage use of the language in local government services and mass media.

* Where the above have largely been achieved encourage use of the language in higher education, government etc.

This model of language revival seeks to avoid conflict and is intended to direct efforts to where they are most effective and to avoid wasting energy trying to achieve the later stages of language revival when the earlier stages have not been achieved.  For instance it is probably wasteful of effort to work on the later stages of language revival if few families are in the habit of using the language among themselves.

The Buddhabrot is an alternate method for the rendering of the traditional Mandelbrot fractal formula, where the [[Fractals/Orbits|orbits]] are traced and their positions drawn directly, rather than coloring based on some other outcome of the orbit.

&lt;pre&gt;
\ifx \Macro1 \Macro2
&lt;tex commands&gt;
\else
&lt;tex commands&gt;
\fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==

With the \ifx command you can perform conditional compilation by testing for macro equivalence.
It does not expand the given macros. The two macros are considered equal if
* both are macros and
* the first level expansion is equal and
* they have the same state with regards to \long and \outer

See also the command [[TeX/def|\def]].

==Examples==
For example, let's say we define a new macro just to do conditional compilation:

&lt;pre&gt;
\def \myMacro {}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then we can use \ifx to check if this macro is defined or not.
&lt;pre&gt;
\ifx \myMacro \undefined
This will be processed if myMacro is not defined.
\else
This will be processed if myMacro is defined.
\fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

See also [http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=isdef] on the use of this method for testing whether
a macro is defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is theology?==
Human beings are essentially social animals. Social animals operate in groups, packs or tribes. Usually individuals are linked by family connections to an 'alpha male' who provides tactical leadership. Provided this leadership increases the probability of success for individual members as well as for himself he will earn respect. Humans uniquely have the ability to formulate long-term strategic plans and communicate complex ideas which has made our species the most successful of all living creatures on this planet. Leadership is crucial to human success. The model of parental superiority is implicit from birth, as the infant human is incapable of independent survival. A hierarchical 'chain of command' with delegated responsibilities and privileges thus emerged naturally and early in human history. Ancestor worship is a form of hierarchical deference to wise (but dead) former leaders. 

===Death===
Theories about what happens after death - if there is a human spirit or soul capable of surviving the body is important to people. Should former leaders influence their survivors? Is  there  somewhere an unseen community of the dead or some sort of super-spirit capable of communicating with the living?  These ideas matter because people believe in these theories, and those beliefs, true or false, do indeed alter our behavior according to the expected reward or punishment. A trader trades with the expectation to be paid 'fairly'. If not, then a 'higher authority' - either the police or the judiciary will be expected to apply influence. A religious person may give alms, or take up arms without expectation of any earthly benefit, expecting instead 'a good feeling' now followed by a certain reward 'in heaven'. 

===Life===
Most religions use the 'external influence' of unseen forces to mold habits that led to successful survival. War is a human strategic invention that allows the winning side to take the riches of the losers, who may be killed or enslaved. War is dangerous for individuals, but not for armies or communities as a whole as long as they are successful defenders or colonizers. Individual warriors have to be assured they will receive their reward at the close of battle or else 'in the afterlife' if they are brave and do as they are told without question. The corollary is that if a warrior is cowardly or disobedient he will first be be killed and tormented 'in the afterlife'.   
===The purpose of Religion===
The origin of theology is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it evolved for the nurture of children&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding|first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hrdy|isbn=9780674032996|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
A society that is able to breed successfully may need to steal from 'outsiders' and enslave 'foreigners' merely to survive. In so doing it is likely to accumulate power and worldly wealth which may be attractive predatory competitors. The same is true of criminal gangs and nation states. The successful strategy is therefore to distinguish 'right' and 'wrong' behavior between 'us' within a group and 'them' - our potential victims. As human societies became more complex the definitions of who was 'inside' (warriors certainly, but what about children, wives, slaves, friendly tribes.....?) as well as the context in which 'right' and 'wrong' might be judged and rewarded (or punished) became a problem requiring study and the evolution of clear rules, which we call theology. When may a warrior legally kill? What is 'just cause' war as distinguished from a criminal enterprise.....

== Types of religion==
Religions generally demand respect for parents, elders and certain wise or brave leaders. Hierarchical power structures culminate in monotheism, where a supreme, all-wise, ever-present but undetectable God monitors a believers' every thought and action.  The contrary view is of polytheism, where many gods deny supremacy to any person or deity. Universal democracy is a form of this, since every elector is an individual, but the average of their collective will (eventually) reign supreme. Rather than respecting the personal wishes of a king or president, democrats require their leaders to conform to their collective will, and punish those who abuse their delegated power. Neither absolute personal princely power nor absolute democracy is very efficient, and most societies strike a balance - The United States of America and the Republic of France have powerful presidents, but their term of office is very short. Conversely the monarchs of the Kingdoms of Spain and Britain rule 'for life' but they have very little power or freedom although their experience may lend them a certain moral authority. 

===Religion and Law===
The European Union has a power structure so complex that it is almost beyond understanding, and relies on the free-will of individual nation states to execute its directives, and rewards or punishes member states rather than their individual citizens. European and International Law emerged mostly from the Judeo-Christian traditions iluminated by some notable Muslim interpretations which evolved around the Iberian peninsula. International law is in one sense a form of religion binding in other religions in order to discourage predatory adventures, racism and genocide, whilst equally encouraging communication, trade and individual human rights guaranteed by the state in which people reside. Not all states subscribe to international law, and some that do place their own theocracy or judiciary above international courts. The USA for example does not submit itself to international scrutiny nor require nor allow its citizens to submit to any legal code except its own constitution. Similarly many Muslim countries apply Sharia (interpretive) contextual judgments rather than impose the rather stark international (codified) law.



== Christianity ==
The Creation in Christianity is based in the book of Genesis. Christians believe this book accurately depicts the creation.   
Genesis is  written in a poetic form, and is presumed to have been inspired by God. It illustrates the creation from the point of view of the Jewish culture and its people. There is an argument amongst Christians as to if it was was written as a parable (evolution via intelligent design) or as a literal truth (which creationists aver).
Most holy scripture is both historically ancient and tends to be  in a mythological language style. Genesis first appeared about three thousand years ago in the tenth century Before the Common Epoch (BC) probably during the reign af King Solomon, and it appears to have been written,re-written, translated and reinterpreted by many authors with different intentions. 
Genesis is not a scientific document, since 'the scientific method' was invented much later (in Baghdad around 7th to 10th century After the common epoch (AC)), Therefore, despite the claims of creationists, it could not explain the creation in scientific terms. Genesis is then a religious document that explain certain spiritual ideas which believers accept as 'true' from a religious and spiritual point of view.

There are many different interpretations about the Genesis from many different Christian denominations.

===Historical or spiritual truth?===
One such interpretation would state that although the book of Genesis does contain poetry and other types of literary devices, it is primarily a historical narrative of how God brought about the beginning of the universe, mankind, the beginning of the Chosen nation of Israel and how 'He' (God) set the wheels in motion for the beginning of his grace after mankind brought about the beginning of sin.  It is a book of beginnings, as is reflected in the title of the book, Bereshith (In the beginning).  Furthermore, for believers, it is more than merely a religious document that explains spiritual truths from a religious point of view.  They accept Genesis as a true historical narrative that reveals the reality of who God is, what he has done in history, and where man came from, how mankind fell into sin, the effects of the fall, and how God has chosen to redeem his chosen people through the Jewish people and his covenant, and ultimately, how He set into motion, the redemption of the elect which would eventually be His Church.
Right and wrong behaviors, just rewards and punishments are exemplified throughout the first five scriptural books (Jewish Torah or Christian Pentateuch) of which Genesis is the opening salvo. 
===Interpretation===
There are several points of differing interpretations within Christian Theology about the actual creation narrative itself.  The first debate begins within the very first word of the very first verse: Bereshith.  The problem arises in the interpretation of the translation.  Whereas, it could be translated &quot;In a beginning&quot; (using an indefinite article - one of many), most scholars will translate it as &quot;In the Beginning&quot; (definite article and therefore the unique story).  This may not seem like a big issue until one moves to the second verse and deals with the translation of the Hebrew word, Hayathah.  There are two legitimate translations of this word, which are, &quot;It was&quot; and &quot;It became&quot;.  If one goes with the former translation, it is clear that this is interpreted as one creation that simply continues the narrative of verse one and translates Bereshith as &quot;In the Beginning&quot;.  If one goes with the latter translation, then this would open the possibility for many different creations and the Gap theory, and would continue the narrative of verse one  which translates Bereshith as &quot;In a Beginning&quot;.  While, the Gap Theorists will point to many creation stories in the ancient world outside of the Jewish narrative as evidence of many creations, proponents of one creation will state that the context of the narrative does not lend itself to a Gap Theory.  The primary context of the narrative is not to tell us how many creations there were, but rather, that God is the one who created the beginning and was the one who was before time (eternal).  It further states that the context is to tell us about the beginning of man, sin, God' covenant, and God's law, and God's redemption of sinful man. The purpose of the writers of Genesis has always been to define 'right' and wrong' interactions (bestowing blessings and sins), how we humans may 'justly' reward and punish each other during our lives, and how (post mortem) we will ourselves eventually receive divine justice calculated and delivered 'fairly and utterly' by a unique and omnipotent God who has an exact record of our every passing moment. 

===History or Poetry?===
The next interpretive issue revolves around the chronological or historical timing of creation.  There are scholars who firmly believe  that creation must have occurred no longer than about 12,000 years ago.  This date may be approximately  deduced from the genealogies given later in Genesis, and on a literal interpretation of a seven days of 24 hours cycle of creation.  One of the major reasons that many Christians hold to this interpretation is that they want to deflect the teachings of 'chance' or Darwinian evolution. If creation of life on earth was simply chance then the fossil records and carbon dating techniques  would predate Genesis and date the world back to millions of years. God would then become merely decorative and cultural within human life rather than truly authoritative and believable source of all things and all-knowing. Contrary to Genesis report of mankind created and completed in an instant Darwin would allow for a gradual emergence of each species (including mankind) over millions of years.  Many faithful Christians, however, would argue that the timing is not of primary importance and that Genesis  explains WHY things are as they are, and so is compatible with,  not in conflict with science, which only explains how things may have become as they are. The actual sequence and timing being immaterial to religious purpose.  Whether  mankind emerged within a seven day cycle or over millions of years, the primary purpose if Genesis is to confirm that God is eternal and is the one agent who created everything.  One argument against the seven 24 hour period of time is that the sun and the moon were not apparently created until the fourth day, and these are essential elements in the measurement of time,  the seasons, and the years.  Another argument revolves around the word &quot;Yom&quot; which can be translated either as 'a day' or used to indicate some undefined period of time.  A third argument is based on the New Testament text which clarifies time as it is understood by God (2 Peter 3:8).  One thing is certain in believers minds is that, whether mankind emerged gradually over millions of years or was created in a split second, there was  God who existed before time as we humans understand it, and it was God who created all things in accordance with divine will.

In this section, we look at the [[w:binomial regression|binomial model]]. We have one outcome which is binary and a set of explanatory variables. 

This kind of model can be analyzed using a [[w:linear probability model|linear probability model]]. However a drawback of this model for the parameter of the [[w:Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli distribution]] is that, unless restrictions are placed on &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;, the estimated coefficients can imply probabilities outside the [[w:unit interval|unit interval]] &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; . For this reason, models such as the [[R_Programming/Binomial_Models#Logit_model|logit model]] or the [[R_Programming/Binomial_Models#Probit_model|probit model]] are more commonly used. If you want to estimate a linear probability model, have a look at the [[R_Programming/Linear_Models|linear models]] page.

== Logit model ==

The model takes the form : &lt;math&gt;y_i \sim Bernoulli(\pi_i)&lt;/math&gt; with the inverse link function : 
&lt;math&gt;\pi_i = \frac{exp(x_i'\beta)} {(1 + exp(x_i'\beta))}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be estimated using maximum likelihood or using bayesian methods. 

=== Fake data simulations ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- 1 + rnorm(1000,1) 
&gt; xbeta &lt;- -1  + (x* 1)
&gt; proba &lt;- exp(xbeta)/(1 + exp(xbeta))
&gt; y &lt;- ifelse(runif(1000,0,1) &lt; proba,1,0)
&gt; table(y)
&gt; df &lt;- data.frame(y,x)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Maximum likelihood estimation ===

* The standard way to estimate a logit model is &lt;tt&gt;glm()&lt;/tt&gt; function with family &lt;tt&gt;binomial&lt;/tt&gt; and link &lt;tt&gt;logit&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;lrm()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Design''') is another implementation of the logistic regression model.
* There is an implementation in the '''Zelig''' package&lt;ref name = &quot;zeliglogit&quot;&gt;Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Oliva Lau. 2008. &quot;logit: Logistic Regression for Dichotomous Dependent Variables&quot; in Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Olivia Lau, &quot;Zelig: Everyone's Statistical Software,&quot; http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig&lt;/ref&gt;.

In this example, we simulate a model with one continuous predictor and estimate this model using the &lt;tt&gt;glm()&lt;/tt&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; res &lt;- glm(y ~ x , family  = binomial(link=logit))
&gt; summary(res) # results
&gt; confint(res) # confindence intervals
&gt; names(res) 
&gt; exp(res$coefficients) # odds ratio
&gt; exp(confint(res)) # Confidence intervals for odds ratio (delta method)
&gt; predict(res) # prediction on a linear scale
&gt; predict(res, type = &quot;response&quot;) # predicted probabilities
&gt; plot(x, predict(res, type = &quot;response&quot;)) # plot the predicted probabilities
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Zelig ====

The '''Zelig'''' package makes it easy to compute all the quantities of interest.

We develop a new example. First we simulate a new dataset with two continuous explanatory variables and we estimate the model using &lt;tt&gt;zelig()&lt;/tt&gt; with  the &lt;tt&gt;model = &quot;logit&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; option. 
* We the look at the predicted values of y at the mean of x1 and x2 
* Then we look at the predicted values when x1 = 0 and x2 = 0
* We also look at what happens when x1 changes from the 3rd to the 1st quartile.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x1 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(1000)
&gt; x2 &lt;- -1 + x1 + rnorm(1000)
&gt; xbeta &lt;- -1  + x1 + x2
&gt; proba &lt;- exp(xbeta)/(1 + exp(xbeta))
&gt; y &lt;- ifelse(runif(1000,0,1) &lt; proba,1,0)
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2)
&gt; table(y)
&gt; 
&gt; z.out &lt;- zelig(y ~ x1 + x2, model = &quot;logit&quot;, data = mydat) # estimating the model
&gt; summary(z.out)
&gt; x.out &lt;- setx(z.out, x1 = mean(x1), x2 = mean(x2)) # setting values for the explanatory variables
&gt; s.out &lt;- sim(z.out, x = x.out) # simulating the quantities of interest
&gt; summary(s.out)
&gt; plot(s.out) # plot the quantities of interest

&gt; # the same with other values
&gt; x.out &lt;- setx(z.out, x1 = 0, x2 = 0)
&gt; s.out &lt;- sim(z.out, x = x.out)
&gt; summary(s.out)

&gt; # What happens if x1 change from the 3rd quartile to the 1st quartile ? 
&gt; x.high &lt;- setx(z.out, x1 = quantile(mydat$x1,.75), x2 = mean(mydat$x2)) 
&gt; x.low &lt;- setx(z.out, x1 = quantile(mydat$x1,.25), x2 = mean(x2)) 
&gt; s.out2&lt;-sim(z.out, x=x.high, x1=x.low) 
&gt; plot(s.out2)
&lt;/source&gt;

* ROC Curve in the '''verification''' package.
* '''Zelig''' has a &lt;tt&gt;rocplot()&lt;/tt&gt; function.

* See [http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm UCLA Statistical Computing example]

=== Bayesian estimation ===

* &lt;tt&gt;bayesglm()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''arm''' package 
* &lt;tt&gt;MCMClogit()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''MCMCpack''' for a bayesian estimation of the logit model.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; # Data generating process
&gt; x &lt;- 1 + rnorm(1000,1) 
&gt; xbeta &lt;- -1  + (x* 1)
&gt; proba &lt;- exp(xbeta)/(1 + exp(xbeta))
&gt; y &lt;- ifelse(runif(1000,0,1) &lt; proba,1,0)
&gt; table(y)
&gt; 
&gt; library(MCMCpack)
&gt; res &lt;- MCMClogit(y ~ x)
&gt; summary(res)

&gt; library(&quot;arm&quot;)
&gt; res &lt;- bayesglm(y ~ x, family = binomial(link=logit))
&gt; summary(res)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Probit model ==

The [[w:Probit_model|probit model]] is a binary model in which we assume that the link function is the cumulative density function of a normal distribution. 

We simulate fake data. First, we draw two random variables x1 and x2 in any distributions (this does not matter). Then we create the vector xbeta as a linear combination of x1 and x2. We apply the link function to that vector and we draw the binary variable y as Bernouilli random variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x1 &lt;- 1 + rnorm(1000)
&gt; x2 &lt;- -1 + x1 + rnorm(1000)
&gt; xbeta &lt;- -1  + x1 + x2
&gt; proba &lt;- pnorm(xbeta)
&gt; y &lt;- ifelse(runif(1000,0,1) &lt; proba,1,0)
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2)
&gt; table(y)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Maximum likelihood ===

We can use the &lt;tt&gt;glm()&lt;/tt&gt; function with &lt;tt&gt;family=binomial(link=probit)&lt;/tt&gt; option or the &lt;tt&gt;probit()&lt;/tt&gt; function in the '''sampleSelection''' package which is a wrapper of the former one.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; res &lt;- glm(y ~ x1 + x2 , family = binomial(link=probit), data = mydat)
&gt; summary(res)
&gt; 
&gt; library(&quot;sampleSelection&quot;)
&gt; probit(y ~ x1 + x2, data = mydat)
&gt; summary(res)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Bayesian estimation ===

* &lt;tt&gt;MCMCprobit()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''MCMCpack''')

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(&quot;MCMCpack&quot;)
&gt; post &lt;- MCMCprobit(y ~ x1 + x2 , data = mydat)
&gt; summary(post)
&gt; plot(post)
&lt;/source&gt;

== What is R ? ==

R is statistical software which is used for data analysis. It includes a huge number of statistical procedures such as t-test, chi-square tests, standard linear models, instrumental variables estimation, local polynomial regressions, etc. It also provides high-level graphics capabilities.

== Why use R? ==

* R is [[w:Free software|free software]]. R is an official GNU project and distributed under the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] [[w:General Public License|General Public License]] (GPL). 
* R is a powerful data-analysis package with many standard and cutting-edge statistical functions. See the Comprehensive R Archive Network's [http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ Task Views] to get an idea of what you can do with R.
* R is a programming language, so its abilities can easily be extended through the use of user-defined functions. A large collection of user-contributed functions and packages can be found at CRAN's [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ Contributed Packages] page.
* R is widely used in political science, statistics, econometrics, actuarial sciences, sociology, finance, etc.
* R is available for all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, GNU-Linux).
* R is [[w:Object-oriented programming|object oriented]]. Virtually anything (e.g., complex data structures) can be stored as an R object.
* R is a matrix language. 
* R syntax is much more systematic than [[Stata]] or [[SAS]] syntax.
* R can be installed on your USB stick&lt;ref name = &quot;portable&quot;&gt;Portable R by Andrew Redd http://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Alternatives to R ===

* [[w:S-PLUS|S-PLUS]] is a commercial version of the same [[w:S (programming language)|S programming language]] that R is a free version of.
* [[w:Gretl|Gretl]] is free software for econometrics. It has a graphical user interface and is nice for beginners.
* [[Using_SPSS_and_PASW|SPSS]] is proprietary software which is often used in sociology, psychology and marketing. It is known to be easy to use. 
* [[w:PSPP|GNU PSPP]] is a free-software alternative to SPSS.
* [[SAS]] is proprietary software that can be used with very large datasets such as census data.
* [[Stata]] is proprietary software that is often used in economics and epidemiology.
* [[MATLAB Programming|MATLAB]] is proprietary software used widely in the mathematical sciences and engineering.
* [[Octave Programming Tutorial|Octave]] is free software similar to MATLAB. The syntax is the same and MATLAB code can be used in Octave.
* [[Python]] is a general programming language. It includes some specific libraries for data analysis such as Pandas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pandas.pydata.org/|title=Python Data Analysis Library|publisher=pandas.pydata.org/|accessdate=February 14th, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.kaggle.com/2013/01/17/getting-started-with-pandas-predicting-sat-scores-for-new-york-city-schools/|title=Getting started with Pandas|publisher=blog.kaggle.com|accessdate=February 14th, 2013|date=January 17th, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Beginners can have a look at [[w:PSPP|GNU PSPP]] or [[w:Gretl|Gretl]]. Intermediate users can check out [[Stata]]. Advanced users who like matrix programming may prefer [[MATLAB Programming|MATLAB]] or [[Octave Programming Tutorial|Octave]]. Very advanced users may use [[R Programming/Using C or Fortran|C or Fortran]].

== R programming style ==

* R is an object oriented programming language. This means that virtually everything can be stored as an R object. Each object has a class. This class describes what the object contains and what each function does with it. For instance, &lt;code&gt;plot(x)&lt;/code&gt; produces different outputs depending on whether &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a regression object or a vector.
* The assignment symbol is &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Alternatively, the classical &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; symbol can be used.
The two following statements are equivalent :
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
 &gt; a &lt;- 2
 &gt; a = 2
&lt;/source&gt;
* Arguments are passed to functions inside round brackets (parentheses).
* One can easily combine functions. For instance you can directly type 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;mean(rnorm(1000)^2)&lt;/source&gt;
* The symbol &quot;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&quot; comments to the end of the line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
 # This is a comment
 5 + 7 # This is also a comment 
&lt;/source&gt;
* Commands are normally separated by a newline. If you want to put more than one statement on a line, you can use the &quot;&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; delimiter.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; a &lt;- 1:10 ; mean(a) &lt;/source&gt;
* You can also have one statement on multiple lines. 
* R is case sensitive: &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; are two different objects.
* Traditionally underscores &quot;&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;&quot; are not used in names. It is often better to use dots &quot;&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. One should avoid using an underscore as the first character of an object name.

== How you can help ==

Here are some things editors do to keep this book internally consistent.
If you have something to contribute, go ahead and make your contribution.
Other editors can touch up your edits afterwards so that they conform to the guidelines.

The local manual of style [[WB:LMOS]] for the R programming book, including a brief explanation of why we do it that way, is:

* Examples use &quot;source&quot; tags : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; a &lt;- 1:10 ; mean(a) &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;. That makes them look pretty to our readers.
* The name of packages are in bold  : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Hmisc'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
* Name of functions are in &quot;code&quot; tags: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
* Page titles -- the part after &quot;R Programming/&quot; -- are in sentence case, like &quot;[[R Programming/Working with data frames]]&quot;. We couldn't decide between sentence case and title case, so I flipped a coin.
* Every page has &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt; at the top and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{R Programming/Navbar|Mathematics|Probability Distributions}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt; at the bottom. That makes it easier to navigate from one page to another online.

{{anchor|prop}}The point at issue in an argument is the
'''proposition'''.
{{anchor|thm}}Mathematicians usually write the point in full before the proof
and label it either '''Theorem''' for major points, '''Corollary'''
for points that follow immediately from a prior one, or '''Lemma'''
for results chiefly used to prove other results. 

The statements expressing propositions can be complex, with many subparts.
The truth or falsity of the entire proposition depends both on the
truth value of the parts, and on the words used to
assemble the statement from its parts.

===Not===
For example, where &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is a proposition,
&quot;it is not the case that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true provided that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is
false.
Thus, &quot;&lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is not prime&quot; is true only when &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is the
product of smaller integers.

{{anchor|Venn}}We can picture the &quot;not&quot; operation with a
'''Venn diagram'''.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_not.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
Where the box encloses all natural numbers, and inside the circle are
the primes, the shaded area holds numbers satisfying &quot;not &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

To prove that a &quot;not &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;&quot; statement holds, show that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is false.

===And===
Consider the statement form &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.
For the statement to be true both halves must hold:
&quot;&lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime and so is &lt;math&gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true, while
&quot;&lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime and &lt;math&gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt; is not&quot; is false.

Here is the Venn diagram for &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_and.png|x200px]]

&lt;/center&gt;

To prove &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, prove that each half holds.

===Or===
A &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true when either half holds:
&quot;&lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime or &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is prime&quot; is true, while &quot;&lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is not prime
or &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is prime&quot; is false.
We take &quot;or&quot; inclusively so that if both halves are true
&quot;&lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime or &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is not&quot; then the statement as a whole is true.
(In everyday speech, sometimes &quot;or&quot; is meant in an exclusive way&amp;mdash; &quot;Eat
your vegetables or no dessert&quot; does not intend both halves to hold&amp;mdash; but
we will not use &quot;or&quot; in that way.)

The Venn diagram for &quot;or&quot; includes all of both circles.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_and.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

To prove &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, show that in all cases at least one
half holds (perhaps sometimes one half and sometimes the other,
but always at least one).

===If-then===
{{anchor|implication}}An &quot;if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; statement (sometimes written
&quot;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; materially implies &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot; or just
&quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;math&gt; P\implies Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot;) is true unless &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;
is true while &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is false.
Thus &quot;if &lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime then &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is not&quot; is true
while &quot;if &lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime then &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is also prime&quot; is false.
(Contrary to its
use in casual speech, in mathematics &quot;if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;
does not connote that
&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; precedes &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; or causes &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;.)

{{anchor|vacuous}}More subtly, in mathematics &quot;if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is
true when &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is false:
&quot;if &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is prime then &lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is prime&quot; and
&quot;if &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt; is prime then &lt;math&gt; 7 &lt;/math&gt; is not&quot; are both true statements,
sometimes said to be '''vacuously true'''.
We adopt this convention because we want statements like &quot;if
a number is a perfect square then it is not prime&quot; to be true, for
instance when the number is &lt;math&gt; 5 &lt;/math&gt; or when the number is &lt;math&gt; 6 &lt;/math&gt;.

The diagram
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_ifthen.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
shows that &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; holds whenever &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; does (another phrasing is
&quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is sufficient to give &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;).
Notice again that if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; does not hold, &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; may or may not
be in force.

There are two main ways to establish an implication.
The first way is direct: assume that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is true and, using that
assumption, prove &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;.
For instance,
to show &quot;if a number is divisible by 5 then twice that
number is divisible by 10&quot;, assume that the number is &lt;math&gt; 5n &lt;/math&gt; and
deduce that &lt;math&gt; 2(5n)=10n &lt;/math&gt;.
{{anchor|contrapositive}}The second way is indirect: prove the
'''contrapositive'''
statement: &quot;if &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is false then &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is false&quot;
(rephrased, &quot;&lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; can only be false when &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is also false&quot;).
As an example, to show &quot;if a number is prime then it
is not a perfect
square&quot;, argue that if it were a square &lt;math&gt; p=n^2 &lt;/math&gt; then it could be
factored &lt;math&gt; p=n\cdot n &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; n&lt;p &lt;/math&gt; and so wouldn't be prime
(of course &lt;math&gt; p=0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; p=1 &lt;/math&gt; don't give &lt;math&gt; n&lt;p &lt;/math&gt; but they
are nonprime by definition).

Note two things about this statement form.

First, an &quot;if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; result can sometimes be improved
by weakening &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; or strengthening &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &quot;if a number is divisible by &lt;math&gt; p^2 &lt;/math&gt; then its square is also
divisible by &lt;math&gt; p^2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; could be upgraded either by relaxing its
hypothesis: &quot;if a number is divisible by &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; then its square
is divisible by &lt;math&gt; p^2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, or by tightening its conclusion:  &quot;if
a number is divisible by &lt;math&gt; p^2 &lt;/math&gt; then its square is divisible by
&lt;math&gt; p^4 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

Second,
after showing &quot;if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, a good next step is to look into
whether there are cases where &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; holds but &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; does not.
The idea is to better understand the relationship between &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;, with an eye toward strengthening the proposition.

===Equivalence===
An if-then statement
cannot be improved when not only does &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;, but
also &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;.
Some ways to say this are:
&quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; if and only if
&lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; are logically
equivalent&quot;, &quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is necessary and sufficient to give &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;,
&quot;&lt;math&gt; P\iff Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.
For example, &quot;a number is divisible by a prime if and only if that number
squared is divisible by the prime squared&quot;.

The picture here shows that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; hold in exactly the
same cases.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_equiv.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
Although in simple arguments a chain like
&quot;&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; ...&quot;
may be practical, typically we show equivalence by showing the
&quot;if &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;if &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;&quot; halves separately.

Compare these two statements about natural numbers:
&quot;there is an &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is
divisible by &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true, while
&quot;for all numbers &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is false.
{{anchor|quant}}We call the &quot;there is&quot; and &quot;for all&quot; prefixes '''quantifiers'''.

===For all===
The &quot;for all&quot; prefix is the '''universal quantifier''',
symbolized &lt;math&gt; \forall &lt;/math&gt;.

Venn diagrams aren't very helpful with quantifiers, but in a sense the
box we draw to border the diagram shows the universal quantifier since
it dilineates the universe of possible members.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_forall.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

To prove that a statement holds in all cases,
we must show that it holds in each case.
Thus, to prove &quot;every number divisible by &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; has its
square divisible by &lt;math&gt; p^2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, take a single number of the form
&lt;math&gt; pn &lt;/math&gt; and square it &lt;math&gt; (pn)^2=p^2n^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
This is a &quot;typical element&quot; or &quot;generic element&quot; proof.

This kind of argument requires that we are careful to not assume
properties for that element
other than those in the hypothesis&amp;mdash; for instance,
this type of wrong argument is a common mistake:
&quot;if &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is divisible by a prime, say &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; n=2k &lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt; n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2 &lt;/math&gt; and the square of the number is divisible
by the square of the prime&quot;.
That is an argument about the case &lt;math&gt; p=2 &lt;/math&gt;, but it isn't a proof for
general &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;.

===There exists===
We will also use the
'''existential quantifier''', symbolized
&lt;math&gt; \exists &lt;/math&gt; and read &quot;there exists&quot;.

As noted above, Venn diagrams are not much help with quantifiers, but a picture
of &quot;there is a number such that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;&quot; would show both that there can be
more than one and that not all numbers need satisfy &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_thereexists.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

An existence proposition can be proved by producing something satisfying
the property: once, to settle the question of primality of
&lt;math&gt; 2^{2^5}+1 &lt;/math&gt;, Euler produced its divisor &lt;math&gt; 641 &lt;/math&gt;.
But there are proofs
showing that something exists without saying how to find it;
Euclid's argument given in the next subsection
shows there are infinitely many primes without naming them.
In general, while demonstrating existence is better than nothing,
giving an example is better, and an
exhaustive list of all instances is great.
Still, mathematicians take what they can get.

Finally,
along with &quot;Are there any?&quot; we often ask &quot;How many?&quot;
That is why the issue of uniqueness often arises in conjunction
with questions of existence.
Many times the two arguments are simpler if separated, so note that just as
proving something exists does not show it is unique,
neither does proving something is unique show that it exists.
(Obviously &quot;the natural number with more factors than any other&quot;
would be unique, but in fact no such number exists.)

|current=Techniques of Proof
|previous=Quantifiers
|next=Sets, Functions, Relations}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Induction===
Many proofs are iterative,
&quot;Here's why the statement is true for for the case of the number &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;,
it then follows for &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;, and from there to &lt;math&gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;, and so on ...&quot;.
These are called proofs by '''induction'''.
Such a proof has two steps.
{{anchor|base step}}In the '''base step'''
the proposition is established for some first
number, often &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
{{anchor|inductive step}}Then in the '''inductive step'''
we assume that the proposition
holds for numbers up to some &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;
and deduce that it then holds for the next number &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;.

Here is an example.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We will prove that &lt;math&gt; 1+2+3+\dots+n=n(n+1)/2 &lt;/math&gt;.

For the base step we must show that the formula holds when &lt;math&gt; n=1 &lt;/math&gt;.
That's easy, the sum of the first &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; number does indeed equal
&lt;math&gt; 1(1+1)/2 &lt;/math&gt;.

For the inductive step, assume that the formula holds
for the numbers &lt;math&gt; 1,2,\ldots,k &lt;/math&gt;.
That is, assume all of these instances of the formula.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
1o
&amp;=1(1+1)/2  \\
\text{and}\quad 1+2
&amp;=2(2+1)/2  \\
\text{and}\quad  1+2+3
&amp;=3(3+1)/2  \\
&amp;\vdots    \\
\text{and}\quad 1+\dots+k
&amp;=k(k+1)/2
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

From this assumption we will deduce that
the formula therefore also holds in the &lt;math&gt; k+1 &lt;/math&gt; next case.
The deduction is  straightforward algebra.

:&lt;math&gt;
1+2+\cdots+k+(k+1)
=
\frac{k(k+1)}{2}+(k+1)
=
\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We've shown in the base case that the above proposition holds for &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
We've shown in the inductive step
that if it holds for the case of &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; then it also holds for &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;;
therefore it does hold for &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.
We've also shown in the inductive step that
if the statement holds for the cases of &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;
then it also holds for the next case &lt;math&gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;, etc.
Thus it holds for any natural number greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Here is another example.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We will prove that every integer greater than &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; is a product
of primes.

The base step is easy: &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; is the product of a single prime.

For the inductive step assume that each of &lt;math&gt; 2, 3,\ldots ,k &lt;/math&gt; is a
product of primes, aiming to show &lt;math&gt; k+1 &lt;/math&gt; is also a product of
primes.
There are two possibilities:
(i) if &lt;math&gt; k+1 &lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by a number smaller than itself then it
is a prime and so is the product of primes,
and (ii) if &lt;math&gt; k+1 &lt;/math&gt; is divisible then its
factors can be written as a product of primes (by the inductive hypothesis)
and so &lt;math&gt; k+1 &lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as a product of primes.
That ends the proof.

(''Remark.''
The Prime Factorization Theorem of Number Theory says that
not only does a factorization exist, but that it is unique.
We've shown the easy half.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two things to note about the &quot;next number&quot; in an induction
argument.

For one thing, while induction works on the integers, it's no good on the
reals.
There is no &quot;next&quot; real.

The other thing is that we sometimes use induction to go down, say, from
&lt;math&gt; 10 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; 9 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; 8 &lt;/math&gt;, etc., down to &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
So &quot;next number&quot; could mean &quot;next lowest number&quot;.
Of course, at the end we have not shown the fact for all natural numbers, only
for those less than or equal to &lt;math&gt; 10 &lt;/math&gt;.

===Contradiction===
Another technique of proof is
to show something is true by showing it can't be false.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The classic example is Euclid's, that there are
infinitely many primes.

Suppose there are only finitely many primes &lt;math&gt; p_1,\dots,p_k &lt;/math&gt;.
Consider &lt;math&gt; p_1\cdot p_2\dots p_k +1 &lt;/math&gt;.
None of the primes on this supposedly exhaustive list divides that number
evenly, each leaves a remainder of &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
But every number is a product of primes so this can't be.
Thus there cannot be only finitely many primes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every proof by contradiction has the same form: '''assume''' that '''the false''' proposition '''is'''
'''true''' and '''derive''' some '''contradiction''' to known facts.
This kind of logic is known as Aristotelian Logic, or Term Logic

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another example is this proof that
&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; is not a rational number.

Suppose that  &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2}=m/n &lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
2n^2=m^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Factor out the &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;'s:
&lt;math&gt; n=2^{k_n}\cdot \hat{n} &lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt; m=2^{k_m}\cdot \hat{m} &lt;/math&gt;
and rewrite.

:&lt;math&gt;
2\cdot (2^{k_n}\cdot \hat{n})^2
=
(2^{k_m}\cdot \hat{m})^2
&lt;/math&gt;

The Prime Factorization Theorem says that there must be the same number of
factors of &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; on both sides, but there are an odd number
&lt;math&gt; 1+2k_n &lt;/math&gt; on the left and an even number &lt;math&gt; 2k_m &lt;/math&gt; on the right.
That's a contradiction, so a rational with a square of
&lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; cannot be.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both of these examples aimed to prove something doesn't exist.
A negative proposition often suggests a proof by contradiction.

{{navigation|Book=Linear Algebra
|current=Sets, Functions, Relations
|previous=Techniques of Proof
|next=Licensing And History}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Sets===
Mathematicians work with collections called '''sets'''.
A set can be given as a listing between curly braces as in
&lt;math&gt; \{ 1,4,9,16 \} &lt;/math&gt;, or, if that's
unwieldy, by using set-builder notation as in
&lt;math&gt; \{x\,\big|\, x^5-3x^3+2=0 \} &lt;/math&gt; (read &quot;the set of all &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;
such that \ldots&quot;).
We name sets with capital roman letters as with the primes
&lt;math&gt; P=\{2,3,5,7,11,\ldots\,\} &lt;/math&gt;, except for a few special sets such as the
real numbers &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;,
and the complex numbers &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;.
{{anchor|element}}To denote that something is an '''element''' (or '''member''') of a set we
use &quot;&lt;math&gt; {}\in {} &lt;/math&gt;&quot;,
so that &lt;math&gt; 7\in\{3,5,7\} &lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt; 8\not\in\{3,5,7\} &lt;/math&gt;.

What distinguishes a set from any other type of collection is
the Principle of Extensionality, that two sets with the same elements
are equal.
Because of this principle,
in a set repeats collapse &lt;math&gt; \{7,7\}=\{7\} &lt;/math&gt; and order doesn't
matter &lt;math&gt; \{2,\pi\}=\{\pi,2\} &lt;/math&gt;.

{{anchor|subset}}We use &quot;&lt;math&gt; \subset &lt;/math&gt;&quot; for the subset
relationship: &lt;math&gt; \{2,\pi\}\subset\{2,\pi,7\} &lt;/math&gt;
and &quot;&lt;math&gt; \subseteq &lt;/math&gt;&quot; for subset or equality
(if &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; A\neq
B &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a '''proper subset'''
of &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;).
These symbols may be flipped, for instance
&lt;math&gt; \{ 2,\pi,5\}\supset\{2,5\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Because of Extensionality, to prove that two sets are equal &lt;math&gt; A=B &lt;/math&gt;,
just show that they have the same members.
{{anchor|mutual inclusion}}Usually we show mutual inclusion,
that both &lt;math&gt; A\subseteq B &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A\supseteq B &lt;/math&gt;.

===Set operations===
Venn diagrams are handy here.
For instance, &lt;math&gt; x\in P &lt;/math&gt; can be pictured
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_xinP.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
and &quot;&lt;math&gt; P\subseteq Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; looks like this.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_ifthen.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

Note that this is a repeat of the diagram for &quot;if \ldots then ...&quot;
propositions.
That's because &quot;&lt;math&gt; P\subseteq Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot; means
&quot;if &lt;math&gt; x\in P &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; x\in Q &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

In general, for every propositional logic operator there is an associated set
operator.
{{anchor|complement}}For instance, the '''complement''' of &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt; P^{\text{comp}}=\{x\,\big|\, \text{not }(x\in P)\} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_not.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

the '''union''' is
&lt;math&gt; P\cup Q=\{x\,\big|\,(x\in P) \text{ or }(x\in Q)\} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_or.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

and the '''intersection''' is
&lt;math&gt; P\cap Q=\{x\,\big|\, (x\in P)\text{ and }(x\in Q)\}. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_venn_and.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

{{anchor|empty}}}}When two sets share no members their intersection
is the '''empty set''' &lt;math&gt; \{\} &lt;/math&gt;,
symbolized &lt;math&gt; \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;.
Any set has the empty set for a subset, by the &quot;vacuously true&quot;
property of the definition of implication.

===Sequences===
We shall also use collections where order does matter and where repeats do
not collapse.
These are '''sequences''', denoted with angle brackets:
&lt;math&gt; \langle  2,3,7 \rangle \neq\langle 2,7,3 \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;.
{{anchor|ordered pair}}A sequence of length &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called an
'''ordered pair''' and written with parentheses: &lt;math&gt; (\pi,3) &lt;/math&gt;.
We also sometimes say &quot;ordered triple&quot;, &quot;ordered &lt;math&gt; 4 &lt;/math&gt;-tuple&quot;, etc.
The set of ordered &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;-tuples of elements of a set &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is denoted
&lt;math&gt; A^n &lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the set of pairs of reals is &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

===Functions===
We first see functions in elementary Algebra, where they are
presented as formulas (e.g., &lt;math&gt; f(x)=16x^2-100 &lt;/math&gt;), but
progressing to more advanced Mathematics reveals more general
functions&amp;mdash; trigonometric ones,
exponential and
logarithmic ones, and even constructs like absolute value that involve
piecing together parts&amp;mdash; and we see that functions aren't
formulas, instead the key idea is that a function associates with its
input &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; a single output &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

{{anchor|function}}Consequently, a '''function''' or '''map''' is defined
to be a set of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt; (x,f(x)\,) &lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; suffices to determine &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, that is:
if &lt;math&gt; x_1=x_2 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; f(x_1)=f(x_2) &lt;/math&gt;
(this requirement is referred to by saying a
function is '''well-defined''').\footnote{More on this is in the section
on isomorphisms}

{{anchor|argument}}Each input &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is one of the function's
'''arguments''' and each output &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a '''value'''.
{{anchor|domain}}The set of all arguments is &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;'s
'''domain''' and the set of output values is its '''range'''.
{{anchor|codomain}}Usually we don't need know what is and is not in the range and we instead
work with a superset of the range, the '''codomain'''. The notation
for a function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; with domain &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; and
codomain &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; f:X\to Y &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_domain_range_codomain.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
{{anchor|image}}We sometimes instead use the notation &lt;math&gt;
x\stackrel{f}{\longmapsto} 16x^2-100 &lt;/math&gt;, read &quot;&lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;
maps under &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; 16x^2-100 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, or &quot;&lt;math&gt;
16x^2-100 &lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;''image''' of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;'. 

Some maps, like &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sin(1/x) &lt;/math&gt;, can be thought of as
combinations of simple maps, here, &lt;math&gt; g(y)=\sin(y) &lt;/math&gt; applied
to the image of &lt;math&gt; f(x)=1/x &lt;/math&gt;. {{anchor|composition}}The
'''composition''' of &lt;math&gt; g:Y\to Z &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, 
is the map sending &lt;math&gt; x\in X &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; g(\, f(x)\,)\in Z &lt;/math&gt;.
It is denoted &lt;math&gt; g\circ f:X\to Z &lt;/math&gt;.
This definition only makes sense if the range of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is a
subset of the domain of &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt;.

{{anchor|identity}}Observe that the '''identity map'''
&lt;math&gt; \mbox{id}:Y\to Y &lt;/math&gt; defined by
&lt;math&gt; \mbox{id}(y)=y &lt;/math&gt; has the property that for any &lt;math&gt; f:X\to Y &lt;/math&gt;,
the composition &lt;math&gt; \mbox{id}\circ f &lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;.
So an identity map plays the same role with respect to function composition
that the number &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; plays in real number addition, or that the number
&lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; plays in multiplication.

{{anchor|left inverse}}In line with that analogy, define a
'''left inverse''' of a map &lt;math&gt; f:X\to Y &lt;/math&gt; to be a
function &lt;math&gt; g:\text{range}(f)\to X &lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt; g\circ f &lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.
{{anchor|right inverse}}Of course, a '''right inverse''' of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is a
&lt;math&gt; h:Y\to X &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f\circ h &lt;/math&gt; is the identity.

{{anchor|inverse}}A map that is both a left and right inverse of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;
is called simply an '''inverse'''.
An inverse, if one exists, is unique because if both &lt;math&gt; g_1 &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; g_2 &lt;/math&gt; are inverses of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt; g_1(x)=g_1\circ  (f\circ g_2) (x)
= (g_1\circ f) \circ g_2(x)
=g_2(x) &lt;/math&gt;
(the middle equality comes from the associativity of function composition),
so we often call it &quot;the&quot; inverse, written &lt;math&gt; f^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, the inverse of the function &lt;math&gt; f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
given by &lt;math&gt; f(x)=2x-3 &lt;/math&gt; is the function &lt;math&gt; f^{-1}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
given by &lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(x)=(x+3)/2 &lt;/math&gt;.

The superscript &quot;&lt;math&gt; f^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;&quot; notation for function inverse can be
confusing&amp;mdash; it doesn't mean &lt;math&gt; 1/f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.
It is used because it fits into a larger scheme.
Functions that have the same codomain as domain can be iterated,
so that where &lt;math&gt;f:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;, we can consider
the composition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with itself: &lt;math&gt; f\circ f &lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt; f\circ f\circ f &lt;/math&gt;, etc.

Naturally enough, we
write &lt;math&gt;f\circ f&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; f^2 &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;f\circ f\circ f&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; f^3 &lt;/math&gt;, etc.
Note that the familiar exponent rules for real numbers obviously hold:
&lt;math&gt; f^i\circ f^j=f^{i+j} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (f^i)^j=f^{i\cdot j} &lt;/math&gt;.
The relationship with the prior paragraph is that, where &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is invertible,
writing &lt;math&gt; f^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; for the inverse
and &lt;math&gt; f^{-2} &lt;/math&gt; for the inverse of &lt;math&gt; f^2 &lt;/math&gt;, etc., gives that
these familiar exponent rules continue to hold, once
&lt;math&gt; f^0 &lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the identity map.

{{anchor|onto}}If the codomain &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; equals the range of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; then
we say that the function is '''onto''' (or '''surjective''').
A function has a right inverse if and only if it is onto
(this is not hard to check).
{{anchor|injective}}If no two arguments share an image, if
&lt;math&gt; x_1\neq x_2 &lt;/math&gt; implies  that &lt;math&gt; f(x_1)\neq f(x_2) &lt;/math&gt;, then the function is
'''one-to-one''' (or '''injective'''). A function has a left inverse if and only if it is
one-to-one (this is also not hard to check).

{{anchor|bijection}}By the prior paragraph, a map has an inverse if and only if it is both
onto and one-to-one; such a function is a
'''correspondence'''.
It associates one and only one element of the domain with each element of the
range (for example, finite sets must have the same number of elements to be
matched up in this way).
Because a composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, and a composition
of onto maps is onto, a composition of correspondences is a
correspondence.

We sometimes want to shrink the domain of a function.
For instance, we may take the function &lt;math&gt; f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; given by
&lt;math&gt; f(x)=x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and, in order to have an inverse, limit input arguments to
nonnegative reals &lt;math&gt; \hat{f}:\mathbb{R}^+\to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;.
{{anchor|restriction}}Technically, &lt;math&gt; \hat{f} &lt;/math&gt; is a different function than &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;; we call it
the '''restriction''' of
&lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; to the smaller domain.

A final point on functions: neither &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; need be a number.
As an example, we can think of &lt;math&gt; f(x,y)=x+y &lt;/math&gt; as a function that
takes the ordered pair &lt;math&gt; (x,y) &lt;/math&gt; as its argument.

===Relations===
Some familiar operations are obviously functions:
addition maps &lt;math&gt; (5,3) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; 8 &lt;/math&gt;.
But what of &quot;&lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt;&quot;?
We here take the approach of rephrasing &quot;&lt;math&gt; 3&lt;5 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; to &quot;&lt;math&gt; (3,5) &lt;/math&gt; is
in the relation &lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.
{{anchor|binary}}That is, define a '''binary relation''' on a set &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; to be
a set of ordered pairs of elements of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
For example, the &lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt; relation is the set
&lt;math&gt;  \{(a,b)\,\big|\, a&lt;b\} &lt;/math&gt;; some elements of that set are
&lt;math&gt; (3,5) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; (3,7) &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; (1,100) &lt;/math&gt;.

Another binary relation on the natural numbers is equality; this relation is
formally written as the set
&lt;math&gt; \{\ldots,(-1,-1),(0,0),(1,1),\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Still another example is &quot;closer than &lt;math&gt; 10 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, the set
&lt;math&gt; \{(x,y)\,\big|\, |x-y|&lt;10 \} &lt;/math&gt;.
Some members of that relation are &lt;math&gt; (1,10) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; (10,1) &lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt; (42,44) &lt;/math&gt;.
Neither &lt;math&gt; (11,1) &lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt; (1,11) &lt;/math&gt; is a member.

Those examples illustrate the generality of the definition.
All kinds of relationships (e.g., &quot;both numbers
even&quot; or &quot;first number is the second with the digits reversed&quot;)
are covered under the definition.

===Equivalence Relations===
We shall need to say, formally, that two objects are alike in some way.
While these alike things aren't identical, they are related
(e.g., two integers that &quot;give the same remainder when divided by &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;).

A binary relation &lt;math&gt; \{(a,b),\ldots \} &lt;/math&gt;
is an '''equivalence relation'''when it satisfies
&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; {{anchor|reflexivity}}'''reflexivity''': any object is related to itself;
&lt;li&gt; {{anchor|symmetry}}'''symmetry''': if &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;;
&lt;li&gt; {{anchor|transitivity}}'''transitivity''':
if &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is
related to &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/ol&gt;
(To see that these conditions formalize being the same, read them again,
replacing &quot;is related to&quot; with &quot;is like&quot;.)

Some examples (on the integers): &quot;&lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt;&quot; is an equivalence relation,
&quot;&lt;math&gt; &lt; &lt;/math&gt;&quot; does not satisfy symmetry,
&quot;same sign&quot; is a equivalence, while &quot;nearer than &lt;math&gt; 10 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; fails transitivity.

===Partitions===
In &quot;same sign&quot; &lt;math&gt; \{ (1,3),(-5,-7),(-1,-1),\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;
there are two kinds of pairs, the first with both numbers positive
and the second with both negative.
So integers fall into exactly one of two classes, positive or negative.

A '''partition''' of a set &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is a collection of subsets
&lt;math&gt; \{S_1,S_2,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt; such that
every element of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is in one and only one &lt;math&gt; S_i &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt; S_1\cup S_2\cup \ldots{} = S &lt;/math&gt;, and
if &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt; S_i\cap S_j=\varnothing &lt;/math&gt;.
Picture &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; being decomposed into distinct parts.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_partition.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, the first paragraph says &quot;same sign&quot; partitions
the integers into the positives and the negatives.

Similarly, the equivalence relation &quot;=&quot; partitions the integers into
one-element sets.

Another example is the fractions.
Of course, &lt;math&gt;2/3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4/6&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent fractions.
That is, for the set
&lt;math&gt;S=\{n/d\,\big|\, n,d\in\mathbb{Z}\text{ and }d\neq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;,
we define two elements &lt;math&gt;n_1/d_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2/d_2&lt;/math&gt;
to be equivalent if &lt;math&gt;n_1d_2=n_2d_1&lt;/math&gt;.
We can check that this is an equivalence relation, that is, that
it satisfies the above three conditions.
With that, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is divided up into parts.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_partition_2.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

Before we show that equivalence relations always give rise to
partitions, we first illustrate the argument.
Consider the relationship between two integers of &quot;same parity&quot;,
the set &lt;math&gt; \{ (-1,3),(2,4),(0,0),\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., &quot;give the same remainder when divided by &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;&quot;).
We want to say that the natural numbers split into two pieces,
the evens and the odds, and inside a piece each member has the same
parity as each other.
So for each &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; we define the set of numbers associated with
it: &lt;math&gt; S_x=\{y\,\big|\, (x,y)\in\text{same parity}\} &lt;/math&gt;.
Some examples are
&lt;math&gt; S_1=\{\ldots,-3,-1,1,3,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt; S_4=\{\ldots,-2,0,2,4,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt; S_{-1}=\{\ldots,-3,-1,1,3,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;.
These are the parts, e.g., &lt;math&gt; S_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the odds.



{{anchor|equiv partitions}}}}&lt;b&gt;Theorem&lt;/b&gt;
An equivalence relation induces a partition on the underlying set.

{{TextBox|1=
;Proof:
Call the set &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; and the relation &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;.
In line with the illustration in the paragraph above,
for each &lt;math&gt; x\in S &lt;/math&gt; define &lt;math&gt; S_x=\{y\,\big|\, (x,y)\in R\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Observe that, as &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a member if &lt;math&gt; S_x &lt;/math&gt;,
the union of all these sets is &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.
So we will be done if we show that distinct parts are disjoint:
if &lt;math&gt; S_x\neq S_y &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; S_x\cap S_y=\varnothing &lt;/math&gt;.
We will verify this through the contrapositive, that is,
we wlll assume that &lt;math&gt; S_x\cap S_y\neq\varnothing &lt;/math&gt; in order to
deduce that &lt;math&gt; S_x=S_y &lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; be an element of the intersection.
Then by definition of &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y&lt;/math&gt;, the two
&lt;math&gt; (x,p) &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; (y,p) &lt;/math&gt; are members of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and by symmetry of this relation
&lt;math&gt; (p,x) &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; (p,y) &lt;/math&gt; are also members of &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;.
To show that &lt;math&gt; S_x=S_y &lt;/math&gt; we will show each is a subset of the other.

Assume that &lt;math&gt; q\in S_x &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt; (q,x)\in R &lt;/math&gt;.
Use transitivity along with
&lt;math&gt; (x,p)\in R &lt;/math&gt; to conclude that &lt;math&gt; (q,p) &lt;/math&gt; is also an element of &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;.
But &lt;math&gt; (p,y)\in R &lt;/math&gt; so another use of transitivity gives that
&lt;math&gt; (q,y)\in  R &lt;/math&gt;.
Thus &lt;math&gt; q\in S_y &lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore &lt;math&gt; q\in S_x &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; q\in S_y &lt;/math&gt;,
and so &lt;math&gt; S_x\subseteq S_y &lt;/math&gt;.

The same argument in the other direction gives the other inclusion, and
so the two sets are equal, completing the contrapositive argument.
}}

{{anchor|equiv classes}}}}We call each part of a partition an '''equivalence class'''
(or informally, &quot;part&quot;).

{{anchor|representitive}}We somtimes pick a single element of each equivalence class to be the
'''class representative'''.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_partition_3.png|x200px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
Usually when we pick representatives we have some natural scheme in mind.
{{anchor|natural}}In that case we call them the '''canonical''' representatives.

An example is the simplest form of a fraction.
We've defined &lt;math&gt; 3/5 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 9/15 &lt;/math&gt; to be equivalent fractions.
In everyday work we often use the &quot;simplest form&quot; or &quot;reduced form&quot;
fraction as the class representatives.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
==Harvard citation templates==
The  templates for using Harvard citations are:
*{{tlx|Harvard citation}} or {{tlx|harv}} for a basic Harvard citation
*{{tlx|Harvard citation no brackets}} or {{tlx|harvnb}} for a Harvard citation with no brackets
*{{tlx|Harvard citation text}} or {{tlx|harvtxt}} for a Harvard citation with the name outside the brackets
*{{tlx|Harvard citations}} or {{tlx|harvs}} for multiple Harvard citations and other more complicated features. 
*{{tlx|citation}}  for formatting the reference.

This page describes the first 3; for the others see their documentation pages. 
==Usage==

: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Harvard citation |''Last name of author(s)''|''Year''| loc = ''Location in the text''}}&lt;/tt&gt;

Instead of using the optional loc parameter, you may also use one of the following parameters:

*&lt;tt&gt;p = ''page''&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;pp = ''pages''&lt;/tt&gt;

; Notes
*The abbreviation ''Harv'' may be used.
*The first parameter is the author's last name.
*Up to four authors can be given as parameters (see the examples). If there are more than 4 authors only the first 4 should be listed; listing more will cause odd things to happen.
*The next parameter is the year of publication.
*The year and author name(s) must not have extra space before and after, else the generated links will not work. (BUG)
*The &quot;loc = &quot; parameter is the location of the cited material within the reference. This parameter is optional.
*The parameter ''p'' is an optional page parameter; thus &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2006| p=25}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; yields &quot;{{Harv|Smith|2006|p=25}}&quot;.
*The parameter ''pp'' is an optional page range parameter; thus &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2006| pp=25&amp;amp;ndash;26}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; yields &quot;{{Harv|Smith|2006|pp=25–26}}&quot;.
*If ''Ref''=''none'', then no hyperlink is created.
*To avoid the brackets surrounding the citation, use {{tlx|Harvard citation no brackets}} or {{tlx|Harvnb}}.
*To use the author name(s) in the text, use {{tlx|Harvard citation text}} or {{tlx|Harvtxt}}.
*For more complicated Harvard citations with multiple links use {{tlx|Harvard citations}} or its abbreviation {{tlx|harvs}}.
*For authors who have published more than one work in the same year, the standard way to differentiate such works is to put a lowercase letter after the year (e.g. year=2006a and year=2006b).

Editors editing this template are requested to make parallel changes to the other versions.

==Recommended style==
The recommended Harvard referencing style potentially uses all four templates. Each automatically generates a hypertext link based on the name(s) and date. Here is an example
:;Markup
:: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Some works on gravitation are so massive they warp spacetime themselves {{Harv|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}; yet {{Harvtxt|Einstein|1915}} presented essential equations with notable brevity. The essential ingredients are the curvature tensor and the stress-energy tensor ({{Harvnb|Einstein|1915|loc=p.&amp;amp;nbsp;844}}; {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=p.&amp;amp;nbsp;41}}).&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
:;Result
:: Some works on gravitation are so massive they warp spacetime themselves {{Harv|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}; yet {{Harvtxt|Einstein|1915}} presented essential equations with notable brevity. The two ingredients are the curvature tensor and the stress-energy tensor ({{Harvnb|Einstein|1915|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;844}}; {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;41}}).
In short:
# For a single work with no author in the text (the most common case), use {{tlx|Harv}}.
# For a single work with the author named in the text, use {{tlx|Harvtxt}}.
# For multiple works at the same point, use explicit parentheses and {{tlx|Harvnb}} separated by semicolons.
# For anything more complicated use {{tlx|Harvs}}.

==&lt;nowiki&gt;#CITEREF&lt;/nowiki&gt;==

More exotic Harvard citations can be constructed using the {{tlx|harvs}} template. If even this is not enough, then as a last resort one can use &lt;nowiki&gt;#CITEREF&lt;/nowiki&gt; as in the following example:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Property (T)|]] was introduced by [[w:David Kazhdan|]] ([[w:Property T#CITEREFKazhdan1967|1967]]).&lt;/nowiki&gt;
which produces
:[[w:Property (T)|Property]] was introduced by [[w:David Kazhdan|David Kazhdan]] ([[w:Property T #CITEREFKazhdan1967|1967]])
with a link to the author, and a link to a citation on a different page.
&lt;nowiki&gt;#CITEREF&lt;/nowiki&gt; should be followed by the last names of up to 4 authors and the year (with no spaces),
and if the link is to a different page it should be preceded by the name of the page (with spaces allowed). The [[Template:Citation|citation template]] marks the reference using &lt;nowiki&gt;#CITEREF&lt;/nowiki&gt;; see the source of
[[Template:Citation/core]] for details.

==Use with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Citation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;==
The {{tlx|Citation}} template can be used to format the citations in the ''References'' section. 
Links from the Harvard citation to the Citation are provided using a &lt;code&gt;#CITEREF&lt;/code&gt; link. The {{tlx|Harvard citation}} template creates a link &lt;code&gt;#CITEREF&lt;/code&gt; followed by the concatenation of the author names and the year. {{tlx|Citation}} creates an [[w:HTML element#Links and anchors|anchor]] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;CITEREF&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; followed by the concatenation of the following parameters:
*'''last''' or '''last1''' or '''surname''' or '''surname1''' or '''author''' or '''author1''' or '''authors''',
*'''last2''' or '''surname2''' or '''author2''',
*'''last3''' or '''surname3''' or '''author3''',
*'''last4''' or '''surname4''' or '''author4''',
*'''editor-last''' or '''editor-surname''' or '''editor1-last''' or '''editor1-surname''' or '''editor''' or '''editors''',
*'''editor2-last''' or '''editor2-surname''',
*'''editor3-last''' or '''editor3-surname''',
*'''editor4-last''' or '''editor4-surname''',
*'''year''' or '''date'''.

For example &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2006| p=25}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; produces a link &lt;code&gt;#CITEREFSmith2006&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Citation|last=Smith|first=John|year=2006|title=My Life}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
produces an anchor &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;CITEREFSmith2006&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cell Anatomy==
Cells differ tremendously in morphology, but the following illustration shows the main features of a typical mammalian cell:


[[Image:Cell structure.png|||432px|Cell Structure]]

The following table summarizes the various parts and their functions. We will then look at the various parts in more detail.

&lt;table cellpadding='10' border='1'&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Structure&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Characteristics&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Microvilli (not shown)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Extensive folding of the cell membrane found in certain cells with an absorptive capacity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Increase surface area for absorption.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cell Membrane&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double layer of Phospholipid molecules studded with Proteins&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Acts as barrier to cell. Proteins serve many functions including transportation of ions and other molecules.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Centrioles&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bundles of microtubules&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Important in Cell Division&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lyosomes, peroxyosomes, secretory vesicles&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Vesicles with Bilayer Phospholipid membrane&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lyosomes contain digestive enzymes; Peroxyiosomes contain enzymes essential for cell function; Secretory vesicles store enzymes etc. for secretion to exterior of cell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double walled organule with a central matrix&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Produces most of the cells ATP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ribosomes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Specialized protein that translates mRNA into polypeptides&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Protein Synthesis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rough and Smooth Endoplastic Reticulum&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bi-phospholipid membrane continuous with nuclear membrane, and studded with ribosomes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rough ER modifies proteins; smooth ER synthesizes fatty acids, steroids and lipids&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;



&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Golgi Apparatus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Modifies and packages proteins, especially those for excretion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Microtubules and Microfillaments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Protein fibers (actin) and protein tubules.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Cell skeleton. Also important in transport of substances within cell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nucleus and Nucleolus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two layer outer membrane with numerous pores, encloses cells DNA.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Directs all functions of Cell. Nucleolus is a collection of proteins and RNA stored for ribosome production.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt; 
===Cell Membrane===
The cell membrane is compose of almost entirely proteins and lipids. It is about '''55% protein''' by weight, '''25% phospholipids''' and '''17% cholesterol''' and other '''lipids''', and '''3% carbohydrate'''. Phospholipids have a '''phophate hydrophillic''' end, and a '''fatty acid hydrophobic end'''. 

              |G|
              |L|
              |Y|---Fatty Acid
 Phosphate----|C|
              |E|
              |R|---Fatty Acid
              |O|
              |L|
 Hydrophilic        Hydrophobic

The hydrophopic parts oppose one another, and the hydrophillic parts are exposed to the intra- and the extracellular fluid. The membrane itself is water insolouble and is only permeable to fat soluble substances. However numerous channels allow passage of water and other substances into the cell. 

[[File:Cell membrane3.png]]

The proteins are anatomically classified into '''integral''' and '''peripheral''' proteins.
Difference between integral &amp; peripheral proteins:
Integral proteins penetrate the membrane, and peripheral proteins are just attached to one side. Integral proteins can act as channels or pores and others act as carriers and transporters of various substances. Peripheral proteins serve a number of functions, and in many cases serve to activate the integral proteins. Some of the proteins are enzymes, others serve as '''second messengers'''. This will be looked at in some detail in the chapter on membrane dynamics. 

Cholesterol is found in varying amounts in the membrane. It tends to be found between the triglyceride 'stalks' of the phospholipids, and serves to make the membrane less porous.

Most proteins and many lipids are '''glycoprotins''' or '''glycolipids''', and the -ve carbohydrate end of the molecule is presented to the extracellular fluid. This carbohydrate layer is sreferred to as the '''Glycocalyx''' of the cell. These carbohydrates serve several important functions&quot;
*Many have a negative electrical charge which repels other negatively charged ions.
*They serve to attach cells to one another, and to the basement membrane
*Many act as receptor sites for hormones such as Insulin
*They enter into immune reactions

====Cell Membrane Proteins====
Cell membrane proteins may be functionally classified into four groups:
*'''Structural Proteins''': On the interior of the cell these serve as anchors for the actin and tubulin microfibrils. (''see below''). On the exterior they serve to bind cells together into tissues (see  ''Cell Junctions and Tissues'')
*'''Enzymes''': In the small intestine, many of the digestive enzymes are embedded in the cell wall.  ''(see Digestion'')
*'''Receptors''': These act as receptors for the messenger system of the cell. For example Insulin exerts its effects on the cell by binding onto a special receptor (see ''Membrane Dynamics'').
*'''Transporters''': these serve to transport molecules in and out of the cell. They may be either channels, or carriers. This is discussed further in ''Membrane Dynamics''.

===Cell Cytoplasm===
The cytoplasm is filled with dispersed particles and organules. The liquid portion of the cytoplasm is called cytosol, and contains dissolved ions, proteins and glucose. Also found are neutral fat globules and glycogen.

It also contains the important organules: '''endoplasmic reticulum''' and '''ribosomes'''; '''golgi apparatus'''; '''lysosomes'''; '''proxiosomes'''; and '''secretory granules'''.

===Ribosomes===
These are the sites of the manufacture of proteins from a mRNA template. They are complex structures made up of '''ribosomal RNA''' and proteins. The are composed of a large and a small subunit which 'clamp' onto the messanger RNA that they 'translate'. Most ribosomes can be found lining the endoplasmic reticulum, but the cytoplasm also contains many free ribosomes.

This will be discussed in further detail under the &quot;Protein Manufacture&quot; section.

===Endoplasmic reticulum===
This membranous sac is a complex series of tubules, continuous with the nuclear membrane. It is sub-classified as a rough, or granular ER, and a smooth or agranular ER. The rough Endoplasmic reticulum is lined with ribosomes and modifies and packages proteins that have been produced by the ribosome. In skeletal and cardiac muscle it is known as the '''sarcoplasmic reticulum'''. The smooth ER synthesize fatty substances and is the site of detoxification processes.

===Golgi apparatus===
The Golgi apparatus is a series of stacked membrane enclosed sacs, usually six or more.  It is a polarized structure with a '''cis''' and a '''trans''' side. The cis side faces the endoplasmic reticulum and the trans side the cell membrane. Its job is to process and package substances, both protein and non-protein, from the endoplasmic reticulum. The Golgi apparatus modifies the oligo-saccharide attachments of the glyco-proteins that have been initially prepared in the ER.

Membranous protein containing vesicles pinch off from the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported across to the cis Golgi apparatus. Substances are exchanged between one layer of the Golgi apparatus and another by a similar process. The vesicles that pinch off from the trans side shuttle to lyosomes or to the cell exterior. Those destined for the cell exterior are follow either '''consitutive''' or '''non-constitutive''' (also known as '''regulated''') pathways. Those following consitutive pathways are immediately secreted; those following a non-constitutive pathway either form an '''excretory vesicle''', or are shunted to an existing vesicle, where further processing may be carried out.

[[File:Golgi secretions.png]]

The destination of Golgi vesicles, indeed the destination of all vesicles is under the control of special proteins attached to the vesicle called '''SNARES''' (for '''S'''oluble '''N'''-ethylmalemite-sensitive factor '''A'''ttachment '''RE'''ceptors). These SNARES are either v-SNARES (for vesicle) or t-SNARES (for target), and they interact in a lock-and-key fashion. 35 different SNARE proteins have been identified in humans.

The process involved in protein synthesis is extremely complex, with plenty of places where errors can creep in. The quality control process starts with the DNA where damaged DNA is either repaired or bypassed; the mRNAs are checked during the translation process; and the ER and GA are particularly important in quality control, weeding out substandard or damaged proteins.

===Lyosomes===
Lyosomes are large somewhat irregular membrane surrounded structures found in the cytoplasm.The contents of the Lyosome are acidic in nature, and contain numerous enzymes for breaking down substrates. The act as the digestive system of the cell. The following enzymes are present in most lyosomes.

&lt;table cellpadding='10' border='1' rules='rows'&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyosomal Enzymes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Enzyme&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Substrate&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Deoxyribonucleases&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DNA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ribonucleases&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;RNA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Phosphatases&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Phosphates&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Glycosidases&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Carbohydrates, polysaccharides, andglycosides&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Arylsulfatases&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sulphate Esters&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Collagenase&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cathepsins&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

'''Clinical Note:''' If an enzyme is congenitally absent, then the lyosome will become engorged on the substrate particular to the missing enzyme. These result in the rare '''Lyosomal Storage Diseases'''. An example of a Lyosomal Storage Disease is '''Tay-Sachs'''. In Tay-Sachs disease an enzyme that breaks down '''gangliosides''', a lipoprotein found in neural tissue, is missing, and gangliosides accumulate in the cells of the brain resulting in mental retardation and blindness. About 1 in 30 American Jews carry the gene for Tay-Sachs.

===Peroxiosomes===
Peroxiosomes are membrane surrounded vesicles with a matrix that contains numerous enzymes which catalyse a variety of anabolic and catabolic reactions. The membrane of the peroxiosome have numerous protein carriers that are concerned with transport of substrates in and out of the matrix of the peroxiosome.

===Secretory Vesicles===
The Golgi apparatus will also package enzymes or hormones for later release. These are stored in the cell as secretory vesicles, awaiting a suitable trigger for release. These comprise a non-constitutive secretion, and in many cases the Golgi apparatus provides the vesicle with a '''pro-hormone''' or '''pro-enzyme''' that is further processed in the secretory vesicle.

&lt;br clear='all'&gt;

===Microfilaments and Microtubules===

Cells contain an extensive network of microtubules and microfilaments which act as both a '''cyto-skeleton''' and a means for transport of substances. 
====microfilaments====
Right under the cell membrane and attached to it is a framework of '''microfilaments''' made up of actin strands. Actin easily polymerizes and de-polymerizes into longer or shorter strands. It is a very common molecule and is usually found in a double stranded helical form.

[[File:Actin strand.png]]

Numerous proteins embedded in the cell wall which attach actin to the cell membrane have been identified.

====Microtubules====
'''Microtubles''' are made up of α-tubulin and β-tubulin molecules. These arrange themselves in strands, and usually 13 strands complete the tubule. Microtubules usually function for transport in cells. They are particullarly numerous in the long axons of nerve cells.

[[File:Microtubules.png|300px]]

====Molecular Motors====
'''Mollecular motors''' move 'cargo' around within cells. They are ATPases. They attach their cargo to their 'tail', and their 'head' will 'walk' down the actin strand or the microtubule. The ATPase that walks on Actin is from the '''myosin''' group, and those that walk down microtubules is from the '''kinesin''' group. Muscle is a special, highly developed example of actin-myosin molecular motors.

The following illustration shows a myosin molecule, with cargo attached walking down an actin strand. Power is supplied by converting ATP to ADP.
[[File:Actin kinesin walking.png]]
====cilia====
A highly specialized example of a molecular motor is the cilia which is found in the repiratory system, where it wafts mucous to the exterior, and in the fallopian tubes, where they waft along the ova to the uterus. The cilia is anchored in the cell membrane and sends its finger like projection upwards. Thes contain nine paired microtubules, with a central pair as shown in the accompanying electron microscope image. They beat backwards and forwards. The 'efficient' stroke is made with a stiff flagellum, the inefficient stroke with a relaxed flagellum.

===Nucleus===
The Nucleus of the cell directs all the activities of the cell. It contains the cells DNA made up into various genes, and is the site of manufacture of mRNA. We will look at all this in further detail when we look at: 
*Gene Expression
*Protein Manufacture
*Cell replication

The membrane of the nucleus is in fact a double layer of phospholipid membrane with numerous pores. Each pore is guarded by numerous protein complexes which  makes it functionally smaller than it apears on EM. Even so the pores can let through molecules of a molecular weight of up to 45,000. The interior of the cell membrane is also continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum.
[[File:Nucleus&amp;Nucleolus.gif|thumb|showing large nucleolus made up of ribosomal proteins and ribosomal DNA. The cell pores are clearly visible as well as the endoplasmic reticulum.]]

[[File:Nuclear membrane.png|400px]]
&lt;br clear='all' /&gt;

===Mitochondria===
[[File:Mitochondria, mammalian lung - TEM.jpg|thumb|mitochondria from the human lung showing christae and granules]]
'''Mitochondria''' (sing. mitochondrion) are known as the powerhouses of the cell, producing the majority - about 95% - of the ATP that is used in cell metabolism. We will look at this in greater detail in the section on ATP and Oxidative Phosphorylation.

Mitochondria come in various shapes and sizes -from round or spheroid to sausage or obloid in shape. The more active a cell is the more mitochondria they have. 

They have a double bilayer membrane, an outer and in inner membrane. The inner membrane is is folded into '''cristae''', and the walls of these cristae are studded with enzyme rich proteins which are involved in the production of ATP. Between the two membranes is the gel of the outer matrix - rich in enzymes for the processing of high energy hydrogen to ATP. In the inner space is the inner matrix which contains numerous enzymes involved in the breakdown of Glucose, fats and proteins for energy.

Mitochondria have several anomolies. They are self replicating and in fact have their own unique DNA.  When a mitochondria replicates, a new one buds off from an old one, similar in fashion to the way a bacteria replicates. This process is under the control of the mitochondria's own DNA. Most of the proteins and enzymes of mitochondria - over 98% - are in fact manufactured by the cells DNA, but many of the enzymes and proteins involved in oxidation and phosphorylation are manufactured by the mitochondria's DNA.

The mitochondrial DNA is not stored in a nucleus, but is in the form of a double circular molecule containing 16,569 base pairs (compared with over a billion base pairs in the cells nucleus). This is similar to the way DNA is stored in bacteria. There are other features similar to bacteria which has led to the postulation that  mitochondria evolved from an '''aerobic bacterium''' that got ingested by a '''eukaryotic''' cell and then learned to live in '''symbiosis''' with it.

[[File:Animal mitochondrion diagram en.svg|400px]]

====Mitochondrial DNA signature====
Sperm contain four mitochondria which are carried with the sperms tail. These are shed when the sperms head fuses with the ovum. This means that all mitochondrial DNA is descended from the female line. Mitochondrial DNA also has few of the reparative mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA, which means that the mutation rate is much faster than inn eukaryotic cells. This has allowed paleo-geneticists to trace the ancestry of humans, and show that we had a common female ancestor about 60 million years ago. In passing it should be noted that a similar analysis of the Y chromosome shows we have a common male ancestor about 60,000 years ago.

===Centrioles===
[[File:Spindle centriole - embryonic brain mouse - TEM.jpg|thumb|Transmission electron microscope image of a thin section cut through the developing brain tissue (telencephalic hemisphere) of an 11.5 day mouse embryo. This high magnification image of &quot;Embryonic brain 80445&quot; show a spindle centriole and some spindle microtubules visible in the cytoplasm of a mitotic cell at the luminal surface of the telencephalon.]]
Near the nucleus are found the centrioles, two structures usually at right angles to each other made up of microtubules. These are important in cell-division. They will be studied further when we look at cell replication.

The Quicksort alogrithm's ''intent'' can be elegantly expressed in Haskell with the help of list comprehensions: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
  qsort []     = [] 
  qsort (x:xs) = qsort [y|y&lt;-xs,y&lt;x] ++ [x] ++ qsort [y|y&lt;-xs,y&gt;=x]
&lt;/code&gt;
Note that because of excessive copying and concatenation of lists this code can be rather slow, depending on the implementation. But more importantly, the above code is not ''in-place'', which is an essential characteristic of ''genuine'' quicksort. Haskell's data is immutable though, but at least the list's double-traversal can be eliminated with
&lt;code&gt;
 qsort []     = [] 
 qsort (x:xs) = let (a,b)=part xs in qsort a ++ x : qsort b
   where
     part [] = ([],[])
     part (y:ys) | y &lt; x     = (y:a,b) 
                 | otherwise = (a,y:b) where (a,b) = part ys
&lt;/code&gt;
to make it a little bit less hideously inefficient.

: Just hazily wondering... but is it really worth it to optimize the sample implementations in this &quot;Overview&quot; page at the cost of clarity and elegance, given that its main point is demonstrating to the readers in a clear way what the language looks like? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:00, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Don't know. That's why I put it here, hoping for someone wiser than me to make a judgment. It's just that I've seen the list-comprehension variant above mentioned as an example of how Haskell makes it very easy to write terribly inefficient code. I was also hoping that the simplified code I've put on the page itself be sufficiently clear and easy for a beginner to read. The original code makes double traverse of the list structure for no other reason than to be visually appealing. Maybe that's ''exactly'' a kind of example that beginners ought ''not'' to see at all. Would appreciate any feedback. [[User:WillNess|WillNess]] ([[User talk:WillNess|talk]]) 11:30, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

: awwghh, how embarrassing. The function &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt; is of course, Data.List.''partition'', reinvented. [[User:WillNess|WillNess]] ([[User talk:WillNess|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WillNess|contribs]]) 08:23, 17 May 2011 (UTC)

Putting back the original concise &lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt; to the content page. The one-traversal code itself had a space leak anyway (explained in Bird's [http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-using-Haskell/dp/0134843460 IntroFunPro], pg. 248):
&lt;code&gt;

Just for reference, with primes wheel optimization, double primes feed for drastically reduced memory consumption, and a better adjusted folding tree structure, the '''''real''''' primes code is:

&lt;code&gt;
  primes = 2:3:5:7: gaps 11 wheel (join $ roll 11 wheel primes')

== Text Editor ==

* Stata 11 includes a do-file editor with syntax highlighting.
* If you are not using Stata 11, you may want to use an external text editor with syntax highlighting.  The list of external text editors are described here (http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html)

==  Customize Stata ==

=== Memory ===

Stata loads the data in memory. If you are dealing with large datasets, you may have the following error message : &lt;tt&gt; no room for more observations &lt;/tt&gt;. In that case, you just need to increase the amount of memory used by Stata. The maximum depends on your computer. 
 . set mem 100m * gives 100 megabyte
 . set mem 1g * gives 1 gigabyte

In Stata 12, these commands are not necessary because memory is managed automatically. Stata will inform you of this change any time you run the &lt;tt&gt; set mem &lt;/tt&gt; command, using this message:

    '''set memory''' ignored.
        Memory no longer needs to be set in modern Statas; memory adjustments are performed on the fly automatically.


If you want to know more, just type '''mem'''
&lt;pre&gt;
. mem
Total memory:   105M
Memory in use:    6k   0%
Room for 867k more observations
Room for 570k more variables (4 byte)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Profile.do ===
 
* profile.do is executed each time you open Stata. It is a simple do-file which should be located in the same directory as the .exe (Windows) or .app (Mac OS) file. You can define your ado files directory and store them in profile.do
&lt;pre&gt;
*! profile.do
sysdir set PERSONAL &quot;/Applications/Stata/ado/personal/&quot;
sysdir set PLUS &quot;/Applications/Stata/ado/plus/&quot;
sysdir set OLDPLACE &quot;/Applications/Stata/ado/oldplace/&quot;

set mem 100m
set more on, permanently
&lt;/pre&gt;


=== System Parameters ===

* '''query''' gives all the system parameter
* '''help limits''' gives all the limits (ie maximum number of observations, maximum number of variable, maximum length of a string, etc). 
* '''sysdir''' gives all the ado directories : 
&lt;pre&gt;
. sysdir
   STATA:  /Applications/Stata/
 UPDATES:  /Applications/Stata/ado/updates/
    BASE:  /Applications/Stata/ado/base/
    SITE:  /Applications/Stata/ado/site/
    PLUS:  /Applications/Stata/ado/plus/
PERSONAL:  /Applications/Stata/ado/personal/
OLDPLACE:  /Applications/Stata/ado/oldplace/
&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''about''' gives information about your version of Stata
&lt;pre&gt;
. about

== User-written ado files ==

* [http://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html SSC website] : a website that includes user-written Stata commands.
* '''ssc whatsnew''' : a command showing what's new in SSC 
* '''ssc des''' : a command describing a user written command.  
 . ssc des ivreg2 
* '''ssc install''' : a command to install new commands from SSC 
 . ssc install ivreg2
* '''ssc des a''' : a command describing all the SSC commands which names begins with 'a'

If you want to find new ado files, just use the findit command. For instance if you want to find new command about poverty, type : 

 . findit poverty

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Stata/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Read and import data ==

Usually, data are loaded into memory using the &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; command. The &lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt; option makes it sure that the current database in memory will be removed without saving the last changes.

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
use &quot;W:\Data\…\table.dta&quot; , clear	
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command allows to specify a working directory and makes it easier to load tables into memory.
 
&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
cd &quot;W:\Data\&quot; 
use table, clear
&lt;/pre&gt;

Stata9 users can import Stata10 datasets using the &lt;code&gt;use10&lt;/code&gt; command.

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
use10 table, clear
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some example datasets are stored in the Stata directory. They can be loaded into memory using the &lt;code&gt;sysuse&lt;/code&gt; command.

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
. sysuse cancer, clear
. sysuse smoking, clear
. sysuse auto, clear
. sysuse jspmix, clear
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can import a Comma Separated Value (CSV) format using '''insheet'''

&lt;pre width = 80&gt;
insheet using &quot;W:\Data\…\table.csv&quot;, delim(&quot;;&quot;)	
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== See also ===

* 'webuse' for internet data
* 'xmluse' for xml files
* 'infile' for text files 
* 'input' for entering data from keyboard
* 'infix' 
* 'fdause' for SAS xport data
* If none of these command works, you may use '''Stat/Transfer'''
* '''FTRANS''': module to batch convert file formats

== Save and export data ==

* save
 save table, replace

If you use Stata10 you can export to Stata9 format using '''saveold'''
 saveold table, replace

* outsheet : export to tab delimited or csv format. 
 outsheet using &quot;W:\Data\…\table.csv&quot;, replace comma		

See also
* outfile 
* xmlsave
* fdasave

== Append and merge ==

The standard Stata command is &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;. However, the user-written command &lt;code&gt;mmerge&lt;/code&gt; is safer and gives a better output. This command may be installed using &lt;code&gt;ssc install mmerge&lt;/code&gt; command or using &lt;code&gt;findit mmerge&lt;/code&gt;.

* dmerge
* joinby merge all possible pairs between the datasets

* '''append''' if you have two datasets with the same variable but different observations, you can make one dataset using the '''append''' command.

 use data_1, clear
 append data_2
 br 

== Describe a datasets ==

* des
* des, s
* codebook
* codebook2

== Detect missing values ==

* tabmiss
* npresent
* nmissing

You can convert missing values to values using the '''mvencode''' command. 
 mvencode exg ga dvg verts eco dr dvd fn reg mnr div, mv(0) override

== Variables ==

Very often you have to convert variable from a string to a numerical format. There are several way to do it. If you already have numeric values in your string variable, you should use '''destring'''. Otherwise you  should use the '''encode''' command. '''Encode''' will automatically create a numerical variable and will use as a value label the string values of the previous variable. 
	

* gen
* egen
* replace
* recode
* drop
* keep
* rename

'vallist' gives the list of all categories of a categorical variable in Stata. 
 vallist codep

== Dealing with labels ==

* lab var
* lab list
* lab define
* lab value


== Expand ==

* You can expand a dataset (ie multiplying observations by a given factor) using the '''expand''' command. 
This is useful for generating panel data models. In the first example, we draw 10 observations in a standard normal distribution and we replicate each observation once. 

&lt;pre&gt;
clear
set obs 10
gen u = invnorm(uniform())
expand 2
sort u
br 
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to pass an integer variable as an argument to '''expand'''.
&lt;pre&gt;
clear
set obs 10
gen u = uniform()
gen var = 1 + int(10 * uniform())
expand var
sort u 
br
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
clear
set obs 10
gen u = invnorm(uniform())
expandcl 2 , gen(cl)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Data Storage types==
All numeric types in Stata are normal &quot;signed&quot; quantities except that the highest 27 values are reserved for the &quot;missing&quot; types (., .a, .b, ..., .z). The storage size of the each variable is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Variable !! Size (in bytes)
|-
| byte || 1
|-
| int || 2
|-
| long || 4
|-
| float || 4
|-
| double || 8
|-
| string || 1 per-letter (therefore only ASCII characters, not full Unicode/UTF-8)
|}

== Standard Error Bar Chart ==

Standard Error Bar Chart are very useful to displain confidence interval.

&lt;pre&gt;
. clear
. set obs 100
obs was 0, now 100
. gen id = _n
. expand 10
(900 observations created)
. gen u = id/30 + invnorm(uniform())
. collapse (mean) mean = u (sd) sd = u, by(id) 
. local s = invnorm(.975) * 97,5 percentile of the normal distribution
. serrbar mean sd id , scale(`s')
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Setting for Graphics ==

* the list of symbols : 
 . palette symbolpalette 


''query graphics'' gives all the settings.

 . query graphics
     Graphics settings
         set graphics        on
         set scheme          vg_s2c
         set printcolor      automatic  may be automatic, asis, gs1, gs2, gs3
         set copycolor       automatic  may be automatic, asis, gs1, gs2, gs3
         set macgphengine    quartz     may be quartz or quickdraw
         set piccomments     on


* The scheme defines the general appearance of the graph.
* You can download more scheme on the Visual Guide to Stata Graphics website : 

 . net from http://www.stata-press.com/data/vgsg2/
 . net install vgsg2

== Exporting/Saving graphics ==

You can export a graph to png, jpg, ps or pdf format by using once the graph is done the '''graph export''' command.

 . tw sc y x 
 . gr export graph.png, replace

See '''h gr export''' to see the list of all available graph devices.

You can also store a graph in the Stata graph format using the '''graph save''' command. This format can only be read by Stata.

== Maps ==

* tmap
* spmap (http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/graphics/spmap.html)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Stata/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Macros == 

Stata includes 2 types of macros, local and global. 

== Programs ==

* A program in Stata is a kind of function. It takes arguments and produces a result. 

* which checks if a program already exists
&lt;pre&gt;
. which hello
/Applications/Stata/ado/personal/hello.ado
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
which hello
cap program drop hello  
program define hello
	di &quot;say hello&quot;
end
hello
program drop hello
&lt;/pre&gt;

A program can also return an r-class object
&lt;pre&gt;
. clear
. set obs 100
obs was 0, now 100
. gen u=invnorm(uniform())
. *** rclass
. program example, rclass
  1.  return scalar x=1
  2. end
. example
. ret list
scalars:
                 r(x) =  1

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Passing argument to a program ===

By default arguments are called using macros `1', `2',…,`N'. Here is an example of how it works. The program is very simple and just display the arguments if any. 

&lt;pre&gt;
. cap program drop tester

. program tester
  1.  di &quot;argument 1 is |`1'|&quot;
  2.  di &quot;argument 2 is |`2'|&quot;
  3.  di &quot;argument 3 is |`3'|&quot;
  4.  di &quot;argument 4 is |`4'|&quot;
  5. end

. 
. tester
argument 1 is ||
argument 2 is ||
argument 3 is ||
argument 4 is ||

. tester a b c
argument 1 is |a|
argument 2 is |b|
argument 3 is |c|
argument 4 is ||

. tester ab cd ee pei 
argument 1 is |ab|
argument 2 is |cd|
argument 3 is |ee|
argument 4 is |pei|
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Personal ado-files ==

The best practice is to store your personal ado-files in the personal directory. 

&lt;pre&gt;
. personal dir
your personal ado-directory is /Applications/Stata/ado/personal/
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Help files ==

Help files are using a specific mark up language. You can open an help file in your text editor and see the syntax.

== Unix-like function ==

* '''rmdir''' remove a directory
* '''mkdir''' create a new directory
* '''erase''' erase a file 
 erase temp.dta
* '''shell''' or '''!''' execute a unix/dos command. For instance in a unix environment (Mac/Linux), one can use the '''iconv''' command line to change the encoding from macroman to latin1 : 
 ! iconv -f latin1 -t macroman dataxmlWin.xml &gt; dataxmlMac.xml
* type print a file in the result window.
 type textfile.txt
* '''copy''' will copy a file to disk
 copy http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Stata wikibook.txt
* filefilter replace a character by another one in a text file. The following command remove quotes from temp1.txt and replace them with a &quot;-&quot;.
 filefilter temp1.txt temp2.txt, from(&quot;\Q&quot;) to(&quot;-&quot;) replace
* tmpdir gives the temporary working directory

=== Encoding problems ===

Sometimes, you need to convert the encoding of a dataset from '''latin1''' to '''macroman'''. You can use the unix '''iconv''' command.

&lt;pre&gt;
cap prog drop win2mac
prog define win2mac
	args basewin 
	use `basewin', clear
	xmlsave dataxmlWin, doctype(dta) replace
	! iconv -f latin1 -t macroman dataxmlWin.xml &gt; dataxmlMac.xml
	xmluse dataxmlMac.xml, doctype(dta)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Shell programs calling Stata ==
For ongoing projects one may want to embed Stata scripts into an automated workflow. This section will show you how to run Stata do files from the command-line. For these examples you will have to include the folder of your Stata executable into your PATH environment variable. Depending on your &quot;flavor&quot; of Stata (SE, MP, IC, Small) your Stata executable may also have a slightly different name. 

If you just call Stata with the do-file as its only argument, such as:
 StataSE myscript.do
Then Stata will open in normal (interactive) mode and do one of two things depending on your user preferences. It may execute the script (running -do myscript.do-) or open the do-file editor (-doedit myscript.do-). To set this preference open the do-file editor and then go to Edit, Preferences, and set the option for &quot;Edit do-files opened from Windows instead of executing them&quot;.

Alternatively, you can call Stata in background (batch) mode, such as:
 StataSE /e do myscript.do
This will execute your script, keep the Stata window minimized, and automatically log everything to myscript.log in the current working directory (there is no way to turn off this automatic logging in batch mode). 

Calling shell commands (!/shell/winexec) in batch mode will not work from Window&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2010-01/msg00537.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Programs that rely on these commands will also not work in this setting. Examples include: dirlist&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2011-07/msg00559.html&lt;/ref&gt; and parallel.

By default, Stata will inherit the working directory from the Shell. For example:
 cd /myproject/
 Stata /e do code/myscript.do
Stata will run with the working directory as /myproject. The log file will be there as well so this is a way to have your log files end up in a different directory than you do files.

=== Scobit ===

* Scobit (Skewed logistic regression) was developped by Jonathan Nagler 1994 (American Journal of Political Science). The idea is two estimate a skewness parameter of the underlying distribution.

&lt;pre&gt;
. global N = 2000 
. global alpha = 1
. clear
. set obs $N
obs was 0, now 2000
. gen u = ln(uniform()^(-1/$alpha) - 1)
. gen x = uniform()
. global beta = 2 
. gen y = ($beta * x + u &gt; 0)

.  
. scobit y x 

Fitting logistic model:

Iteration 0:   log likelihood =  -1190.598
Iteration 1:   log likelihood = -1126.9573
Iteration 2:   log likelihood = -1125.9604
Iteration 3:   log likelihood = -1125.9597
Iteration 4:   log likelihood = -1125.9597

Iteration 3:   log likelihood = -1125.8241  
Iteration 4:   log likelihood = -1125.8008  
Iteration 5:   log likelihood = -1125.7376  
Iteration 6:   log likelihood =  -1125.731  
Iteration 7:   log likelihood =  -1125.724

== Simple Linear Model ==

We generate a simple fake data set : 
&lt;pre&gt;
clear
set obs 1000
gen u = invnorm(uniform())
gen x = invnorm(uniform()) 
gen y = 1 + x + u
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
reg y x
eret list /*gives the list of all stored results */
predict yhat /*gives the predicted value of y*/
predict res, res /*gives the residuals*/
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''leanout''' is a prefix which simplifies the output&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Beck &quot;leanout: A prefix to regress (and similar
commands) to produce less output that is more useful&quot; Stata Journal, forthcoming http://politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/2576/sj_driver.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This command does not display useless ancillary statistics and focus and confidence intervals rather than null hypothesis testing.

&lt;pre&gt;
ssc install leanout
leanout : reg y x 
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Performing multiple regression on the same subsample == 

Sometimes you want to perform multiple regressions on the same subsample. This is not obvious since when one of the variable of the model is missing the observation is dropped. One way to be sure that you use the same subsample is to use the 'e(sample)' command which returns the list of all used observations. In the example below qui store the result of 'e(sample)' in variables 'samp1' and 'samp2' and we perform the model conditionning on 'samp1==1 &amp; samp2 == 1'. Thus we are sure that both estimation are done using the same observations.  

&lt;pre width=80&gt; 
. clear
. set obs 1000
. gen u = invnorm(uniform())
. gen x = invnorm(uniform())
. gen y1 = 1 + x + u if uniform() &lt; .8
. gen y2 = 1 + x + u if uniform() &lt; .9 
. qui reg y1 x
. gen samp1 = e(sample)
. ta samp1 
. qui reg y2 x
. gen samp2 = e(sample)
. ta samp2
. eststo clear
. eststo : qui : reg y1 x if samp1 &amp; samp2 
. eststo : qui : reg y2 x if samp1 &amp; samp2
. esttab ,  star(* 0.1 ** 0.05 *** 0.01) se
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Instrumental Variables ==

Here is a data generating process for an instrumental variable setting. 
'''u''' is correlated with '''x''' which gives endogeneity. 
'''z''' is independant of '''u''' and correlated with '''x''', which makes it eligible as a valid instrument for x.

&lt;pre&gt;
clear
set obs 1000
gen u = invnorm(uniform())
gen z = invnorm(uniform())
gen x = invnorm(uniform()) + z + u
gen y = 1 + 2*x + u
&lt;/pre&gt;

It easy to see that the standard least square estimate is biased and the IV estimate is unbiased.

&lt;pre&gt;
eststo clear
eststo : reg y x 
eststo : ivreg y (x=z)
esttab , se
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can perform an overidentification test using '''overid''' or '''ivreg2'''

&lt;pre&gt;
clear
set obs 1000
gen u = invnorm(uniform())
gen z1 = invnorm(uniform())
gen z2 = invnorm(uniform())
gen x = invnorm(uniform()) + z1 - 2*z2 + u
gen y = 2*x + u

ivreg y (x=z1 z2)
overid
ivreg2 y (x=z1 z2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Seemingly Unrelated Equations ==

&lt;pre width=80&gt;
. clear
. set obs 1000
. local s11 = 1
. local s12 = .5 
. local s22 = 1
. local s13 = .5
. local s23 = .5
. local s33 = 1 
. forvalues k = 1/3{
  2.  tempvar u`k'
  3.  gen `u`k'' = invnorm(uniform())
  4.  }
. gen eta1 = `s11' * `u1'
. gen eta2 = `s12' * `u1' + `s22' * `u2'
. gen eta3 = `s13' * `u1' + `s23' * `u2' + `s33' * `u3' 
. gen x = invnorm(uniform()) 
. forvalues k=1/3{
  2.  gen z`k' = invnorm(uniform())
  3.  }
. gen y1 = 1 + 2*x + z1 + eta1 
. gen y2 = - 1 + x + z2 + eta2 
. gen y3 = 4 + z3 + eta3
. global eq1 =  &quot;y1 x z1&quot;
. global eq2 =  &quot;y2 x z2&quot;
. global eq3 =  &quot;y3 x z3&quot; 
. reg $eq1
. reg $eq2
. reg $eq3
. sureg (toto1 : $eq1) (toto2 : $eq2) (toto3 : $eq3)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Random effect estimator ===

We assume &lt;math&gt;y_{it} = 1 + x_{it} + z_{i} + f_{i} + u_{it}&lt;/math&gt;. With f independant of x and z and u independant of x and z.
&lt;pre&gt;

. set obs 1000
. gen id = _n
. gen f = invnorm(uniform())
. gen z = uniform()
. expand 10
. gen u = invnorm(uniform())
. gen x = uniform()
. gen y = 1 + x + z + f + u
. eststo clear
. eststo : qui : reg y x z
. eststo : qui : reg y x z, robust
. eststo : qui : reg y x z, cluster(id)
. eststo : qui : xtreg y x z, i(id) re
. eststo : qui : xtreg y x z, i(id) mle
. eststo : qui : xtmixed y x z || id : , mle
. esttab * , se  
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Dynamic Linear Panel Data ===

Layard and Nickel unemployment dataset.

&lt;pre&gt;
. use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/macro/abdata.dta, clear
(Layard &amp; Nickell, Unemployment in Britain, Economica 53, 1986 from Ox dist)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also generate fake data :
&lt;pre&gt;
clear
	set obs 10000
	set seed 123456
	gen id = _n
	gen f= invnorm(uniform())
	forvalues t=1/5{
		gen u`t' = invnorm(uniform())
		}
	gen y1 = f/.3 + u1 
	forvalues t=2/5{
		local z=`t'-1
		gen y`t' =  .7 * y`z' +  f +  u`t'
	}
save wide, replace
reshape long y, i(id) j(year)
drop u* f
tsset siren an 
save long, replace
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is easy to see that standard random effect and fixed effect models are biased but instrumented random and fixed effect are unbiased : 
&lt;pre&gt;
eststo clear
eststo : qui : xtreg y l.y, re 
eststo : qui : xtreg y l.y, fe 
eststo : qui : xtivreg y (l.y= l2.d.y) , re 
eststo : qui : xtivreg y (l.y= l2.y) , fd 
esttab  ,se
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
eststo clear
eststo : qui : xi : xtabond2 y l.y, gmmstyle(l.y, lag(2 .) equation(level))  nomata  robust
eststo : qui : xi : xtabond2 y l.y, gmmstyle(l.y, lag(2 .) equation(level))  ivstyle( , e(diff)) nomata  robust
eststo : qui : xi : xtabond2 y l.y, iv(l.y l2.y l3.y, equation(diff))   nomata  robust
esttab , se
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Weaving ==

Weaving is an integration of statistical program with a publishing software. You have in the same file your code and your text. Weaving is intended to improve reproducibility standards (see [http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/repro.html Roger Koenker's webpage]). 

* [http://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457021.html Ben Jann's texdoc] provides weaving capabilities for Stata and LaTeX

== Export to [[LaTeX]] ==

* '''eststo''', '''esttab''', '''estadd''' and '''estout''' are the best solution to print and export to latex the estimation results&lt;ref&gt;Visit the website http://repec.org/bocode/e/estout/&lt;/ref&gt;. 
** '''eststo''' is a prefix command which stores estimation results.
** '''estout''' prints the results. It includes many options and is difficult to use.
** '''esttab''' is a wrapper for '''estout''' which includes less options and is easier to use.
** '''estadd''' allows to store more statistics.

Pan broiling is when an item, usually meat, is placed in a dry pan and cooked over high heat. Meats that are good for pan broiling include [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], and [[cookbook:fish|fish]].</text>

Hi, and welcome to my talk page.

I am Dirk Beetstra, my main projects are [[:w:en:User:Beetstra]] and [[:m:User:Beetstra]]

My main edits here will concern editors who were performing the same (or similar) edits on more than one wikipedia.

'''If you want to contact me quickly:&lt;br/&gt;
leave a message [[:w:en:User talk:Beetstsra|on en.wikipedia]] or [[:m:User talk:Beetstra|on meta.wikimedia]]&lt;br/&gt;
contact me [irc://chat.freenode.net:8001/wikipedia-spam-t on IRC]'''
&lt;/div&gt;
----
'''My edits here'''
* My edits here will mainly be due to removal of '''unwanted external links''' and '''vandalism'''.  Generally the edits I revert have been performed on a (large) number of wikimedia projects, or the info I remove has been added ('pushed') to a (large) number of wikimedia projects (hence regarding edits that were very similar in nature), and is considered ''generaly'' unhelpful.  

* If the removal concerns '''external links''', then the removal may very well precede or follow meta blacklisting, and the removal is to prevent further disruption.

* I will be able to provide ''evidence'' of the wide scale disruption that has been performed by the editor whose edits I revert.

* Please note that the info on a singular wiki may seem appropriate, but the user I am handling is probably performing their edits on a large number of wikis.  If you feel the edit is here appropriate, or even wanted, just revert me.

Terms I use in my edit summaries:
* 'cross-wiki spam' or 'xwiki spam' -&gt; a user has been adding the link(s) I am removing/reverting edit on a large number of wikipedia.  The link may already be blacklisted on meta (see [[:m:Talk:Spam blacklist]]).

'''My tools'''
* I have [[:m:Global rollback]].  If I use it on this wiki, I will probably be reverting something cross-wiki.

*I am a 'bot' operator (software automatically processing wikimedia edits), running a number of bots on IRC, and some on en.wikipedia and meta.wikimedia.  The majority of these bots concern 'conflict of interest' and link additions.  These bots report to IRC and in that way provide me with information about cross-wiki aspects of certain editors.

'''General links'''
* [[:m:External_links_policy|meta external links policy]]
* [[:m:External_links_policy/Local_policies_and_pages|matrix of local policies and pages ]]
