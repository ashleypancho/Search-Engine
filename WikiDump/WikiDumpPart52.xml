This book will guide you through the process of writing a business plan. Having a business plan and running your business according to that plan can be fundamental to a business's success. It is also important to have enough capital so you can run your business at a loss until it can turn profitable without going under. 

==Introduction==
A business plan is a formal statement of a set of business goals, the reasons why they are believed attainable, and the plan for reaching those goals. It may also contain background information about the organization or team attempting to reach those goals.

The business goals being attempted may be for-profit or non-profit. For-profit business plans typically focus on financial goals. Non-profit and government agency business plans tend to focus on service goals.

Business plans may also target changes in perception and branding by the customer, client, tax-payer, or larger community. A business plan that has changes in perception and branding as its primary goals is called a marketing plan.

Business plans may also be internally or externally focused. Externally focused plans target goals that are important to external stakeholders, particularly financial stakeholders. They typically have detailed information about the organization or team attempting to reach the goals. In the case of for-profit entities, external stakeholders would include investors and customers.

External stake-holders of non-profits include donors and the clients of the non-profit's services.

In the case of government agencies, external stakeholders would include tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as the IMF, the world bank, various economic agencies of the UN, and development banks.

Internally focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals. They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new IT system, a restructuring of finance, the refurbishing of a factory or a restructuring of the organization.

An internal business plan will often be developed in conjunction with a balanced scorecard or a list of critical success factors. This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures. Business plans that identify and target internal goals, but provide only general guidance on how they will be met are called strategic plans.

Operational plans describe the goals of an internal organization, working group or department. Project plans, sometimes known as project frameworks, describe the goals of a particular project. They may also address the project's place within the organization's larger strategic goals.

Business plans are decision making tools. There is no fixed content for a business plan. Rather the content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. A business plan should contain whatever information is needed to decide whether or not to pursue a goal.

For example, a business plan for a non-profit might discuss the fit between the business plan and the organization’s mission. Banks are quite concerned about defaults, so a business plan for a bank loan will build a convincing case for the organization’s ability to repay the loan. Venture capitalists are primarily concerned about initial investment, feasibility, and exit valuation. A business plan for a project requiring equity financing will need to explain why current resources, upcoming growth opportunities, and sustainable competitive advantage will lead to a high exit valuation.

Preparing a business plan draws on a wide range of knowledge from many different business disciplines: finance, human resource management, intellectual property management, supply chain management, operations management, and marketing, among others. It can be helpful to view the business plan as a collection of sub-plans, one for each of the main business disciplines.

The format of a business plan depends on its presentation context. It is not uncommon for businesses, especially start-ups to have three or four formats for the same business plan:

* an &quot;elevator pitch&quot; - a three minute summary of the business plan's executive summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential funders, customers, or strategic partners.

* an oral presentation - a hopefully entertaining slide show and oral narrative that is meant to trigger discussion and interest potential investors in reading the written presentation. The content of the presentation is usually limited to the executive summary and a few key graphs showing financial trends and key decision making benchmarks. If a new product is being proposed and time permits a demonstration of the product may also be included.

* a written presentation for external stakeholders - a detailed, well written, and pleasingly formatted plan targeted at external stakeholders.

* an internal operational plan - a detailed plan describing planning details that are needed by management but may not be of interest to external stakeholders. Such plans have a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality than the version targeted at external stakeholders.

Cost and revenue estimates are central to any business plan for deciding the viability of the planned venture. But costs are often underestimated and revenues overestimated resulting in later cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and possibly non-viability. During the dot-com bubble 1997-2001 this was a problem for many technology start-ups. However, the problem is not limited to technology or the private sector; public works projects also routinely suffer from cost overruns and/or revenue shortfalls. The main causes of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls are optimism bias and strategic misrepresentation.

=Writing the plan=
This article explains what goes into a business plan and why. It is not specific to any particular kind of business plan. Nor does it presume any specific layout. Please do not read the section headings as titles of business plan sections. For information on the various presentation formats of a business plan see the main article Business plan.

Though business plans have many different presentation formats, business plans typically cover five major content areas:

* background information
* a marketing plan
* an operational plan
* a financial plan
* a discussion of the decision making criteria that should be used to approve the plan.

Some of these content areas may be more or less important depending on the kind of business plan. There is no fixed content for a business plan. Rather the content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. A business plan should contain whatever information is needed to decide whether or not to pursue a goal.

Once a business plan has been developed, the key decision making points are usually summarized in an executive summary.

== Executive Summary ==
The executive summary summarizes the key points of the business plan.  It should define the decision to be made and the reasons for approval. The specific content will be highly dependent on the core purpose and target audience. To get a sense of the difference the purpose and target audience can make, here are three different sets of key points for an executive summary - one for a loan request, one for a start-up seeking venture finance, and one for an internal plan.  Items unique to a particular kind of plan are highlighted in bold:

A loan request executive summary might contain the following information {{Fact|date=March 2007}}:
* company information: name of company, '''years in business''', legal structure, minority and majority owners
* brief description of project
* '''amount and length of loan'''
* objective reasons why the bank should be confident that the loan will be paid back.  This likely will include
** financial track record
** the future revenue stream
** any contracts in place that might guarantee the revenue stream is more than just a forecast.

For a new venture, the executive summary might contain{{Fact|date=March 2007}}:
* company information: name of company, '''proposed legal structure''', current legal structure, minority and majority investors.
* '''amount of investment requested'''
* '''expected terminal value'''
* '''description of market opportunity'''
* '''objective reasons why the market opportunity can be exploited by this particular team'''

For an internal project plan, the executive summary might look like this{{Fact|date=March 2007}}:
* company information:  '''not applicable'''
* description of project
* '''project mandate: who requested the proposal, who is being assigned to carry it out'''
* '''strategic''', '''tactical''' and financial justifications
* summary of resources needed: '''staff''', funds, '''facilities'''

In some cases information will overlap. For example, some of the reasons why a loan is likely to be repaid might equally as well be used as justification for the kind of extraordinary return expected by venture capitalists.

In some cases the business plan as a whole contains similar information, but for one type of plan it is mere detail and for another it is a key decision making factor.  For instance, both start-ups and internal projects need staff and facilities. However the staffing and facilities needs are considered details in a plan for start-up financing.  In a plan for internal projects they are key elements and, in fact, may be the only resources needed.

== Organizational Background ==
In a written plan information may appear in a separate section, an appendix, or may be omitted altogether depending on the nature of the plan.  If the plan is directed at people outside of the company, a brief synopsis may appear in the executive summary.  This will be supplemented with a more detailed discussion elsewhere in the plan.

=== Mission Statement ===

=== Current Status ===
* number of employees
* annual sales figures
* key product lines
* location of facilities
* current stage of development (start-ups)
* corporate structure (options are: 
** [[Sole proprietor]]
** [[Partnership]]
** [[Joint Venture]]
** [[Publicly traded corporation]]
** [[Limited liability company]]
** [[Public utility]]
** [[Non-profit organization]]
* names of the majority investor, if any

=== History ===
* founding date
* major successes
* strategically valuable learning experiences

=== Management Team ===
* Board members
* Owners
* Senior managers
* Managing partners
* Head scientists and researchers

== Marketing Plan ==
The marketing plan has five objectives:

* to identify revenue generating opportunities
* to provide a rationale for revenue forecasts.
* to define marketing goals.
* to define a set of concrete steps for reaching those goals.
* to describe current progress towards those goals, if any.

The rationale behind revenue projections is developed by describing the market associated with each product covered by the business plan. In addition the business's current and likely future competitive position must be discussed.

Specific marketing goals and the steps involved in achieving them are covered by describing plans for pricing, promotion, demand management, distribution, and brand development.

For more information, see [[Marketing Plan]].

=== Product Portfolio ===
* Core product lines relevant to venture or project
* For each relevant product line, 
** [[Product management|Life cycle management plan]]
** Versioning possibilities
** Revenue potential

=== Market Size and Structure ===
* allied markets (substitute products)
* major players: customers, vendors, regulatory agencies, etc
* balance of power among vendors, customers, regulatory agencies, other
 
=== Competitive analysis: Existing Markets ===
If the product has an existing market, a table or set of paragraphs explaining the following may be needed:

* name, features, why proposed product is better
* switching costs
* customer loyalty to/brand premium of competitors
* why the product will overcome switching costs and customer loyalty
* the competitive strategy:
** staying power (common for second mover large corporations)
** expertise in mass distribution (another large second mover advantage)
** niche for which competitor has no suitable strengths
** monopoly rights to improved product, i.e. patents, exclusive contracts
** richness of alliances
** novel and hard to copy business process/culture
* time line for growth in market share

=== Competitive analysis: New Markets ===
If the product is a new product with no existing market, one must identify all substitute products. For each significant substitute product one must explain:
* name, features, why substitute, why proposed product better
* switching costs and why new product justifies switching
* expected adoption dynamics
* expected role once market begins to develop (see above for existing products)

=== Pricing ===
* chosen price points
* proposed [[Pricing|Pricing strategy]]
* research supporting chosen price points

=== Demand Management ===
&lt;!-- SBA stats - too rapid growth kills businesses --&gt;
&lt;!-- May need new wiki topic.  Demand management topic only covers
     macro-economic, not marketing, use of the term. --&gt;

=== Distribution ===
* [[Distribution (business)|Distribution strategy]] 
* List of major distributors
* Current status of negotiations

=== Promotion and Brand Development ===
* [[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion strategy]]

== Operational Plan ==

=== Current Product/project status ===

=== Research and development plan ===

=== Manufacturing/Deployment plan ===
* [[Supply chain]] requirements
* Production inputs
* Facility requirements - size, layout, capacity, location
* Equipment requirements
* Warehousing needs for raw materials, finished goods
** space requirements

=== Information and Communications Technology Plan ===
* Systems needed
** Operations: Billing, HR, SCM, CRM, Knowledge bases, etc
** Websites: internal, public
* Security and privacy requirements
* Hardware requirements
* Off-the-shelf software needed
* Custom development requirements

=== Staffing Plan ===

==== Staffing Needs ====
* list of roles
* management structure
* for each role
** number of employees
** proposed compensation
** availability

==== Union issues ====

==== Training Requirements ====

==== Hiring Time Table ====

==== Staffing Budget ====

=== Business Process Outsourcing Plan ===
Only those processes are to be outsources that aren't the core processes of the business, 
For example, a company XYZ invents a product called ABC and starts its production. as soon as the patent of the same expires, others will start to manufacture the product ABC. 
Companies will now tend to gain an upperhand either by associating more benefits to it, else will outsource its manufacture to some organization which has cost cutting benefits.  
The company XYZ, if it has invested on R&amp;D, enough, will now start to produce another product and kill off the earlier product, ABC.

=== Asset Development Plan ===

==== Intellectual Property Plan ====
* intellectual property inventory
* portfolio development plan

==== Acquisition Plan ====
Some business plans gain competitive advantage by buying companies up and down the value chain.  Some gain competitive advantage by buying up companies and consolidating them.  Sometimes a business plan will seek to earn a superior return by adding superior management talent to an existing weak company.

For more information see [[Mergers and Acquisitions]].

When acquisitions form a major part of the business strategy, the acquisition plan needs to be included in the business plan.

* acquisition strategy
* proposed acquisition targets
* effect on market structure (if consolidation plan is being proposed)

==== Organizational Learning Plan ====
The organizational learning plan discusses what lessons will be learned from the marketing, operational, and finance plans and how those lessons will be consolidated to gain strategic advantage.

* market sensing - organization's method for collecting information about customers (George Day)
* [[Strategic Staircase]] - the accumulation of future competencies by building on existing competencies. (Michael Hays, Costas Markides)

=== Cost Allocation Model ===
If variable costs play an important role in the business plan, it may be helpful to include a cost allocation model.  This is particularly true if one has a unique business model that creates competitive advantage by transforming traditionally fixed costs into variable costs{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.
     
* Fixed cost
* Variable costs

== Financial Plan ==
For more information, see [[Financial plan]].

=== Current Financing ===
* key investors or owners
** investment firms (private equity)
** corporate investors
** angels, friends, and family
* existing loans and liabilities
* terms, obligations

=== Funding Needs ===

=== Funding Plan ===
* potential sources of new funding

=== Financial History ===

=== Financial Forecasts ===
* sometimes called [[pro forma]]s
** balance sheet
** income statement
** cash flow statement
* 1-3-5-7 year projections (depends on length of project)
** for loans, repayment period determines length of projections, i.e. a six month loan doesn't need seven year forecasts
** for investments point at which returns stabilize ([[terminal value]]) determines length of forecast
* annual, quarterly, and monthly versions should be provided
* graphs of key values often helpful: gross revenue, EBITDA, NPV, etc.
* financial portions of the marketing, asset development, and operations are often placed in this section rather than in the section discussing th plan.  They are viewed as elaboration on the various line items in the pro-formas.

=== Valuation ===

== Risk analysis ==
For more information, see [[Risk analysis]].

=== Risk Evaluation ===
* market risks
** new entrants to market
*** easy of entry
*** potential threat to market share
** slower than expected adoption
* operational risks
* staffing risks
** availability of skilled workforce
** union issues
* financing risks
** liabilities
** poorly worded investor contracts at risk for litigation
** investor pull-out
** lack of follow-on funding to complete project
* managerial risks
** poor board or investor dynamics
** agency risk particular to the venture

=== Risk Management Plan ===
Detailed plans are more often found as part of in internal plans. 
Plans written for funders may need to include a high level description if there are significant controllable risks.

* methods and procedures to limit liabilities
* reserve funds
* continuity of operations plan

Hello, Leigh Blackall from Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand. We have been funded to re write a business planning workbook based on what is commonly used throughout NZ. Our brief is to write a simple, highly accessible workbook that includes a template for a business plan with the notable difference being that this plan will be for developing a sustainable business - probably following a simplified triple bottom line idea.

I'm in two minds - create a new Wikibook called Starting a Sustainable Business - or start contributing to this one. The thing is - our edits will be fast and many, with a specific objective in mind.

Your thoughts? --[[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 23:08, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

If content used on the book has a source on Wikipedia you have to acknowledge it in an authors page, even if you used transwiki to get the history logs complete some users do have dual licensing of the content and some licenses can give more freedom that GFDL so a reference to Wikipedia on the book will always be useful.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:51, 15 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

If used underwater, this spell creates a jet of boiling water. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] used this spell underwater when he is attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grindylow|Grindylows]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 26|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]] as a part of the Second Task.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anonymity in John 19'''  We have mention of Christ, Mary, Mary wife of Clopas, Mary Magdalene, Pontius Pilate, Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea in John 19.  All of these people were, to a lesser or greater degree, supporters and / or followers of Christ.  The name-dropping of these supporters is quite rampant in this chapter, but as for those opposed to Christ, we have only the vague titles of &quot;the Jews&quot; and &quot;the chief priests.&quot;  Caesar is mentioned briefly, but only in an invocation by the chief Jewish priests.  Why all this anonymity?  I'm not sure of the reason, but I would like to point out that the anonymity is an indicator of political motivations.  If the author of John was Gentile and anti-Semitic, it would have been more effective for him/her to name specific Jews to polarize his audience, in addition to the already negative portrayal of the Jews and chief priests.  The fact that he/she does not do this suggests one of two things: 1) he/she did not know the names of those priests and officials involved or 2) he / she was less actively anti-Semitic than he / she could have been, which is an encouraging thought.
After Jesus' arrest, He appeared in front of multiple Jewish leaders, who eventually passed him off to the Romans because according to Jewish law, they had &quot;no right to execute anyone&quot; (18:31).  Pushing the decision on the Romans, the Jews were using the Romans as a means to execute Jesus, while avoiding the penalty of their own law.  Even Pilate, a Roman leader, had trouble punishing an innocent man.  He looked toward the people and encouraged them to free Jesus on the basis that he found &quot;no basis for a charge against him&quot; (18:38).

Here are the charges:

•	SEDITION 

•	TAX EVASION

•	IMPERSONATING A KING 

•	IMPERSONATING THE MESSIAH 

•	IMPERSONATING GOD 

“This man is a wizard, shaman, warlock, and an insurrectionist. He is stirring up the people telling them not to pay taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be the Messiah, the King of the Jews.”

Pilate said he finds &quot;no basis for a charge against&quot; Jesus.  As Pilate hears that Jesus is the Son of God, he is &quot;afraid&quot; (19:8), and tries to set him free (v. 12).  Yet he shows his true alliance to the government as the Jews bring the Roman law into focus by basically calling Pilate disloyal.  The fact of the matter remains, Caesar himself had warned Pilate twice that another rebellion and bloodletting in the Jewish community would result in his punishment (Smith).  Pilate therefore had a very interesting decision to make.  Does he execute a man that some consider to be a prophet?  This in itself may cause a rebellion.  Or does he defy the Jewish law and set him free?  Caiphus and the Jewish community at large would surely be outraged.  Either way, Pilate felt deep concern regarding this decision.  This is probably the main  reason he wished to debate with the chief priests on the nature of Jesus' punishment.  Even at this point, Pilate is still uncomfortable with punishing an innocent man, especially the Son of God (see 19:35), and the text concludes Pilate's fight to free Jesus by saying that he &quot;Finally handed Him over,&quot; thus showing that it wasn't a willing choice, but one made through time and pressure.

'''Women in Jesus' Family and their Presence at the Cross'''  John 19: 25 states, &quot;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.&quot;  While women are present at the crucifixion in all the other Gospels, all have different lists of which women were present (except for Luke, whose Gospel doesn't contain a list at all).  It is quite interesting that the narrator of John had Jesus' mother appear only at the beginning of His ministry and at the end.  D. Moody Smith says that her appearance at the crucifixion is similar to &quot;her presence in the upper room, with Jesus' brothers, after the Ascension&quot; in Acts 1:14 (Smith 359).  There are examples of Jesus' brothers that became disciples and missionaries after the risen Jesus appeared to them (1 Cor 15:7) and 1 Cor 9:5 are two such examples).  Since the Gospel of John doesn't contain an infancy narrative, the readers of John don't see Mary &quot;venerated&quot; or become a disciple of Jesus like she is in both Matthew, Luke, and Acts.  The narrator of John includes Mary's presence at the crucifixion while showing Jesus wanting to provide for his mother: in John 19: 26-27, Jesus presents &quot;the disciple whom he loved&quot; to his mother saying &quot;here is your son&quot; and presents his mother with the disciple saying &quot;here is your mother.&quot;  It is possible that narrator of John &quot;knew a tradition that placed the mother of Jesus at the foot of the cross, and this fact occasioned his construction of this narrative in which she is linked most closely to the Beloved Disciple, the model disciple and witness who takes her to his home&quot; (Smith 360).  

This strange episode in 26-27 is also significant because it seems to show Jesus circumventing the traditional model of the brothers taking care of the mother after the oldest child's death, but instead Jesus is giving care of his mother over to one of his disciples.  Many Catholics point to this passage as evidence that Mary may have in fact stayed a perpetual virgin and did not mother the other children of Joseph.  Though it is possible to take such an interpretation of this passage, there are other passages in the New Testament that make it difficult.  Others have tried to claim that the mother being referred to in the passage is actually Mary Magdalene and that Jesus is talking to his son whom he fathered with Mary.  Obviously this view is a rather dramatic departure from the actual content of the chapter.  John clearly identifies her as &quot;Jesus' mother&quot; and later that the beloved disciple took her &quot;into his home&quot; which clearly identifies the disciple as a man.  People who hold this view though, would say that John deliberates misrepresents the situation because Jesus' life with Mary was somewhat secret and could not be openly expressed.  Both of these views seem to be reading into the text things that are not there, but it is true that all translation of ancient text require some degree of interpretation and it is not possible to rule them out as possibilities.     


'''&quot;It is Finished!&quot;''' 
In John 19 Jesus' last words seem to express triumph over defeat. In verse 11 Jesus states: &quot;You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me up to you has the greater sin.&quot;(NAS)  Jesus is pointing to Satan as the one who rules the earth and ruled over Pilate. It is important to note, however, that Pilate's actions are not without sin.. Pilate is believed to have come from Scotland, he ruled from 26 to 36 AD. The Jewish Encyclopedia says,
“His administration was characterized by corruption, violence, robberies, ill treatment of the people, and continuous executions without even the form of a trial…Pilate looted “funds from the sacred treasury in order to provide for the construction of an aqueduct”…when the citizens protested he sent among the crowds disguised soldiers carrying concealed daggers, who massacred a great number, not only of the rioters, but of casual spectators…Pilate's last deed of cruelty, and the one which brought about his downfall, was the massacre of a number of Samaritans who had assembled on Mount Gerizim to dig for some sacred vessels.” http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=312&amp;letter=P&amp;search=pilate  


 Jesus mentions that the one who handed him over to Pilate--Caiaphas, not Judas--has the ''greater'' sin. This implies that there is certainly a lesser sin, and it has been done by Pilate. This also predicts this overcoming just as the rest of previous chapters in John. However, what is interesting in John is that it has no mention of the veil of the temple being torn after Jesus gives up his spirit. This veil was used to &quot;serve as a partition between the holy place and the holy of holies&quot; mentioned in Exodus 26:33.It was used in Jerusalem and was the center of religious Jewish life where animal sacrifices and worship were performed in order to make anointment for people's sins. In all the synoptic gospels this account was mentioned as well as an earthquake in Matthew. This tearing of the veil was a historic catastrophe to the people at this time, so why did the author of John leave this significant event out? One belief is that the author left this piece of evidence out to emphasize the next verses. In John 19: 31-37 the Jews are said to break the bones of the other men who were crucified, but not Jesus' because He was already dead. (v.31-33) Then in verse 34, Jesus is pierced in the side with a spear and blood and water came out. Many believe the blood is a symbolism of sacrifice and the water is of purification. With that said, in verse 35 it states: &quot;And he who has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.&quot; (NAS)This seems to be a reoccurring theme in John, for the author to educate and almost &quot;evangelize&quot; his readers.  Then, we have again another theme in John that Jesus was not a sacrifice but a ransom and the ransom was paid to Satan. Jesus saved us from the land of Death by presenting himself alive as a sinless man. Satan was smugly confident that he could make Jesus sin by nailing him to a cross and blaming it on the Father making Yah into just another blood thirsty pagan God. This was the last temptation. Jesus could have called down 70,000 angels, but by refusing he went to the point of death without sinning and died a sinless man. Satan had the right to kill every sinner, but he did not have the right to kill a sinless man and when he did he fell under the curse of God. His throne was toppled.  
'''Chapter 19:31-42:'''

Jesus' body bears witness to his identity and his fulfillment.  When the soldiers find Jesus dead one of them stabs him to be sure he is dead, and out comes a sudden flow of blood and water (v. 34).  There is some uncertainty as to where the water and blood came out.  Did it flow from beneath His skin or from a deeper source?  It is the fact of death, not the cause of death that the author was more concerned about.  The significance of this flow is that Jesus is the Passover sacrifice. Furthermore, Jesus used both blood and water as significant symbols in his teaching, and this gives us guidance for their significance. Water symbolizes purification, the Spirit, and salvation.  Blood symbolizes Jesus' death, which brings life to the world (6:53-56). From these relations it would seem that in this flow of blood and water &quot;John saw a symbol of the fact that from the Crucified there proceed those living streams by which men are quickened and the church lives&quot; (Dodd 1953:428)

Another important part in these last verses is the fact that none of the soldiers did break his bones coincidently just as scripture had earlier prescribed it to be: &quot; Break none of his bones&quot;.  Now, the fact being that they knew they were fulfilling scripture or not is a whole other matter, but is unlikely since it said that they only did not break his legs since he was already dead.  Still, the fact that things like this happen and fulfill scripture is interesting.  
Also, the fact that Nicodemus, the one who had originally come in the dark because he did not believe, came back at the end to show his respects to Jesus is a sign of coming full circle in John.  It is also a character that is specific to this gospel as well. 


These chapters are essential in the Gospel of John because of the death of Jesus which is the central theological theme of this Gospel has been misunderstood by the writers of the other new Testament books who mistake Jesus for the goat of the atonement or the bull.  It is important to note that the death is expressed much different than the rest of the New Testament.  Most noteworthy is the lack of elaborate account of Jesus' trial before Jewish authorities.

      At Their Second Meeting, Pilate  Angers the Rogues by saying He Plans  to Release Yahshuah			

When the rogues met the second time with Pilate, Pilate said, “First you brought this man accusing him of trying to overthrow your nation and Caesar. I examined him and found him to be harmless, and I told you it is no crime for a fool to claim to be a king. Then you took him to Antipas, who as near as I can tell, did not find any crimes in him either, but sent him back dressed as a king, to show that he too thinks he is a harmless fool. Under Roman law, being a fool is not a crime. Therefore, here is what I will do. I will have him scourged, and since it is the Passover feast, when I usually release a prisoner, I will release him.”
The rogues all cried out at once. “No, execute this Yahshuah and release to us the other Yahshuah, the son of Abba, (Barabbas). Barabbas was a robber and an Israeli extreme patriot who had been arrested for murder and causing a riot in Jerusalem.
Pilate said, “But this Yahshuah of the Galil has committed no crime.”
They cried, “Impale him. Impale him!” He has blasphemed against our nation claiming he is the son of Adonai.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the heart of the Lone Star State - the Hill Country region. Here, you’re not only in the middle of Texas, but you’re also at the center of everything Texas has to offer. You’ll find beauty all around you. The Hill Country is home to rolling hills that dominate the region, a breathtaking display of wildflowers found along roadsides in springtime, year-round lush green landscapes and plenty of splendid lakes and rivers beckoning you to take a dip or cast your line.
----
This region begins in west Texas in Crockett County, and stretches east to Austin, the state’s capital in Travis County. Mills County is the region’s northern point, and Kinney, Medina and Uvalde counties make up the southern border.
----
Austin, the jewel of the region, is host to many outstanding attractions and points of interest. History buffs can sate their desire for knowledge at places like the granite dome of the State Capitol building, which is taller than our nation’s capitol, the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum or the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum. While you’re here, don’t miss the University of Texas at Austin campus (one of the largest in the country) and Zilker Park with its famous spring-fed Barton Springs pool. Do a little browsing at the eclectic shops found along South Congress Avenue.
----
There is, of course, no shortage of shopping opportunities everywhere you turn. Starting in San Marcos, you’ll find Prime Outlets and Tanger Outlet Center, which is the largest factory outlet complex in the state. Just north of San Marcos in the town of Buda, you’ll find Cabela’s, the eye-popping outdoor recreation mega-store that’s so large there’s a two-story mountain and gigantic fresh-water aquarium inside its two-story layout. There are also great antique stores found in cities like Burnet, Wimberly, Dripping Springs and more.

----
If water sports are more to your liking, you’ll find plenty of opportunities here. There are almost two dozen magnificent state parks here, most of which are located along lakes or rivers. So, if you like to fish, swim, waterski, pitch a tent and camp near a lake or river bank, you’re definitely in the right region.

----
But there’s so much more, beginning with the exciting Schlitterbahn water park in New Braunfels. Located alongside the spring-fed Comal River, Schlitterbahn features all kinds of water rides and activities for the whole family. It has been recognized as the top water park in the country for seven consecutive years. There’s also the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Park in Stonewall, which features the reconstructed childhood home and final resting place of the President. Down the road in Fredericksburg, you’ll find the National Museum of the Pacific War, which tells the story of Admiral Chester Nimitz and features displays and exhibits detailing the American and Japanese battles in the Pacific Ocean during World War II.

----
The region is also filled with heritage and historical museums, amazing underground caverns, historic structures providing a glimpse into the lives of early Texas settlers, wineries offering tours of their vineyards and wine-making facilities, wildflower and nature attractions, dude ranches that allow guests to relax or have a true cowboy experience, and plenty of venues to enjoy some quintessential Hill Country cuisine and music. 

----
Enjoy the heart of Texas and have a great time in the Hill Country!

'''Anemone''' (''Anemone'') (from the Greek  Άνεμος, wind), is a genus of about 120 species of flowering plants in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae in the north and south temperate zones. They are closely related to Pasque flower (''Pulsatilla'') and Hepatica (''Hepatica''); some botanists include both of these genera within ''Anemone''.

The meaning of the anemone flower is &quot;forsaken&quot; and also &quot;a dying hope&quot;. The flower ''Anemone'' could also be used to signify Anticipation.

The ''[[../Anemone coronaria/]]'' (&quot;[[w:he:כלנית|Kalanit]]&quot; in Hebrew) is one of the most well known and beloved flowers in Israel. During the British Mandate of Palestine British soldiers were nicknamed &quot;Kalaniyot&quot; for their red berrets.

==Description==
The plants are perennial herbs with an underground rootstock, and radical, more or less deeply cut leaves. The elongated flower stem bears one or several, white, red, blue or rarely yellow, flowers; there is an involucre of three leaflets below each flower. The fruits often bear long hairy styles which aid their distribution by the wind (&quot;windflower&quot; is a common name sometimes used for members of the genus). Stems are hairy, with an acrid sap.

==Growing Conditions==
They grow best in a loamy soil, enriched with well-rotted manure, which should be dug in below the tubers. These may be planted in October, and for succession in January, the autumn-planted ones being protected by a covering of leaves or short stable litter. They will flower in May and June, and when the leaves have ripened should be taken up into a dry room till planting time. They are easily raised from the seed, and a bed of the single varieties is a valuable addition to a flower-garden, as it affords, in a warm situation, an abundance of handsome and often brilliant spring flowers, almost as early as the snowdrop or crocus. 

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Many of the species are favourite garden plants; among the best known is ''Anemone coronaria'', often called the poppy anemone, a tuberous-rooted plant, with parsley-like divided leaves, and large showy poppy-like blossoms on stalks of from 15–20 cm high; the flowers are of various colours, but the principal are scarlet, crimson, blue, purple and white. There are also double-flowered varieties, in which the stamens in the centre are replaced by a tuft of narrow petals. It is an old garden favourite, and of the double forms there are named varieties. 

The genus contains many other spring-flowering plants, of which ''A. hortensis'' and ''A. fulgens'' have less divided leaves and splendid rosy-purple or scarlet flowers; they require similar treatment. ''Anemone hupehensis'', and its white cultivar 'Honorine Joubert', the latter especially, are amongst the finest of autumn-flowering hardy perennials; they grow well in light soil, and reach 60–100 cm in height, blooming continually for several weeks. A group of dwarf species, represented by the native British ''A. nemorosa'' and ''A. apennina'', are amongst the most beautiful of spring flowers for planting in woods and shady places.

'''Cotoneaster''' (''Cotoneaster'') is a genus of woody plants in the rose family Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to the hawthorns (''[[../Crataegus/]]''), firethorns (''[[../Pyracantha/]]''), photinias (''[[../Photinia/]]'') and rowans (''[[../Sorbus/]]'').

Depending on the species definition used, there are between 70-300 species of cotoneaster, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.

==Description==
The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5-5 m tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably ''C. frigidus'', are small trees up to 15 m tall and 75 cm trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitude (e.g. ''C. integrifolius'', which grows at 3000-4000 m in the Himalaya), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots (10-40 cm long) producing structural branch growth, and short shoots (0.5-5 cm long) bearing the flowers; this pattern often developing a 'herringbone' form of branching. The leaves are arranged alternately, 0.5-15 cm long, ovate to lanceolate, entire; both evergreen and deciduous species occur. The flowers are produced in late spring, solitary or in corymbs of up to 100 together; they are 5-10 mm diameter, and have five petals, creamy white to light pink, 10-20 stamens and up to five styles. The fruit is a small pome 5-12 mm diameter, bright red when mature, containing one to three (rarely up to five) seeds.

==Growing Conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
The species are divided into two or more sections:
*''Cotoneaster'' sect. ''Cotoneaster''. Flowers solitary or up to 5 together; petals forward-pointing, often tinged pink. Mostly smaller shrubs.
**''C. horizontalis''
**''C. integrifolius'' (syn. ''C. microphyllus'' var. ''thymifolius'')
**''C. intergerrimus''
**''C. microphyllus''
*Flowers 5-15 together in corymbs. Mostly larger shrubs.
**''C. bullatus''
*''Cotoneaster'' sect. ''Chaenopetalum''. Flowers more than 20 together in corymbs; petals opening flat, creamy white. Mostly larger shrubs.
**''C. affinis''
**''C. coriaceus''
**''C. frigidus'' - Himalayan Tree Cotoneaster
**''C. glabratus''
**''C. glaucophyllus''
**''C. harrovianus''
**''C. rhytidophyllus''
**''C. salicifolius''
**''C. turbinatus''

==Uses==
Cotoneasters are very popular garden shrubs, grown for their attractive habit and decorative fruit. Many of the garden shrubs are cultivars, some of hybrid origin; some of known parentage, others not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This account of the resurrection is the longest in the New Testament.  There are two sets of narratives between Chapters 20-21.  Each event also has a counterpart in the Synoptics.

'''Language and the Beloved Disciple in John 20'''  The situational language in John 20 seems to rule out Mary Magdalene as a possibility for the identity of the Beloved disciple.  In verse 2, the Beloved Disciple and Mary Magdalene are clearly established as separate entities.  In every gospel, including John, the discovery of Jesus' empty tomb is credited to a woman or women.  However, in all of these gospels Mary Magdalene is named.  The language used pertaining to the &quot;Beloved Disciple&quot; is John 20 puts the beloved disciple in a seeming contest with Peter (Smith).  &quot;Typically, Peter is placed in a kind of rivalry with the Beloved Disciple, in which he fares none too well, coming in a clear second (20:3-4) (Smith 374).  Peter sees the empty tomb and does not believe, while the beloved disciple does.  &quot;While Peter is said to have seen, he does not believe.  That the Beloved Disciple believes on the basis of what he has seen fits John's portrayal of him as the truthful witness (19:35; 21:24) (Smith 374).

'''Thomas in Chapter 20'''

John's unique account of Jesus' second appearance to the disciples one week after the first is important for several reasons.  First it reflects another detail unique to John and that is of the piercing of Jesus’ side.  Thomas requests to put his hand in Jesus’ side and there is some speculation that this might be a clue that Thomas is in fact the beloved disciple who was the only one in position to have witnessed the piercing of Jesus’ side, and furthermore that he might have in fact been the author of John.  Also you have Jesus knowing Thomas' request before it is ever asked of him, a clear example of divine knowledge, a phenomenon well attested not only in John but also in the synoptic gospels.  And finally you have an important theological statement by Jesus in verse 29 coupled with the profession of Jesus as “an elohim”  or specifically &quot;My adoni and My elohim!&quot; by Thomas in verse 28.  This claim of Jesus as &quot;an elohim&quot; is found only in John and has been misunderstood to teach the deity of Jesus.  That being said, this idea of Jesus as God is an extremely radical one, especially in a Jewish society in which even evoking the name of God could result in execution.  Such views have caused some to question whether John was in the mainstream of early Christianity or if he might have written a gospel considered heretical by early Jewish-Christians.  If you read Thomas' comments in the Hebrew he is not calling Jesus Lord as in Adonai, but adoni which is a tern of respect for a leader. And he is calling him an elohim which is means an agent of the high Elohim, like Moses was an elohim.

'''The Concept of Resurrection'''  During the time of Jesus, resurrection was the form that belief in the afterlife took for most of the Jews.  It was a common, mainstream understanding, and definitely not a concept unique to Jesus' situation.  If it was such a common view, many would wonder why the disciples were so surprised at the sight of Jesus, and why Thomas doubted Jesus' reality.  This is probably because there was most likely a diversity of views in the physicality of resurrection.  Thomas says he wants to touch Jesus' hands and side in order to actually, physically, feel Jesus' person.  After Jesus, the earliest Christian belief was that resurrection was expected to happen to everyone; Jesus was the first one it happened to.  

'''Reason for The Gospel of John:'''

John 20:31 gives the reason for the Gospel, saying, &quot;These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.&quot; 

Notice he does not call him God the son. Jesus is never called the Son of God. It is not required to believe he is God the son to be a believer only that you recognize him as the son of God. In fact since the gospels insist he was a real man and a so it is a grievous error to call him God the son. Throughout the Gospel of John, the author tells things from a certain perspective which seems to portray certain stories and characters in a way that may seem unjust.  This verse justifies the argument that the author may be biased.  Rather than suggesting that every word in the book is true, or that every side of an argument is represented, the verse explains that the text of this account of the life of Jesus was in fact a persuasive text, or a biased argument.  Prior to this verse, the author of the Gospel of John writes, &quot;Jesus did many other miracles that were not recorded in this book&quot; (v. 30).  The author may have picked out only the miracles which would seem to create a sense of awe for the reader.  Or perhaps listing other miracles which were not recorded elsewhere would destroy the validity of this account.  On the other hand, why would the author leave out miracles that would have helped to accomplish the goal of leading others to believe in Christ?   John 21:25 shares a reason: that &quot;if every one of them were written down, I supposed that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.&quot;  So why does the author interject this two verse segment into the end of Chapter 20, when another account of a miracle is given in the next chapter?  This may be due to a change in authorship toward the end of the book (see Chapter 21).

It is obvious that the author of John took a lot of time in the arrangement of this book. He did do so in order &quot;that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.&quot; (John 20:31 NAS) Throughout the gospel of John this theme of bringing his readers to faith in Jesus as the Messiah and then redefining Him as the Son of God is very prevalent (1:7, 12; 3:15; 11:26, 14:1; 17:20; 19:35). For instance the word &quot;believe&quot; is used 98 times . Since each book has been so carefully collected the Evangelists in the synoptics have different purposes in the retelling of the passion story. In John, there is an emphasis on doubt which the entire community takes part in. Jesus, throughout the gospel, performs signs so that all of those who were in unbelief would believe and become witnesses.(6:29, 10:38, 20:8) With that said, when Thomas does not believe that Jesus had been resurrected it is no surprise to the reader. The author has already presented us with so much doubt in the gospel, including from the disciples, that this is familiar. However, this is done so that the story is influential and persuasive to the reader so that they may believe.

The purpose of verse 30 and 31 is to convince people to believe.  John's purpose is not just a profession of faith, but also the experience of eternal life. Eternal life begins the moment relationship with God through Christ begins.  After we have met the Risen Christ and as we study and reflect upon the God who is revealed in Christ and in Scripture, we find understanding, appreciation, and joy continually growing and unfolding through the rest of our lives (R. Hahn, 2007).   The resurrection of Jesus is significant to us because it is the reason for our faith.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Some Points of Interest in John 21'''  Peter is asked to declare his love for Christ three times, matching the number of times he denied Him before He was crucified.However, after the third denial, Peter realized that he had fulfilled Christ's prediction of his denial, and wept.  In John 21, though, we have no indication that Peter realizes the significance of the moment.  His comment &quot;I'm going fishing&quot; shows that he plans to simply return to his old life. He is being bestowed with grace and forgiveness, but seems not to recognize it. Indeed, the author even mentions Peter's hurt at being asked a third time.     

Peter also makes reference to the beloved disciple, and while doing so, adding to the possibility that a rivalry might have existed between the two.  As Jesus and Peter are walking together after Jesus has bestowed grace and forgiveness upon him, Peter turns around and makes reference to the beloved disciple walking behind them.  The beloved disciple (John) probably is just following Jesus, and was most likely uninvited on Peter and Jesus' little walk.  It is actually quite humorous when Peter notices John trailing himself and Jesus.  As he asks Jesus &quot;what about him?&quot; Jesus no doubt picks-up on his condescending tone and sets him straight. It's possible that Peter was also a little jealous of the beloved disciple. After hearing about the way he was to die, it seems natural for Peter to inquire about the beloved disciple's fate as well. Jesus dismisses the question because he knows that Peter's worrying about the beloved disciple will not lead Peter to the life of holiness that Jesus has commissioned him to live.  



'''John, are you there?'''

The authorship of the Gospel of John is questionable in the switch between Chapters 20 and 21.  The end of the previous chapter (21:29-31) seems to come to an abrupt halt, as the author declares his reasoning for the composition of the Gospel of John.  Verse 30 shares that not all of the miracles which Jesus performed are recorded.  The interjection of this verse seems unreasonable, as the next chapter contains an account of yet another miracle.  These last verses of chapter 20 seem to wrap up the book in an abrupt, yet reasonable manner.  However, the addition of Chapter 21 to John seems to come at an odd time.  Perhaps the original author did not finish The Gospel of John.  Then toward the end of chapter 21, another two verses seem to close the book once again, saying: &quot;This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down.  We know that his testimony is true&quot; (21:24).  The third person narrative seems to lead the reader to believe that the author himself did not write this. (However, if the author did write this, the third person narration would line up when compared to the idea of John being the &quot;Beloved Disciple,&quot; who is also discussed in third person).  Further misunderstanding comes when the use of the word &quot;we&quot; comes into play.  This shows that the author is no longer one person.  Perhaps a community of believers finished the book for John, adding to his credibility.  Yet once again, the narration switches back to first person in verse 25.  This verse seems to line up more with verse 30 of the previous chapter.  The author, whether or not the same author, is being redundant.  Wrapping up the Gospel two times along a similar idea causes me to question the interjection of 23 verses.  Scholars have added the language and word choice to their argument that the closing chapter of the Gospel of John came from an outside source.

'''Jesus' Conversation with Peter'''
Most of the Gospel of John is written simplistically and are based on tradition.  The conversation with Peter in 21:12-19 is much different being highly stylized and Johannine.  Jesus takes on a pastoral role for Peter.  &quot;Clearly Peter is the leading figure among the twelve in John and in the other Gospels,&quot; (Smith 395).  Jesus begins by asking if Peter loves him more than his materials such as his fishing equipment.  Another interpretation is whether Peter loves Jesus more than the other disciples.  This specific excerpt can be interpreted by whether Peter loves Jesus more than Peter loves the other disciples.  &quot;The other disciples are clearly present.  The question therefore seems to contemplate Peter's leadership or superior rank, whether during Jesus' ministry or later,&quot; (Smith 396).

'''Peter 21:15-17'''

Jesus asks in verse 15, &quot;Simon, Son of John, do you love Me more than these?&quot; Some believe that the &quot;more than these&quot; is referring to the fishing gear near by. However, others believe that Jesus is asking &quot;Do you love these disciples more than Me?&quot; And lastly, some believe that Jesus is asking &quot;Peter, do you love me more than these other disciples do?&quot; The last belief seems to have quiet a bit of irony to it. In John 13:37 Peter boasts and says &quot;I will lay down my life for you.&quot; Matt 26:33 and 14:29 are also cross references to Peter proclaiming his loyalty to Jesus. The irony behind this is that Jesus is trying to say &quot;Peter after denying me 3 times, which I foreshadowed, can you still testify that you do love me more than these other disciples?&quot; The overall message of this part of the last chapter is to show &quot;Peter’s complete restoration to a position of apostolic leadership after his threefold denial&quot; (Harris III). Three times Peter denies Christ, and three times Peter proclaims his love for the Lord and then Jesus commands Peter three times to tend His sheep. With that said, Peter's faith has been completely restored to fellowship. 

'''The Beloved Disciple'''

Again in Chapter 21 John makes reference to this mysterious figure of &quot;the beloved disciple.&quot;  Many have speculated as to the identity of the disciple, from John himself, to Thomas, and even Mary Magdalene, several possibilities have been offered.  The obvious problem with such speculation is that John apparently intended for the disciple to remain anonymous and would likely not have left deliberate clues as to his identity.  Whatever the case may be, the disciples appearance here in the questionable epilogue to John's gospel is somewhat curious.  D. Moody Smith points out that Peter is concerned with the disciple's presence as they have been shown to be rivals of sorts throughout the gospel and apparently Peter was always trying to measure up.  Jesus rebukes Peter and tells him to worry about his own discipleship and not the discipleship of others.  There is then a curious passage that seems to suggest a certain degree of unrest within the Christian community at the time relating to the time frame of Jesus' return, &quot;Jesus answered, 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.' 23 Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?'&quot;  Whether John is changing a prevalent tradition in light of subsequent facts, or if he is simply pointing out the misunderstanding is not clear and is impossible to know.  What is clear is that the early Christians in John's community seemed to have some expectation relating to the return of Jesus as being in the very near future.  

'''Symbolism:'''
It is fascinating that there were 153 fish caught in the apostles’ nets.  The significance of the number 153 is noteworthy.   Does it signify the different types of fish they caught or is it more symbolic?  The emphasis in the story, however, is purely on how many fish there were and the fact that the net did not break. On the simplest level, these details speak of the abundance that our gracious God provides and how he also enables the abundance to be received. Perhaps the number 153 relates to the &quot;apostles' mission to catch men (converts), and that is the number they were seeking?  Also the untorn net could symbolize or represent the church(New American Bible, 1174).

May I ask why you have created two pages that appear to be about the same person?  It may be that you would find reading about the [[WB:WIW|project scope]] helpful too as I am not sure how your work will relate to this - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:40, 15 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{A Beginner's Guide to D}}


== Simple Iteration: The foreach loop ==
The ''foreach'' statement provides a number of ways to iterate through an array in either direction. It takes as its arguments the name of a variable that will contain an element in the array, and the array to be traversed. It is followed by the statements to be executed. It is possible to obtain the index used to find a specific position in the array. In the following example we initialize an array of integers and iterate through it using ''foreach'' and ''foreach_reverse''. You do not need to specify a type for the ''value''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;
 
int main()
{
    int[] arr = [ 1, 3, 5 ];

    foreach (value; arr)
        writefln(&quot;foreach: value = %d&quot;, value);

    foreach (index, value; arr)
    {
        writefln(&quot;foreach: index = %d, value = %d&quot;, index, value);
    }

    foreach_reverse (index, value; arr)
    {
        writefln(&quot;foreach_reverse: index = %d, value = %d&quot;, index, value);
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

As with the ''if'' statement in previous chapters, you do not need brackets if there is only one statement following ''foreach''. It is worth noting the use of a comma instead of semi-colon between ''index'' and ''value''.

The code prints out the following:
 &lt;b&gt;foreach: value = 1
 foreach: value = 3
 foreach: value = 5
 foreach: index = 0, value = 1
 foreach: index = 1, value = 3
 foreach: index = 2, value = 5
 foreach_reverse: index = 2, value = 5
 foreach_reverse: index = 1, value = 3
 foreach_reverse: index = 0, value = 1&lt;/b&gt;
Cycling using ''foreach'' is done on a copy of the values, meaning that changes to them are not reflected in the originals. If we want to change the original array's values, that can be done by adding the type modifiers ''out'' or ''ref'' (equal to ''inout''). The first can only be written to, the second can be read and written. If you attempt to '''read''' an ''out'' variable, it will be initialized. Adding the type modifier to an array index results in a compiler error.

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
  int[] arr = [ 1, 3, 5 ];
 
  foreach (ref value; arr)
  {
      value++;
  }

  foreach (key, inout value; arr)
  {
      value += 10; // Adds 10 to value
  }

  foreach (key, value; arr)
  {
      writefln(&quot;arr[%d] = %d&quot;, key, value);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 &lt;b&gt;arr[0] = 12
 arr[1] = 14
 arr[2] = 16&lt;/b&gt;</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:18, 15 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

== John Seely Brown ==

Famous for many areas of learning and cognition from K-12 to corporate worlds.  John Seely Brown is perhaps most well known for his work on communities of practice as well as that related to situated learning and informal learning.  His book with Paul Duguid on the social life of information is a classic.  He was Chief Research scientist at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and is now a famous consultant and keynote speaker.  Brown has worked on intelligent tutoring systems in math.  He was also worked in the area of hypermedia and collaboration tools.  Recently, he has provided consulting support for the Hewlett Foundation on Open Educational Resources which are free resources in education.

He gave a talk on this topic at MIT on open content and its impact on education on December 1, 2006: http://b2e.nitle.org/index.php/2006/12/01/john_seely_brown_icampus_keynote

== Alan Paivio ==

Psychology professor from the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario (in Canada).  Paivio is famous for dual coding theory.  He conducted much research on learning strategies and mnemonics.  Dual coding theory, in effect, if we learn information visually and verbally, it is more likely to be retrieved.  Such information is not only available knowledge, but accessible.  Dual coding theory is highly related to current uses of technology in education--when we learn something with multimedia, we engage our senses and have multiple retrieval paths.  As technology becomes more mobile, wireless, collaborative, visually-rich, and ubiquitous, then learners have more opportunities top store their learning in multiple ways; and, hence, retrieve them as well.  Paivio may have developed his ideas 30-40 years ago, but they are highly relevant today.  People in introductory learning theory courses and educational psychology as well as educational technology courses, should read from Alan Paivio.

David Ausubel from the University if Illinois is famous for the ideas of advance organizers.  He believed in priming student knowledge helps learning.  An advance organizer is something that comes before instruction that helps people learn.  It might be a metaphor, a concept map, a timeline, a quote or joke, a taxonomy, a flowchart, etc.  Whatever it is, it should provide the scaffolding for later learning.  This technique is highly popular with teachers across educational settings.  In effect, Ausubel is one educational psychologist who had a deep impact in education.

== Jerome Bruner==
Jerome Bruner was born on October 1, 1915 in New York City, New York.  By the age of 2, Jerome Bruner had corrective eye surgery as a result of developing cataracts.  His educational development was hindered as a result of several relocations as a child after his father’s death at the age of 12.  His grades were such that Duke University admitted him and he eventually received his A.B. in 1937.  In the subsequent years, Bruner completed both his Master’s (1939) and Ph. D.(1941) in Psychology at Harvard University.  During World War II, Bruner was a social psychologist for the U.S. Army intelligence.   He has contributions in many fields of study.  Most notably he is consider to be a key figure in the “cognitive revolution”, but as of late he been critical of the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; and has focused more on the cultural psychology within a person’s societal and historical context.  

Jerome Bruner is currently a research professor at the New York University School of Law.

=== Educational achievements ===
* Duke University-General Education 1937
* Harvard University-A.M Psychology 1939
* Harvard University-Ph.D. Psychology 1941

As his representative books, there are The Process of Education (1960), Acts of Meaning (1991) and The Culture of Education (1996).

== Elizabeth Tisdell ==

Elizabeth J. Tisdell is Associate Professor of Adult Education at Penn State, Harrisburg.  While not commonly known as a major theorist in the area of adult learning, Tisdell recently authored “Exploring Spirituality and Culture in Adult and Higher Education” (2003).  In this, as well as her other writings, she has introduced the concept that spirituality and culture are major components in the development of adult learners.  Relying heavily on Meizrow’s transformational learning theory as well as the liberating learning premise of Paulo Freire, Tisdell incorporates the idea of spirituality, culture and gender into various adult learning theories.

=== Major Contributions to the Field of Learning ===
“A common theme is the focus of meaning-making in adult learning as intricately related to the spiritual quest of adults.” (Tisdell, 2001, p. 2)  This is the foundation upon which Elizabeth Tisdell makes her greatest contribution to the field of adult learning.   For adults, learning takes place in various forms and environments.  As a result, formal and informal learning becomes a life-long process.  Likewise, spirituality is often the driving force guiding life choices such as vocations, relationships, and cultural development.  It is through the lens of spirituality that adults view the world and their place in it.  This is the same world and environment in which life-long learning occurs.  Here an interesting web is spun between the meaning-making of adult learning and the meaning-making associated with spirituality.

Additionally, Tisdell makes a distinct connection between spirituality and cultural identity.  “Cultural identity is a psychologically central aspect of an individual’s self-concept deriving from their awareness of membership in a particular social group.”  (Tolliver &amp; Tisdell, 2002, p. 391)  More simply stated, “the term culture refers broadly to a relatively stable set of beliefs, values and behaviors commonly held by a society.” (Lim, 1995, p. 16) When considering personal authenticity, one’s culture is inextricably tied to their understanding of self.  Subsequently, “cultural identity development is coming to know self as an expression of Spirit.”  (Tolliver &amp; Tisdell, 2002, p. 390)  Tisdell contends that there is a cultural dimension to spirituality and spiritual dimension to culture.  While offering support to various other adult learning theories, these theories simply do not go far enough to include cultural identity into the equation (Tisdell &amp; Tolliver, 2001).  Inasmuch as culture informs spiritual experience, this is an unexplored area of adult development and learning.

Tisdell also made great strides in the field of adult learning by introducing a feminist pedagogy that draws attention to the role that gender plays in the classroom.  While this gender praxis may not be directly connected to spirituality in learning, it is important that educators recognize that women may have different learning needs than men.  Therefore it is necessary to validate the learning that comes from their life experiences, spiritual or otherwise, as women. (Tisdell, 1993)  Relying heavily on the liberatory pedagogy of Paulo Freire, whose work primarily has dealt with class-based oppression in education, Tisdell prefers to focus specifically on how to create environments where women (in the generic sense) can come to voice, see themselves as constructors of knowledge in an atmosphere of psychological safety that emphasizes connection and relationship, and appreciate their learning experiences.

== John Dewey ==

“John Dewey is considered by many to be the most influential education theorist in the twentieth century” (Finnan, 2006, p. 83). He has contributed seminal works in the field of psychology, philosophy and education.   Dewey is known in the education field for his ideas on experience and reflection, democracy and education, motivation of students, the nature of freedom in learning, and pragmatism.  He believed education should be active and practical; students should learn in order to help them at home, in their communities, or in their work life (Dewey 1952).  

While many agree that Dewey has made a huge impact in the education field and is still relevant today, few are able to articulate why.  Few schools resemble the schools Dewey designed in terms of their organization, or application of his teaching methods (Finnan, 2006).  Dewey’s original writings are rarely read by students, they are not even read by education students.  Many of his ideas, such as progressive education, are misunderstood by both its supporters and its opponents.  Reasons for this include his writing style and the changing of his position on many topics. (Finnan, 2006).

Dewey’s writing style can be hard to comprehend.  He takes his time expressing his ideas, and explores many related topics before completing his thought. He was also extremely prolific.  Dewey was born in 1859 and died in 1952.  In his life time he wrote nearly 700 articles and 40 books (Hill, 2006). As he matured, his beliefs and thoughts evolved, and at times, changed.  This added to the misinterpretations and misunderstandings of his work (Perricone, 2006).

Dewey’s influential works in the field of education philosophy include: Democracy and Education (1944), Experience and Nature (1929), Art and Education (1927), Art and Experience (1934) and Experience and Education (1938).   But perhaps Dewey’s theory on progressive education and the importance of experience is his most influential contribution to the field of education. “Above all, Dewey believed in the power of actual experience” (Deblois, 2002). 

This paper will discuss influences of Dewey, as well as theorist and theories that he has influenced.  This paper will also review major works by Dewey, and criticism of these works.  Because of the lasting importance of Dewey’s book titled Experience and Education, it will be discussed in detail.

=== Influences of John Dewey ===
During his formative years, John Dewey was influenced by two prominent theorists: Hegel and Darwin.  Dewey was introduced to Hegelianism by an intellect he studied under at John Hopkins University, George Sylvester Morris, a German trained Hegelian. Hegelianism is a branch of Idealism in which Hegel held “that every existent idea or fact belongs to an all embracing mind in which each idea or situation (thesis) evokes its opposite (antithesis) and these two result in a unified whole (synthesis), which in turn becomes a new thesis” (Guralnik, 1999). 

Eventually Dewey’s beliefs evolved from Hegelianism to Darwinism.  Darwinism emphasized empirical data and experimentation in the logic of knowledge. “Dewey’s idealism, with its categories of the organic whole, and development viewed as a passage from ‘contradiction’ to ‘syntheses’ gave way to the evolutionary and biologically conceived notion of growth as a process of ‘conflicts’ and resolutions’” (Perricone, 2006, p. 21). Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species” would greatly influence Dewey and his later works (Perricone, 2006).  

Dewey was introduced to the importance of the scientific method by Darwin’s works.  In, Experience and Education, Dewey states that the scientific method is an excellent way for students to learn because of its use of empirical data and experimentation in the logic of knowledge. He states that there are three reasons why the scientific method is an important method for teaching: students create a hypothesis, students then test the hypothesis and learn from consequences, and the methodology of intelligence in used since students must keep tract of ideas, activities and consequences (Dewey, 1952).

Dewey, influenced by Darwin, now sees man as adaptive and as a problem solving animal.  Dewey relates learning as an individual process intertwined and heavily influenced by the environment.  The need to survive in the environment provides the impulse, the instrumental value, to learn and to grow intellectually (Perricone, 2006).  He in heavily prejudiced by Darwin’s conceptualization of the ever altering nature of our world; Dewy believes the school’s ultimate duty is to prepare students for life, which entails constant change (Finnan, 2006).

=== John Dewey’s Influence ===
As stated before, “John Dewey is considered by many to be the most influential education theorist in the twentieth century” (Finnan, 2006, p. 83).  He is one of the founders of both pragmatism thought and progressive education (Deblois, 2002).  His influences include many of the ideas and concepts used by progressive educators and outcome based education practitioners including: outcome based education, standard based education, life-long learning, critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, and meaningful learning (Deblois).  His devotion to transforming schools into democratic institutions dedicated to addressing social inequities, and understanding how to deal with a world which is constantly changing still resonates with parents and new educators today.  Many parents want schools to challenge their children and prepare them for an unknown, changing future.  Dewey’s ideas of curriculum, teaching and school organization are still widely referenced today in education coursework.  New teachers inspired by Dewey enter into the teaching profession with hopes of changing the system.  These teachers believe in Dewey’s thoughts on how schools can initiate change and transformation in society (Finnan, 2006).

Hands-on learning program, outdoor education and community learning service programs were ideas taken from Dewey’s book Experience and Education (Deblois, 2002).    
     
Dewey founded the University of Chicago Lab Schools and his work influenced one of the oldest national school reforms models, the Accelerated Schools (Finnan, 2006). 

Many educational theorists were influenced by John Dewey.  Dewey abhorred standardized test, such as I.Q. test.  He believed these test did not reflect how learners actually learned: through experiences (Dewey, 1952).  Howard Gardner’s theory on multiple intelligences was influenced by Dewey’s work (Deblois, 2002).  

“Piaget echoed Dewey’s thoughts on experience-based conception of development through the process of equilibration” (Glassman, 2004).  Piaget’s theory on instrumentality in which individuals learn by solving problems they encounter in their environment was influenced by Dewey’s belief in the need of instrumentality to learn (Glassman, 2004).  

Coyle, Kolb and Rogers work on the development of informal education all were influenced by Dewey’s original works (Glassman, 2004).

=== Experience and Education ===
One of Dewey’s most influential works and a major contribution to education philosophy is his book titled Experience and Education originally published in 1938.  Dewey wrote this work in part because he wanted to set the record straight on his thoughts on what progressive education should be, and what it should not be.  Many criticisms of progressive education mounted, and because Dewey was one of the founders of this new education theory the criticisms were directed towards him personally. 

Critics of progressive education argued that progressive schools were given free rein in education were problematic.  One criticism was: this anything goes approach to education resulted in education chaos, in which no standards of learning were neither identified nor achieved, creating an environment counterproductive to learning.  Some traditional educators argued that progressive schools ignored significant knowledge that was essential to participating in a democratic society.  Critics also believed that progressive education instruction created habits in students which resulted in undisciplined students.  Furthermore, these undisciplined students would be unleashed into the world without the tools to continue learning throughout their lives and be unprepared to contribute to society in adulthood.  If students did not learn a common core of knowledge about our culture, country and shared history, the glue that binds and stabilizes our society would not be created, the critics argued (Deblois, 2002).  

Dewey begins the book with discussing what is required of an educational theory.  He states that many schools who practice progressive education are not applying a new theory of education; they are merely reacting against the shortcomings and criticisms of Traditional Education Theory.  In order for progressive education to be a legitimate theory, the theory must be able to stand on its own and answer questions on how students should learn, how can the teacher help the learning process, and how can new concepts of teaching and learning be applied in the real world.  A theory, he argues, should explain what must be done and how it is to be done (Dewey, 1952).

Dewey then discusses the short comings of the traditional theory of education and explains how progressive education theory can address these shortcomings and answer the questions stated above.  In short, he explains the importance of experience in the learning process and how teachers and parents can and should help guide students in the learning process (Dewey, 1952).

=== Criticisms of Traditional Education Theory ===
Traditional education, Dewey states, is primarily concerned with teaching students information and skills that have already been worked out in the past.  They assume that the future will be just like the past; therefore the skills and knowledge that were of use in the past will help students succeed in the future.  He identifies this assumption as a major flaw in traditional education.  Dewey believes the world is constantly changing, and students need to learn critical thinking skills and problem solving skills in order to deal with these changes.  Traditional education treats students as docile, non-active receptive entities that learn only from books and teachers.  Knowledge is taught as a finished product.  Students cannot learn essential problem solving skills if they are taught that all problems and answers to these problems have already been worked out (Dewey, 1952). “If we teach today as we taught yesterday, we rob out children of tomorrow” (Dewy, 1944, p. 167).

Dewey stressed the importance of active learning; students must be engaged in the learning process.  Traditional education, in which conduct is strictly enforced, automatic drills are used to transfer knowledge and students’ power of judgment and intelligence are impeded, created the wrong kind of experiences to promote learning.  They rendered the students callous of ideas and caused students to associate learning with boredom (Dewey, 1952).

=== Progressive Education ===
Progress Education Theory main tenet is that education is based on personal experiences of the learner.  Teachers are the mature person who provides guidance to the students to facilitate learning.  The instructor’s main function is to arrange for the kind of experiences that engage students and promote further experiences.  Dewy states that quality experiences are necessary.  Quality experiences are experiences that lead to more experiences; Dewey refers to these types of experiences as the experiential continuum.  Quality experiences must also lead to intellectual growth, which arouses curiosity and strengthens initiative.  Again, Dewey criticized traditional education practices because the type of experiences promoted did not lead to the continuity of new experiences or aroused curiosity or initiative (Dewey, 1952). 
 
Students should understand why they are learning.  Instrumentality of learning is paramount in progressive education.  Students should not learn in isolation.  Dewey stresses that education is a social process that everyone should participate in.  Schools should be involved in their local community so that students learn how to participate in the community. Teachers are also required to know the students in order to identify their needs and capacities so that they can arrange classroom experiences that will help the students cope with real life situation.

Teachers must recognize what surroundings are conductive to promote quality experiences.  Traditional Education did not allow teachers to affect the learning environment.  Desks were arranged in rows and students were to sit still and sit up straight. This arrangement encourages passivity in students.  Progressive education requires the teacher to arrange the learning environment to promote active student learning. Students may move around the room from work station to station, actively working on and solving problems.  The classroom setting is arranged so that students have freedom of movement.  Physical freedom of movement lends itself to freedom of intelligence. This requires teachers to put more thought into lesson planning and arranging the learning environment (Dewy, 1952).

A major criticism of progressive education is the lack of rules.  Dewey addresses this by discussing to use of rules and their function.   Teachers create rules for the students to follow, but these rules are not used as social control mechanisms as they are used in traditional education classrooms.  Teachers should not act as dictator in the classroom but as a leader of the group.   The rules are created to increase student’s freedom and limit the situations in which the teacher must exercise authority. Games have rules so that players know how to conduct the game and ensure everyone plays fair, so must the learning environment Dewey argues. The rules are also designed so as to encourage participation from all students.  
        
Dewey argues that progressive education is more democratic, more humane, has less rigid rules than traditional education.  Progressive education promotes freedom of students in both physicality and intellectually.  It encourages participation and promotes better, more enjoyable learning experiences that are more democratic; both teachers and students have influence on learning and the learning environment (Dewey, 1952).   For these reasons many individual like and are in favor of progressive education.  Then why are so few schools in the United States designed, organized or apply Dewey ideas?  Finnan (2006) states that “attitudes and beliefs become more conservative when education is seen as part of a societal threat or problem” (p. 90).  Although many educational policies are still made at the local level, the federal government, through the no child left behind act, influences standards at an unprecedented level.  These rigid standards which require students to pass standardized test create an environment which opposes progressive educational practices and theory (Finnan, 2006).

=== Summary ===
This paper has reviewed the influences of Dewey, as well as theorist and theories that he has influenced.  This paper has also reviewed the major works by Dewey, and criticism of these works.  Dewey’s book titled Experience and Education was discussed in detail and examples in how this work influenced education throughout the United States was discussed.  Although Dewey’s body of work has had a major influence on education philosophy, most schools in the United States never adopted the major tenets of his Progressive Education Theory.

== Carl Rogers ==

Carl Rogers was born January 8, 1902 in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, the fourth of six children. His father was a successful civil engineer and his mother was a housewife and devout Christian. His education started in the second grade, because he could already read before kindergarten. He got a degree in agriculture from the University of Wisconsin and later a PhD. in clinical psychology from Columbia University.  He got a faculty position at Ohio State University and later the University of Chicago.  In 1957, he landed a job as professor at the University of Wisconsin but tension in the department caused him to leave for a research position La Jolla, California in 1964 where he gave talks, provided therapy, and wrote until 1987 when he passed away. Today, with project and problem-based learning, participatory learning, constructivism, and now the Web 2.0, we can see his ideas in action.  Carl Rogers is famous for his works, &quot;Freedom to Learn&quot; and &quot;Freedom to Learn for the 1980s.&quot;  These summarize his learning theory--learning should be open, genuine, inviting, respectful, active, collaborative, and student driven.  In effect, he was a humanist who was learner-centered.  He believed that if you were free and and open to experiences, you will more likely be creative and participate productively in the world. He believed that the experience of being understood and valued gives us the freedom to grow, while pathology derives from attempting to earn others' positive regard rather than following an inner compass. With this focus, he would likely have loved Wikis, blogs, and social networking software since they allow learners to express themselves and participate in their own learning.

While his work was mainly in psychology, he had deep and lasting impact in education, such as in learner-centered and invitational learning.  We want to invite students to learn not distract them from learning.  We want to welcome in learners, not deter them or put up roadblocks.  He is a hero for many teachers, and, of course, many students.

== B.F. Skinner ==

Burrus Frederic Skinner (B.F.Skinner) also known as Fred to friends and family was born on March 20, 1904 in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania.  Skinner was the oldest of two sons and his family lived in a quaint city while his fathered work as an attorney.  As a child, Skinner enjoyed building things and working with his hands, which eventually led to him creating the Skinner Box which will be addressed further in this paper.  After graduating from high school, Skinner attended and graduated from Hamilton College in New York.  One memorable moment about Skinner’s college days was that he decided to play a hoax on his college classmates and posted around campus that the silent film star, Charlie Chaplin, would be making a special guest appearance at Hamilton College.  Although Skinner wasn't aware of it, the college president decided to attend the ceremony and invited several distinguished guests and children from the local orphanage planned to attend. Ultimately, the hoax was found out, but Skinner never was identified as the prankster.  In 1928 Skinner entered Harvard University to study Psychology and in 1931 B.F.Skinner received his Ph.D.  After receiving his doctorate, Skinner taught at the University of Minnesota and in 1948 became chairman of the Department of Psychology at Indiana University.  In 1936 Skinner married and had 2 daughters.  One daughter studied educational psychology and the youngest became an artist.  B.F. Skinner died on August 18, 1990 at the age of 86 from complications of leukemia. 

Skinner’s first published book was Behavior of Organisms.  Skinner’s philosophy was that “behaviorism is a formulation which makes possible an effective experimental approach to human behavior.” (O’Donohue &amp; Ferguson, 2001, p.56).  The belief was that behaviorism was concerned with purposive or voluntary behavior-what we can help doing rather than what we can’t help doing.  Skinner did not look within the human psyche for any of the causes of behavior.  Skinner pointed out that the social and physical conditions of our environment are critically important in determining our behaviors (neighborhoods, family, community).  Skinner believed there was no such thing as free will or individual choice.  Behavior is pre-determined by past and present events in the objective world (past events from life history and evolution). 

Skinner believed that innate hereditary factors contribute to aspects of behavior.  A term that Skinner used to reference behaviors and frequency of behaviors is operant conditioning.  “Operant conditioning (OC) occurs when the frequency of behavior changes based on the behaviors consequences” (O’Donohue &amp; Ferguson, 2001, p. 73).  Skinner created an apparatus termed a Skinner Box which is “principally a compartment with two simple mechanisms (e.g. a bar to press or a disc to be pecked and another apparatus to reward the animal for using the first apparatus-a food dispenser)” (O’Donohue &amp; Ferguson, 2001, p.73).  Skinner used the box to allow animals to manipulate devices to elicit a response from them.  Ultimately through his research and studies, Skinner was able to introduce the world to behaviorism and be identified as a leader in the behaviorist approach.

== Chris Argyris ==

Chris Argyris has made a significant contribution to the development of organizational learning, and has been called one of the single most influential scholars in the field of organizational development (Smith, 2001). Argyris is noted for explaining how the needs of the organization and the needs of the individual are related.  His conclusions are that these two sets of needs are at conflict with each other.  The individual will work to satisfy his needs first, thus making the needs of the organization secondary.  Following the lead of Lewin, Argyris has expanded the understanding of experiential learning. This paper will deal specifically with Argyris’ contribution of single-loop and double-loop learning, and how these theories translate into contrasting models of organizational learning systems. Developed with Donald Schön, these learning theories have been some of the most cited in the past thirty years. 
What Argyris would later describe as his greatest learning of “ineffective leadership” came as a Signal Corp officer during World War II (Woodell, 2003). He had recently been given an award for his leadership and was back visiting the officer that had replaced him at his command. When asked how had he really been as a leader, Argyris was shocked to hear a litany of negative comments. When another former report was asked, she confirmed what had been said. Although he was at first troubled by the comments his mind quickly started asking why there was such disconnect between what was publicly said and personally felt. This is what initiated his desire to understand his own “blind spots” which eventually turned evolved into a lifelong pursuit to understand the issue in the context of the organization and leadership and led to the development of the double-loop learning theory (Chris Argyris, 2001

== Mary Field Belenky ==
          
Mary Field Belenky is an Associate Research Professor at the University of Vermont (Belenky, Bond, and Weinstock, 1997).  She has also served as a consultant for community and educational organizations.  She began as a developmental psychologist interested in the intellectual and ethical development of women.  She worked with Carol Gilligan, a colleague of Kohlberg’s, studying people facing a serious moral crisis.  They interviewed women facing an unwanted pregnancy, using Kohlberg’s map of moral development.  Belenky became interested in gender studies when the women’s responses did not fit Kohlberg’s map.

Belenky’s major work is Women’s Ways of Knowing (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, and Tarule, 1997).  She and the other three researchers conceived of a project to study women’s educational development.  FIPSE (Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education) agreed to support a three year project.  The women interviewed 135 women at nine different sites over three years.  Ninety women were from academic institutions with varying educational philosophies and student compositions.  The other 45 were from invisible colleges-a term the researchers used to designate social agencies serving clients seeking information on parenting.  The four co-investigators met three-four days every two months to evaluate the results of the interviews.  
     
The cohort identified five different phases, what they called “ways of knowing” (Belenky, Clinchy, et al., 1997).  The first phase was silence.  Silent women were raised in neglected or abused conditions.  They know words as weapons and not as tools for communication.  To learn, they have to be shown how to do things.  The next phase was called received knowledge.  These women described their fathers as dictatorial and sometimes violent.  Like the silent women, they look to authority for right and wrong, believing there is only one right answer to a problem.  They learn by listening and absorbing knowledge.  The subjective phase women, who comprised almost half of the interviewees, listen to an inner voice.  They learn by listening, watching, and analyzing personal experiences.  They become their own authority leaving them disadvantaged in the rational and scientific world.  The next phase is procedural knowledge.  The emphasis is on skills and techniques.  These women are systematic thinkers who beat the system by excelling.  The last phase is constructed knowledge.   Women who achieve this stage integrate their knowledge with what they learn from others.  They consider everyone’s needs and viewpoints.  Belenky does not see these stages as a developmental model in the sense that Perry’s model is (Ashton-Jones and Thomas, 1990).  Evidence suggests that one does not move through all five phases.

“Feminist pedagogy focuses on the concerns of women in the teaching-learning transaction” (Merriam, Caffarella, and Baumgartner, 2007, p. 262).  Maher posits that there are two models:  liberatory and gender.  Liberatory pedagogy studies how social structures oppress through power and control.  The gender model, represented by Belenky’s studies, examines how the educational environment can best help women to learn.  Tisdell proposes a model that integrates the two.

== Jean Lave ==

Jean Lave has a strong interest in social theory and upon graduation from Harvard University from a Ph.D. program in social anthropology she began her career investigating learning activities through ethnographically-based research. This endeavor resulted in the 1991 publication of Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation, coauthored by Etienne Wenger. In this publication Lave and Wenger assert that “learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process [called] legitimate peripheral participation” (p. 29). This social pursuit of learning theory was a divergence from the traditional psychological framework and accordingly provided both individuals a degree of acclaim as learning theorists. 

Although Lave and Wenger coauthored the concept of situated learning and legitimate peripheral participation, for the purposes of this discussion I have chosen to associate the theory primarily with Lave who still champions this socially conscious postulation by asserting that “it is difficult, when looking closely at everyday activity . . . to avoid the conclusion that learning is ubiquitous in ongoing activity, though often unrecognized as such” (Lave, 1993, p. 5).

=== Elements of Theory ===

Lave believes that “the region of social theory that seems richest in clues for how to conceive of learning in social terms . . . is that of historical, dialectical, social practice theory” (1996, p. 150). The concept of situated learning postulates that cognitive knowledge acquisition must be presented from within a context specific. Accordingly, learning then becomes a social interaction or collaboration that can occur as a natural function of an activity, and therefore is generally unintentional. While situated learning defines the overall theory of learning from working within this contextual group, the functional process of the group has been defined as legitimate peripheral participation (LPP). 

=== Foundational and Elaboration ===

While “learning-transfer research had its beginnings in Thorndike’s critique of the doctrine of formal discipline” (Lave, 1988, p. 23) much of the implications for instruction technologies steams from the Vygotskian school of Russian psychology claim that “attempt to link the social and individual levels of cognition” (Hung &amp; Nichani, 2002, p. 172). Wertsch, Minick and Arns (1984) expound on this noting that “cognitive development is explained largely by what [Vygotsky] (1972) termed the ‘appropriation’ of socioculturally evolved means of mediation and modes of activity” (p. 152). 

In the early 1970s Lave began researching the informal learning by observing the lives of tailor apprentices at Vai and Gola, in Liberia, which became instrumental in forming the pretext for situational learning. “Craft apprenticeship among tailors in Liberia is a complex educational form which calls into question the school-centric, simplistic dichotomy (formal and informal education) which pervades comparative research on education” (Lave, 1982, p. 181). Traditionally apprenticeships have been view as informal education because learners develop their understanding from abstract generalizations obtained by observation, demonstration or practical application. However, “comparative analysis of apprenticeship and schooling shifts the focus from differences in the organization of teaching, to the rich variety of learning processes that are integral to every form of education” (p. 181). 

Essentially, during a long stay with the apprentices and masters of the tailor profession Lave began to understand that these individuals were not only learning a trade, but also the necessary information to participate in buying, selling, supporting oneself and family, and adhering to the criteria that would lead from apprentice to master. By watching these poor people develop into individuals making a contribution within their small community, within their own context, she began to see the intrinsic value of the apprenticeship. This is not to say that she concluded that an apprenticeship was better than a formal education but instead that there was a value to both. From this perception Lave realized that “understanding of both learning and teaching are thus problematic, inviting new analysis, which in turn requires novel analytic units and new questions” (Lave, 1996, p. 154).

Another outcropping of the tailor research projects were learning transfer experiments Lave undertook in an attempt to determine cross-cultural effectiveness of both Liberian school and tailoring practices. She chose arithmetic problems for the comparison because “arithmetic is an accepted topic for research within cognitive psychology . . . in settings other than laboratories [and] offers opportunities to compare results and raise questions about the ecological validity of experimental studies” (Lave, 1988, p. 5). Through these experiments it became clear that students of formal mathematic training were no more capable to transferring their understanding of beyond the context it had been presented than the apprentices were; in short, it appeared that all forms of learning are contextual. This was particularly important because it shifted the focus from the individuals presenting the information to the learners themselves. At the conclusion of these apprentice studies it was observed that “by combining intensive ethnographic work with formal experiments, it [was] possible to demonstrate that a traditional form of education – apprenticeship training – does teach general problem-solving skills . . . both tailoring experience and schooling contribute strongly to arithmetic problem-solving successes on unfamiliar problems” (Lave, 1977, p. 177).

Lave, Murtaugh and de la Rochga (1984) next investigated the contextual usages of arithmetic in grocery shopping and found “the context that determines which events shoppers will experience as problematic” (p. 79) because shoppers’ views the event as routine. The ensuing analysis of practical arithmetic showed “implications for theories of cognitive processing” (p. 94) further supporting the concept that learning is situated. The “evidence from the Adult Math Project suggest that, at least in the United States, schooling always teaches an ideology, but only partially and sporadically a technology, of arithmetic practice” (Lave, 1985, p. 175).

Lave suggests “that an anthropological emphasis on learning as quintessentially contextualized, socially organized, active” (Lave, 1982, p. 181) and that  “the ideology of math is a poor theory of practice because it supposes that arithmetic activity is value-free, information-seeking, factual, and an end in itself” (Lave, 1985, p. 176). In conclusion the Lave and Wenger (1991) suggest that“rather than learning by replicating the performance of other or by acquiring knowledge transmitted in instruction, we suggest that learning occurs through centripetal participation in the learning curriculum of the ambient community. Because the place of knowledge is within a community of practice, questions of learning must be addressed within the developmental cycles of that community, a recommendation which creates a diagnostic tool for distinguishing among communities of practice” (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p. 100).

== Malcom Knowles ==

One of the most significant influencers of both adult learning academics and practitioners alike is a very humble, non-assuming man by the name of Malcolm Knowles. In many circles he is referred to as the Father of Adult Learning (Bell, 1989). He would have never claimed this title for himself as he often downplayed his impact on the field of organizational learning and adult education. This American adult educator will be the main focus of this paper as we investigate the theories and practices he advocated, the influences that had an impact on his thinking, and those whom he impacted with his thoughts. 

Kurt Lewin is famous for saying “There’s nothing as practical as a good theory.” This idea actually describes Knowles contribution to the learning field quite well. The theory he advocated, known as Andragogy, was the term he used to describe how adults learn - - especially as it is contrasted with how children learn. He explained and illustrated andragogy with specific descriptions of what this theory looked like in practice. The details of this theory and the recommended applications will be covered in some detail throughout the remainder of this paper. 

One of the first major influencers on Knowles’ thinking about learning was Cyril Houle. 
Dr. Houle was a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School, Department of Adult Education where he served as Knowles’ major adviser. In Knowles’ first book, Informal Adult Education (1950) he gives a great deal of credit to Houle in the preface (p. ix): “The greatest contribution was made by Dr. Cyril O. Houle, Associate Professor of Education and Dean of University College, University of Chicago, who as a teacher guided me into advanced understanding of the theory and philosophy of adult education.”  Knowles expounds on Houle’s influence in his 1989 classic, The Making of an Adult Educator (p. 12-13):

On June 2, 1946, I was accepted into the graduate program of adult education at the 	University of Chicago and started my first class on June 6. My adviser was Cyril O. 	Houle... Houle was without question the leading adult educator in this country at the time. 	He taught only in seminars (no lecture courses), and I experienced the feeling that I was 	being treated as an adult and as a valuable resource for the learning of my peers (and for 	Houle) from the outset. I learned a great deal from the experience of my fellow students, 	who were drawn from the wide spectrum of adult educational institutions. But Houle’s 	deep commitment to scholarship and his role modeling a rigours scholarly approach to 	learning stand out in my mind as probably the most important contribution to my 	development at the University of Chicago. His attitude toward students is exemplified in 	the inscription he made in the copies of his books he sent me for years: ‘To Malcolm 	Knowles, from whom I have learned so much!’

In terms of ideas that Knowles credits Houle for influencing, he specifically refers to Houle’s (1961) The Inquiring Mind as being the source that most greatly influenced his thinking regarding self-directed learning. In Knowles’ 1975 book, Self-Directed Learning: A Guide for Learners and Teachers, he references Houle’s seven key principles for continuing learners as being particularly impactful (p. 68-69): 
# Act as though you are certain to learn.
# Set realistic goals – and measure their accomplishment.
# Remember the strength of your own point of view.
# Actively fit new ideas and new facts into context. 
# Seek help and support when you need it. 
# Learn beyond the point necessary for immediate recall.
# Use psychological as well as logical practices. 

Another contribution to Knowles’ understanding of how adults learn that came from Houle was the adult learner typology the latter deduced from his research. During the 1950s, Houle conducted investigations to determine why adults decide to continue their learning. A colleague by the name of Allen Tough from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education continued those studies over the next two decades (Knowles, 1973). Houle concluded that there are basically three types of adult learners (Ibid, p. 35-36): 

The criterion for typing the individuals into subgroups was the major conception they 	held about the purposes and values of continuing education for themselves. The three 	types are: 1. The goal-oriented learners, who use education for accomplishing fairly 	clear-cut objectives... 2. The activity-oriented, who take part because they find in the 	circumstances of the learning...   All of the activity-oriented people ... were course-takers 	and group-joiners... it was the social contact that they sought... 3. The learning-oriented, 	who seek knowledge for its own sake. Unlike the other types, most learning-oriented 	adults have been engrossed in learning as long as they can remember.

== Howard Gardner ==

Howard Gardner (1943-) is an American psychologist and educator.

Dr. Gardner is the co-director with David Perkins of the Project Zero (http://pzweb.harvard.edu/) under Harvard University. He is also involved in the GoodWork Project. (www.goodworkproject.org)

=== Major contribution ===
Dr. Gardner proposed the Theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) in his book, Frames of mind: The theory of multiple intelligences in 1983. MI has a profound influence on education thereafter. In 2005 he was selected by Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines as one of 100 most influential public intellectuals in the world.

=== Definition of intelligence ===

: &quot;An intelligence is the ability to solve problems, or to create products, that are valued within one or more cultural settings (Gardner, 1983/2003, p. x)&quot; 

THE CRITERIA FOR MI

The criteria to consider &quot;candidate intelligences&quot; (Smith, 2002): 
# Potential isolation by brain damage.
# The existence of idiots savants, prodigies and other exceptional individuals.
# An identifiable core operation or set of operations.
# A distinctive development history, along with a definable set of 'end-state' performances.
# An evolutionary history and evolutionary plausibility.
# Support from experimental psychological tasks.
# Support from psychometric findings.
# Susceptibility to encoding in a symbol system. (Howard Gardner 1983: 62-69)

According to Gardner, there are three essential elements to effective leadership.  Gardner asserts that leaders must be good with language (possessing the art of story telling), they must possess high levels of personal intelligence (interpersonal and intrapersonal), and they must be an existentialist.  

Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences establishes that all humans possess eight intelligences.

# Linguistic
# Logical/Mathematical
# Spatial
# Musical
# Bodily-Kinesthetic
# Interpersonal
# Intrapersonal
# Naturalist

== Peter Senge ==

Learning Theorist: Peter M. Senge
Vincent A. Cera ('''''Vincent, that is fine. The only requirement for our purposes is the trunk''')''
Dr. Dale Fowler
Indiana Wesleyan University
April 28, 2007

Being a baby boomer and residing in the state of Michigan from 1947 through 1985 provided me the opportunity to work for Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, Cadillac Motor Car, Uniroyal Tire, and the National Bank of Detroit—a diverse group of employers. One would be challenged to identify a theme of commonality other than they are all American based, and through 1990 were very successful in their respective industries. A review of their annual reports and strategic plans would portend a rather rosy outlook for years to come. Needless to say, all of these organizations left the twentieth century looking over their shoulders and trying to keep their heads above water.

What happened? In spite of assuming organizational longevity like many of their American counterparts, things changed dramatically as they all experienced that familiar litany of challenges: global competition, technological advances, quality improvements, changing demographics, and social structures. 

Since beginning the IWU/DOL program in July 2006, many of the research articles I have encountered have mentioned the concept of learning organizations and the role they can play in the increasingly more complex and competitive environment that organizations will encounter if they expect to survive. Synonymous and verbally joined at the hip with any writing on learning organizations was the name of Peter Senge. After listening to a DOL professor’s lecture last fall, I purchased Senge’s book, The Fifth discipline: The art and practice of the learning organization, originally published in 1990. Reading this book has resulted in my selecting Senge as the learning theorist that this paper will be based on.

=== Who is Senge? ===
Database research on learning theorists will generally not portray Senge as one of historical pillars of learning, not quite yet a candidate for the Mount Rushmore of learning theorists. However, based on how he has been lauded since 1990 and the growing cadre of supporters, critics, and the curious, it appears that he will outlast the label of “fad” author that bursts on the scene and quickly fades away. Harvard Business Review has identified The fifth discipline as one of the seminal management books of the past 75 years. In 1999, the Journal of Business Strategy named him “Strategist of the Century,” one of the 24 men and women who have had the “’greatest impact on the way we conduct business today’” (Peter Senge, n.d., para 1).

Senge is also founding chair of the Society for Organization Learning (SoL), a group of corporations, researchers, and consultants committed to “’increase our capacity to collectively realize aspirations and resolve differences’” (Peter Senge, n.d., para 1). His focus is on decentralizing the role of leadership in organizations to help people to work productively toward common goals. His work places human values at the “cornerstone of the workplace, proposing that vision, purpose, reflectiveness, and systems thinking are essential for organization to realize their potentials.” (Peter Senge, n.d., para 1).

=== What is a Learning Organization? ===
A review of literature related to learning organizations reveals that there is no shortage of definitions that describe them. Since so many of the scholars that have written on the subject seem to credit Senge with popularizing the concept of the “learning organization,” let’s note his definition first and then include a few others by way of offering a summary literature review and their nuances.

Senge (1990) submits that learning organizations are organizations where “people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire; where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured; where collective aspiration is set free; and where people are continually learning—learning to see the whole together” (as cited in Smith, Peter Senge, 2001, Learning Organization section, para 1). Examination of these words would lead many readers to characterize this definition as utopian and abstract. Senge describes himself as an “idealistic pragmatist” (Smith, Peter Senge, 2001, Peter Senge section, para 2 ). It is important to note that despite the legions of advocates and supporters that have written on the concept of learning organizations, there are skeptics and critics that question its validity. Space will be later devoted in this paper to identify the questions and concerns that exist, as well as associated myths and realities.

Watkins and Marsick (as cited in Smith, The learning organization, 2001) contend that in learning organizations the employer, along with all the employees, is involved in changing the organization collaboratively, and everyone is held accountable as they work toward shared values or principles. Pedler, Burgoyne, and Boydell (as cited in Smith, The learning organization, 2001) define a learning organization as that is continually changing as it assists employees in learning. It is not brought about simply by training individuals; it can only happen as a result of learning at the whole organization level. Lahteenmaki, Toivan and Mattila (2002) believe that a learning organization is built by “empowering employees in the development of their working context and therefore getting them committed to continuous personal development (p. 188). 

Garvin (1993) offers that a learning organization is “an organization skilled at creating, acquiring and transferring knowledge, and modifying its behavior to reflect knowledge and insights. New ideas are essential if learning is to take place” (p. 80). Batchelor (as cited in deWeerd-Nedenhof, Paritti, da Silva Gomes &amp; Pearson, 2002) contends “learning occurs when individuals obtain representations of the world through assimilating new experiences” (p. 321). This can be best accomplished through the deployment of learning tools such as job rotation, innovative process planning, and diligent project review (de Weerd-Nederhof, et al.).

Other researchers summarize learning organizations as ones that have the following characteristics.
* They provide continuous learning opportunities.
* They use learning to reach their goal.
* They link individual performance with organizational performance.
* They foster inquiry and dialogue, making it safe for people to share openly and take risks.
* They embrace creative tensions as a source of energy and renewal.
* They are continuously aware of and interact with their environment. (Calvert, et al. and Watkins &amp; Marsick, as cited in Kerka, n.d., Getting a Grip section, para 1).

Despite the lofty ideals and suppositions offered within these definitions, becoming a learning organization and sustaining the commitment to maintain momentum to remain one is daunting for most organizations. Senge (n.d.) notes that even though we may see and think in straight lines, reality is made up of circles (Learning Organizations, The Problem section, para 1). “Linear thinkers are always looking for a thing or person who is responsible. System thinkers take on greater responsibility for events because their perspective suggests that everyone shares responsibility for problems generated by a system” (Learning Organizations, The Problem section, para 1). He believes that it is no accident that most organizations learn poorly. Learning disabilities prevail in these organizations because of the way people’s jobs are designed, managed, and defined and “most importantly the way we have been taught to think and interact” (Senge, p. 18). Tragically, these disabilities generally go undetected, and to cure them they must be identified, which he does in his writings, and they are:

:a) “I am my position” (Senge, p. 18). Most people describe the tasks of their job, not its purpose. Consequently, they feel limited by the boundaries of their position. Since they will be inclined to look only within themselves, they will have only a limited sense of responsibility for the result produced when required to interact with others. This compromises the ability to assess the reasons for disappointing results.
:b) “The enemy is out there.” We tend to always want to find someone other than ourselves when things go wrong (Senge, p. 19).
:c) The illusion of taking charge. When something goes wrong or faced with a difficult problem, it has become vogue to take change. Senge suggests that “all too often, proactiveness is reactiveness in disguise. True proactiveness comes from seeing how we contribution to our problems. It is a product of our way of thinking, not our emotional state” (Senge, p. 21).
:d) The fixation on events. Most organizations see life as a series of events that always have an obvious cause. With this mindset, we can miss the long-term patterns of change and consequently never get to understand the causes of the patterns. Senge points out that most of today’s threats to our survival do not evolve from events but from gradual processes; the arms race, environmental decay, the erosions of public education are some examples that he offers (Senge, p. 21).
:e) The delusion of learning from experience. “We learn best from experience but we never really experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions. Today, organizations attempt to surmount the difficulty of coping with the breadth of impact from decisions by breaking themselves into components” (Senge, p. 24).
:f)The myth of the management team. Even though organizations are laden with turf battles, they try to maintain the appearance of having a cohesive team. Consequently, disagreements are often squelched and joint decisions are often watered down. Decisions are based on what can be lived wit. The consequence of this behavior is what Chris Argyris calls “skilled incompetence—teams full of people that are incredibly proficient at keeping themselves from learning (Senge, p. 25).

The basis for the formation of this list of disabilities took root early in Senge’s graduate school experience at MIT. It was there that his learning theory was shaped by his professors, such as Jay Forrester, a computer pioneer; David Bohm, a contemporary physicist; along with noted learning theorists like W. Edwards Deming, Paul Schön, and Chris Argyris to name a few. These names frequent the publications of Senge and their thoughts will be further developed in this paper.

In addition to being shaped by these noted individuals as a practitioner and writer on learning, his interactions with a “CEO group” that met regularly at MIT starting in the early 1980s. This group included William O’Brien of Hanover Insurance, Arie de Geus of Shell, Edward Irwin from Herman Miller, and Ray Itata of Analog Services. Involvement with this group led to work with noted organizations such as Apple, Ford, Harley-Davidson, Philips, Polaroid, and Trammel Crow.

Senge (1990) readily admits that his learning from these experiences is what shaped the development of his book The Fifth Discipline and of his passion for the practice of collective learning. In this book, Senge submits that there are five disciplines that serve as the antidote to the learning disabilities and the high mortality rate of so many organizations. The disciplines he elaborates on in his publications are: systems thinking, personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, and team learning. This paper will later address each of the disciplines, but summarily they are:

:a)Personal mastery. “The discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision of focusing our energies on developing patience and seeing reality objectively. People need to be committed to their own lifelong learning” (Senge, p. 7).
:b)Mental models. “These are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how we take action. They affect what we see and do” (Senge, p. 8).
:c)Building shared vision. “With this discipline a focus of mutual purpose is establish” (Senge, p. 9). The counterproductiveness of dictated visions is undermined through this discipline.
:d)Team learning. “This is the process of aligning and developing the capacity of a team to create the results its members truly desire through group interaction” (Senge, p. 218). It can lead to the effective mobilization of collective thinking.
:e)Systems thinking. The “essence of the discipline of systems thinking lies in the shift of mind: seeing interrelationship rather than linear cause-effect chains and seeing processes of change rather than snapshots” (Review of the Fifth Discipline, Systems thinking section,  3). 

=== Note to Dr. Fowler ===
This submission of Part I reflects my first draft to identify the “trunk” for my theorist, Peter Senge. As this paper is further developed, not only will this trunk section be enhanced, I conceptualize adding the following sections that will address who influenced Senge; a deeper dive into the essence of Senge’s five disciplines; the linkage between learning organizations and leadership; concerns and criticism about Senge’s theories; relation of learning concepts to Senge’s learning organization; who Senge influenced; and the conclusion. I welcome your comments.

== Edward Thorndike ==

Enrolled in a learning organization course, I first selected James Brian Quinn as my learning theorist (not a good selection); then Philip Candy, a good selection but not someone I felt comfortable with.  I was definitely learning who I couldn’t or didn’t want but was becoming anxious to make a final learning theorist selection.  After much deliberation, I was relieved to find that Edward Lee Thorndike had not been selected by my class peers.  So here is where I begin my quest to learn more about the gentlemen known as “one of the great learning theorists of all time” (Clark, n.d., p. 1), Edward Lee Thorndike. 

Thorndike was born August 31, 1874, in Williamsburg, Massachusetts.  Thorndike was the son of a Methodist minister and grew up in an age when “scientific psychology was first establishing its place in academic institutions” (Erika Reinemeyer, 1999, p. 1).  While attending Wesleyan University he became interested in psychology after reading William James’ “Principles of Psychology” and after graduating from Wesleyan in 1895, enrolled at Harvard to study under James (Erika Reinemeyer, 1999).  He graduated from Harvard in 1896 and received his Ph.D. in 1898 from Columbia.

He became interested in researching children and his greatest contributions to educational psychology were “largely in the methods he devised to test and measure children’s intelligence and their ability to learn” (The Psi cafe - a psychology resource site (n.d.).     

=== The theorist’s major contribution to the field of Learning ===

Thorndike’s major contribution to the field of learning and contributions to the study of psychology was his work with animals.  Through his research with animals he built devices called “puzzle boxes” (Erika Reinemeyer, 1999, p. 2). 

This experiment was performed by putting a hungry cat into the puzzle box and then observing the cat’s behavior as it tried to escape and obtain food.  When observing the cat it appeared the food was only obtained through “trial-and error”.  As the cat made successive attempts to escape, the trial-and-error behavior decreased and the cat escaped more quickly each time the experiment was performed.  The experiment was performed using multiple cats and the length of time the cats spent in the box gradually shortened.  What is this experiment trying to prove?  What does this experiment mean?  It means the cat not only knew what it had to do to escape from the box but the connection between the cat’s situation and the response that freed the cat was stamped in.  Through this experiment, Thorndike hypothesized that “certain stimuli and responses become connected or dissociated from each other according to what has been called Thorndike’s law of effect.  Thorndike stated, “When particular stimulus-response sequences are followed by pleasure, those responses tend to be ‘stamped in’; responses followed by pain tend to be ‘stamped out’,” (Erika Reinemeyer, p. 2).

Thorndike’s research formulated the founding principle of instrumental learning known as the theory of “The Law of Effect”.  The learning theory of “law and effect” represents the original stimuli and response associations and is based on: responses to a situation that are followed by satisfaction are strengthened; and responses that are followed by discomfort are weakened (Indiana University, n.d., p. 1).  These associations, or habits, become “strengthened or weakened by the nature and frequency of the stimuli-response pairings” (Tip Psychology, n.d., p. 1).  The stimuli-response theory was trial and error learning because certain responses dominate others due to rewards.  “Connectionism (like all behavioral theory) was that learning could be adequately explained without referring to any unobservable internal states” (Tip Psychology, p. 1).

Thorndike’s theory consisted of three primary laws (Tip Psychology, n.d., p. 1):
# law of effect – responses to a situation which are followed by a rewarding state of affairs ill be strengthened and become habitual responses to that situation;
# law of readiness – a series of responses can be chained together to satisfy some goal which will result in annoyance if blocked; and
# law of exercise – connections become strengthened with practice and weakened when practice is discontinued. 
This theory suggest that transfer of learning depends upon the “presence of identical elements in the original and new learning situations; i.e., transfer is always specific, never general” (Tip Psychology, n.d., p. 1). 

Thorndike was known for his book Educational Psychology first published in 1903 and later revised in 1910 which linked psychology of human nature and educational theory.  By doing so he attempted to link educational theory into four parts (Thorndike, 1910):
* a general knowledge about instincts, habits, memory, attention, interests, reasoning;
* thoughts, feelings and conduct of children at different ages
* teaching methods on perceptions, association, practice, fatigue
* differences between human beings regarding sex age, race, ancestry, and circumstances of life.

Educational theory requires the exact knowledge of the nature and amount of individual differences in intellect, character and behavior for two reasons: (1) the need to know the knowledge of the differences of individuals as well as knowledge of that type.  “Education needs knowledge of men as well as of man” (Thorndike, 1910, p. 3); and (2) studying the causes of differences, education may learn how to make people more efficient, wise, and skillful.  It therefore becomes important to know what differences in people is a result of sex, race, immediate ancestry, and maturity and which are beyond control by ordinary educational endeavors, and then further what differences is a result of training or education.

What constitutes a difference in human nature is a difference in “the amount of one thing or an aggregate of differences each in the amount of one thing” (Thorndike, 1910, p. 4).  Thorndike is adamant that to measure human nature and to make it useful in experiments the researcher must identify the “amount in question for any competent thinker, just as a useful description must identify the object in question” (Thorndike, p. 10).  This is essential so that any competent person making the same measurement gets the same result.  The measurement should be “at defined points on an objective scale, the distances of these points one from another being also defined” (Thorndike, p. 10).

Thorndike notes that the application of the principle as describe above is essential to the study of educational psychology because these types of measurements have not been adhered to in the past thus suggesting caution in trusting measurements which do not deserve trust.  “The lesson to be drawn from the contrast is that a measurement can rightly be trusted or rejected or criticized or, indeed, understood, only if the concrete reality which it describes is known.  Any numerical statement has meaning only in reference to a concrete scale and its units” (Thorndike, p. 11).

=== Who the theorist was influenced by, and How ===

Time Period 2 of “The Great Schools” was a period of time where the study of intelligence gained popularity based upon the work of William James and J. M. Cattell.  James was a psychologist and a philosopher and was considered a profound and original thinker and the most widely known of American scholars (Indiana University, n.d.).  Thorndike was a student of both these men and was influenced by their work to begin his study of intelligence. 

=== Who the theorist influenced, and How ===

David Wechsler is known for developing several widely used intelligence tests which include the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Indiana University, n.d.).

Wechsler first met Thorndike after joining the Army during World War I.  Wechsler received his master’s degree in psychology from Columbia University and while waiting to be inducted into the Army, Wechsler volunteered to score the Army Alpha test, one of two group intelligence tests developed by the Committee on the Psychological Examination of Recruits (Indiana University, n.d.).

== Albert Bandura ==

Bandura was born in 1925 in the small town of Mundare in Northern Alberta, Canada. He received his bachelors degree in Psychology from the University of British Columbia in 1949. He became a professor at the University of Iowa, where he received his Ph.D. in 1952. In 1953, he started teaching at Stanford University, where he has remained to pursue his career.

Bandura found that Behaviorism was not enough to explain humans’ behaviors. He decided to take into account the environment, behavior, and the person’s psychological processes when he looked at personality. He developed a theory called Social learning theory. This theory focuses on cognitive, vicarious, self-regulatory, and self-reflective processes in human adaptation and change.

Little known fact: Bandura is on the board of directors of the School of Education at Indiana University.

== Lewin, Kurt ==

Kurt Lewin, who died at the age of 57, was born in Moglino in the Prussian province of Posen. Being Jewish, the family was subjected to public discrimination but education was legally required for all children. Lewin's parents wanted the best education for him he was sent to live with friends in Posen to further his education. When the family relocated to Berlin, he moved with them.

Upon completing his high school studies where he had developed a love for philosophy, Lewin entered the University of Freiburg intent on becoming a doctor. After a semster, he transferred to the University of Munich and then in 1910 he went on the University of Berlin. During his education at the University of Berlin, he began his studies in psychology.

Lewin worked on his dissertation under the direction of Carl Stumpf. Stumpf was a &quot;leader in redirecting the study of man's mind from the discipline of philosophy to that of science&quot; ([[Alfred J. Marrow]], 1977, p.7)and was the developer of theories of space perception and sensation. Stumpf was a mentor to Lewin and gave him the freedom to work on his own ideas.

At the time, the study of experimental psychology was in its beginnings. While other researchers did not deny the existence of an individual's will or his emotions and their impact, it was believed that &quot;emotions were...to fluid and intangible to be pinned down by scientific analysis or by experimental procedures&quot; (Marrow, 1977, p.9). Lewin believed that psychological topics should be included in the science arena and he coupled these thoughts with those of Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer's thoughts on science and reseach deeply affected Lewin as he wrote &quot;...acknowledge the help which Cassirer's views on the nature of science and research offered...To proceed beyond the limitations of a given level of knowledge, the researcher, as a rule, has to break down methodological taboos which condemn as 'unscientific' or 'illogical' the very methods or concepts which later on prove to be basic for the next major progress&quot; (Marrow, 1977, p.9).

When World War I began, Lewin was already in the military. He had enlisted after completing his academic requirements and was on active duty during most of the war. This time in the military led to his concept of life space which Lewin studied throughout much of his life. In 1917, he published an article entitled &quot;The War Landscape&quot; in which the landscape the soldier sees changes dependent upon his needs. A soldier may have the same object during war and during peace but its use may change if the needs of the soldier change. 

Lewin's concept of field referred to the &quot;totality of psychological factors acting at any particular moment to determine a person's behavior&quot;(Sheeny, 2004, p. 139)and this concept was in line with the views of phenomenological philosopher, Edmund Husserl. Phenomenologists developed a &quot;method of inquiry based on the premise that reality consist of objects and event as they are perceived or understood in human consciousness and not of anything independent of human consciousness&quot; (American Heritage Dictionary). The war in combination with the influence of Husserl were formative to Lewins thoughts on the 'field' ideas.
Lewin was also included in the category of psychologists known as Gestalts. Gestalt psychology deals with the whole person and as such it is based on the &quot;observation that we often experience things that are not a part of our simple sensations&quot; (Boeree, 2000, p.2). Wertheimer,Kohler and Koffka were the roots of the Gestalt study with Lewin and Goldstein introducing it into other aspects of psychology (Boeree,2000).

Lewin, different than Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka, explained human behavior and what caused it. He believed human behavior was aimed toward a goal. His work included study on human needs, levels of aspiration, groups and action research. His research spanned studies on children,marriage and racial inequality.
Lewin completed his PhD at the University of Berlin in 1916, was a visiting professor at Stanford in 1932 and part of the faculty at Cornell University in 1933. He was a Professor at the University in 1935. His published works included &quot;A Dynamic Theory of Personality&quot;, &quot;Principles of Topological Psychology&quot; &quot;Frontiers in Group Dynamics&quot; and other papers complied into volumns. He never wrote a textbook as he preferred writing monographs and articles (Lewin,1935). Lewin was also involved in the establishment of the Commission on Community Interrelations, the Research Center for Group Dynamics at M.I.T. and the National Laboratories Training. His contributions to his field are well recognized today.

&lt;u&gt;'''Major Contributions'''&lt;/u&gt;
	
Jack Mezirow is a Professor Emeritus at Teacher’s College, Columbia University.  His chosen 
field of interest is adult education and adult learners.  Mezirow has written 
many articles, books, and research reports.  His two latest books include 
Transformative Dimensions of Adult Learning and Fostering Critical Reflection in Adulthood.   
He is largely responsible for the body of research that exists regarding transformation theory.  
According to Mezirow, transformation theory contains three major ideas.  The first is that 
an individual experiences a crisis and reflects on one’s own assumptions in regard to the 
crisis phenomena.  Second, the individual engages in discourse and critical self-reflection 
evaluating his or her ideas on the subject.  Third, the individual takes action regarding the 
crisis.  This action is taken based upon the reflection on assumptions that occurr in the 
previous two phases. 
 
&lt;u&gt;'''Major Influence'''&lt;/u&gt;

Mezirow has been influenced by Paulo Freire in his work with transformation theory.  
Freire, an idealist from Brazil, was exiled by the Brazilian government for his views 
on societal change and transformation in 1959.  In his discussions via books and interviews, 
Mezirow sees transformational theory as personally liberating for the individual.  The 
individual undergoes a series of transformations when confronted by a crisis and as a result 
betters himself or herself.  This idea is one that Freire shares, however personal fulfillment 
is not enough in his opinion.  According to Freirie, the individual must use his or her 
newfound learning as a means to transform society, thereby balancing the societal inequalities 
which exist.  Although Mezirow has been influenced by Freire in personal transformation, he 
would not agree with the latter’s view on quick and expedient societal change. 

&lt;u&gt;'''Critical Review'''&lt;/u&gt; 

Most of Mezirow’s career has been involved with developing, presenting, and providing evidence 
for his theory of transformational learning.  As a result, a short explanation regarding critical 
reviews of this theory will provide insight into the man himself.  Transformational theory puts 
much emphasis into the crisis phase that an individual experiences.  Critics suggest that too much 
emphasis is placed on it.  It has been suggested that greater attention be placed on the context 
in which the crisis is occurring.  Other criticisms of transformational theory suggest that there 
should be an increased role in the ways of knowing and learning a concept, and that transformational 
theory is not applicable as a guide to classroom teaching.  This last criticism is important because 
Mezirow’s focus is on adult learning.  Although his books have won the 
Frandson Award for Outstanding Publication in Continuing Education and Last Gamble on Education 
and the Okes Award for Outstanding Research in Adult Education, some theorists say that his work 
is difficult to apply to the adult classroom environment.  Finally, his theory does not stress the 
importance of relationships enough.  It is thought that relationships play such an important role 
in the life of an individual when confronting a crisis, that Mezirow should focus more on this aspect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a Request For Comments about the recent behavior of {{User|Robert Horning}}, put to the community by {{User|SBJohnny}}. All Wikibookians with something to add about this contributor's actions are encouraged to comment, but please remain [[WB:CIVIL|civil]]. While it is in the nature of this process to be critical, please try to remember that the RFC process is not meant to be a forum for [[WB:ATTACK|personal attacks]], and all should try to approach this [[WB:NPOV|objectively]].

==[[User:SBJohnny|SBJohnny]]'s Concerns==
Robert's conduct of late has been alarming, destructive, and harmful to our project, and in many cases his conduct has been quite frankly bizzarre, and not at all what I would have expected from him had you asked me 6 months ago. The questionable conduct has taken place both on Wikibooks itself and on foundation-l, which is the mailing list for discussions of wikimedia-wide issues.

On foundation-l, [a recent post of Robert's] was inexcusably inflammatory, and might even be interpreted as a [[WB:ATTACK|personal attack]] on Whiteknight (and a completely misdirected personal attack at that). This is evan more disturbing because Robert has repeatedly asserted (both here on wikibooks and in two emails to me) that getting &quot;the foundation&quot; involved in our local problems is a bad idea. I'm honestly not sure why their involvement would be bad (I personally wish we could be more of a priority for them), and I've gotten the distinct impression from those I've talked to that they don't want to get involved with us because of Robert Horning.

The problem both locally and in the wider world of Wikimedia is that Robert puts himself forward as the spokesperson for &quot;the average Wikibookian&quot; I feel rather strongly that some of his views don't reflect the community at all, but my efforts in suggesting this to him have not been taken to heart.

Localy (here on Wikibooks), he has also claimed that he speaks for the &quot;unheard Wikibookians&quot;, despite any evidence to back up this claim. This wouldn't be much of an issue (most people assume their views are common sensical), but a few days ago he threatened to use administrative tools to make his point (he also insinuated that any administrator who didn't agree with him might end up in legal trouble). 

I feel rather strongly at this point that Robert is more interested in pressing his agenda than he is in being part of a consensus driven community.

If Robert is speaking for the 'unheard Wikibookians' then I am one of them.  I see nothing in his comments that could be interpreted as being uncivil or provokative.  Maybe he has said something but I can't find any suitable reference and even if he had been uncivil or provocative then I wouldn't blame him as this has been the recent attitude by many towards him and he is merely defending himself.  Wikibooks is great because we have such differences of opinion and this discussion, quite frankly, is ridiculous.

I like this policy too. I worry that things should be specified more clearly, especially the idea of being &quot;kid friendly&quot;. Appropriate books for 12yr olds are not appropriate for 5yr olds. A wikijunior book should really pick one age range, and write books specifically for that age range. That's just my opinion, of course. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
:I agree that the audience should be well defined for Wikijunior books. Trying to write for too broad an age range is frustrating for everyone. This ''is'' covered in the [[Wikijunior:Style_Guide|Wikijunior Style Guide]]. So perhaps it doesn't need to be included here. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:55, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

:I like the policy too, too. I don't understand the point of having the text &quot;in birth&quot; in bold. Perhaps there is a reason. Perhaps stating Wikijunior is intended for audiences up to age twelve would serve the same purpose. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 06:38, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
::The reason it is in bold is because it is a major departure from the Wikijunior &quot;charter&quot; (such as it is) that was developed on Meta. I wanted to attract attention to it, but you're right, there's no need to make it bold in the final version. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:02, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

== Referendum [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikijunior&amp;oldid=836022 What is Wikijunior (836022)]==
It has been more than 1 week without discussion. I would like to submit this policy for community referendum. I would also like to use a slightly modified &quot;voting&quot; system so that people can express a range of opinions. In this system, yellows and greens represent those who favor the new policy. Grays, blues and reds represent those who do not favor the policy. Consensus is determined based on not only numbers but the strength of arguments and the level of investment or commitment of participants. The policy/guideline in question can be revised during the referendum process, but please begin a new vote once a stable negotiated version has been identified.

To respond to the referendum, please type one of the following: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Respond Advocate}}, {{Respond Favor}}, {{Respond Stand Aside}}, {{Respond Concerns}}, or {{Respond Oppose}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Include appropriate reasoning and sign your comment. 

== Decision ==

I'm closing this vote as '''accepted''' because of 100% support / favour by the Wikibooks community. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:21, 19 May 2007 (UTC) 

:{{Respond Advocate}} ''means'' &quot;I strongly support the action and would like others to support it too.&quot; Please give reasons.
:{{Respond Favor}} ''means'' &quot;I am generally in favor of this.&quot; 
:{{Respond Stand Aside}} ''means'' &quot;I do not necessarily agree, but have decided to accept the prevailing opinion.&quot;
:{{Respond Concerns}} ''means'' &quot;I have some specific concerns or reservations.&quot; Please list specific concerns. 
:{{Respond Oppose}} ''means'' &quot;I strongly oppose the action and favor keeping the status quo.&quot; Please give reasons.

===Responses===
{{Respond Advocate}} I believe that this policy is an important next step in the development of Wikijunior, and that it is appropriate and necessary to expand the scope of Wikijunior as described. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:26, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

{{Respond Advocate}} Wikijunior has some significant potential, and this proposal will help wikijunior grow. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 13:00, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

{{Respond Advocate}} I really like the idea of Wikijunior, and in fact, Wikijunior is what led me to Wikibooks in the first place.  The policy as written should help Wikijunior to grow. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 03:15, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

{{support}} Wikijunior is a great project and it deserves its own domain separate from Wikibooks in my opinion however I have no problems with this policy.  My only problem is with these silly new &quot;advocate&quot;, favo[u]r&quot; options which look very Mickey-Mousey and make achieving an agreement more difficult.  Plus &quot;favour&quot; has been misspelt :) [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:00, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
: There is now a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Respond Favour}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template as well. I'm not sure what &quot;Mickey-Mousey&quot; means. ...must be one of those 'idioms' I've been hearing about lately. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:31, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

{{Respond Favor}} Good policy. The link above is to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]], BTW - I presume that is unintended, or am I missing something? I hope that Wikijunior will be getting its own namespace soon too, as previously discussed elsewhere. Oh, and whilst I agree that &quot;favor&quot; is misspelt, I can deal with the odd bit of Wronglish now and then.

{{Respond Favour}} --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:58, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

{{Respond Favor}} I find the Wikijunior policy to be very good and decent enough to anyone who considers to edit the entries in it. Plus, as with some who said this above, would be great if it got its own namespace. The policy in my opinion also seems to be correct to the original mission of Wikijunior (by keeping the literature kid-friendly), so I fully support this! BTW sorry if I'm late on this. --[[User:Avenue of Covina|Avenue of Covina]] 02:13, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a Request For Comments about the conduct and contributions of {{User|SB_Johnny}}, put to the community by {{User|SB_Johnny}}. All Wikibookians with something to add about this contributor's actions are encouraged to comment, but please remain [[WB:CIVIL|civil]] if your comments are critical: The RFC process is intended for ''constructive'' criticism, and criticism that is not constructive will not move us foreward. While it is in the nature of this process to be critical, please try to remember that the RFC process is not meant to be a forum for [[WB:ATTACK|personal attacks]], and all should try to approach this [[WB:NPOV|objectively]].

==Why Comments are Needed &lt;small&gt;(initial opinion of [[User:SB_Johnny|SB_Johnny]])&lt;/small&gt;==
I should start by saying that I think that this RFC process would be good for the community, especially when it comes to very prominent users (like myself) whom some might be shy to be openly critical of. The reason wikis work is because wikis -- by their very nature -- encourage those with something to contribute to do so, on equal par with the &quot;experts&quot;, and I strongly believe that &quot;anyone can edit&quot; implies that &quot;all are equal&quot;.

I've been taking some beatings lately, and I really do feel them. I've been accused of using my admin tools improperly, and of playing a central part in a harmful cabal. On good days, I just feel that those criticisms are completely off the mark. On bad days, I feel guilty.

I would greatly appreciate it if my fellow Wikibookians could give me some guidance on these points. Even if you think I've been fairly good at judging what's the right thing to do, I'd still appreciate guidance about how to do things better in the future. 

Just a technical note: this page was created using {{tl|Rfc-uc}}. That template needs refining, because we need a template that encourages constructive criticism in a step-by-step manner. User Conduct RFCs aren't worth doing if there's no hope of helping the user in question become a better Wikibookian, so the template should be aimed towards helping users help other users.

==What [[User:SB_Johnny|SB_Johnny]] would like to see happen==
I'd like to feel more confident about how I approach things, or at least know how ''not'' to approach things in the future.

===Users who support this viewpoint===

=== [[User:Panic2k4]]'s viewpoint===
Conversations outside of any Wikiproject should not be the bases to form judgments, come to final conclusions or be used to gather support against a person that is not present or as a way to split or divide the community, not to help to cover actions or reinforce statement made by another user that wishes to remain anonymous or just lacks the backbone to commit to them himself. Any conversation or ideas expressed outside of the site should not be used to justify or serve as a bases to any on site action and mention of them should be actively avoided, they are not part of the public record, verifiable or even authenticated by the community or the project. 

Wikibooks constitutes a social network of voluntaries, most are here to be productive and generate content, others may be here just to give an helping hand from time to time and some may even be making an extra personal effort to be able to participate  on it, antagonizing, discrediting or in any way degrade or excluding users should be activity avoided, some of the actions may not constitute acting on bad faith but the result will be he exclusion or removing other the ability to participate, freely express opinions and contribute to the project's evolution.  Communication and friendship among users is a good outcome of participation on the project, but using or even unwilling generating a split or even a group working in coordination to drive the projects evolution or removing opposing views or treat them as a barrier should be a topmost priority of any user involved on an active relations with other Wikibookians to avoid.  It should be something to avoid to even give the idea that it is going on, this is probably an harder task if the level of activity is above normal and not directed on addressing the core objective (producing content) but on shaping the project evolution by policy or self promotion, may it be organized or not the result of even an uncoordinated movement of users on that single direction should be seen as problematic and endangering the project's future.

Adminitrative actions should never be based on single admin personal judgment, we are humans and prone to errors or bad interpretations, lacking a formal policy or guideline at least a informal gathering of opinions should occur (and stated on the project as a way to evolve into a formal decission and give similar resolutions consistency in the future), preemptive action should be also actively avoided, Adminitrators aren't detectives nor even cops, there must be a clear call for intervention to justify any Administrative action, all users are free to comment on another's actions but Administrators should be aware that some rights granted to them can indeed cause grave damage to a Wikibookian especially if they are not provided with a way to object or address any errors.

I have avoided specific examples on propose I will not use this forum to rehash past discussions or divergences, what is stated here is my viewpoint and probably part of the justification to some actions I have fought against in the past and will fight to block in the future, as for my opposition to the recent vote I again state that I don't think SB Jhonny was, is or will act on bad faith (if not I would take a direct action), but due to events my level of thrust in the user is low, I can't be more clear about things as I have been in the past, and in regards to this particular vote my comments are not directed only to the perception of danger but on how things evolve or seem to be evolving, I know SB Jhonny needed the tools recently but what gave me the urgency to object was that it wasn't the user that requested them, the motives or the reason given to request them were not the ones I expected and would support and since the exercise isn't isolated, I saw it under a different light that started  long ago and recently on the voting of WIW, the people that activity promoted voting on a policy that was still under discussion and how it lacked the normal due process to publicize it (clearly stating 7 days limit for approval), a &quot;cabal&quot; like Robert has called it some time ago may not exist but a state were coordinated actions keep occurring in regards to policy and promotion of specific ideas is very disturbing to me, intentionally or not...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:08, 16 April 2007 (UTC)      

=== [[User:Whiteknight]]'s viewpoint ===

I disagree pretty strongly with much of what Panic has to say, although this should not be any surprise to people who know Panic and I. I won't take the time to elaborate on any of it here, mostly because i feel many of the issues panic brings up aren't on task with this RFC. 

I don't feel that SB Johnny has abused nor misused his admin tools whatsoever since his promotion. Many of the issues for which there is concern center around SBJohnny's dealings with [[User:Panic2k4]] and [[User:Robert Horning]], which most users are at least marginally familiar with. Before I say anything further, I want to make it perfectly clear that there is animosity between Rob and myself, and there is also animosity between Panic and myself. Anything I say about these two users is likely tainted because of my personal viewpoint and should be taken with a grain of salt. In Johnny's discussions with both Rob and Panic, (Rob most recently), if things have turned ugly I think it is certainly worth strong consideration that it was not the fault of Johnny. It is perhaps not admirable to be baited into such fights, but it isn't completely inconceivable that it could happen either. Especially in his dealings with Panic, Johnny has shown significantly more restraint and patience than I and a few other people have shown. Whether Panic appreciates the effort, or whether he views it as simply a slower and more deliberate form of antagonism I suppose only Panic knows for certain. 

It may be seen as suspicious, perhaps, that Johnny and I appear to be friends (or at least to be very friendly and supportive of one another), and that I have posted a glowing RFA nomination for him, and am posting a supportive comment here. The fact is that Johnny and I live in the same area , that we have had lunch together on one occasion, and that we speak together regularly via telephone. The telephone bit is mostly a matter of convenience because it is a local call and is therefore cheap (or free when I have the available cellphone minutes). I would say that I know Johnny as well or better then any other wikibookian, and it is because of my knowledge  of him that I am confident in my positive reviews of him. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:45, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

=== [[User:Herbythyme|Herby]]'s viewpoint===
OK - I am part of this community although recently I have remained on the edge and my inclination is to stay there now but...

I do think that constructive ideas may come out of this type of process and for some time now Wikibooks has been deep in inertia.  Policy discussion may be great for some but in the real world actions are required to move anything forward.  Wikibooks seems stuck in discussion rather than action.  Many years ago I ran a training session that addressed a similar problem in a very different environment.

I questioned what a climber should do when all four limbs are on the rock.  For quite sometime the climber will be safe - however eventually he will be dead.  The courage to make a move is required in order not to die.  Some one reminded me of this very recently so it had an impact as an illustration on one person at least.

Why is this relevant?  Because some of us live in a world where &quot;hanging on&quot; really is not an option and action (of almost any sort - particularly if it is potentially reversible - that luxury few of us have in the real world) must happen.  In general I don't &quot;do&quot; policy (I haven't read much of it if I am totally honest) so if that makes me a bad sysop I hope someone will tell me about it.  If I don't know what to do I ask (&amp; expect replies - so folk who do not answer me will lose my respect).  There are times I just have to get on with it and hope I get it right.  I have seen in edit summaries and in logs comments that I see as being rather pointed and aimed at me - maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong.  To be helpful to others and to be constructive is what I have sought to do and looked for in others.

Finally why is this relevant to this page - there are many differences between Johnny &amp; I but it seems there are many similarities - it appears to me that we act in the way we see as best at the time.  I hope I get right - I know sometimes I get it wrong and hope to learn.  I see Johnny as similar - not always right, not always wrong but always trying.

For your patience - thanks.  For those of you who look for other agendas, I am sorry but there are none here.  For those of you intent on looking for other meanings in my words, I haven't found them or sought to put them there.  For the cabalists, you are right but I am the only member of my cabal and always will be.  I don't have invested in Wikibooks the same as many of you so if I need to go I will (but the tools will be handed back). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:49, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

=== [[User:Robert Horning|Robert Horning]]'s viewpoint ===

While I will openly admit that I have not been getting along with Johnny, I don't really understand the purpose of re-opening this festering wound in our community and holding this round of comments.  I know Panic is trying to prove a point here by going through this process but I think it is largely unnecessary.

Besides the feuding flamefests on talk pages that I have engaged with Johnny over, we really haven't been fighting each other in terms of actual edit conflicts or even have engaged each other with wheel warring either.  Quite a bit of bluster has been shown, but nothing substantive that I've seen that shows any real conflict.  And while feelings can get hurt on the various talk pages, in some ways it is better that we get everything out in the open for everybody to see what is going on.

If Johnny refuses to respond to this RfC, I would actually support such action (or inaction).  There is nothing that will change in terms of his status on Wikibooks, nor do I see any real positive outcome for any such discussion that was not already covered in the previous arbitration between Johnny and Panic.  From my perspective, it perhaps would be better to encourage some disengagement and to allow some cooling off time for all of the emotions that have been vented lately.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:27, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

=== [[User:Xania|Xania]]'s viewpoint ===

I refuse to take part in such a debate even if it was initiated by the party concerned.  We should address our issues directly with those concerned and not encourage a circus like this.

      <comment>/* 6. With a partner set up a track and trail course covering at least one mile (1.6  km) which will include at least four change-of-directions utilizing traditional native signs and have at least two</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|2|2001|Nature|General Conference}}
==1. Have the Animal Tracking Honor.==
{{ay_prerequisite|Nature|Animal Tracking}}

==2. What is the difference between positive and negative casts of animal tracks?==
When the first cast of an animal track is made by pouring the casting material into the track, the result is a negative cast.  It is called a negative cast, because rather than looking like the animal's track, it takes the shape of the animal's foot which made the track.  A positive cast can be made by casting a negative track, and the result looks like the track left by the animal.

==3. Make at least one positive cast from a negative cast or rubber mold.==
To make a positive cast from a negative cast, you will need a container at least the same size as the animal track.  Lubricate the negative cast with petroleum jelly so that it does not stick to the positive cast.  Then mix up some plaster, pour it into the container, and place the negative cast on top of the plaster.  Press it in and vibrate it so that all the air pockets are removed and all the spaces filled.  Leave it alone while it sets.  If it was lubricated sufficiently, the casts should come apart easily after the plaster sets.

==4. What is scatology and why is it important in the study of animals?==
Scatology is the study of feces. Scatological studies allow one to determine a wide range of biological information about a creature, including its diet (and thus where it has been), healthiness, and diseases such as tapeworms.  Animal feces dries, cools, and decays as it ages, so it can also tell the careful observer how long ago the animal was present.  The presence (or absence) and type of insects &quot;feasting&quot; on scat is another important clue to when it was deposited.

==5. Find at least one trace of an animal other than its tracks. Through careful observation and/or analysis determine as many conclusions as possible from the evidence.==
;Scat: As discussed in the previous requirement, scat can tell many things about an animal.
;Fur, feathers, skin, and antlers: Animals sometimes leaves bits of themselves behind.  Birds drop feathers when they molt, or when they are torn from them by a predator.  Egg shells are kicked from nests.  Animals catch their fur in trees and thorns.  Snakes and other reptiles shed their skin, and deer and moose shed their antlers in the fall after the rut.
;Cuttings: Cuttings are things such as acorn shells which have been nibbled on. Deer and squirrel often leave them behind.
;Scratches on trees: Bears, members of the cat family, and other predators will sharpen their claws on tree trunks. Sometimes they will do this to mark their territory.
;Scent Posts: Many animals mark their territory by urinating on trees or other prominent items. If you are walking through the woods and smell a strong musky odor, look around — you may find other sign.
;Carcasses: A half eaten carcass must have been eaten by ''something''!  Large predators sometimes eat their meals infrequently, so when they bring down large prey, they will gorge themselves on it to the point where their stomachs will take no more.  They will sometimes hide the rest, or rest nearby while they digest what they have eaten, and then come back for more.  If you find a half-eaten carcass, be careful - it's owner may be near by and will ''not'' want you to disturb it.

==6. With a partner set up a track and trail course covering at least one mile (1.6  km) which will include at least four change-of-directions utilizing traditional native signs and have at least two other persons successfully follow the route. Successfully follow a one mile (1.6 km) route set by someone else. ==
Here are a few traditional markers constructed with rocks.  Note that the &quot;turn&quot; markers are constructed so that the smaller rock on the ground points in the direction of the trail.

**Introduced by Halsted in 1894
**En bloc removal of the breast, overlying skin, pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and Level I, II, and III lymph nodes
**Typically requires a skin graft. Long thoracic and thoracodorsal nerves sacrificed, leading to atrophy of serratus anterior and latissiumus dorsi
**Improved local control, but poor survival
**Currently no absolute indications for this procedure
*'''Extended radical mastectomy'''
**Introduced in an effort for improved loco-regional control based on Halsted's progression of breast cancer
**Radical mastectomy + dissection of axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and 2nd-4th intercostal spaces
**Currently not used
*'''Modified Radical Mastectomy'''
**Complete removal of breast tissue, pectoralis major fascia, and Level I and II lymph nodes. Preserves pectoralis minor.
**Intercostal brachial nerve sacrified, leading to numbness in medial aspect of upper arm
**Survival equivalent to radical mastectomy
*'''Total Mastectomy (Simple Mastectomy)'''
**Removal of breast tissue only. Preservation of both pectoralis muscles and axillary lymph nodes
**More commonly used with sentinel lymph node biopsy
*'''Skin-Sparing Mastectomy'''
**Resection of biopsy scar, skin overlying the tumor, and removal of breast parenchyma. Preservation of majority of breast skin for reconstruction
**Comparable recurrence rates, as long as all breast parenchyma is removed
*'''Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy'''
**Skin-sparing mastectomy with preservation of the nipple-areola complex
**Used in patients with peripheral and small tumors
*'''Quadrantectomy'''
**Complete removal of primary carcinoma, with 1.5-2.0 cm surgical margin. Portions of the overlying skin and deep muscular fascia also removed
**Used in the pivotal Milan trial of radical mastectomy vs. BCS
*'''Partial Mastectomy'''
*'''Lumpectomy'''
*'''Wide Local Excision'''


*Absolute contraindications to BCS
**Persistently positive resection margins after reexcision 
**Multicentric disease, with 2+ primary tumors in separate quadrants 
**Diffuse malignant-appearing mammographic microcalcifications, suggesting multicentricity 
**Prior RT to the breast or chest wall
*Relative contraindications to BCS
**Pregnancy, with possibly performing BCS in 3rd trimester and deferring RT after delivery
**Connective tissues disorders, since these patients may tolerate RT poorly
**Large tumor in a small breast, because cosmetic outcome may not be satisfactory

==More Extensive Mastectomy vs. Less Extensive Mastectomy + RT==
*'''NSABP B-04''' (1971-1974) -- radical mastectomy vs. total mastectomy + RT vs. total mastectomy alone
**Randomized, 2 separate randomizations. 1665 women.'' For further information, please see page at'' [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Early_breast/Axilla#Surgery_vs_Radiotherapy|Axilla]]
***1079 women with clinically LN-: Arm 1) radical mastectomy vs. Arm 2) total mastectomy + RT vs. Arm 3) total mastectomy alone

***No difference in DFS, RFS, DM, or OS
***Conclusion: No advantage to radical mastectomy. Also no survival advantage to removing occult positive nodes at surgery or to RT

*'''Denmark DBCG''' (1951-1957) -- extended radical mastectomy vs. simple mastectomy + RT
**Randomized. 666 consecutive patients with untreated primary breast CA randomized, 425 patients underwent surgery (majority of those excluded were not surgical candidates). Arm 1) extended radical mastectomy (radical mastectomy + dissection of axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and 2nd-4th intercostal spaces) vs. Arm 2) simple mastectomy + RT. RT given with opposing tangential fields including internal mammary LN + anterior/posterior fields to axilla supraclavicular region. Energy 180 kV - 400 kV, dose 42-45 Gy given in 6 days/week
**'''50-years; 2008''' PMID 18465331 -- &quot;Extended radical mastectomy versus simple mastectomy followed by radiotherapy in primary breast cancer. A fifty-year follow-up to the Copenhagen Breast Cancer randomised study.&quot; (Johansen H, Acta Oncol. 2008;47(4):633-8.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS ERM 1% vs. SM + RT 1% (NS); 30-year OS 11% vs. 9% (NS). 25-year DFS 18% vs. 14% (NS)
***Predictors: Stage I better vs. Stage II-III; premenopausal better vs. postmenopausal. Excess mortality due to breast CA demonstrable up to 20-25 years after primary diagnosis
***Toxicity: lymphedema ERM 12% vs. SM + RT 4%
***Conclusion: Mutilating extended radical mastectomy can be safely substituted by simple mastectomy with radiation; no difference in OS or DFS

==Mastectomy vs. BCS + RT==
*No difference in overall survival between mastectomy and breast-conservation surgery + radiation
*No difference based on the size of the tumor itself, therefore choosing mastectomy vs BCT for large tumors should be based on anticipated cosmetic outcome, not control of the cancer (based on B-06)
*Young age alone is also not a contraindication

==BCS +/- RT==
*Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Early_breast/BCT/RT_in_BCT|detailed trial information]]
*18 randomized trials performed (13 published as full results, 2 published as abstracts, 3 not published). Please note that eligibility criteria and adjuvant tamoxifen/chemo varied significantly
*Addition of RT decreases ipsilateral BCA recurrence by approximately 2/3; effect is much more pronounced in N+ patients and younger women, but persists even in low risk small widely resected tumors
*EBCTCG analysis of individual patient data from 10 trials (PMID 16360786) suggests 5-year outcome benefits:
**Overall LR: 26% vs. 7% (SS)
***If LN- LR: 23% vs. 7% (SS)
***If LN+ LR: 41% vs. 11% (SS)
**BCA mortality at 15 yrs: 36% vs. 30% (SS)
**This translates into preventing 1 BCA death for every 4 local recurrences prevented, at 15 years

==Triple Negative==
===Initial Treatment===
*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18413639 -- &quot;Breast cancer subtype approximated by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 is associated with local and distant recurrence after breast-conserving therapy. (Nguyen PL, J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 10;26(14):2373-8.)
**Retrospective. 793 pts 1998-2001 from DFCI/MGH, none received trastuzumab. Median F/U 70 months
**Used receptors to divide pts into groups modeled after genetic subtype: 
**Luminal A (ERorPR+/HER2-), Luminal B (ERorPR+/HER2+), HER2 (ERandPR-/HER2+), Basal (Triple negative)
**5-year Local recurrence: Significantly worse for triple negative (7.1%) and HER2 (8.4%) vs. Luminal A (0.8%).
**Conclusion: Triple negative subtype and HER2 type (without trastuzumab) have significantly higher risk of local recurrence.
**Comment: Possible reason given for difference with Yale series: Harvard series had more modern patients with lower overall rate of local recurrence (1.8% vs. 17% for Yale series) which might have allowed the increased risk of LR among triple negative subtype to be more easily discerned.

*'''Yale; 2006''' PMID 17116942 -- &quot;Locoregional relapse and distant metastasis in conservatively managed triple negative early-stage breast cancer.&quot; (Haffty BG, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 20;24(36):5652-7.)
**Retrospective. 117/482 triple negative patients. Median F/U 7.9 years
**5-year DMFS: triple negative 67% vs. all others (ER+ or PR+ or her2+) 82% (SS)
**5-year Local recurrence: no difference (17%)
**Conclusion: higher risk of mets, but not at higher risk for local failure

===After Recurrence===

**Retrospective. 47 IBTR specimens of patients who experienced an IBTR after conservative surgery and RT. Median F/U 7.5 years
**Outcome: After IBTR, 5-year DMFS 83% and OS 91%. By subtype, 5-year DMFS tripple negative 49% vs non-TN 91% (SS). Univariate predictors of poor 5-year outcomes: tripple negative phenotype, time-to-recurrence &lt;3 years, local recurrence
**Conclusion: Although patients experiencing an IBTR have a relatively favorable prognosis, those with IBTR events of the TN phenotype had a rather poor prognosis despite receiving standard chemotherapy

**Retrospective. Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer. 655 women, BRCA1/2 mutations, diagnosed with breast cancer, treated with BCT (n=302) or mastectomy (n=353)
**Local control: 15-year local failure BCT 23% vs mastectomy 5% (SS). For BCT patients, 30% same quadrant and same histology (true recurrence) vs 70% different quadrant and/or different histology (2nd primary), so true recurrence BCT 7% vs mastectomy 5%. 
**Outcome: Contralateral BCA 23%, same in both arms. BRCA1 had 1.8x higher risk than BRCA2. No difference in 15-year DM rate (11% vs 9%, NS), 15-year CSS (92% vs 93%, NS) or 15-year OS (87% vs 90%, NS)
**Conclusion: Similar survival, however, elevated risk of 2nd in-breast event. Contralateral cancers very common

**Screening for metastatic recurrence: if asymptomatic - routine clinic visits, no specialized testing or screening. If symptomatic (bone bain, dyspnea, jaundice, neurologic symptoms), then work-up
**Screening for loco-regional recurrence: same as contra-lateral breast
**Screening for new primary cancers: breast - incidence 0.5-1%/year (2X normal), routine annual mammograms; high-resolution ultrasound and MRI controversial; other cancers - routine, age-appropriate screening for colon and cervical cancer
**Symptom management reviewed: hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction
**Long term toxicity reviewed: osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism
**Frequency: visits every 4-6 months first year, then annually; mammograms annually; if on tamoxifen monitoring for uterine cancer


==Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence==

Epub 2010 May 13.)
**Retrospective. Data from whole breast randomized trials (PMID 15878095, PMID 16750496), 1410 women. IBTR classified as definite LR, likely LR, likely NP or definite NP. Definite LR if same quadrant, same histology, and same or higher grade. Definite new primary (NP) if different histology, lower grade and different quadrant. Median F/U 10.1 years
**Outcome: IBTR 10.6% - definite/likely LR 79%, definite/likely NP 18%. Contralateral BTR 5%. Median time-to relapse 3.4 years. Crude rates of ipsilatera new primary 1.9% vs contralateral new primary 5%
**Conclusion: Whole breast RT reduces rate of ipsilateral new primary tumors

**Analysis of NSABP B-06 reveals that IPTR is a marker for distant recurrence but is not a cause of distant recurrence. Thus, while mastectomy or RT after lumpectomy prevent the expression of this marker, they do not prevent the occurrence of distant disease.

**5-year and 10-year local failure rate was 10% and 16%. Risk of recurrence rose to be about 2%/year from 2-1/2 years to 5 years, then fell to 0.5%/year. Median time to recurrence is 38.5 months. Median time to &quot;elsewhere&quot; failures in the breast (i.e. other quadrants) was 64.5 months.</text>

==PET staging==
*'''Netherlands Cancer Institute; 2010''' (2007-ongoing) PMID 20719497 -- &quot;Detection of extra-axillary lymph node involvement with FDG PET/CT in patients with stage II-III breast cancer.&quot; (Aukema TS, Eur J Cancer. 2010 Aug 16. [Epub ahead of print])
**Prospective. 60 patients, invasive BCA, T &gt;3cm or pN+ (75%). Baseline U/S of ICV/SCV, followed by PET, before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All visually PET+ nodes or SUVmax 2.5 were regarded as metastatic. Standard RT included IM and SCV lymph node coverage
**Outcome: Extra-axillary LN+ 28% (breast 1%, pectoral 7%, IM 13%, IFC 7%, contralateral 5%. U/S found extra-axillary LN in 12% (vs PET 28%). RT treatment altered in 12% 
**Conclusion: PET may be usefula additional staging tool, with impact on adjuvant RT management


==Axilla==
===Overview===
*Historically, the axilla was managed with a full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), either as part of modified/radical mastectomy, or as part of breast conservation surgery. Axillary dissection provides both treatment and information on nodal staging
*Two Japanese randomized trials showed that Level III dissection is not necessary, as it doesn't improve outcome and may result in worse side effects
*Adequate lymph node dissection is considered to be &gt;=10 LNs
**For [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Post_mastectomy|PMRT trials]], median # of nodes removed in Danish trial was 7, while median # of nodes removed in British Columbia trial was 11
*Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been developed as a means of axillary staging patients with early breast cancer, since their risk of positive axillary lymph nodes is low, in order to decrease morbidity associated with full ALND
**Several smaller trials have shown SLN to be safe and effective. Clinical failure rate in axilla was essentially 0%
**A large NSABP B-32 trial (5611 patients) showed 97% technical success rate, and a 10% false negative rate. In these patients (98% T1-T2, all cN0), 26% had positive SLN, and of these, 38% had additional positive lymph nodes on completion dissection. Thus, 74% had negative axilla and additional 16% only had one sentinel lymph node positive 
**The ALMANAC trial showed significantly better rates of lymphedema (5% vs. 13%) arm numbness (11% vs 31%), and overall quality of life scores for SLN the groups

***5-yr OS 91.8% (ALND) vs 92.5% (SLND). 5-yr DFS 82.2% vs 83.9%. 
***Median # of nodes removed: 17 for ALND and 2 for SLND. Number of positive nodes (not including micromets) - median: 1 (ALND) vs 1 (SLND). However, 21% of ALND had &amp;ge; 3 positive LN.  Sentinel lymph node biopsy contained micromets: 37.5% (ALND group) and 44.8% (SLND). In ALND group, axillary dissection revealed additional metastases in 27.3%; 10% of ALND pts with micromets in SLN had additional positive (non-micromet) non-SLN lymph nodes.
***Conclusion: among pts with limited positive SLN disease, treated with breast conservation +/- systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival.

*'''NSABP B-04''' (Fisher), 1977 (1971-4) - radical mastectomy (including axillary dissection) vs total mastectomy (no axillary dissection) + XRT to chest wall and lymphatics.  
**1665 pts, operable, potentially curable cancer confined to the breast and axilla; nodes not fixed.  
**For clinically N+ pts, randomized to radical mastectomy vs total mastectomy + RT.  
**For clinically N- pts, randomized to radical mastectomy vs total mastectomy vs total mastectomy + RT.  Pts treated without axillary dissection or regional RT who later developed biopsy-proven axillary disease then went on to axillary dissection. These pts were not considered to have a LR (unless the nodes were unresectable, only in 1 pt).
**RT technique - dose was 50 Gy / 25 fx to chest wall, 45 Gy to SCLV and IM nodes (both @ 3cm), mid axilla boosted to 50 Gy with PAB; for LN+ pts, axilla boosted to additional 10-20 Gy by direct appositional field.
**No systemic therapy was given.
**Statistics: DFS, RFS, DDFS, OS. Local recurrence: in chest wall or scar. Regional recurrence: SCLV, subclavicular, IMN; or in ipsilateral axilla (in pts treated with RM or TM+RT). Pts who had TM alone and developed axillary recurrence that required axillary dissection were not considered to have a recurrence unless the nodes were unresectable (only in 1 pt). 
***DFS events: local, regional, or distant recurrence; contralateral breast ca, or any second primary tumor (other than a tumor in the breast); death.
***RFS events: local / regional / distant recurrence; contralateral breast event that was judged a recurrence.
***DDFS events: &quot;distant recurrences that occurred either as the first recurrence or after a local or regional recurrence, contralateral breast cancers, and other second primary cancers&quot;

Most recurrences (74%) were distant. 30% of LN- pts had a distant recurrence and 42% of LN+.  5% had local recurrence, and 4% had regional recurrence.  Note the continued relapses even after 10 years.
***''Clinically negative axilla'':
****Axillary failure rate: 18.6% of LN- pts undergoing TM without RT eventually required nodal dissection for axillary recurrence. Median time to axillary failure was 14 months.
****40% of pts treated with radical mastectomy had occult positive lymph nodes.
****Nodal recurrence as first recurrence event: 4% axillary dissection, 4% axillary RT, 6% no axillary tx

****Need for treatment of internal mammary nodes: no higher risk of distant metastases in pts with medial-central tumors (which have untreated IM nodes potentially harboring cancer cells). No evidence of beneficial effect of irradiating IM nodes.

**Conclusion: Failed to show a benefit of axillary dissection for clinically node-negative pts (compared with a wait-and-watch approach). 

*'''Institut Curie''' (France)(1982-1987) - lumpectomy + axillary surgery vs lumpectomy + axillary XRT
**Randomized. 658 pts. Clinically N0, T &lt; 3cm, randomized to axillary dissection or axillary XRT.  All patients received lumpectomy + XRT to the breast, 55 Gy + 10-15 Gy boost (total 65-70 Gy).  
***Pts randomized to axillary surgery had axillary dissection (level I and lower level II nodes inferior to axillary vein) and had XRT to SCLV and IM nodes if they had positive axillary nodes, and IM node XRT if they had a central or medially located tumor.  
***Pts randomized to axillary XRT received RT to axilla and IMN. Dose to axilla was 50 Gy; dose to SCLV and IM nodes was 45 Gy. 
***21% of the surgery group had LN+. Pts with more than one positive LN were allowed either hormonal therapy or CMF chemotherapy; some pts in XRT group received chemo. Chemotherapy in ~5% of surgery group, 3% of XRT group. Tamoxifen was allowed. Hormonal therapy given in 3-5% of patients (more in surgery group).

J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 20;24(3):337-44.
**473 pts. Women &gt;= 60 yrs, clinically node negative, operable, eligible for tamoxifen. Randomized to primary surgery + axillary clearance vs surgery without axillary clearance. Both groups received tamoxifen. Primary end point was quality of life.  Axillary staging was clinical; no sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. RT was tangents, no axillary RT.
**Median f/u 6.6 yrs. 42% had 2 cm or larger tumors. 20% of pts (of those dissected) had 1-3 LN, 8% had 4 or more LN. Largest difference in QOL was before first post-op visit. Differences disappeared by 6-12 months. At median f/u, similar DFS and OS. 2% axillary recurrence rate (same in both arms). 
**Avoiding axillary clearance leads to similar efficacy and better early QOL.

**Retrospective. Subset analysis of MIRROR trial, SN biopsy without macrometastases. 835 patients with pN0(i-), 799 patients with pN0(i+), and 958 patients with N1(mi). Median F/U 4.7 years
**Outcome: 5-year axillary recurrence pN0(i-) ~2%, pN0(i+) ~1.5%, pN1(mi) CLND or RT 1.2%, pN1(mi) SN only 6.2% (SS)
**Conclusion: Omission of cALND or RT in patients with pN1(mi) resulted in significantly higher axillary recurrence rate

==Supraclavicular/Internal Mammary==
*In patients with N1 disease (1-3 nodes positive)
**Overall SCV failure without SCR RT may be 6-9%, but isolated SCV failure without concurrent DM is only 2-3%
**Several factors appear to predict for &gt;10-15% risk of overall SCV failure: LVI+, ECE+, 2-3 involved LNs (vs 1 involved), involved Level II/III LNs (vs Level I only), &gt;20% LN+, age &lt;50, Grade III, and ER- disease
**Given that SCV recurrence salvage is challenging, it may be reasonable to offer SCV RT to these patients
**Please also see general studies in N1 section below
*NCCN Guideline (v2.2010): 
**Negative axillary nodes: whole breast RT only
**1-3 positive axillary nodes: &quot;strongly consider&quot; RT to infraclavicular and supraclavicular region (category 2B). Consider internal mammary RT (category 3)
**&amp;ge; 4 positive axillary nodes: whole breast, infraclavicular/supraclavicular RT, consider internal mammary RT (category 3)

**Outcome: LRR 14%. SCV recurrence 8.9%, but SCV recurrence without DM 2.7% (isolated SCV 1.8%, SCV + regional recurrence 0.7%, SCV + LR 0.2%).
**Predictors for SCV recurrence: LVI+ (5-year SCV-RFS 83% vs 95%), ECE+ (55% vs 95%), 2-3 involved axillary LNs (86% vs 98%), involved Level II/III LN (75% vs 94%), &gt;20% positive (82% vs 95%, p=0.051). If 2+ RFs, SCV-RFS 73% vs 97% (SS)
**Conclusion: Prognostic factors associated with SCV recurrence in N1 patients were LVI+, ECE+, &gt;1 LN+ and level II/III of involved LNs. Patients with 2+ risk factors might benefit from SCV RT

===Number of excised LNs===
*'''Quebec; 2006''' (1972-97) - PMID 16542789 &amp;mdash; &quot;The impact of the number of excised axillary nodes and of the percentage of involved nodes on regional nodal failure in patients treated by breast-conserving surgery with or without regional irradiation.&quot; (Fortin A et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 May 1;65(1):33-39.) Median F/U 5 years
**Retrospective. 1372 pts. T1-T2 node-positive, treated with breast conservation. Analysis of the 904 pts who did not receive RT to the axilla. 
**Outcome: Negative hormonal status and LF were the only factors associated with axillary failure. Trend for increased failures with extracapsular extension. Median # of nodes excised was 11 (interquartile range: 8-14). 
***''Number of nodes removed:'' No difference in axillary control for pts with complete (&gt;10 nodes removed) vs incomplete axillary dissection. 
***''Percentage of positive nodes:'' Median was 25%. For pts with 1-3 positive nodes, the median percentage was 14%, versus 60% for pts with &gt;3 positive nodes. Higher risk of axillary failure for pts with &gt;40% involvement (if 1-3 nodes are positive) or &gt;50% involvement (if &gt;3 nodes are positive). 
***''Effect of regional RT:'' axillary RT is associated with increased axillary control for pts with higher percentage of involved nodes but not for those pts with a low percentage of involved nodes. Regional control rate (includes axilla and SCLV) improved even in pts with low percentage of positive nodes. 
**Conclusion: irradiation of the axilla should be reserved for pts with &gt;40% involved nodes if there are 1-3 positive nodes and &gt;= 50% involved nodes if more than 3 nodes are positive.  Recommend irradiation of SCLV and level III of axilla for all node-positive pts.

**Retrospective. 663 patients, primarily inner quadrants, biopsy of IM nodes. If N+, RT given to IM node chain (1st-3rd intercostal spaces, anterior angled electons/photons or IMRT 50/25) and systemic treatment given.
**Outcome: positive IM node 10%. 5-year OS 95%
**Conclusion: Propose IM exploration should be part of staging

*'''Israel; 2003''' PMID 12860949 -- &quot;The role of irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes in high-risk stage II to IIIA breast cancer patients after high-dose chemotherapy: a prospective sequential nonrandomized study.&quot; (Stemmer SM, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 15;21(14):2713-8.)
**Phase II, non-randomized. 100 patients with high risk Stage II-III BCA, treated with adjuvant chemo -&gt; high-dose chemo -&gt; stem cell support, and loco-regional RT. 67 patients received IM RT with electrons, 33 patients did not due to machine unavailability in the middle of the protocol. Median F/U 6.4 years
**Outcome: DFS IM RT 73% vs. no RT 52% (SS), OS 78% vs. 64% (p=0.08). No treatment-related mortality
**Conclusion: In high risk, IM RT associated with improved DFS and borderline better OS
**Comment: Prescription depth 1cm below sternum with 9-12MEV beam may not be sufficient

*'''Fox Chase / U. Pennsylvania; 2000''' (1979-1994) PMID 10863056 &amp;mdash; &quot;Internal mammary node irradiation neither decreases distant metastases nor improves survival in stage I and II breast cancer.&quot; Fowble B et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jul 1;47(4):883-94.
**Retrospective. 1383 pts, Stage I-II, treated with lumpectomy + ALND (&gt;=10 nodes removed) + XRT. 114 pts had radiation to the IMN with deep tangents. The rest did not have IMN treated.
**Median f/u 6 yrs. No difference in 5 or 10 yr IBTR, nodal recurrence, DM, OS, or CSS in the two groups. 
**No evidence of a benefit for IMN RT for stage I-II pts in this retrospective review.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The clientupdate utility is a way to distribute new clients to machines without logging into each of them, it can also be used to update certain settings i.e. The IP address of the server that the client reports to.

==Making the new client==
First it is best to create the new client, all you have to do it log onto a machine of the right platform etc. that the new client will be distributed to and compile the client as normal for instructions.  Once you have the client set up you, copy it to another directory (i.e. /tmp/hobbit_client, you need to tar it from the lowest directory (the one that contains etc/ bin/ etc.) tar only the files you want distributed to all the other machines i.e. delete items from the logs/ and tmp/ directories and maybe some binaries, the only thing that does make clients imcompatible are the compiled binaries so you can just delete them and distribute to any and all platforms as the rest of the hobbit client is made up primarily of scripts.

The tar'd client then needs to be moved to the hobbit server to INSTALL_DIR/server/download and made accessible to hobbit (chmod), '''note: you cannot compress the client! it must end in .tar'''

==Setting up the server==
Now that you have the tar'd client that you want to distribute you must tell the server which clients need to download it.  The way this is acheived is that each time a client reports to hobbit it receives a clientversion, unless clientupdate is used this clientversion is a null value, so the client knows not to do anything.  To change this you need to alter client-local and under the platform, machine name etc. you put the clientversion you wish the client to acquire for example:

&lt;pre&gt;[rhes]
log:/var/adm...
clientversion:server_move

[hostname]
log:/var/adm...
clientversion:hobbit_server&lt;/pre&gt;

''note: you do '''not''' include the .tar at the end of the client version.''

==Just sit and wait==
After you have told the server which machines need which client and made the appropriate clients you just need to give hobbit time to report to the server and download the file, the rest is done automatically it usually takes 10-20 minutes, but I suggest you wait longer as clients report at different times, take more/less time to download the file etc. so for instance if you were changing the IP address for the server to something else and wanted the clients to reflect this fact I would recommend leaving it for approximately 1 hour before altering the server itself.  There are no guarantees that every client will be updated, it depends on the settings in client-local.cfg, permissions on the machine etc. but you should get about a 90+% success rate, the others you can alter manually and make a note so that you can work on adding them into client-local and/or alter permissions so that the client updates automatically next time.

      <comment>Bicep cannot move if upper arm is stationary, it can only contract.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Dumbbell Curls are predominately used to gain bicep muscle size.
The suggested method is 3 sets with 12, 10 &amp; 8 reps respectively.
Start with 70% of the maximum you can lift &amp; increase the amount by 5% with each new set (to a maximum of 80%)
It is a good idea to consult a personal trainer or someone with a good knowledge of the gym prior to beginning any weight training program.

==Form==
While doing Dumbbell Curls, the legs and torso should be kept as still as possible (do not lock knees) and elbows should not move around while lifting the weight. 

A suggested method for keeping near-perfect form while performing Dumbbell Curls is to stand against a wall and keep your feet, buttocks, and head touching the wall while lifting (the upper back may also touch the wall). At the same time, elbows should be kept at your sides and should not move around. One way to ensure that the elbows do not move is to keep the upper arm stationary. The only part of the body that moves during this exercise is the forearm.

      <comment>/* Nominative */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Cases are probably one of the hardest things in Croatian to get used to. It is very important to learn cases because without them you will sound horrible and people might not understand you. Learning them is hard but with a lot of practice you will get used to them.

==Cases of the Declension==
==== Nominative ====
The Nominative is otherwise known as the subject of a sentence, for example:

'''I was going home.''', ''Išao sam kući.''

'''I''' is the nominative of the sentence. When nouns are nominative, they do not change. For example, the word '''student''' will remain '''student'''.

==== Genitive ====
The genitive may denote possession of a place or object, for example:

They are from '''Pittsburgh'''.
Oni su iz '''Pittsburgha'''.

Pittsburgh was the genitive of the sentence. Pittsburgh is Pittsburgh in its nominative form, but because it was used for the genitive, an -a was added onto the end. The same happens for any masculine genitive noun. Feminine nouns such as Hrvatska (in its nominative form) will have an -e replacing the -a on the end of the noun, so Hrvatska in its genitive form is Hrvatske. 
The genitive is also used after some prepositions, like od (from), bez (without) iza (behind) etc.

The genitive is also used after &quot;here is&quot; (evo), &quot;there is&quot; (eno) and &quot;how many&quot; (koliko) after an adverb of quantity, such as some, a lot, little etc.

Here are some '''pineapples'''.
Eno nekoliko '''ananasa'''.

====Dative====
Indirect objects take the dative. The dative is also used in certain other expressions.

I gave the book '''to''' my '''friend'''. - Knjigu sam dao '''prijatelju'''.

To my friend is the dative. 
The dative also is used in prepositions such as u (in), na (on), pod (under), pred (in front of) and kroz (through)

====Accusative====
The accusative is the object of a sentence. From the earlier sentence, I was going home, I was the nominative, and home is the accusative. Masculine and feminine nouns in the singular accusative endings depend if the object is moving. If the object is inanimate like a town or house, the word doesn't change, it stays as the accusative, but if the object is moving, it will be the same as the genitive, like say that the town was moving, for some strange reason. Grad would then be grada, but since towns moving is not usual, it would usually be just grad.

====Vocative====
The vocative is used for calling people or animals.

'''Oj, Ano!''' &lt;BR&gt;
Oh, Ana!

====Locative====
The locative is used to denote certain locations, such as:


Je li profesor '''u učionici'''?&lt;br&gt;
Is the professor '''in''' the '''classroom'''?

'''U Splitu'''&lt;br&gt;
in '''Split'''


The masculine nouns end with -u when in the locative, and feminine nouns end with -i when in the locative. The main prepositions followed by the locative are &quot;in&quot; and &quot;on&quot;.

====Instrumental====
The instrumental is used to denote actions, such as:

On je pokazao '''prstom'''
He pointed '''with his finger'''

== Putting it all together ==
Below are a few examples of some nouns and how they change with what case, whether they're masculine, feminine, singular or plural. It is very hard to remember the cases and how nouns follow, so this will help to have a clearer picture of it all.

==The Process of Proteomics==

The proteome, as defined above, is extremely dynamic. Protein expression in cells can change through time based on many internal and external environmental conditions. This dynamic nature can actually be both beneficial and a potential complication. If all proteins a cell ever needed were always present, it would likely be easier to correlate genes with proteins. However, variable protein expression allows us to look at what is up and down regulated with a given set of circumstances. This is very useful in determining proteins related to and affected by diseases and conditions such as temperature or presence of certain molecules in the environment (such as lactose in E. coli with 
the &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon).

One of the important goals of proteomics as a field is to enhance understanding of the biological processes involved in protein construction and conformation.  Each protein folds into a specific shape, which directly affects its function.  Understanding how proteins fold, as well as how they interact with one another and other molecules, directly relates to understanding the biological processes occurring in cells.  However, currently there are limitations to the speed at which proteomics-related data can be retrieved and analyzed. Structure determination is often the most time-consuming process, and is usually done by [[w:en:X-ray crystallography|X-ray crystallography]] or [[w:en:Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]. Protein structure determination by NMR is relatively new, and may aid in obtaining structures for proteins which are found to be difficult to crystallize (such as those with many hydrophobic regions). There is also some work toward developing an automated process for structure determination by NMR, which if accurate would enable full characterization of proteins to be done at a faster pace than ever before.

There are many techniques used in the study of proteins, such as [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|gel electrophoresis]] , [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography|liquid chromatography]], [[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry|mass spectrometry]], etc for separating, identifying, sequencing, and determining other features of proteins. In later chapters these protocols and techniques will be discussed thoroughly to allow a better understanding of how the study of the proteome is being furthered. There are emerging visualization technologies being developed to help interpret the data for more detailed results during analysis. Protein microarrays, also described as protein chips or more specifically biochips, are techniques  in development to determine protein concentrations, especially peptides and samples in very low concentrations. Chemical microarrays are other tools being used in proteomics, and this type of microarray is used in peptide analysis, as well as analysis of other small molecules.

There are high performance imaging software and tools that allow real-time scanning of 2D gels, more specifically western blots. Even the infra-red spectrum is being used to reduce noise in imaging of gels. Top-down analysis techniques are also in development and being practiced in order to increase sample sizes for improved time efficiency in the lab. 
[[Image: SDS-PAGE_Coomasie_stained.jpg|thumb|Western Blot used for protein separation based on size]]
More proteomic technology advances include Free Flow Electrophoresis, which allow for higher affinity in size separation, and ProteomeLab’s PF2D system, which has separation based on charge and hydrophobicity. Nanotechnology seems to be very promising field to proteomics, and some scientists are producing nano-particles as labeling devices, such as SERRS tags.

One difficulty being encountered in proteomics is the study of proteins present in relatively low concentrations in a cell. Since many proteins exist in very high concentrations, their presence can mask lower-concentration proteins. Along the same lines, it is very difficult to isolate these less-concentrated proteins, as the resolution of current methods does not allow visualization of proteins below a certain concentration threshold. Methods with fairly high resolution have the problem of not being able to isolate a large number of different proteins, and need a great deal of sample preparation. The difference between the highest and lowest concentration of protein in a system, or detectable with a certain technique is known as &lt;i&gt;dynamic range&lt;/i&gt; in proteomics. Combining different techniques  with complementary strengths shows a lot of promise in proteomics studies.

Another difficulty with proteomics is the analyses of the data gathered in the proteomical study (or studies). A single computer programmed to simulate a single protein folding for a specific function can take up to thirty years. However, there are a number of efforts intended to speed up this process. One way scientists are trying to analyze the data and simulate the different proteins folding is through distributed computing. Distributed programming is essentially using many computers -- interpreting their normal idle time, in contrast to a specific programming procedure, for example, in order to characterize and analyze data that a parent computer sent them. With this process, the time required to model one protein's folding can be cut from thirty years to ten days. These and other types of improvements show great promise in furthering the study of proteins.

High-throughput analysis and tools are being used to bypass these limitations in the data collection process. Some of the limitations or bottle-necks in proteomics include large and uncurated databases, low affinity to the separation of peptides, and the many types of post translational modifications [[w:en:Post-translational_modification|(PTMs)]] of proteins that lead to much more complexity -- not only of [[w:Tertiary structure|Tertiary structure]] and [[w:Quaternary structure|Quaternary structure]], but also actions, effects, and functions of a given protein. High-throughput proteomics incorporates large scale purifications methods, such as affinity tags. Some microscale productions are being used to examine protein profiles including protein chips and microfluid separations. High-throughput prescreening techniques are being developed as well to help assure sample quality and allow for quicker results from testing, like for cancer patients.

==Bioinformatics in Proteomics==
[[Image: BlueGeneL_cabinet.jpg|thumb|A cabinet from the IBM Blue Gene L supercomputer]]
As with other subsets of biology, an increased ability to generate large amounts of data from the use of high throughput methods has led to an increased reliance on computers for data acquisition, storage, and analysis. The internet has also enabled collaboration and sharing of data that would have previously not been possible, leading to the development of large public databases with contributors all over the world. Many databases exist for protein-related information, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) which handles structure and sequence information for proteins with a determined crystal structure. Expasy is a popular and well-curated resource for proteomics databases and tools, including resources such as the Prosite protein feature and domain database, protein BLAST (Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool, for similarity searching), and structure prediction. NCBI also provides many resources for many types of data, including proteins, which are all searchable and well integrated.

As with other bioinformatics resources, &lt;i&gt; &quot;in-silico&quot; &lt;/i&gt; discovery is not meant as a replacement for lab techniques, but rather as a supplement to work done in a wet lab. For example, if a protein thought to be a transmembrane protein was analyzed with a sequence-based localization tool that agreed with the hypothesis, it would probably still be worth experimentally confirming before drawing a conclusion. However, bioinformatics tools can be extremely useful time savers, and can provide a possible place to start with experimentation, narrow down a problem domain, or provide potential solutions to problems which would be very difficult or impossible to determine experimentally, such as with protein folding. Protein folding has become a benchmark application for many supercomputers and distributed computing systems, such as IBM's BlueGene {{ref|bluegene}} and Stanford's Folding@Home project. Distributed computing makes use of many independent client nodes that connect to a master server to obtain data to process and send back results, making them well suited to use over LANs and the internet. Projects like Grid.org and Folding@Home can be run by anyone on their own computers, and currently have thousands of participants. Although folding for now is not a replacement for structure determination by crystallography, it can provide a reasonable estimate of structure which can be investigated until actual structure is elucidated.

=='''Introduction to Electrophoresis''' ==

====Definition:  e•lec•tro•pho•re•sis (ĭ-lĕk'trō-fə-rē'sĭs) n. ====
As given by American Heritage Dictionaries

1) The migration of charged colloidal particles or molecules through a solution under the influence of an applied electric field usually provided by immersed electrodes. Also called cataphoresis.

2) A method of separating substances, especially proteins, and analyzing molecular structure based on the rate of movement of each component in a colloidal suspension while under the influence of an electric field.  

===Electrophoresis Theory===
The separation by electrophoresis depends on differences in the migration velocity of ions or solutes through the given medium in the electric field. The electrophoretic migration velocity (&lt;math&gt;u_p&lt;/math&gt;) of an analyte is:

&lt;math&gt; u_p = \mu_p E&lt;/math&gt;

Where E is the electric field strength and &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is the electrophoretic mobility. 

The electrophoretic mobility is inversely proportional to frictional forces in the buffer and directly proportional to sample's the ionic charge. The forces of friction against an ion is dependent on size of the ion and the viscosity (η) of the medium. Analytes with different frictional forces or different charges will separate from one another when they move through a buffer. At a given pH, the electrophoretic mobility of an analyte is:

&lt;math&gt;\mu_p = \frac{z}{6\pi \eta r}&lt;/math&gt; 
 
Where r is the radius of the analyte and z is the net charge of the analyte. 

The differences in the ratio of charge to size of the analytes cause differences in electrophoretic mobility. Small and highly charged analytes have greater mobility, whereas
large and low charged analytes have lower mobility.

Electrophoretic mobility is an indication of speed of a given analyte in a give medium. It is the balance of electrical force that acts in favor and the frictional force that acts against the motion. These two forces remain steady during electrophoresis; therefore electrophoresis mobility is a constant for a given ion under a given set of conditions. Based on this characteristic property of ion or solute, it can be separated using electrophoresis.

===Applications of Electrophoresis===
Electrophoresis has wide variety of applications in [[proteomics]], forensics, molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology.

The common method of electrophoresis used in proteomics is Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE). PAGE is used for separation, identification, and purification of proteins. The proteins can be analyzed for information about the mass, charge, and purity. Different types of PAGE provide different types of information about the proteins. SDS-PAGE is used for separating proteins based on their molecular mass. SDS-PAGE is also used for protein identification and quantitation, identification of disulfide bonds,determination of purity of sample, and also blotting applications. Native-PAGE is used to separate proteins in their native form without denaturing. QPNC-PAGE is used to isolate active or native metalloproteins in biological samples. 2D-PAGE separates modified proteins and provide information about various modified states. 2D-PAGE and DIGE are used to study differential expression of proteins in healthy and diseased tissues. Proteins that are more abundant in disease tissue may be considered as diagnostic disease markers or potential drug targets. Since a sinle 2-DE can resolve thousands of proteins it is also used for cell map proteomics as well as for characterizing subproteomes. Capillary electrophoresis is employed for faster, efficient separation of proteins. 

Electrophoresis is also used for separation and analysis of DNA. Sequencing of DNA, analysis of PCR products, separation and estimation of the size of the DNA fragments from restriction enzyme digestion are only some of the applications. Gel electrophoresis is used in [http://protist.biology.washington.edu/fingerprint/dnaintro.html DNA fingerprinting]which has applications in forensics. Certain DNA segments are characteristic and vary from person to person. These segments are cut at recognition sites by restriction endonuclease enzymes and run on gel by electrophoresis. The position and number of bands on each lane of gel is characterestic of the DNA sample and considered as the genetic &quot;fingerprint&quot; of that sample.

&lt;big&gt;Uterine Leiomyosarcoma&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*LMS account for ~25% of uterine sarcomas, which account for ~4% of uterine malignancies
*Presentation typically with vaginal bleeding, pelvic mass, and pain
*PET/CT useful based on anecdotal evidence
*Staging: based on [[Radiation_Oncology/Endometrium#Staging|endometrial CA]]; cervical LMS is considered Stage II
*Outcome prediction
**Mayo clinic risk assessment index (age, size, stage, grade)
**Prognostic index developed for soft tissue sarcomas does not apply to LMS (PMID 10717626)
*Surgery main treatment modality 
**TAH standard component
**Lymph node dissection has not improved survival, but provides prognostic information
**Oophorectomy may not be necessary in premenopausal women, if ovaries are grossly normal
*Outcomes:
**Stage I-II LMS may be cured (15-year OS 40-50%)
**Stage III-IV LMS have very poor prognosis (5-year OS 15-30%)
*Adjuvant RT is controversial; Mayo data suggest significantly improved LC, but no impact on DFS or OS. Phase III EORTC trial in Stage I-II showed no impact on loco-regional control, PFS or OS for leiomyosarcoma (but LRR benefit for carcinosarcoma)
*Adjuvant chemotherapy is also controversial; doxorubicin-based regimens appear the most active, but have not resulted in significant survival benefit

==Localized LMS==
*'''EORTC 55874''' (1987-2000) -- observation vs. pelvic RT
**Randomized. 224 patients with high grade uterine sarcoma (leiomyosarcoma 46%, carcinosarcoma 41%, endometrial stromal sarcoma 13%), Stage I-II, treated with TAH/BSO + washings (75%), nodal sampling optional (25%). Arm 1) observation vs. Arm 2) pelvic RT 50.4/28 Field: top border L4/L5, lower border lower margin of obturator foramina, posterior border S2/S3
**'''2008''' PMID 18378136 -- &quot;Phase III randomised study to evaluate the role of adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of uterine sarcomas stages I and II: An European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group Study (protocol 55874).&quot; (Reed NS, Eur J Cancer. 2008 Mar 28 [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: LRR only observation 18% vs. RT 3%, LRR at any time 40% vs. 21% (SS); no impact on PFS or OS
***By subset: No benefit for LMS, improved local control for CS
***Conclusion: Pelvic RT improves local control but not PFS or OS for carcinosarcoma, there is no benefit in leiomyosarcoma

*'''Minnesota, 2005''' (1972-1998) PMID 15923804 -- &quot;On the apparent failure of adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy to improve survival for women with uterine sarcomas confined to the uterus.&quot; (Dusenbery KE, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;28(3):295-300.)
**Retrospective. 49 patients with Stage I-II (20 LMS, 18 homologous mullerian, 11 heterologous mullerian)
**DFS: LMS 5-years 40%, 15-years 40%; Mullerian 5-years 65%, 15-years 61%. Failures mostly distant
**Toxicity: 3 SBO, 1 sigmoid colon obstruction
**Conclusion: adjuvant pelvic RT efficacious; frequent peritoneal failures suggest role for abdominal RT; better systemic therapy needed

*'''Gustave-Roussy, 2004''' PMID 15571617 -- &quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin followed by radiotherapy in localized uterine sarcomas: results of a case-control study with radiotherapy alone.&quot; (Pautier P, Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2004 Nov-Dec;14(6):1112-7.)
**Case-control. 18 patients with chemo followed by RT vs. 16 patients RT alone vs. 2 patient no therapy
**Conclusion: Adjuvant chemo followed by RT is feasible; PIII trial ongoing in France

==Advanced LMS==
*No good chemotherapy regimens available; minimal impact on survival
*Doxorubicin-based combinations appear the most active, and are typically used as first line
*Minnesota experience with RT not particularly successful
*Search continues ...


*'''GOG, 2005''' PMID 15721421 -- &quot;Phase II evaluation of liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) in recurrent or advanced leiomyosarcoma of the uterus: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; (Sutton G, Gynecol Oncol. 2005 Mar;96(3):749-52.)
**Phase II. 35 patients. Liposomal doxorubicin 50mg/m2 IV.
**Conclusion: no benefit over standard doxorubicin

*'''GOG, 2005''' PMID 16051328 -- &quot;Phase II trial of dacarbazine, mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin with sargramostim in uterine leiomyosarcoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; (Long HJ, Gynecol Oncol. 2005 Nov;99(2):339-42.)
**Phase II. 18 patients. DMAP + sargramostim.
**Conclusion: too complex and toxic. Study closed early

*'''Minnesota, 2004'''(1978-1997) PMID 15262141 -- &quot;Limitations of adjuvant radiotherapy for uterine sarcomas spread beyond the uterus.&quot; (Dusenbery KE, Gynecol Oncol. 2004 Jul;94(1):191-6.)
**Retrospective. 19 women with advanced uterine sarcomas who received adjuvant RT. 7 adjuvant chemo. 
**Survival: 1-year 67%, 5-year 33%; failures mostly distant
**Conclusion: prognosis if spread beyond uterus is poor

*'''GOG, 2003''' PMID 12694653 -- &quot;Evaluation of paclitaxel in previously treated leiomyosarcoma of the uterus: a gynecologic oncology group study.&quot; (Gallup DG, Gynecol Oncol. 2003 Apr;89(1):48-51.)
**Phase II. 48 patients. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV
**Conclusion: modest activity, minimal toxicity

*'''GOG, 2002''' PMID 12051882 -- &quot;Phase II study of mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in the treatment of advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; (Edmonson JH, Gynecol Oncol. 2002 Jun;85(3):507-10.)
**Phase II. 35 patients, treated with MAP 1-6 cycles
**Conclusion: MAP is not remarkably active; significant (10/35) pulmonary toxicity

*'''GOG, 1999''' PMID 10479491 -- &quot;Phase II trial of paclitaxel in leiomyosarcoma of the uterus: a gynecologic oncology group study.&quot; (Sutton G, Gynecol Oncol. 1999 Sep;74(3):346-9.)
**Phase II. 34 women. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV. RT in 23%
**Conclusion: Limited activity; consider higher dose

*'''GOG, 1996''' PMID 8751554 -- &quot;Ifosfamide and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced leiomyosarcomas of the uterus: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; (Sutton G, Gynecol Oncol. 1996 Aug;62(2):226-9.)
**Phase II. 34 women. Ifosfamide + doxorubicin
**Conclusion: Toxic, with moderate activity


==All stages==
*'''Dijon, 2005''' (France) (1966-2001) PMID 15837053 -- &quot;The role of surgery and treatment trends in uterine sarcoma.&quot; (Benoit L, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2005 May;31(4):434-42.)
**Retrospective. 72 patients with uterine sarcomas (34 LMS, 25 mullerian, 12 ESS, 1 angiosarcoma). RT 55%. Chemo 37%
**5-year OS: all 36%; Stage I 47%, Stage II 60%, Stage III/IV 15%
**Conclusion: surgery main treatment. Adjuvant therapies do not decrease DM or increase OS

*'''MGH, 2004''' (1990-1999) PMID 14766261 -- &quot;The treatment of uterine leiomyosarcoma. Results from a 10-year experience (1990-1999) at the Massachusetts General Hospital.&quot; (Dinh TA, Gynecol Oncol. 2004 Feb;92(2):648-52.)
**Retrospective. 27 patients. Most treated with multimodality therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or RT)
**Sugery: if no visible disease post-op, better OS (SS)
**Adjuvant therapy: after optimal cytoreduction, no decrease in rate of recurrence
**Adjuvant chemo: minimally effective, with 80% progression of disease
**Conclusion: Deadly disease. Aggressive surgical cytoreduction should be the goal

*'''Mayo, 2003''' (1976-1999) PMID 12798712 -- &quot;Retrospective review of 208 patients with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus: prognostic indicators, surgical management, and adjuvant therapy.&quot; (Giuntoli RL 2nd, Gynecol Oncol. 2003 Jun;89(3):460-9.)
**Retrospective. 208 patients with LMS. Median F/U 7.7 years
**Worse prognosis: high grade, advanced stage, oophorectomy worse DSS
**Pelvic RT: no impact on DSS (p=0.06) in multivariate analysis. Significantly decreased LR when further evaluated as 31 case-controls (70% Stage I)
**Ovarian resection no impact on survival
**Risk-assessment index developed: 
***Age (&gt;51): 1 point; Tumor size (&gt;5cm): 1 point; Stage (II-IV): 1 point; Grade (2-4): 2 points
***Low risk = 0-1 points (n=22, no deaths, median survival &gt;25 years), intermediate risk = 2-3 points (n=53, median survival 6.5 years), high risk = 4-5 points (n=81, median survival 2.1 years)

*'''Vienna, 1999''' PMID 10419731 -- &quot;Leiomyosarcoma of the uterus: a clinicopathologic multicenter study of 71 cases.&quot; (Mayerhofer K, Gynecol Oncol. 1999 Aug;74(2):196-201.)
**Retrospective. 71 patients. Median F/U 9 years
**Predictors: age (&lt;50 better), tumor stage, LVI, mitotic count in Stage I

*'''Norwegian Radium Hospital, 1993''' (1976-1985) PMID 11578330 -- &quot;Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) of the uterus. A survey of patients treated in the Norwegian Radium Hospital 1976-1985.&quot; (Nordal RN, Int J Gynecol Cancer. 1993 Mar;3(2):110-115.)
**Retrospective. 127 patients with LMS or endometrial stromal sarcoma, 14 reclassified
**5-year OS: LMS 39%, ESS 67%
**Prognosis: grade (Grade I-II similar prognosis as endometrial carcinoma, Grade III-IV 5-year OS 33%)
**Adjuvant chemo: no clear benefit

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructional Systems Design's team approach to design is considered postmodern because it rejects the idea of a central authority. Instruction should be designed based on individual needs as individuals are viewed as decentered by postmodernists. Constructivist theory and hypertext both emphasize the individual learner. If we veiw ourselves as postmodernists, when developing instruction, we should focus on the process rather than the content or information because information changes rapidly.

Although Instructional Design is based on a scientific, systematic and quantitative paradigm, postmodernists perceive it as an art as well as a science and suggest that instructional designers become &quot;Connoisseurs.&quot;

Andrew Yeaman (1994) outlined nine ideas for postmodern instructional design:

1. Accept that there a e several workable solutions to every design problem.

2. Expect that students or trainees will interpret instruction in different ways.

3. Examine and learn from instruction that fails as well as instruction that succeeds.

4. Metaphors, symbols and models should be used cautiously.

5. Determine if technological fixes have improved problems or created more.

6. Avoid idealism that all students/trainees will have absolute correspondence in theirunderstanding - there is never a true meeting of the minds.

7. Avoid authoritarian approach - give some control to learners.

8. Look for contradictions in your messages and in other's.

9. Plan instruction based on learners' needs not just technologies.

With UNESCO's Education for Everyone by 2015 initiatives underway, this philosophy is extremely applicable, especially in terms of creating instruction across geographical, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Culture, language and societal contexts color contextual meaning. Culture not only affects how we learn, but determines how we think, and how we think about learning. As instructional designers, we need to be thinking more wholistically about the design of instruction. This is especially true as we move from local design, development and deployment to more global implementations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Known Problems with the Nighthawk 1984-1986 CB700/750S ==

Contributed by [http://users.lmi.net/gshell/nh/index.htm Greg Shell]
 
There are a few problems which seem to be fairly widespread with this bike. The following notes come from my own experience combined with info from other sources, namely mechanics, parts counter people, magazines, and other owners.

===Alternator shaft chain breaks===

The CB700SC was one of Honda's first inline-fours with the alternator (and starter) moved back onto a discrete shaft, decreasing the width of the engine. Unfortunately, the original chain driving this shaft (from the crankshaft) and/or the tensioner has a tendency to break. I understand there was an update to the chain to fix this problem, but I don't know if it made it into any production bikes. The symptoms of this problem are no charging, no useful starter (whirrrr!), and poor idle/running as the battery doesn't seem quite powerful enough when running with a &quot;total loss&quot; (no alternator/generator) electrical system.

This happened to my '85 bike. It took me quite a while to realize what the problem was and decide to fix it, five years in fact. At last I decided to return to riding, pulled the engine out (ouch!), and had a mechanic replace the chain and tensioner for about $650. I put that sucker back in (double ouch!) and now it lives again, although with more noise and vibration and oil consumption than I remember. Next time I'll follow Honda's long-term storage recommendations.

===Starter woes===

A lot of people have had starter problems. My bike has the following symptoms:

Oil in the starter motor, which tends to leak out and make a mess. I imagine this is caused by high compression in the crankcase resulting from leaky rings, possibly combined with a starter commutator shaft that's not quite in balance. I've been told there's a seal that can be replaced for this, but it's not obvious from the shop manual. And new seals for the starter motor case do a good job of keeping the oil from getting out.

Prematurely worn brushes. I've heard it said that the commutator shaft can get out of balance, wearing the brushes and commutator and probably allowing the oil to leak in. The brushes and &quot;brush holder&quot; are not terribly expensive from Honda, these fix things right up for a while. What's more, I've found I can simply stuff the wires behind the brushes with good effect, so I carry the required 8mm wrench and screwdriver when I tour.

After suffering through increasing starter problems for about a year, with ever less starting power and equally less effect from my dubious repairs, I finally went out and spent $150 on a rebuilt starter. It works great, I should have done it six months previously. Not only is it now reliable and leak-free (so far as I know, might be some internal leakage), but it also now starts the bike instantly. Just like a starter should.

I had the same issues with a leaky weak starter.  Found a local electric motor mechanic who completely rebuilt my starer for $60. Works great.

Indeed a weak point in the design.  The oil leaks are more likely caused by a faulty oil seal on the main bearing.  Replacing the bearing fixed the issue on my bike.  
Wear: I had the starter rebuilt three times before giving up and replacing with a new unit.  The commutator always wore out really quickly.  I suspect the rear bearing wear was causing an alignment issue resulting in premature failure.

===Transmission===

There can be a problem with the transmission, wherein the bike pops out of gear, starting with 2nd. Apparently the problem grows to include 3rd gear, etc. I've been told that the cause is a too-small part in or actually near the transmission that wears out. That's all I know. My bikes jumps out of 2nd occasionally, but only right after shifting from 1st, so I think my experience is more of a missed shift. And the jump out of 2nd can be avoided by I really firm shift from 1st to 2nd.

===Instrument needles break===

The indicator needles on the tachometer and speedometer often break off. On mine this happened with the tach, but it's still easy enough to read. Easier to read than the intact speedometer, I find.

{{BookCat}}

I have had the same happen.  It is due to sunlight degradation of the plastic needles.  Replaced with homemade PET plastic needles because I could not source original speedo replacements.  The bezel surface also darkens with age because of sunlight exposure.  This can be sanded off and replaced with a clear lacquer.

      <comment>Random Opening Chess is the same kind of chess game with the standard rules and moves but with different starting positions.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Why is this not combined with http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Variants/Random_Opening_Chess ?

Even I wrote a small note for this page without seeing the other page first. It is as follows:
In Random Opening Chess, the beginning of the game is different. (i.e.) the position of the pieces are different from the one in the classical chess. For example, the position of the bishop and the knights could be interchanged and the game could start in this manner. This had been created since it was seen that people normally have standard moves of playing which are learnt instead of actually understanding and playing according to some strategy. In the classical chess, there are some standard openings, known as the Sicilian Defence, Italian Game, etc. (See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Print_version for more on these) In the Random Opening Chess, this is not possible since what is a good strategy in the classical chess may work to the players detriment in this.</text>

'''Fried chicken''' is a Southern main meal in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], served often at &quot;Sunday dinner&quot; (&quot;dinner&quot; being the midday meal for many Southerners) or church &quot;suppers&quot; (&quot;supper&quot; being the term for the evening meal). Recipes are legion; every family has one handed down.

The '''Kousa Dogwood''' (''Cornus kousa'' or ''Benthamidia kousa''), also known as the '''Japanese Flowering Dogwood''' (Yamaboushi ヤマボウシ in Japanese), is a small flowering tree native to Eastern Asia and Japan, but grown in other regions as an ornamental and occasionally for its edible fruit.

==Description==
It is a small deciduous tree 8-12 m tall, native to eastern Asia. Like most dogwoods, it has opposite, simple, ovate leaves, which are 4-10 cm long. Fall colors are vivid reds, yellows, and purples.

The tree is showy when in flower, but the &quot;showy&quot; elements are actually white bracts which are held below dense cymes of yellow-green flowers. The flowering is in spring, shortly after it leafs out. It has a relatively upright habit, unlike the closely related Flowering Dogwood (''[[../Cornus florida/]]'') of eastern North America, which has a sprawling habit. It also differs from that in flowering about a month later, and in having pointed (not rounded) flower bracts.

The fruit is a globose pink to red amalgamate of drupes containing several 1-2 seeded stones, 2-3 cm diameter, and resembling a pom-pom. The berries can grow even larger towards the end of the season and some berries that do not fall from the tree surpass 4 cm. It is edible, though the tree is not commonly grown for fruit.

The bark exfoliates in irregular patches or gray, brown, tan, and olive-green, providing winter interest. The stems are horizontally arranged, slender, and rigid. Buds are valvate, the flower buds longer and larger than the vegetative buds. 

==Growing conditions==
Does best in moist, well-drained, fertile soils, but is adabtable. Full sun to dense shade, flowering better in more sun.

==Varieties==
===Natural Varieties===
*''Cornus kousa'' var. ''kousa''. Leaves 4-7 cm; flower bracts 3-5 cm.Native to Japan.
*''Cornus kousa'' var. ''chinensis''. Leaves 5-10 cm; flower bracts 4-6 cm, opening white and then fading to pink. Native to China.

===Cultivars===
*‘China Girl’: Heavy flowering, flowers when very young.
*‘Elizabeth Lustgarten’: selection of var. chinensis with weeping branchlets.
*‘Gold Star’: Bracts white, fading to pink. Leaves with dark yellow centers, red with purple margins in fall color. Shrubby form.
*‘Milky Way’: heavy flowering and fruiting.
*‘Rubra’: flower bracts pink.
*‘Satomi’: Floral bracts dark pink, fall color purple.
*‘Snowboy’: Dwarf (to 2.5 m), leaves grayish, with white margins.
*‘Summer Stars’: Heavy flowering, fall color maroon.
*‘Variegata’: leaves variegated with white.

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
It is resistant to the dogwood anthracnose disease, caused by the fungus ''Discula destructiva'', unlike Flowering Dogwood, which is very susceptible and commonly killed by it; for this reason, Kousa Dogwood is being widely planted as an ornamental tree in areas affected by the disease. A number of [[hybrid]]s between Kousa Dogwood and Flowering Dogwood have also been selected for their disease resistance and good flower appearance.

See ''[[../Cornus/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus.

The '''Flowering Dogwood''' (also called American Dogwood, Cornelian Tree, False Box, False Boxwood, Florida Dogwood, Indian Arrowwood, Nature's Mistake or, White Cornel; ''Cornus florida'', syn. ''Benthamidia florida'') is a species of dogwood native to eastern North America, from southern Maine west to southern Ontario and eastern Kansas, and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas, with a disjunct population in eastern Mexico in Nuevo León and Veracruz.

==Description==
It is a small deciduous tree growing to 10 m high, with a trunk diameter of up to 30 cm. The leaves are opposite, simple acute oval, 6-13 cm long and 4-6 cm broad, with an apparently entire margin (actually very finely toothed, under a lens); they turn a rich red-brown in fall. 

The flowers are individually small and inconspicuous, with four greenish-yellow petals 4 mm long. Around 20 flowers are produced in a dense, rounded, cymes 1-2 cm diameter, the flower head surrounded by four conspicuous large white or pink &quot;petals&quot; (actually bracts), each bract 3 cm long and 2.5 cm broad, rounded, and with a distinct notch at the apex. The flowers are bisexual. 

While most of the wild trees have white bracts, some selected cultivars of this tree also have pink bracts, some even almost a true red. They typically flower in early April in the southern part of their range, to late April or early May in northern and high altitude areas. The similar Kousa Dogwood (''[[../Cornus kousa/]]''), native to Asia, flowers about a month later. 

The fruit is a cluster of three to eight 10-15 mm diameter drupes which ripen to a bright red in the fall; they are eaten by birds which distribute the seeds. The berries are edible, often being used to sweeten tea in Mexico. 

==Growing conditions==
Flowering Dogwood does best when it has shade from the west but good morning sun. It does not do well when exposed to intense heat sources such as adjacent parking lots or air conditioning compressors. It has a low tolerance of salt. In eastern North America, it is cultivated as far north as Toronto and south to central Florida. Farther west, places of cultivation include Boulder, Sacramento and Vancouver. It is sold in other temperate parts of the world, including Sydney, Australia.

==Varieties==
*''Cornus florida'' subsp. ''florida''. Eastern United States, southeastern Canada (Ontario).
*''Cornus florida'' subsp. ''urbiniana'' (syn. ''Cornus urbiniana''). Eastern Mexico (Nuevo León, Veracruz).

*'Autumn Gold' - white bracts; yellow fall color.
*'Barton' - large white bracts; blooms at early age; resists mildew.
*'Bay Beauty' - double white bracts; resists heat and drought; good for Deep South.
*'Cherokee Daybreak' - white bract; vigorous grower with variegated leaves.
*'Cherokee Chief' - red bracts; red new growth.
*'Cherokee Sunset' - purplish-red bracts; variegated foliage.
*'Gulf Coast Pink' - best pink flowering dogwood in Florida.
*'Hohman's Gold' - white bracts; variegated foliage.
*'Plena' - double white bracts; anthracnose-resistant.
*'Purple Glory' - red bracts; purple foliage; anthracnose-resistant.
*var. ''rubra'' has pink flowers
*'Weaver White' - large white blooms; large leaves; candelabra shape; good in north-central Florida.

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;
Cornus florida is easily propagated by seeds, which are sown in the fall into prepared rows of sawdust or sand, and emerge in the spring. Germination rates for good clean seed should be near 100% if seed dormancy is first overcome by cold stratification treatments for 90 to 120 days at 4 °C (39 °F).[4][5] Flowering dogwood demonstrates gametophytic self-incompatibility, meaning that the plants can’t self-fertilize. This is important for breeding programs as it means that it is not necessary to emasculate (remove the anthers from) C. florida flowers before making controlled cross-pollinations. These pollinations should be repeated every other day, as the flowers must be cross-pollinated within one or two days of opening for pollinations to be effective.[6]

Softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer from new growth can be rooted under mist if treated with 8,000 to 10,000 ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). In cold climates, potted cuttings must be kept in heated cold frames or polyhouses the following winter to maintain temperatures between 0 and 7°C. Although rooting success can be as high as 50-85%, this technique is not commonly used by commercial growers. Rather, selected cultivars are generally propagated by T-budding in late summer or by whip grafting in the greenhouse in winter onto seedling rootstock.[5][7]

Micropropagation of flowering dogwood is now used in breeding programs aiming to incorporate resistance to dogwood anthracnose and powdery mildew into horticulturally and economically important cultivars. Nodal (axillary bud) sections are established in a culture of Woody Plant Medium (WPM) amended with 4.4 μM 6-Benzyladenine (BA) to promote shoot growth.[8] Rooting of up to 83% can be obtained when 5-7 week-old microshoots are then transferred to WPM amended with 4.9 μM IBA.[9]

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
It is very susceptible to dogwood anthracnose, a disease caused by the  fungus ''[[../Discula destructiva/]]''. This has killed many wild stocks of Flowering Dogwood; domestic landscape plantings have often been affected to a lesser degree because better air circulation and less humid conditions discourages the fungus, but losses still occur frequently. The Kousa Dogwood (''[[../Cornus kousa/]]'') is more resistant to this disease, and sometimes planted as a safer alternative.

'''Butterfly weed''' (''Asclepias tuberosa'', also called Canada root, Chigger flower, Chiggerflower, Fluxroot, Indian paintbrush, Indian posy, Orange milkweed, Orange Swallow-wort,  Pleurisy root, Silky Swallow-wort, Tuber root, Yellow milkweed, White-root, Windroot) is a species of milkweed native to eastern North America, but also grown in gardens throughout the world for the showy flowers and the butterflies that are attracted to it.

The common name comes from the butterflies that are attracted to the plant by its color and its copious production of nectar. Butterfly weed is also the larval food plant of the [[w:Queen butterfly|Queen butterfly]]. 

==Description==
It is a perennial plant growing to 0.6-2 m (1 -2 feet) tall, with cymes of orange, yellow, or nearly red flowers which are regular, perfect, 5-parted, top of flower (“crown”)  with erectly held “hoods”. Pollen is in waxy masses. Flowers are produced from early summer to early fall. The leaves are spirally arranged, lanceolate, 5-12 cm long and 2-3 cm broad, hairy, dark green above and lighter beneath. The roots are thick taproots, to 30 cm long.

[[Image:Asclepias tuberosa seeds 001.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Seeds and seed pods]]
The seeds, borne in elongate pods, are also an attraction due to the large, silky pappus which are blown in the wind when ripe.

The plant looks similar to the Lanceolate milkweed (''[[../Asclepias lanceolata/]]''), however the Butterfly weed is uniquely identified by the larger number of flowers and hairy stems.  It is most commonly found in fields with dry soil.

==Growing conditions==
In gardens, butterfly weed does best with a deep, rich, well-drained soil in full sun. In the wild it is often found in dry, sand or gravel soil, but has also been reported on stream margins.

==Varieties==
[[Image:Asclepias tuberosa.JPG|thumb|right|200px|cv. 'Hello Yellow' has yellow flowers]]
*''Asclepias tuberosa interior'', Central United States. 
*''Asclepias tuberosa rolfsii'' (Rolfs Milkweed), Southeast United States. 
*''Asclepias tuberosa tuberosa'', Eastern United States. 

*‘Gay Butterflies’ - is a commercial seed mix with varied flower colors.
*'Hello Yellow' - has yellow flowers.

==Uses==
As a border perennial or meadow plant, primarily grown to attract butterflies to the garden. Can also be grown for cut flowers. The plant is often used in children's gardens for the seeds (for making &quot;wishes&quot; by blowing the seeds), as well as for the caterpillars and butterflies.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:Asclepias tuberosa winter 001.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Stems and pods can provide winter interest]]
Remove the forming seed pods to encourage reblooming, or leave them to develop the interesting seeds and for winter interest. Transplanting can be difficult due to the deep taptoot.

==Propagation==
Primarily by seed, but also by division or basal cuttings.

==Harvesting==
Does well as a cut flower, but leaves should be completely removed from the stems before putting in the vase.

==Pests and diseases==
See ''[[../Asclepias/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases. Caterpillars found on this plant are usually butterfly larvae, so if butterflies are desired, leave the caterpillars be.

*Storage - Nutrients can be stored inside the bones to be used at a later date. For example, calcium is stored in the bones and then released when the body is not taking in enough calcium.
This is not correct, since excess Calcium is not stored in the bone but rather excreted in the urine. Release of calcium is a compensatory mechanism in case of shortage, that is on the cost of structural stability of bones.

To get the length of a string, we use the len() function:
&lt;pre&gt;len(&quot;Hello Wikibooks!&quot;) -&gt; 16&lt;/pre&gt;

You can take bits of a string using the [:] command, much like lists.
&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello Wikibooks!&quot;[0:5]
'Hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello Wikibooks!&quot;[5:11]
' Wikib'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello Wikibooks!&quot;[:5] #equivalent of [0:5]
'Hello'
&lt;/pre&gt;

To get an ASCII character code, you use the &lt;code&gt;ord()&lt;/code&gt; command.
&lt;pre&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ord('h')
104
&gt;&gt;&gt; ord('a')
97
&gt;&gt;&gt; ord('^')
94&lt;/pre&gt;
To get the letter formed by an ASCII character code, you use the &lt;code&gt;chr()&lt;/code&gt; command.
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(104)
'h'
&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(97)
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(94)
'^'&lt;/pre&gt;

==Example==
stringparser.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Add each character, and it's ordinal, of user's text input, to two lists
s = input(&quot;Enter value: &quot;)  # this line requires Python 3.x, use raw_input() instead of input() in Python 2.x
l1 = [] 
l2 = []
for c in s:   # in Python, a string is just a sequence, so we can iterate over it!
    l1.append(c) 
    l2.append(ord(c))
print(l1)
print(l2)
&lt;/source&gt;

Or shorter (using list comprehension instead of the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; block):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Add each character, and it's ordinal, of user's text input, to two lists
s = input(&quot;Enter value: &quot;)  # this line requires Python 3.x, use raw_input() instead of input() in Python 2.x

l1=[c for c in s]   # in Python, a string is just a sequence, so we can iterate over it!
l2=[ord(c) for c in s]

print(l1)
print(l2)
&lt;/source&gt;


Output:
&lt;pre&gt;
Enter value: string
['s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']
[115, 116, 114, 105, 110, 103]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or
&lt;pre&gt;
Enter value: Hello, Wikibooks!
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'i', 'k', 'i', 'b', 'o', 'o', 'k', 's', '!']
[72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 105, 107, 105, 98, 111, 111, 107, 115, 33]
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Modules and how to use them|Exceptions}}

In python there are three types of errors; ''[[Python Programming/Errors#Syntax errors|syntax errors]]'', ''[[Python Programming/Errors#Logic errors|logic errors]]'' and ''[[Python Programming/Errors#Exceptions|exceptions]]''.

== Syntax errors ==
Syntax errors are the most basic type of error. They arise when the Python parser is unable to understand a line of code. Syntax errors are almost always fatal, i.e. there is almost never a way to successfully execute a piece of code containing syntax errors.
Some syntax errors can be caught and handled, like eval(&quot;&quot;), but these are rare.

In IDLE, it will highlight where the syntax error is. Most syntax errors are typos, incorrect indentation, or incorrect arguments. If you get this error, try looking at your code for any of these.

== Logic errors ==
These the most difficult type of error to find, and also the most common because your program will run, but it will give unpredictable results and may crash.  A lot of different things can happen with logic errors.

== Exceptions ==
Exceptions arise when the python parser knows what to do with a piece of code but is unable to perform the action. An example would be trying to access the internet with python without an internet connection; the python interpreter knows what to do with that command but is unable to perform it.

=== Dealing with exceptions ===
Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are not always fatal. Exceptions can be handled with the use of a &lt;tt&gt;try&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

Consider the following code to display the HTML of the website 'example.com'. When the execution of the program reaches the try statement it will attempt to perform the indented code following, if for some reason there is an error (the computer is not connected to the internet or something) the python interpreter will jump to the indented code below the 'except:' command.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import urllib2
url = 'http://www.example.com'
try:
    req = urllib2.Request(url)
    response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
    the_page = response.read()
    print the_page
except:
    print &quot;We have a problem.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way to handle an error is to except a specific error.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    age = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;))
    print &quot;You must be {0} years old.&quot;.format(age)
except ValueError:
    print &quot;Your age must be numeric.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

If the user enters a numeric value as his/her age, the output should look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Enter your age: 5
You must be 5 years old.
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, if the user enters a non-numeric value as his/her age, a &lt;tt&gt;ValueError&lt;/tt&gt; is thrown when trying to execute the &lt;tt&gt;int()&lt;/tt&gt; method on a non-numeric string, and the code under the &lt;tt&gt;except&lt;/tt&gt; clause is executed:

&lt;pre&gt;
Enter your age: five
Your age must be numeric.
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also use a &lt;tt&gt;try&lt;/tt&gt; block with a &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop to validate input:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
valid = False
while valid == False:
    try:
        age = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;))
        valid = True     # This statement will only execute if the above statement executes without error.
        print &quot;You must be {0} years old.&quot;.format(age)
    except ValueError:
        print &quot;Your age must be numeric.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The program will prompt you for your age until you enter a valid age:

&lt;pre&gt;
Enter your age: five
Your age must be numeric.
Enter your age: abc10
Your age must be numeric.
Enter your age: 15
You must be 15 years old.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In certain other cases, it might be necessary to get more information about the exception and deal with it appropriately. In such situations the except as construct can be used.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
f=raw_input(&quot;enter the name of the file:&quot;)
l=raw_input(&quot;enter the name of the link:&quot;)
try:
    os.symlink(f,l)
except OSError as e:
    print &quot;an error occured linking %s to %s: %s\n error no %d&quot;%(f,l,e.args[1],e.args[0])
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
enter the name of the file:file1.txt
enter the name of the link:AlreadyExists.txt
an error occured linking file1.txt to AlreadyExists.txt: File exists
 error no 17

enter the name of the file:file1.txt
enter the name of the link:/Cant/Write/Here/file1.txt
an error occured linking file1.txt to /Cant/Write/Here/file1.txt: Permission denied
 error no 13
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Networks|Database Programming}}

Python has support for working with databases via a simple API. Modules included with Python include modules for [[w:SQLite|SQLite]] and [[w:Berkeley DB|Berkeley DB]]. Modules for [[MySQL]] , [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]] , [[w:FirebirdSQL|FirebirdSQL]] and others are available as third-party modules. The latter have to be downloaded and installed before use.
The package MySQLdb can be installed, for example, using the debian package &quot;python-mysqldb&quot;.

== DBMS Specifics ==

=== MySQL ===
An Example with MySQL would look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import MySQLdb
db = MySQLdb.connect(&quot;host machine&quot;, &quot;dbuser&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;dbname&quot;)
cursor = db.cursor()
query = &quot;&quot;&quot;SELECT * FROM sampletable&quot;&quot;&quot;
lines = cursor.execute(query)
data = cursor.fetchall()
db.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

On the first line, the [[Python Programming/Modules|Module]] &lt;tt&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/tt&gt; is imported. Then a connection to the database is set up and on line 4, we save the actual SQL statement to be executed in the variable &lt;tt&gt;query&lt;/tt&gt;. On line 5 we execute the query and on line 6 we fetch all the data.
After the execution of this piece of code, &lt;tt&gt;lines&lt;/tt&gt; contains the number of lines fetched (e.g. the number of rows in the table &lt;tt&gt;sampletable&lt;/tt&gt;). The variable &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; contains all the actual data, e.g. the content of &lt;tt&gt;sampletable&lt;/tt&gt;. In the end, the connection to the database would be closed again. If the number of lines are large, it is better to use &lt;tt&gt;row = cursor.fetchone()&lt;/tt&gt; and process the rows individually:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
  #first 5 lines are the same as above
  while True:
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    if row == None: break
    #do something with this row of data
  db.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

Obviously, some kind of data processing has to be used on row, otherwise the data will not be stored. The result of the &lt;tt&gt;fetchone()&lt;/tt&gt; command is a [[Python Programming/Tuples|Tuple]].

In order to make the initialization of the connection easier, a configuration file can be used: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import MySQLdb
db = MySQLdb.connect(read_default_file=&quot;~/.my.cnf&quot;)
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the file .my.cnf in the home directory contains the necessary configuration information for MySQL.

=== Sqlite ===
An example with sqlite is very similar to the one above and the cursor provides
many of the same functionalities. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sqlite3
db = sqlite3.connect(&quot;/path/to/file&quot;)
cursor = db.cursor()
query = &quot;&quot;&quot;SELECT * FROM sampletable&quot;&quot;&quot;
lines = cursor.execute(query)
data = cursor.fetchall()
db.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

When writing to the db, one has to remember to call db.commit(),
otherwise the changes are not saved:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sqlite3
db = sqlite3.connect(&quot;/path/to/file&quot;)
cursor = db.cursor()
query = &quot;&quot;&quot;INSERT INTO sampletable (value1, value2) VALUES (1,'test')&quot;&quot;&quot;
cursor.execute(query)
db.commit()
db.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Postgres ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(&quot;dbname=test&quot;)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(&quot;select * from test&quot;);
for i in cursor.next():
    print i
conn.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Firebird ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import firebirdsql
conn = firebirdsql.connect(dsn='localhost/3050:/var/lib/firebird/2.5/test.fdb', user='alice', password='wonderland')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute(&quot;select * from baz&quot;)
for c in cur.fetchall():
    print(c)
conn.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

== General Principles ==

=== Parameter Quoting ===
You will frequently need to substitute dynamic data into a query string. '''It is important to ensure this is done correctly.'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
# Do not do this!
result = db.execute(&quot;select name from employees where location = '&quot; + location + &quot;'&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This example is '''wrong''', because it doesn’t correctly deal with special characters, like apostrophes, in the string being substituted. If your code has to deal with potentially hostile users (like on a public-facing Web server), this could leave you open to an '''[[w:Sql_injection|SQL injection attack]]'''.

For simple cases, use the automatic parameter substitution provided by the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
result = db.execute(&quot;select name from employees where location = ?&quot;, [location])
&lt;/source&gt;

The DBMS interface itself will automatically convert the values you pass into the correct SQL syntax.

For more complex cases, the DBMS module should provide a quoting function that you can explicitly call. For example, MySQLdb provides the &lt;code&gt;escape_string&lt;/code&gt; method, while APSW (for SQLite3) provides &lt;code&gt;format_sql_value&lt;/code&gt;. This is necessary where the query structure takes a more dynamic form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
criteria = [(&quot;company&quot;, company)] # list of tuples (fieldname, value)
if department != None :
    criteria.append((&quot;department&quot;, department))
#end if
# ... append other optional criteria as appropriate ...

result = db.execute \
  (
        &quot;select name from employees where &quot;
    +
        &quot; and &quot;.join
          (
            &quot;%s = %s&quot; % (criterion[0], MySQLdb.escape_string(criterion[1]))
            for criterion in criteria
          )
  )
&lt;/source&gt;

This will dynamically construct queries like “select name from employees where company = &amp;#39;''some company''&amp;#39;” or “select name from employees where company = &amp;#39;''some company''&amp;#39; and department = &amp;#39;''some department''&amp;#39;”, depending on which fields have been filled in by the user.

=== Use Iterators ===
Python iterators are a natural fit for the problem of iterating over lots of database records. Here is an example of a function that performs a database query and returns an iterator for the results, instead of returning them all at once. It relies on the fact that, in APSW (the Python 3 interface library for SQLite), the &lt;code&gt;cursor.execute&lt;/code&gt; method itself returns an iterator for the result records. The result is that you can write very concise code for doing complex database queries in Python.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def db_iter(db, cmd, mapfn = lambda x : x) :
    &quot;executes cmd on a new cursor from connection db and yields the results in turn.&quot;
    cu = db.cursor()
    result = cu.execute(cmd)
    while True :
        yield mapfn(next(result))
    #end while
#end db_iter
&lt;/source&gt;

Example uses of this function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for \
    artist, publisher \
in \
    db_iter \
      (
        db = db,
        cmd =
                &quot;select artist, publisher from artists where location = %s&quot;
            %
                 apsw.format_sql_value(location)
      ) \
:
    print(artist, publisher)
#end for
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for \
    location \
in \
    db_iter \
      (
        db = db,
        cmd = &quot;select distinct location from artists&quot;,
        mapfn = lambda x : x[0]
      ) \
:
    print(location)
#end for
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first example, since &lt;code&gt;db_iter&lt;/code&gt; returns a tuple for each record, this can be directly assigned to individual variables for the record fields. In the second example, the tuple has only one element, so a custom &lt;code&gt;mapfn&lt;/code&gt; is used to extract this element and return it instead of the tuple.

=== Never Use “SELECT *” in a Script ===
Database table definitions are frequently subject to change. As application requirements evolve, fields and even entire tables are often added, or sometimes removed. Consider a statement like
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
result = db.execute(&quot;select * from employees&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

You may happen to know that the &lt;TT&gt;employees&lt;/TT&gt; table currently contains, say, 4 fields. But tomorrow someone may add a fifth field. Did you remember to update your code to deal with this? If not, it’s liable to crash. Or even worse, produce an incorrect result!

Better to always list the '''specific''' fields you’re interested in, no matter how many there are:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
result = db.execute(&quot;select name, address, department, location from employees&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

That way, any extra fields added will simply be ignored. And if any of the named fields are removed, the code will at least fail with a runtime error, which is a good reminder that you forgot to update it!

=== Looping on Field Breaks ===
Consider the following scenario: your sales company database has a table of employees, and also a table of sales made by each employee. You want to loop over these sale entries, and produce some per-employee statistics. A naïve approach might be:

* Query the database to get a list of employees
* For each employee, do a database query to get the list of sales for each employee.

If you have a lot of employees, then the first query may produce a large list, and the second step will involve a correspondingly large number of database queries.

In fact, the entire processing loop can run off a ''single database query'', using the standard SQL construct called a &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Python Programming/Note|SQL programming is a specialty skill in its own right. To learn more about this, start with the [[w:Sql|Wikipedia article]].}}

Here is what an example of such a loop could look like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
rows = db_iter \
  (
    db = db,
    cmd =
        &quot;select employees.name, sales.amount, sales.date from&quot;
        &quot; employees left join sales on employees.id = sales.employee_id&quot;
        &quot; order by employees.name, sales.date&quot;
  )
prev_employee_name = None
while True :
    row = next(rows, None)
    if row != None :
        employee_name, amount, date = row
    #end if
    if row == None or employee_name != prev_employee_name :
         if prev_employee_name != None :
              # done stats for this employee
              report(prev_employee_name, employee_stats)
         #end if
         if row == None :
              break
         # start stats for a new employee
         prev_employee_name = employee_name
         employee_stats = {&quot;total_sales&quot; : 0, &quot;number_of_sales&quot; : 0}
         if date != None :
               employee_stats[&quot;earliest_sale&quot;] = date
         #end if
    #end if
    # another row of stats for this employee
    if amount != None :
         employee_stats[&quot;total_sales&quot;] += amount
         employee_stats[&quot;number_of_sales&quot;] += 1
    #end if
    if date != None :
         employee_stats[&quot;latest_sale&quot;] = date
    #end if
#end while
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the statistics are quite simple: earliest and latest sale, and number and total amount of sales, and could be computed directly within the SQL query. But the same loop could compute more complex statistics (like standard deviation) that cannot be represented directly within a simple SQL query.

Note how the statistics for each employee are written out under either of two conditions:
* The employee name of the next record is different from the previous one
* The end of the query results has been reached.

Both conditions are tested with &lt;code&gt;row == None or employee_name != prev_employee_name&lt;/code&gt;; after writing out the employee statistics, a separate check for the second condition &lt;code&gt;row == None&lt;/code&gt; is used to terminate the loop. If the loop doesn’t terminate, then processing is initialized for the new employee.

Note also the use of a &lt;code&gt;left join&lt;/code&gt; in this case: if an employee has had no sales, then the join will return a single row for that employee, with SQL &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values (represented by &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; in Python) for the fields from the &lt;TT&gt;sales&lt;/TT&gt; table. This is why we need checks for such &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; values before processing those fields.

Alternatively, we could have used an &lt;code&gt;inner join&lt;/code&gt;, which would have returned ''no'' results for an employee with no sales. Whether you want to omit such an employee from your report, or include them with totals of zero, is really up to your application.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Web Page Harvesting|Networks}}

The urllib module which is bundled with python can be used for web interaction. This module provides a file-like interface for web urls.

==Getting page text as a string==
An example of reading the contents of a webpage
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import urllib
pageText = urllib.urlopen(&quot;http://www.spam.org/eggs.html&quot;).read()
print pageText
&lt;/source&gt;

Get and post methods can be used, too.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import urllib
params = urllib.urlencode({&quot;plato&quot;:1, &quot;socrates&quot;:10, &quot;sophokles&quot;:4, &quot;arkhimedes&quot;:11})

# Using GET method
pageText = urllib.urlopen(&quot;http://international-philosophy.com/greece?%s&quot; % params).read()
print pageText

# Using POST method
pageText = urllib.urlopen(&quot;http://international-philosophy.com/greece&quot;, params).read()
print pageText
&lt;/source&gt;

== Downloading files ==
To save the content of a page on the internet directly to a file, you can read() it and save it as a string to a file object, or you can use the urlretrieve function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import urllib
urllib.urlretrieve(&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/9/91/Python_Programming.pdf&quot;, &quot;pythonbook.pdf&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
This will download the file from [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/9/91/Python_Programming.pdf here] and save it to a file &quot;pythonbook.pdf&quot; on your hard drive.

== Other functions==
The urllib module includes other functions that may be helpful when writing programs that use the internet:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; plain_text = &quot;This isn't suitable for putting in a URL&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print urllib.quote(plain_text)
This%20isn%27t%20suitable%20for%20putting%20in%20a%20URL
&gt;&gt;&gt; print urllib.quote_plus(plain_text)
This+isn%27t+suitable+for+putting+in+a+URL
&lt;/source&gt;
The urlencode function, described above converts a dictionary of key-value pairs into a query string to pass to a URL, the quote and quote_plus functions encode normal strings. The quote_plus function uses plus signs for spaces, for use in submitting data for form fields. The unquote and unquote_plus functions do the reverse, converting urlencoded text to plain text.

== Email ==

With Python, [[w:MIME|MIME]] compatible emails can be sent. This requires an installed SMTP server. 

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

msg = MIMEText( 
&quot;&quot;&quot;Hi there,

This is a test email message.

Greetings&quot;&quot;&quot;)

me  = 'sender@example.com'
you = 'receiver@example.com'
msg['Subject'] = 'Hello!'
msg['From'] =  me
msg['To'] =  you
s = smtplib.SMTP()
s.connect()
s.sendmail(me, [you], msg.as_string())
s.quit()
&lt;/source&gt;

This sends the sample message from 'sender@example.com' to 'receiver@example.com'.

== Sockets ==

Python can also communicate via sockets.

=== Connecting to a server ===
This simple Python program will fetch a 4096 byte HTTP response from Google:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import socket, sys
sock = socket.socket ( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM )
sock.connect ( ( &quot;google.com&quot;, 80 ) )

sock.send('GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n')
sock.send('User-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (wikibooks test)\r\n\r\n')
print sock.recv(4096)
&lt;/source&gt;

== High-level interfaces ==

Most Python developers will prefer to use a high-level interface over using sockets, such as [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ Twisted] and [http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2 urllib2].

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to some psycholinguists these are the 63 most basic words to learn. (Actually the author added two to the set -man,woman- to arrive at a nice table) 

Study them well! They are worth the effort. 

The # mark opens a sound file. The words themselves are linked to the Dutch wiktionary. Use the links for more information.

Once you think you know all the words, go to the self test pages to test your new vocabulary.

Version 1.2, November 2002 
&lt;code&gt;Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&lt;/code&gt;
====0. PREAMBLE====
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. 

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. 

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 

====1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS====
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. 

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. 

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. 

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. 

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;. 

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. 

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition. 

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

====2. VERBATIM COPYING====
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. 

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 

====3. COPYING IN QUANTITY====
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. 

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. 

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. 

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 

====4. MODIFICATIONS====
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 

:'''A.''' Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. 
:'''B.''' List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. 
:'''C.''' State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 
:'''D.''' Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
:'''E.''' Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
:'''F.''' Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
:'''G.''' Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 
:'''H.''' Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
:'''I.''' Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
:'''J.''' Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
:'''K.''' For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 
:'''L.''' Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
:'''M.''' Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 
:'''N.''' Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
:'''O.''' Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. 

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. 

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. 

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. 

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

====5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS====
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. 

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. 

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot; 

====6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS====
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. 

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 

====7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS====
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. 

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 

====8. TRANSLATION====

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. 

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 

====9. TERMINATION==== 
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 

====10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE==== 
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. 

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

      <comment>/* Jon Amos Comenius (1592-1670) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Instruction has been around as long as there have been humans on the earth. In the beginning, instruction consisted of one on one teaching of elements required for survival; what foods were edible, how to create tools, etc. During this time, the methods that were used consisted of one person telling and showing another person the simple information. Humans did not start seriously thinking  about educational methods until much later. This document will be sketching the history of instructional technology from the Elder Sophists to 1900.
==Pre 1700==
===The Elder Sophists (~5 BC)===
The Elder Sophists can be considered the first instructional technologists (Saettler, 1968). They used public lecture to gain students. This was the first time that education moved from one on one instruction to mass instruction. The Sophists were different from the various teachers of the time because they believed all technology was worth learning, from statecraft to handicraft.  Focusing on general education, the Sophists were the first group of teachers to use systematic instruction.

===Pierre Abelard (1079-1142)===
Pierre Abelard taught at the Notre Dame Cathedral School and was known for his method of teaching. Abelard's approach was to present pros and cons of theological or philosophical propositions and leave the formulaton of conclusions to his students. His teachings had a direct influence on St. Thomas Aquinas, who developed the Scholastic method, which focused on teaching students how to aquire information for themselves. This method would never have been created without the influence of Pierre Abelard.
===Johann Amos Comenius (1592-1670)===  
Comenius' major contribution to instructional technology was his instructional method - used in science to analyze and improve the instructional process. He is considered the first true forrunner of instructional technology. Saettler states:&lt;blockquote&gt; ..[Comenius] laid the foundation of a systematic understanding of the teaching-learning process and anticipated, to a remarkable extent, the modern concept of instructional technology as applied science in support of the practical arts. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, Comenius' principles of instructional method was lost until the mid 19th century. Since found, many of his ideas have been incorperated into the methods instructional technologists use today.

==1700 through 1900==
Prior to 1800, the American schools were one room school houses with a teacher with very little advanced education. While many students might belong to the school, the instruction was still primarily done on an individual basis, with the students comming to the teacher for one on one tutalage during the day.
===The Lancasterian System===
Joseph Lancaster created a systematic way of teaching many students at once. Lancaster created a learning system that provided organized lessons in a graded plan of study. More importanly, his system was relatively inexpensive and had a higher success rate than the traditional methods of teaching at the time. School systems in American cities started to buy the system to assist in creating a free public school system. Because Lancaster was the first to introduce order and system into the instructional method used in American schools, he is considered a forrunner of todays instructional technologists.
===Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi===
Pestalozzi took educational theories presented by Jean Jacques Rousseau and developed a system of instruction that focused on allowing the student to learn through multiple senses. He believed that by teaching through the objects around the learner, the learner would be able to comprehend the concepts easier than just being told the information. For example: to learn arithmetic, the learner should count the things around them to come to an understanding of what each number meant. Like the Lancasterian system, Pestalozzi's method moved away from the rote memorization that had plagued early American schools, and moved towards group lessons. This method also challenged the educator, since he or she needed to have a thourough understanding of the subject as well as good classroom management and questioning skills.

'''Thyme''' (''Thymus'') (pronounced &quot;time&quot;) is a genus of about 350 species of aromatic perennial herbaceous plants and sub-shrubs to 40 cm tall, in the family Lamiaceae and native to Europe, North Africa and Asia. A number of species have different [[w:chemotypes]]. They are grown as culinary herbs, ground covers, and rock garden plants around the world.

==Description==
The stems tend to be narrow or even wiry; the leaves are evergreen in most species, arranged in opposite pairs, oval, entire, and small, 4-20 mm long. The flowers are in dense terminal heads, with an uneven calyx, with the upper lip three-lobed, and the lower cleft; the corolla is tubular, 4-10 mm long, and white, pink or purple.

==Growing conditions==
Well-drained soil is a must. They are better adapted to ceramic containers than to plastic.

==Species==
Among the most commonly cultivated species are:
*''[[../Thymus vulgaris/]]'' (Common Thyme or Garden Thyme) is a commonly used culinary herb. It is a Mediterranean perennial which is best suited to well-drained soils and enjoys full sun.
*''[[../Thymus herba-barona/]]'' (Caraway Thyme) is used both as a culinary herb and a groundcover, and has a strong caraway scent.
*''[[../Thymus × citriodorus/]]'' (Citrus Thyme; hybrid ''T. pulegioides'' × ''T. vulgaris'') is also a popular culinary herb, with cultivars selected with flavours of various ''Citrus'' fruit (lemon thyme, etc.)
*''[[../Thymus pseudolanuginosus/]]'' (Woolly Thyme) is not a culinary herb, but is grown as a ground cover
*''[[../Thymus serpyllum/]]'' (Wild Thyme) is an important nectar source plant for honeybees. All thyme species are nectar sources, but wild thyme covers large areas of droughty, rocky soils in southern Europe (Greece is especially famous for wild thyme honey) and North Africa, as well as in similar landscapes in the Berkshire Mountains and Catskill Mountains of the northeastern US. 

==Uses==
Thyme is widely cultivated as an herb, grown for its strong flavour, which is due to its content of thymol (Huxley 1992). It retains its flavour on drying better than many other herbs.

Thyme is often used to flavour meats, soups and stews.  It is used in French cuisine, where it is an important element in a ''bouquet garni'', as well as in ''herbes de Provence''.  It is also widely used in Caribbean cuisine. In some Middle Eastern countries, the condiment ''za'atar'' contains thyme as a vital ingredient.

Thyme is added early in cooking so that its oils have time to be released.

Medicinally thyme is used for respiratory infections in the form of a tincture, tisane, salve, syrup or by steam inhalation.

In traditional Jamaican childbirth practice, thyme tea is given to the mother after delivery of the baby. Its oxytocin-like effect causes uterine contractions and more rapid delivery of the placenta but this was said by Sheila Kitzinger to cause an increased prevalence of retained placenta.

Ancient Egyptians used thyme in embalming.  The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples, believing that thyme was a source of courage.  It was thought that the spread of thyme throughout Europe was thanks to the ancient Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms.  In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares. (Huxley 1992).  In this period, women would also often give knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englishplants.co.uk/thyme.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englishplants.co.uk/thyme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:12, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== Featured Book template ==

I saw your featured book template, it was very nice. You picked up on the wiki syntax quickly, and you added it correctly to the main page. I modified your template a little bit, i hope you don't mind.

Alot of the students in your class are excellent authors, and i hope that you and some of your classmates will stick around to become permanent community members after your class is over. We have several books in need of additional help, both on the health science bookshelf, and elsewhere. 

Let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:11, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

:We've set up a place to hold the templates at [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Templates]], so if you want to make changes to the human physiology template you can do it on that page and not on the main page. Once the templates look good, we can move them to the main page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:31, 24 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>a few words about flash memory</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Memory is a fundamental aspect of microcontroller design, and a good understanding of memory is necessary to discuss and processor system. 

== Memory Hierarchy ==

Memory suffers from the dichotomy that it can be either large or it can be fast. As memory becomes more large, it becomes less fast, and vice-versa. Because of this trade-off, computer systems typically have a hierarchy of memory types, where faster (and smaller) memories are closer to the processor, and slower (but larger) memories are further from the processor.

== Hard Disk Drives ==
{{Wikipedia|Hard disk drive}}
Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD) are occasionally known as '''secondary memory''' or ''nonvolatile memory''. HDD typically stores data magnetically (although some newer models use flash), and data is maintained even when the computer is turned off or removed from power. HDD is several orders of magnitude slower then all other memory devices, and a computer system will be more efficient when the number of interactions with the HDD are minimized.

Because most HDDs are mechanical and have moving parts, they tend to wear out and fail after time.

{{todo | Say a few words about the flash memory used inside most single-chip CPUs (as of 2013) as program memory. Not only *can* CPUs directly execute native code in such memory, Harvard-architecture CPUs often *cannot* directly execute native code in SRAM or DRAM or any other kind of memory but the flash program memory. }}

== RAM ==

Random Access Memory (RAM), also known as '''main memory''', is a volatile storage that holds data for the processor. Unlike HDD storage, RAM typically only has a capacity of a few megabytes to a few gigabytes. There are two primary forms of RAM, and many variants on these.

=== SRAM ===
{{Wikipedia|SRAM}}
Static RAM (SRAM) is a type of memory storage that uses 6 transistors to store data. These transistors store data so long as power is supplied to the RAM and do not need to be refreshed.

[[Image:6t-SRAM-cell.png|center|thumb|400px|A single bit of storage in SRAM, showing 6 transistors.]]

SRAM is typically used in processor caches because of its faster speed, but not in main memory because it takes up more space.

=== DRAM ===

{{Wikipedia|DRAM}}
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a type of RAM that contains a single transistor and a capacitor. DRAM is smaller than SRAM, and therefore can store more data in a smaller area. Because of the charge and discharge times of the capacitor, however, DRAM tends to be slower than SRAM. Many modern types of Main Memory are based on DRAM design because of the high memory densities. Because DRAM is simpler than SRAM, it is typically cheaper to produce.

A popular type of RAM, SDRAM, is a variant of DRAM and is not related to SRAM.

As digital circuits continue to grow smaller and faster as per Moore's Law, the speed of DRAM is not increasing as rapidly. This means that as time goes on, the speed difference between the processor and the RAM units (so long as the RAM is based on DRAM or variants) will continue to increase, and communications between the two units becomes more inefficient.

=== Other RAM ===

== Cache ==
{{Wikipedia|CPU cache}}
Cache is memory that is smaller and faster than main memory and resides closer to the processor. RAM runs on the system bus clock, but Cache typically runs on the processor speed which can be 10 times faster or more. Cache is frequently divided into multiple levels: L1, L2, and L3, with L1 being the smallest and fastest, and L3 being the largest and slowest. We will discuss cache in more detail in [[Microprocessor Design/Cache |a later chapter on cache]].

A computer system may have between several kilobytes to a few megabytes of available cache.

== Registers ==

Registers are the smallest and fastest memory storage elements. A modern processor may have anywhere from 4 to 256 registers.
We will discuss registers in much more detail in a later chapter, [[Microprocessor Design/Register File]].</text>

== New pages ==

Hi - I see you have created a series of pages such as [[Influential Leader in Instructional Technology - Robert Heinich]].  In practice Wikibooks naming policy would require this page to be called [[Instructional Technology/Robert Heinich]] for example to make it a sub page of the book.  Nothing need be lost as you can use the &quot;move&quot; tab to correct the name.  It would be good if you could do that for all the new pages you created (the links on the main page will need to be changed to reflect the move) thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:27, 19 April 2007 (UTC)
:Please will you ensure that future pages are named according to policy and that you correct the ones already created as soon as possible --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 06:56, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

== An invitation of a Wikibook study ==
Hi Saciptoker, 
I'm a doctoral student at Indiana University. I'm currently working on a Wikibook study about online authors' experiences and perceptions with my advisor. I read your wikibook of Instructional Technology. It's very impressive. We would like to learn more from your experience. If you would like to participate in the case study, please contact me by email (cl17@indiana.edu) or leave a message. We'll discuss the detailed information about the study. (The format will be a one hour interview by phone or email) Your input will be greatly appreciated.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition of &quot;Low Threshold Application (LTA)&quot;==

Steve Gilbert, President of the  Teaching and Learning Technology Group (TLT)[http://www.tltgroup.org], a non-profit corporation focused on teaching and learning in post-secondary education, has defined a low threshold applications (LTAs) as a  &quot;teaching/learning application of information technology  that is reliable, accessible, easy to learn, non-intimidating and (incrementally) inexpensive...for purchase, training, support, and maintenance.&quot;[http://www.tltgroup.org/resources/rltas.html] LTAs can be especially useful in institutions where instructors have limited technical resources or support.[http://www.campustechnology/article.aspx?aid=38],[http://www.campustechnology/article.aspx?aid=40168]

== Using LTAs to Design Instruction==
Because LTAs are frequently created using &quot;almost ubiquitous technology,&quot;[http://www.tltgroup.org/gilbert/Columns/Syllabus.htm] familiar programs like MS PowerPoint, or with relatively inexpensive and easy to learn commercial programs such as the video screen-capture program Camtasia, they do not require a high level of technical skills to create, and the end product is generally in a form which users find familiar and easy to use. It is nonetheless crucial that whatever the ease with which they are created, they must still be based on sound design principles, and the application should be suited to the form the instruction takes. For example, PowerPoint is well suited to instruction with a linear structure, Windows MovieMaker works best with digital video that requires basic editing only, and the relatively inexpensive ($300)[http://www.techsmith.com/purchase/default.asp] Camtasia is extraordinarily effective when used to show and describe activity such as software demos as they take place on a computer screen. Gilbert has also characterized open source and open course resources as RLOs, provided they are available at no or low cost.

== Using LTAs to Create Reusable Learning Objects ==
LTAs are a simple tool for creating RLOs. Documents created in Word, PowerPoint, Excel or similar productivity software can simply be saved in their default format and loaded into object repositories and content collections, as can digita vido clips. Animated PowerPoint is especially effective when output in Java, which may be accomplished by a conversion program. Text documents can be protected to a certain degree from unauthorized changes by generating them as PDFs by using Acrobat's document security features; PDFs also have the capability of reducing file size.

== Examples ==

Many learning object repositories contain RLOs created using LTAs. Some examples are

== Backdoor / Trojan? ==

Why when I turn on the DMZ to any particular address (in this example, 222) do the following ports become open from that address, which does not have a computer on it? (The port is turned on but the computer is non-existant)?
 
UDP 192.168.2.222 22379 cpe-76-87-90-7.socal.res.rr.com (76.87.90.7) 40769 Low 

UDP 192.168.2.222 22379 207-255-157-142-dhcp.clf.pa.atlanticbb.net (207.255.157.142) 30524 Low 

UDP 192.168.2.222 22379 adsl-160-102-220.asm.bellsouth.net (74.160.102.220) 52276 Low 

UDP 192.168.2.222 22379 71.239.42.130 (71.239.42.130) 61774 Low 
 
Is this a backdoor, a hack, or trojan?

== Other Questions ==

Why is there no section on &quot;wireless&quot;? There are a lot of confusing settings in Tomato, such as Afterburn, Ap Isolater, etc. What do these mean?

Same thing with &quot;routing&quot;. Not all of us are network engineers, so at least a pointer to some helpful information elsewhere would be handy.

Once more, a missing bit of information. Under &quot;Static DHCP&quot;, in the router it has a field for a &quot;hostname&quot;. What exactly does this do?

For the WRT54G there is an entry for version &quot;TM&quot;.  What does this mean?  Is there literally a &quot;Version TM&quot; or does it mean something else?

edit: I agree, the old wikibooks entry was MUCH more helpful than the current one. Adding current version is great and all but the old one that explained the features of Tomato in depth was way more helpful. I'm a wiki newbie and so can't dig up the old version but if anyone could consider bringing back the old and add the current version in a new section that'd be great. [[Special:Contributions/75.82.42.70|75.82.42.70]] ([[User talk:75.82.42.70|talk]]) 02:49, 29 November 2009 (UTC)

== Logging externally ==

What does Tomato do if it cannot log externally (say, the computer is down?).





Is there a way to block keywords?

== AP Isolation ==

I just googled this term -- AP Isolation -- and learned a bit about it.  Perhaps someone can squeeze actual information out of what I read and add it to the page somewhere relevant (perhaps under Advanced -&gt; Wireless).  Basically, it sounds like a way of preventing one wireless client from talking to another through the router.  Helpful if your router is hosting a public hotspot and you don't want people hacking each other's wireless laptops.  These references are in forums, but perhaps someone can find better ones:

http://www.wirelessforums.org/alt-internet-wireless/client-isolation-ap-isolation-how-does-work-774.html

http://forums.linksys.com/linksys/board/message?board.id=Wireless_Routers&amp;message.id=12693

: Does this have anything to do with virtual access points?  I want to set up an encrypted access point for myself that connects to other machines on the LAN, but an unencrypted connection for other people that just connects to the web.

== Advanced Wireless settings ==

I just did some research and completed this section, which should be a big help. Anyone who knows any better, feel free to make corrections.
--[[User:MikeSayers|MikeSayers]] 18:36, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think the description of the Distance / ACK Timing is accurate. I don't think it can be used to actually prevent people at long distances connecting - it's just used for helping throughput for long distance links. I'm not really sure enough of my own knowledge to update the article though. Here's some information I found: http://nuke.freenet-antennas.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=22 --[[User:195.212.29.67|195.212.29.67]] 10:33, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

== WHR-G125 ==

http://my.opera.com/georgewu/blog/tomato-125

There's now a build that runs on the WHR-G125.

== Routing == 
&quot;''Miscellaneous - Mode: Gateway vs. Router. I haven't a clue what this does. IMO Gateway = Router.''&quot;

In '''Router''' mode the LAN addresses are passed onto, and advertised on the WAN side via RIP, but in '''Gateway''' mode, the local addresses are NAT'd, and not advertised via RIP. 

Thus, in Router mode, if the LAN is 192.168.1.1/24, and the WAN side is, say, 192.168.2.0/24, any attempt to connect to 192.168.1.3 from 192.168.2.60 will be passed through in router mode, but will be rejected as unroutable in the gateway mode, and all packets from 192.168.1.3 will be NAT'd to appear to be from the router's WAN port address.


== QoS ==

What do the two percentages mean, for each of the Quality of Service classes?

* See the new &lt;em&gt;Installation and Configuration&lt;/em&gt; subchapter on &lt;em&gt;QoS Basic Settings&lt;/em&gt;

Are the theories from ''rcordorica'' and ''bengali'' on the [http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=53366 linksys forums] correct?

* No. Several are based on blind speculation.

Is the first number the &quot;guaranteed minimum&quot; (so long as these guarantees don't add up to &gt; 100%) for each class? Is the second the maximum permitted bandwidth for that class?

* Yes, exactly. The second number is an absolute limit that is under no circumstances exceeded.

== Added Extra Info to &quot;Administration --&gt; Bandwidth Monitoring&quot; section ==

'lo. Someone who watches this might want to clean it up a bit, but I added the following based on some questions I asked Jon.

Save History Location: ... Keep in mind that if the share that your CIFS1/2 points to is offline, that it will save the Bandwidth History the next time the share is online. ...

Save Frequency: ... The exact time that the save interval happens at is based on what time you save your settings. So if you set it to &quot;Every 2 Days&quot; at 10:35AM, it will save 48 hours from then, and every 48 hours thereafter. 

Awaiting a second e-mail for a bit of clarification, but otherwise, I thought it might be useful for this information to go somewhere, os I just added it to the appropriate sections.

== Inbound QoS ==

The article states:
:Inbound data cannot be prioritized effectively because it has already passed through the bottleneck (your Internet connection) by the time the router has a chance to evaluate it.
If it works like I think it does, then inbound QoS is possible for TCP. If too much bandwidth is used, the router should drop some packets (or use ICMP?) to make the sender send slower ([https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Congestion_control TCP congestion control]). This could be used to avoid stuttering playback of a music stream while downloading other things. – [[Special:Contributions/91.4.19.244|91.4.19.244]] ([[User talk:91.4.19.244|talk]]) 17:40, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

Some newer versions now have &quot;TCP Vegas (network congestion control)&quot;. [[User:Hgmichna|Hgmichna]] ([[User talk:Hgmichna|talk]]) 20:43, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

== Advanced/Firewall/NAT Loopback: more options ==

The &quot;NAT Loopback&quot; is no longer just a checkbox; it's now a popup menu with &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Forwarded Only&quot;, and &quot;Disabled&quot; options. Someone who is &quot;in the know&quot; should update the relevant section. -- [[User:Dtgriscom|Dtgriscom]] ([[User talk:Dtgriscom|talk]]) 15:46, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

When set to 'Forwarded Only', apache2 reports the router WAN ip address in its logs when a client on the LAN tries to access one of the NATed web-servers (using a public fully qualified domain name [FQDN]) that reside also on the LAN.  When set to 'All' the router LAN address is logged.  When set to 'Disabled' you can not access, from within the LAN, NATed web-servers that also reside on the LAN using their public FQDN. (Kiriakos Georgiou, Sat Oct 17 20:49:35 EDT 2009)

== Bandwidth monitoring ==

Is the following line from the article true? If not, we should remove it. If it is true, then maybe an explanation of how to do that?

:You can also associate each mac address with a letter (up to 10) and get a bandwidth pie chart so you can see bandwidth for each mac address, you can then throttle in % each address if required

Yes: 5 letters A to E and 5 groups Highest to Lowest. You can set up rules in QoS -&gt; Classification to assign a letter from A to E or one of the groups to a particular src (LAN) MAC address(es).

This group can then be limited like any QoS class.

* However, note that the priorities are fixed, and A to E have the lower priorities, below the &quot;Lowest&quot; class. (Perhaps the designer had only limited command of the English language and didn't know what &quot;lowest&quot; means. :-) The priorities determine which channel gets any remaining bandwidth, i.e. the rest up to 100%, if any, plus the guaranteed, allocated, but not actually used bandwidth. But nobody says you have to use the A to E classes for this purpose. You can use any class you like. [[User:Hgmichna|Hgmichna]] ([[User talk:Hgmichna|talk]]) 20:51, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

== Access Restriction rules - AND or OR? ==

Very simple question: if you add more than one filter where it says &quot;Rules&quot;, are they evaluated with AND or with OR? All it says is &quot;Add&quot; which isn't a boolean operator. (I wish they'd publish a real manual. There's only this Wikibook and a meager FAQ. OK, most free software doesn't even have that and I ''could'' read through the source I guess...) 

Edit: I just found the part about &quot;sticky rules&quot;, so I guess that means OR.

== ND version? ==

What is it? Please explain in article. [[Special:Contributions/169.252.4.21|169.252.4.21]] ([[User talk:169.252.4.21|talk]]) 13:15, 6 May 2009 (UTC)

== Screenshots were all FAIR USE - restore, please ==

*Some editor requested deletion of all screenshots, and was quite correctly ignored.
*Some other @$$44+ deletionist editor went through with it, quite against policy.  
*Screenshots of copyrighted works are valid under FAIR USE with a valid Fair Use Rationale.
*This means screenshots of Tomato's UI are valid also.
*This further means anyone possessing the Tomato firmware (it's up to 1.25 at the moment) on their router is invited to repost screenshots where needed for clarity - just remember to include a completely filled-out Fair Use Rationale.

== Reoganized and split single page &quot;book&quot; ==
I hope I haven't upset everyone... I've begun to break the &quot;book&quot; up into separate pages. Currently, I've started with
* [[{{BOOKNAME}}/Installation and Configuration]]
* [[{{BOOKNAME}}/Menu Reference]]
Those pages are still quite large and may benefit from further sub-divisions. I've spend a lot more hours than I'd planned and I am not yet done.

=== Goals ===
Here is what I am slowly trying to do with these changes, as I learn about wiki and wikibooks formatting:
* Easier readability through
** Better organization
** Better presentation (look)
* Consistency of formatting through-out
* Add more prose, where helpful—especially to a broad spectrum of potential users.
* Update content with (at least 1.25 Tomato)
* More easily maintainable book structure, that would allow other contributors a framework to modify and augment this content.
* Migrate to wikibook-compliant layout and features (as I learn them).
* Make the book more &quot;book-like&quot;.
* Include more info on Tomato variations, configuration tips and recipes.
* ''Move'' content from Wikipedia on this topic with references, to encourage people to update this book rather than Wikipedia.

If anyone has any better idea of how the changes should be (including my goals as outlined, here), I'd be happy to discuss them. If course if ''everyone'' is upset by my changes, they can be reverted and I'll leave the pages alone. 

AND if anyone wants to help complete this effort, I'd be happy to have their help.

I think that other inclusions/expansions would be
* acknowledgment in some manner of the fact that the author, Jonathan Zarate, links to this Wikibooks page and the main wiki
* some amplification on the wireless survey and traffic features
* some more amplification of the logging and non-local storage options that the linux engine provides.
* definitely a feature comparison table with links to other places as appropriate

I can help on some of this at some point.

I thought I'd add here as a warning that I tried this with my Belkin F5D7231-4 router and bricked it, perhaps that should be noted on this wiki page.

'''''Veronica''''' is the largest genus in the flowering plant family [[../Plantaginaceae/]], with about 500 species; it was formerly classified in the family [[../Scrophulariaceae/]]. Taxonomy for this genus is currently being reanalysed, with the genus ''Hebe'' and the related Australasian genera ''Derwentia'', ''Detzneria'', ''Chionohebe'', ''Heliohebe'', ''Leonohebe'' and ''Parahebe'' included by many botanists. Common names include '''speedwell''', '''bird's eye''', and '''gypsyweed'''. 

The species are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also shrubs or small trees if ''Hebe'' is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; ''Hebe'' is mostly from New Zealand.

==Description==
Flowers are perfect, irregular, 4-5 parted. Ovary 2-celled. 2 showy stamens are a good ID characteristic for the genus. The foliage is opposite (but alternate near the flowers), simple, with dentate or entire margins. Fruits are dry capsules containing many small seeds. Roots are fibrous, and often adventitions on the stems.

'''Tod Mun''' (Thai fish cakes) can be found sold on the streets of Thailand and are a popular snack. At home they are perfect for an appetizer. There are many different recipes. The most common variant uses both fish and shrimp; this is the basic fish recipe.

==Ingredients==
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) vegetable oil (for frying)
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) sugar
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (7.5 mL) salt
*120 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] green beans
*360 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] ground fish or fish paste (''pla kuud)''
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) red curry paste
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|Kaffir lime leaves]]

== Procedure ==
# Stack the lime leaves and roll them together into a tube shape. Slice them into thin strips.
# Slice the green beans into small (½ inch) pieces.
# Mince the fish.
# Mix all the ingredients except the green beans and lime leaves in a bowl. 
# Stir until the mixture is smooth.
# Add the green beans and lime leaves to the mixture and stir again.
# Add the oil to a frying pan and heat to a medium temperature.
# Drop a tablespoon of the mixture into the pan and flatten slightly. When the bottom is cooked, turn over.
# When cooked on both sides, place on a paper towel to drain any extra oil. Continue with the rest of the mixture.

==Notes==

* If fresh Kaffir lime leaves are not available, do not substitute dried leaves as this will not work, and it is better to leave them out altogether.
* You may substitute the fish with chicken.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

The '''Lavenders''' ''Lavandula'' are a genus of about 25-30 species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae, native from the Mediterranean region south to tropical Africa and to the south east regions of India. The genus includes annuals, herbaceous plants, subshrubs, and small shrubs. The native range extends across the Canary Islands, North and East Africa, south Europe and the Mediterranean, Arabia, and India. Because the cultivated forms are planted in gardens world-wide, they are occasionally found growing wild, as garden escapees, well beyond their natural range.

==Species==
The most common species in cultivation is the Common Lavender ''[[../Lavandula angustifolia/]]'' (formerly ''L. officinalis''). A wide range of cultivars can be found. Other commonly grown ornamental species are ''[[../Lavandula stoechas/]]'', ''L. dentata'', and ''L. multifida''.

==Uses==
Lavenders are widely grown in gardens. Flower spikes are used for dried flower arrangements. The fragrant, pale purple flowers and flower buds are used in potpourris. Dried and sealed in pouches, they are placed among stored items of clothing to give a fresh fragrance and as a deterrent to moths. The plant is also grown commercially for extraction of lavender oil from the flowers. This oil is used as an antiseptic and for aromatherapy.

Lavender flowers yield abundant nectar which yields a high quality honey for beekeepers. Lavender monofloral honey is produced primarily in the nations around the Mediterranean, and marketed worldwide as a premium product. Lavender flowers can be candied and are used as cake decoration. Lavender is also used as a herb, either alone or as an ingredient of ''herbes de Provence''. Lavender is also used to flavour sugar, the product being called &quot;lavender sugar&quot;, and the flowers are sometimes sold in a blend with black tea, as &quot;lavender tea&quot;.

French chefs in and around Provence, France have been incorporating this herb into their cuisine for many centuries. Lavender lends a floral, yet slightly sweet and elegant flavor to most dishes. For most cooking applications it is the dried buds (also referred to as flowers) of lavender that are utilized, though some chefs experiment with the leaves as well. It is the buds however that contain the essential oil of lavender, which is where both the scent and flavor of lavender are best derived.

===Medicinal uses===
[[image:LavendarFlower.jpg|thumb|right|Flower of cultivated lavender; ''Lavandula stoechas'' or Spanish lavender]]
Lavender has been extensively used in herbalism.
English lavender, Lavandula angustifolia, yields a highly effective essential oil with very sweet overtones, and can be used in balms, salves, perfumes, cosmetics, and topical applications. French lavender, Lavandula x intermedia, yields a similar essential oil, with higher contents of turpin, which adds a harsher overtone to the fragrance. Spanish lavender, Lavandula stoechas is not used medicinally, but mainly for landscaping purposes.

Essential oil of lavender has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. It was used in hospitals during WWI to disinfect floors, walls and other surfaces. Lavender is soporific, and added to bath water or sprinkled on pillows aids relaxation and sleep.

An infusion of lavender is claimed to soothe and heal insect bites. Bunches of lavender are also said to ward off insects. If applied to the temples, lavender oil is said to soothe headaches. Lavender is frequently used as an aid to sleep and relaxation: Seeds and flowers of the plant are added to pillows, and an infusion of three flowerheads added to a cup of boiling water are recommended as a soothing and relaxing bedtime drink. Lavender oil (or extract of Lavender) is claimed to heal acne when used diluted 1:10 with water, rosewater, or witch hazel; it is also used in the treatment of skin burns and inflammatory conditions (it is a traditional treatment for these in Iran).

'''Health precautions:''' There is scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of some of these remedies, especially the anti-inflammatory effects, but they should be used with caution since lavender oil can also be a powerful allergen. Ingesting lavender should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umm.edu/altmed/ConsHerbs/Lavenderch.html Lavendar: Precautions], Center for Integrative Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;.

A preliminary finding presented at the Endocrine Society's conference in June 2006 had suggested that shampoos, soaps and body lotions containing lavender and tea tree oils may cause &quot;hormonal imbalances and breast growth in young boys&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical uses===
The ancient Greeks called the lavender herb ''nardus'', after the Syrian city of Naarda. It was also commonly called nard.

During Roman times, flowers were sold for 100 denarii per pound, which was about the same as a month's wages for a farm labourer, or fifty haircuts from the local barber. Lavender was commonly used in Roman baths to scent the water, and it was thought to restore the skin. When the Roman Empire conquered southern Britain, the Romans introduced lavender.

During the height of the Plague, glove makers at Grasse would scent their leathers with lavender oil, and this was claimed to ward off the Plague. This story could have some validity as the Plague was transmitted by fleas, which lavender is known to repel.

'''Gudeg''' (green jackfruit stew) is a very sweet dish made of young jackfruit, cooked with palm sugar and seasoning until it turns dark brown and cannot be distinguished from cassava leaves, which are boiled together with it, and from the red beans, which are optional ingredients.

Gudeg is usually served with rice, coconut milk soup (areh), tofu, country chicken egg, and traditional krecek sambal goreng (another traditional Jogjanese food).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vitamin K'''

In 1935 a Danish scientist came across a nutrient that he named “Koagulations”. This name, in Danish, means clotting. The nutrient that this scientist came across is now referred to as vitamin K (American Cancer Society). 
Vitamin K is a fat soluble essential nutrient that is not produced by the body. It is imperative that we receive this nutrient for proper blood clotting. Vitamin K is involved in the production of four of the thirteen proteins involved in normal blood clotting (Harvard School of Public Health). Vitamin K is also involved in bone density maintenance and may help decrease hip fractures in both men and women. There are three variations of vitamin K, vitamins K1, K2, and K3 (American Cancer Society). Vitamin K1 is also known as phylloquinone and is found in green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, and cabbage and also in some fruits such as kiwi, blackberries, and blueberries (Turner, Elaine). This form of the vitamin is best digested in the GI tract when eaten with fats. The second form is Vitamin K2. This form is called menaquinone and is produced by the natural flora (bacteria) found in the large intestine. It is produced as a byproduct of the bacteria’s metabolism and small amounts can be absorbed by the intestine. The third form of vitamin K is a synthetic or man-made form called Menadione also known as vitamin K3 (Turner, Elaine). This can be found in some supplements; however supplements are not usually necessary because a normal diet and an average bacteria load will supply enough for the average person. Men nineteen years and older are encouraged to take 120 micrograms a day in their diet, and women nineteen years and older 90 micrograms (Turner, Elaine). Only one in four people in the United States meet the goal for the intake of vitamin K (Harvard School of Public Health). 
Newborns are not born with many bacteria in their intestine and therefore are considered vitamin K deficient. Only small amounts of vitamin K pass from mother to fetus through the placenta, so when the baby is born it lacks a sufficient amount of vitamin K (Johnson, Larry). In order to combat the symptoms of vitamin K deficiency (hemorrhagic diseases and other clotting problems) newborns are injected with a shot of vitamin K to help with clotting in the first few weeks after birth (Turner, Elaine). 
For those who are at high risk for blood clots, including those with deep vein thrombosis, irregular rhythms of the heart, and pulmonary embolism your doctor may have prescribed anticoagulation medications such as Warfarin (Coumadin) for blood clot control (Johnson, Larry). It is important to know that these types of medications are vitamin K antagonists. This means that too much vitamin K in the diet may change the effectiveness of these specific medications. It is important to talk to your doctor about your diet to see what changes may be beneficial. 
There is no research thus far to indicate that the body can have too much vitamin K. The only problems that have surfaced have been in relation to those taking medications such as Coumadin for blood clot control (Turner, Elaine).

===Vitamin K and Insulin===
In a recent study it was found that Vitamin K additionally appeared to reduce resistance to insulin in men.  Insulin moves sugar in the blood into cells, but for insulin resistant (those with diabetes) the sugar cannot be removed and, therefore, builds up.  Unfortunately the same results were not found in women, as those administered the additional Vitamin K in the experiment showed no decrease in insulin resistance.  It is not sure why the Vitamin K had no effect on women, but it is hypothesized that the extra vitamin amounts built up in the additional fatty tissue of the women rather than getting into the blood.

===Effects of Aging===
Vitamin K deficiency problems appear to be more common in the elderly than in the younger populations resulting in bone loss, osteoarthritis, hardening of the arteries, and fractures.  This appears not to be a problem so much of lack of intake, but of inefficient metabolism of Vitamin K after menopause due to lower estrogen levels.  Separately Vitamin K intake was analyzed for elderly men and appeared not to independently effect cardiovascular health, but did indicated a healthier lifestyle and diet, which reduced risk of hear disease.

;Definition (Vector Space)
:Let ''F'' be a field. A set ''V'' with two binary operations: + (addition) and &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (scalar multiplication), is called a '''Vector Space''' if it has the following properties:
#&lt;math&gt;(V, +)&lt;/math&gt; forms an abelian group
#&lt;math&gt;v(a+b) = va + vb&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a, b \in F&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;a (v + u) = av + au&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v,u \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \in F&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(ab)v = a(bv)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;1_F v = v&lt;/math&gt;
The scalar multiplication is formerly defined by &lt;math&gt;F \times V \xrightarrow{\phi} V&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi((f,v)) = fv \in V&lt;/math&gt;.

Elements in ''F'' are called scalars, while elements in ''V'' are called vectors.

;Some Properties of Vector Spaces:
#&lt;math&gt;0_F v = 0_V= a0_V&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(-1_F)v = -v&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;av = 0 \iff a = 0 \text{ or } v = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:Proofs:
#&lt;math&gt;0_F v = 0_F v + 0_V = (0_F + 0_F) v = 0_F v + 0_F v \Rightarrow 0_V = 0_F v . Also, a 0_V = a 0_V + 0_V = a(0_V + 0_V) = a0_V v + a0_V  \Rightarrow a0_V = 0_V v&lt;/math&gt;
#We want to show that &lt;math&gt;v + (-1_F)v = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;v + (-1_F)v = 1_F v + (-1_F)v = (1_F + (-1_F))v = 0_Fv = 0_V&lt;/math&gt;
#Suppose &lt;math&gt;av = 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^{-1} (a v) = a^{-1} 0 = 0 \Rightarrow 1_Fv = v = 0&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Asclepias''''', the '''milkweeds''', is a genus of herbaceous perennial, dicotyledonous plants  that contains over 140 known species. It used to belong to the family Asclepiadaceae, but this is now classified as a subfamily [[../Asclepiadoideae/]] of the dogbane family [[../Apocynaceae/]].

==Description==
Milkweeds are an important nectar source for bees and other nectar seeking insects, and a larval food source for monarch butterflies and their relatives, as well as a variety of other herbivorous insects (including numerous beetles, moths, and true bugs) specialized to feed on the plants despite their chemical defenses.  Milkweed is named for its milky juice, which contains alkaloids, caoutchouc, and several other complex compounds including cardenolides. Some species are known to be toxic.

==Growing Conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
Some '''''Asclepias''''' species:

*''[[../Asclepias acida/]]'' - Possibly used to create Soma. 
*''[[../Asclepias amplexicaulis/]]'' (Blunt-leaved milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias asperula/]]'' (Antelope horns)
*''[[../Asclepias curassavica/]]'' (Scarlet milkweed, Bloodroot, Bastard Ipecacuanha)
*''[[../Asclepias exaltata/]]'' (Poke milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias fascicularis/]]'' (Narrow leaf milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias humistrata/]]'' (Sandhill milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias incarnata/]]'' (Swamp milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias lanceolata/]]'' (Lanceolate milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias linearis/]]''
*''[[../Asclepias obovata/]]''
*''[[../Asclepias physocarpa/]]'' (Gomphocarpus physocarpus, commonly balloonplant, balloon cotton-bush or swan plant)
*''[[../Asclepias purpurascens/]]'' (Purple milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias quadrifolia/]]'' (Four-leaved milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias rubra/]]'' (Red milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias speciosa/]]'' (Showy milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias subulata/]]'' (Rush milkweed - Leafless milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias sullivantii/]]'' (Sullivant's milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias syriaca/]]'' (Common milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias tuberosa/]]'' (Butterfly weed, Pleurisy root)
*''[[../Asclepias variegata/]]'' (White milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias verticillata/]]'' (Whorled milkweed)
*''[[../Asclepias vincetoxicum/]]''

==Uses==
In the past, the high dextrose content of the nectar led to milkweed's use as a source of sweetener for Native Americans and voyageurs.

Milkweed latex contains about 1 to 2% caoutchouc, and was attempted as a natural source for rubber by both Germany and the United States during World War II. No record has been found of large-scale success.

Milkweed is a common folk remedy used for removing warts.  Milkweed sap is applied directly to the wart several times daily until the wart falls off.  Dandelion sap is often used in the same manner.

Milkweed is beneficial to nearby plants, repelling some pests, especially wireworms.

Milkweed also contains cardiac glycoside poisons which inhibit animal cells from maintaining a proper K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration gradient. As a result many natives of South America and Africa used arrows poisoned with these glycosides to fight and hunt more effectively.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner, as the pollen is grouped into complex structures called pollinia (or &quot;pollen sacs&quot;), rather than being individual grains, as is typical for plant pollen. The flower petals are smooth and rigid, and the feet of visiting insects (predominantly large wasps, such as spider wasps, which visit the plants for nectar) slip into notches in the flowers, where the sticky bases of the pollinia attach to the feet, pulling the pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off. Bees, including honey bees only gather nectar from milkweed flowers, and are generally not effective pollinators despite the frequency of visitation.

Species in the ''Asclepias'' genus grow their seeds in pods. These seed pods contain soft filaments known as either ''silk'' or ''floss''. The filaments are attached to individual seeds. When the seed pod ripens, the seeds are blown by the wind, each carried by several filaments.

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==

== Description==

This package provides a high level binding to the Windows registry. It is possible to do simple things like reading a key value and creating a new key. This binding handles only key values of type Standard.String. For a full registry API (but at a lower level of abstraction) refer to the Win32.Winreg package provided with the Win32Ada binding. 


An example of how to use this package:

&lt;pre&gt;

with GNAT.registry;
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Exceptions;
with Ada.Strings.Unbounded;

use GNAT.registry;
use Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Exceptions;
use Ada.Strings.Unbounded;

-- This is an example of how to manipulate the windows registry using
-- the GNAT.registry class. It reads in the value of a key if it exists,
-- otherwise, it creates a new key, modifies its value, and then removes the key.

procedure Registry_Manip is

	reg : HKEY;
	key : String := &quot;SOFTWARE\Raytheon&quot;;
	subKey : String := &quot;URL&quot;;
	subKeyValue : String := &quot;http://www.raytheon.com&quot;;
	
	currentValue : Unbounded_String;

begin

	Put_Line(&quot;Creating registry key: &quot; &amp; key);
	reg := Create_Key(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, key);

	Put_Line(&quot;Testing to see if key already exists (key_exists() doesn't work)&quot;);
	begin
		currentValue := To_Unbounded_String(Query_Value(reg, subKey));
		exception
			when Registry_Error =&gt;
				currentValue := To_Unbounded_String(&quot;&quot;); --No Key Found
	end;
	if (currentValue /= &quot;&quot;) then
		Put_Line(&quot;Key Exists! Value: &quot; &amp; To_String(currentValue));
	else
		Put_Line(&quot;Key does not Exist.&quot;);
	end if;

	Put_Line(&quot;Added registry sub-key: &quot; &amp; subKey);
	Put_Line(&quot;      with a value of: &quot; &amp; subKeyValue);
	Set_Value(reg, subKey, subKeyValue);
	
	
--	Put_Line(&quot;Deleting registry sub-key: &quot; &amp; subKey);
--	Delete_Value(reg, subKey);
--	Put_Line(&quot;Deleting registry key: &quot; &amp; key);
--	Delete_Key(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, key);


	Put_Line(&quot;Closing the key&quot;);
	Close_Key(reg);
	

	-- This will catch all Registry_Error exceptions that may be thrown	
	exception
		when E : others =&gt;
           Put_Line(Exception_Name (E) &amp; &quot;: &quot; &amp; Exception_Message (E));

end Registry_Manip;

&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nominative case of Masculine, Feminine and Neuter nouns ==

=== Singular/Jednina ===
Masculine nouns in the nominative case usually do not have a fixed ending. '''Student''', '''pilot''', '''profesor''' are all masculine nouns.

Feminine nouns have a fixed ending. If the '''student''' is female, the noun would change to '''studentica'''. The fixed ending is '''-ica''', or occasionally, just an '''-a''' is there, like '''škola''', ''school'' or '''plaža''', ''beach''.

Neuter nouns end with '''-o''' or '''-e'''. Neuter nouns usually can't be changed to masculine or feminine.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Muški rod (Masculine)
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Ženski rod (Feminine)
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Srednji rod (Neuter)
|- 
| Student || Student + -ica = Studentica || Vino
|-
| Professor || Professor + -ica = Profesorica || Jaje
|}

=== Plural/Množina ===
Masculine nouns, when plural, add '''-i''' onto the end of the word. But some masculine nouns, usually those with one syllable and some with two syllables, end with '''-ov'''/'''-ev''' depending on whether they, in singular, end with palatal consonant, or not. Those masculine nouns, which end with palatal consonant, add '''-evi''' to the stem of the word, and those who don't end with a palatal consonant, add '''-ovi'''.

*Palatal consonants:
j, lj, nj, đ, dž, č, ć, š, ž

Feminine nouns, when plural, replace the '''-a''' with '''-e''' onto the end of the word.

Neuter nouns, when plural, replace the '''-o'''/'''-e''' with '''-a''' onto the end of the word. Some nouns insert '''-en-''' between the stem and the plural, like '''ramena''', ''shoulders''. Also, some neuter nouns only exist in plural form, such as '''vrata''', ''door''. Finally, some nouns have an irregular plural, meaning they don't always end with '''-a''' in plural form, such as '''uho''', ''ear'', in singular, and '''uši''', ''ears'', in plural, or '''oko''', ''eye'', in singular, and '''oči''', ''eyes'' in plural.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!width=&quot;75&quot;|Srednji rod (Neuter)
|- 
| Student + -i = Studenti || Studentica -&gt; Studentic + -e = Studentice || Vino -&gt; Vin  + -a = Vina
|-
| Kralj + -evi = Kraljevi || Profesorica -&gt; Profesoric + -e = Profesorice || Jaje -&gt; Jaj + -a = Jaja
|-
| Grad + -ovi = Gradovi || Škola -&gt; Škol + -e = Škole|| Ime -&gt; Imen + -a = Imena

The bcode templates are designed to be included into pages as templates for specific formatting of code.  Bcode is merely a shortening of Basic Code (though no relation to BASIC or Visual Basic) which represents the fact that these are very simple formats. They're paticularly useful for presentation of code segments that lack formatting via the {{tag|code}} tags, e.g. [[TI-Basic_Z80_Programming/Criteria_Instructions|TI-BASIC]].

Use as follows:
*Call with ''bcode:name'' followed by the arguments, all within two brackets (as a standard template)
*No pre tags needed.
*Italicize variables.

===Available Templates===
There are three formatting styles.
*[[Template:Bcode:Syntax | Syntax]] - The syntax of a programming language function (or any other applicable use)
*[[Template:Bcode:Example | Example]] - An example of a programming language function (or any other applicable use)
*[[Template:Bcode:Output | Output]] - What the output of a program would look like if run

===Syntax===
The first argument is the syntax of a programming language function (or any other applicable use) and the second argument is limitations to the code:
{{bcode:Syntax|
printMessage(''msg'')
|
*Where ''msg'' is a message to output to the user, and ''msg'' must
**be less than 255 characters in length
**end with the '@' character
}}
The code for the above follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{bcode:Syntax|
printMessage(''msg'')
|
*Where ''msg'' is a message to output to the user, and ''msg'' must
**be less than 255 characters in length
**end with the '@' character
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In mainstream [[economics]], the word “'''inflation'''” refers to a general rise in prices measured against a standard level of purchasing power. Previously the term was used to refer to an increase in the money supply, which is now referred to as expansionary monetary policy or [[monetary inflation]]. Inflation is measured by comparing two sets of goods at two points in time, and computing the increase in cost not reflected by an increase in quality. There are, therefore, many measures of inflation depending on the specific circumstances. The most well known are the [[Consumer Price Index | CPI]] which measures consumer prices, and the [[GDP deflator]], which measures inflation in the whole of the domestic economy.

The prevailing view in mainstream economics is that inflation is caused by the interaction of the supply of [[money supply|money]] with output and [[interest rate]]s. Mainstream economist views can be broadly divided into two camps: the &quot;[[monetarist]]s&quot; who believe that monetary effects dominate all others in setting the rate of inflation, and the &quot;[[Keynesian]]s&quot; who believe that the interaction of money, interest and output dominate over other effects.  Other theories, such as those of the [[Austrian school of economics]], believe that an inflation of overall prices is a result from an increase in the supply of money by central banking authorities. 

Related terms include: [[deflation (economics)|deflation]], a general falling level of prices; [[disinflation]], the reduction of the rate of inflation; [[hyper-inflation]], an out-of-control inflationary spiral; [[stagflation]], a combination of inflation and poor economic growth; and [[reflation]], which is an attempt to raise prices to counteract deflationary pressures.

== Measures of inflation ==
===A problem of econometrics===
Measuring inflation is a question of [[econometrics]], finding objective ways of comparing nominal prices to real activity. In many places in economics, &quot;real&quot; variables need to be compared, in order to calculate GDP, effective interest rate and improvements in productivity. Each inflationary measure takes a &quot;basket&quot; of goods and services, then the prices of the items in the basket are compared to a previous time, then adjustments are made for the changes in the goods in the basket itself. For example if a month ago canned corn was sold in 10 oz. jars, and this month it is sold in 9.5 oz jars, then the prices of the two cans have to be adjusted for the contents. The result is the amount of increase in price which is attributed to &quot;inflation&quot; and not to improvements in productivity. 

This means that there are many measures of inflation, depending on which basket of goods and services are used as the basis for comparison. Different kinds of inflation measure are used to determine the real change in prices, depending on what the context is.

===Commonly used measures of inflation=== 
Examples of common measures of inflation include:

* '''[[consumer price index|consumer price indices]]''' (CPIs) which measure the price of a selection of goods purchased by a &quot;typical consumer&quot;.  

* '''[[Cost-of-living index|Cost-of-living indices]]''' (COLI) which often adjust fixed incomes and contractual incomes based on measures of goods and services price changes

* '''[[list index summary analysis]]''' (LISA) which measures the change in volume of peoples' voices.

* '''[[producer price index|producer price indices]]''' (PPIs) which measure the price received by a producer. This differs from the CPI in that price subsidization, profits, and taxes may cause the amount received by the producer to differ from what the consumer paid. There is also typically a delay between an increase in the PPI and any resulting increase in the CPI. Producer price inflation measures the pressure being put on producers by the costs of their raw materials. This could be &quot;passed on&quot; as consumer inflation, or it could be absorbed by profits, or offset by increasing productivity.

* '''[[wholesale price index|wholesale price indices]]''', which measure the change in price of a selection of goods at wholesale, prior to retail mark ups and sales taxes. These are very similar to the Producer Price Indexes. 

* '''[[commodity price index|commodity price indices]]''', which measure the change in price of a selection of commodities. In the present commodity price indexes are weighted by the relative importance of the components to the &quot;all in&quot; cost of an employee.

* '''[[GDP Deflator]]'''s measures price increases in all assets rather than some particular subset. The term &quot;deflator&quot; in this case means the percentage to reduce current prices to get the equivalent price in a previous period. The US Commerce Department publishes a deflator series for the US economy.
au of Labor Statistics breaks down CPI-U calculations down to different regions of the US.

* '''Historical Inflation''' Before collecting consistent econometric data became standard for governments, and for the purpose of comparing absolute, rather than relative standards of living, various economists have calculated imputed inflation figures. Most inflation data before the early 20th century is imputed based on the known costs of goods, rather than compiled at the time. It is also used to adjust for the differences in real standard of living for the presence of technology. This is equivalent to not adjusting the composition of baskets over time.

=== Hedonic adjustments to measuring inflation ===

Inflation measures are often modified over time, either for the relative weight of goods in the basket, or in the way in which goods from the present are compared with goods from the past. This includes [[hedonic adjustments]] and “reweighing” as well as using chained measures of inflation. As with many economic numbers, inflation numbers are often [[seasonally adjusted]] in order to differentiate expected cyclical cost increases, versus changes in the economy. Inflation numbers are averaged or otherwise subjected to statistical techniques in order to remove [[statistical noise]] and [[volatility]] of individual prices. Finally, when looking at inflation, economic institutions sometimes only look at subsets or ''special indices''. One common set is inflation ex-food and energy, which is often called “[[core inflation]]”.

In classical [[political economy]], “inflation” referred to government policy itself: inflation meant increasing the money supply over and above that necessary to accommodate any increase in real GDP, while “deflation” meant decreasing it. Some economists in a few schools of economic thought, generally described as libertarian, classical liberal, or ultra-conservative, still retain this usage. In mainstream economic terms these would be referred to as expansionary and contractionary monetary policies.

== The role of inflation in the economy ==
In the long run, inflation is generally believed to be a monetary phenomenon, while in the short and medium term, it is influenced by the relative elasticity of wages, prices and interest rates. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2004/july/testimony.htm ''Federal Reserve Board's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress''];
[http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/Speeches/2003/20030723/Economics Roundtable];
[http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2004/html/is040701.en.html ''Introductory statement by Jean-Claude Trichet on 1 July 2004]''&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether the short-term effects last long enough to be important is the central topic of debate between monetarist and Keynesian schools. In [[monetarism]], prices and wages adjust quickly enough to make other factors merely marginal behavior on a general trendline. In the Keynesian view, prices and wages adjust at different rates, and these differences have enough effects on real output to be &quot;long term&quot; in the view of people in an economy.

A great deal of economic literature concerns the question of what causes inflation and what effect it has.  A small amount of inflation is often viewed as having a positive effect on the economy.  One reason for this is that it is difficult to renegotiate some prices, and particularly wages, downwards, so that with generally increasing prices it is easier for relative prices to adjust. Many prices are &quot;sticky downward&quot; and tend to creep upward, so that efforts to attain a zero inflation rate (a constant price level) punish other sectors with falling prices, profits, and employment. Efforts to attain complete price stability can also lead to [[deflation (economics)|deflation]], which is generally viewed as a negative outcome because of the significant downward adjustments in wages and output that are associated with it.

Inflation is also viewed as a hidden risk pressure that provides an incentive for those with savings to invest them, rather than have the purchasing power of those savings erode through inflation. In investing inflation risks often cause investors to take on more [[systematic risk]], in order to gain returns that will stay ahead of expected inflation. Inflation is also used as an index for cost of living adjustments and as a peg for some bonds. In effect, inflation is the rate at which previous economic transactions are [[discounted]] economically.

Inflation also gives central banks room to maneuver, since their primary tool for controlling the money supply and [[velocity of money]] is by setting the lowest interest rate in an economy - the discount rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank. Since borrowing at negative interest is generally ineffective, a positive inflation rate gives central bankers &quot;ammunition&quot;, as it is sometimes called, to stimulate the economy.

However, in general, inflation rates above the nominal amounts required to give monetary freedom, and investing incentive, are regarded as negative, particularly because in current economic theory, inflation begets further inflationary expectations. 

*Increasing ''uncertainty'' may discourage investment and saving.
*''Redistribution''
** It will redistribute income from those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, and shifts it to those who draw a variable income, for example from wages and profits which may keep pace with inflation.
** Similarly it will redistribute wealth from those who lend a fixed amount of money to those who borrow.  For example, where the government is a net debtor, as is usually the case, it will reduce this [[debt]] redistributing money towards the government.  Thus inflation is sometimes viewed as similar to a hidden [[tax]].
* ''International trade'': If the rate of inflation is higher than that abroad, a fixed [[exchange rate]] will be undermined through a weakening [[balance of trade]].
*''Shoe leather costs'': Because the value of cash is eroded by inflation, people will tend to hold less cash during times of inflation.  This imposes real costs, for example in more frequent trips to the bank. (The term is a humorous reference to the cost of replacing shoe leather worn out when walking to the bank.)
*''Menu costs'': Firms must change their prices more frequently, which imposes costs, for example with restaurants having to reprint menus.
*''Relative Price Distortions'': Firms do not generally synchronize adjustment in prices. If there is higher inflation, firms that do not adjust their prices will have much lower prices relative to firms that do adjust them. This will distort economic decisions, since relative prices will not be reflecting relative scarcity of different goods. 
*''Hyperinflation'': if inflation gets totally out of control (in the upward direction), it can grossly interfere with the normal workings of the economy, hurting its ability to supply. 
*''Inflation tax'' when a government can improve its net financial position by allowing inflation, then this represents a tax on certain holders of currency. Governments may decide to use this &quot;stealth tax&quot; in order to avoid hard fiscal decisions to cut expenditures, raise taxes, or confront government unions with greater efficiency. 
*''Bracket Creep'' is related to the inflation tax. By allowing inflation to move upwards, certain sticky aspects of the tax code are met by more and more people. Commonly income tax brackets, where the next dollar of income is taxed at a higher rate than previous dollars. Governments that allow inflation to &quot;bump&quot; people over these thresholds are, in effect, allowing a tax increase because the same real purchasing power is being taxed at a higher rate.

As noted, some economists see moderate inflation as a benefit; some business executives see mild inflation as &quot;greasing the wheels of commerce.&quot; A very few economists have advocated reducing inflation to zero as a monetary policy goal - particularly in the late 1990s at the end of a long disinflationary period, when the policy seemed within reach.

== Causes of inflation ==

There are different schools of thought as to what causes inflation. Most can be divided into two broad areas: quality theories of inflation, and quantity theories of inflation. Many theories of inflation combine the two. The quality theory of inflation rests on the expectation of a buyer accepting currency to be able to exchange that currency at a later time for goods that are desirable as a buyer.  The quantity theory of inflation rests on the equation of the money supply, its velocity, and exchanges. [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] proposed a quantity theory of inflation for money, and a quality theory of inflation for production. 

[[Keynesian]] economic theory proposes that money is transparent to real forces in the economy, and that visible inflation is the result of pressures in the economy expressing themselves in prices.

There are three major types of inflation, as part of what [http://faculty-web.at.nwu.edu/economics/gordon/indexlayers.html Robert J. Gordon] calls the &quot;'''triangle model'''&quot;:
*'''[[Demand pull inflation]]''': inflation from high demand for goods and low unemployment.
*'''[[Cost push inflation]]''': presently termed &quot;supply shock inflation,&quot; from an event such as a sudden decrease in the supply of oil, which would increase oil prices.  Producers for whom oil is a part of their costs could then pass this on to consumers in the form of increased prices.
*'''[[Built-in inflation]]''': induced by [[adaptive expectations]], often linked to the &quot;[[price/wage spiral]]&quot; because it involves workers trying to keep their wages up with prices and then employers passing higher costs on to consumers as higher prices as part of a &quot;vicious circle.&quot; Built-in inflation reflects events in the past, and so might be seen as [[hangover inflation]].

A major demand-pull theory centers on the supply of money: inflation may be caused by an increase in the quantity of [[money]] in circulation relative to the ability of the economy to supply (its [[potential output]]).  This has been seen most graphically when governments have financed spending in a crisis by printing money excessively (from war or civil war conditions), often leading to [[hyperinflation]] where prices rise at extremely high rates (such as, doubling every month).  Another cause can be a rapid decline in the ''demand'' for money as happened in Europe during the black plague. 

The [[money supply]] is also thought to play a major role in determining levels of more moderate levels of inflation, although there are differences of opinion on how important it is.  For example, [[Monetarism|Monetarist]] economists believe that the link is very strong; [[Keynesian economics]] by contrast typically emphasize the role of [[aggregate demand]] in the economy rather than the money supply in determining inflation. That is, for Keynesians, the money supply is only one determinant of aggregate demand.

A fundamental concept in such Keynesian analysis is the relationship between inflation and [[unemployment]], called the [[Phillips curve]].  This model suggested that price stability was a [[trade off]] against employment.  Therefore some level of inflation could be considered desirable in order to minimize unemployment.  The Philips curve model described the U.S. experience well in the 1960s but failed to describe the combination of rising inflation and economic stagnation (sometimes referred to as ''[[stagflation]]'') experienced in the 1970s. 

Thus, modern macroeconomics describes inflation using a Phillips curve that ''shifts'' (so the trade-off between inflation and unemployment changes) because of such matters as supply shocks and inflation becoming built into the normal workings of the economy. The former refers to such events as the oil shocks of the 1970s, while the latter refers to the [[price/wage spiral]] and [[inflationary expectations]] implying that the economy &quot;normally&quot; suffers from inflation. Thus, the Phillips curve represents only the [[demand pull inflation|demand-pull]] component of the triangle model.

Another Keynesian concept is the [[potential output]] (sometimes called the &quot;[[natural gross domestic product]]&quot;), a level of [[GDP]] where the economy is at its optimal level of production, given institutional and natural constraints. (This level of output corresponds to the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment, [[NAIRU]], or the &quot;natural&quot; rate of unemployment or the full-employment unemployment rate.)  If GDP exceeds its potential (and unemployment is below the NAIRU), the theory says that inflation will ''accelerate'' as suppliers increase their prices and built-in inflation worsens.  If GDP falls below its potential level (and unemployment is above the NAIRU), inflation will ''decelerate'' as suppliers attempt to fill excess capacity, cutting prices and undermining built-in inflation.

However, one problem with this theory for policy-making purposes is that the exact level of potential output (and of the NAIRU) is generally unknown and tends to change over time. Inflation also seems to act in an asymmetric way, rising more quickly than it falls.  Worse, it can change because of policy: for example, high unemployment under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK may have led to a rise in the NAIRU (and a fall in potential) because many of the unemployed found themselves as [[Structural unemployment|structurally unemployed]] (also see [[unemployment]]), unable to find jobs that fit their skills in the British economy. A rise in structural unemployment implies that a smaller percentage of the labor force can find jobs at the NAIRU, where the economy avoids crossing the threshold into the realm of accelerating inflation.

=== Problems of inflation ===

If inflation is high in an economy there are three main problems it can cause:

# People on a fixed income (e.g. pensioners, students) will be worse off in real terms due to higher prices and equal income as before; this will lead to a reduction in the purchasing power of their income.
# Rising inflation can encourage trade unions to demand higher wages. This can cause a [[wage spiral]]. Also if strikes occur in an important industry which has a comparative advantage the nation may see a decrease in productivity and suffer.
# If inflation is relatively higher in one country, exports will become more expensive for other countries to purchase, this will create a deficit on the current account.

=== Monetarism ===

One of the most influential schools of economic thinking rests on a quantity theory of money, namely monetarism. Monetarists assert that empirical study of monetary history shows that &quot;inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&quot;  Modern mainstream central bank practice until recently adhered closely to this concept. 

These economists derive this belief from what is known as the [[Quantity Theory of Money]]. The Quantity Theory of Money, simply stated, is that the total amount of spending in an economy is primarily determined by the total amount of money in existence. From this theory the following formula is created:

&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{D_C}{S_C}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the general price level of consumers' goods, &lt;math&gt;D_C&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate demand for consumers' goods and &lt;math&gt;S_C&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate supply of consumers' goods. The idea behind this formula is that the general price level of consumers' goods will rise only if the aggregate supply of consumers' goods goes down relative to the aggregate demand for consumers' goods, or if the aggregate demand increases relative to the aggregate supply of consumers' goods. Based on the idea that total spending is based primarily on the total amount of money in existence, the economists calculate aggregate demand for consumers' goods based on the total quantity of money. Therefore, they posit that as the quantity of money increases, total spending increases and the aggregate demand for consumers' goods increases as well. For this reason the economists who believe in the Quantity Theory of Money also believe that the only cause for rising prices in a growing economy (this means aggregate supply of consumers' goods is increasing), is an increase of the total quantity of money in existence, which is caused by monetary policies, generally of [[central bank]]s where there is a monopoly on currency issue and the lack of a commodity peg to currency. The [[central bank]] of the United States is the [[Federal Reserve]]; the central bank backing the [[euro]] is the [[European Central Bank]].

=== Rational expectations ===
Rational expectations theory, sometimes known as “ratex” &lt;!-- google for quick confirmation --&gt; or as “rashex”, is a view of macroeconomics that states that economic actors look rationally into the future and try and maximize their general sense of future states of well-being, and do not simply respond to the immediate opportunity cost and pressures of the present. In this view, while generally grounded in monetarism, future expectations and strategies are important for inflation as well. 

One core assertion of rational expectations theory is that actors will seek to “head off” central bank decisions, by acting preemptively and in ways that may themselves fulfill the predictions that drive them. This means that central banks must establish their credibility in fighting inflation, or have economic actors make bets that the economy will expand, believing that the central bank will expand the money supply rather than allow a recession which would be very damaging to the economy, and possibly require government bailouts.

In this view central banks might be at an advantage renouncing some flexibility of monetary policy, in order to persuade economic actors that the bank will not allow it.

=== Other theories ===

==== Austrian School ====

[[Austrian School|Austrian School]] economics falls within the general tradition of the quantity theory of money, but is notable for providing a theory of the process whereby, upon an increase of the money supply, a new equilibrium is pursued. More specifically, possessors of the additional money are held to react to their new purchasing power by changing their buying habits in a way that generally increases demand for goods and for services. Austrian School economists do not believe that production will simply rise to meet all this new demand, so that prices increase and the new purchasing power erodes.  The Austrian School emphasizes that this process is not instantaneous, and that the changes in demand are not distributed uniformly, so that the process does not ultimately lead to an equilibrium identical to the old except for some proportionate increase in prices; that “nominal” values thus have real effects. Austrian economists tend to view fiat increases in the money supply as particularly pernicious in their real effects.  This view typically leads to the support for a [[commodity]] standard of a very strict variety where all notes are convertible on demand to some commodity or basket of commodities. (The more popular of the Austrian economists tend to favor a [[gold standard]].)

==== Marxist theory ====

In [[Marxist economics]], value is based on the labor required to extract a given commodity versus the demand for that commodity by those with money. The fluctuations of price in money terms are inconsequential compared to the rise and fall of the labor cost of a commodity, since this determines the true cost of a good or service. In this, Marxist economics is related to other &quot;classical&quot; economic theories that argue that monetary inflation is caused solely by printing notes in excess of the basic quantity of gold. However, Marx argues that the real kind of inflation is in the cost of production measured in labor. Because of the classical labor theory of value, the only factor that is important is whether more or less labor is required to produce a given commodity at the rate it is demanded.

==== Supply-side economics ====

[[Supply-side economics]] asserts that inflation is always caused by either an increase in the supply of money or a decrease in the demand for balances of money. The value of money is seen as being purely subject to these two factors. Thus the inflation experienced during the [[Black Plague]] in medieval Europe is seen as being caused by a decrease in the demand for money (the money stock used was gold coin and it was relatively fixed), whilst the inflation of the 1970s is regarded as initially caused by an increased supply of money that occurred following the US exit from the Bretton Woods [[gold standard]]. [[Supply-side economics]] asserts that the money supply can grow without causing inflation as long as the demand for balances of money also grows.

=== Issues of classical political economy ===
While economic theory before the &quot;marginal revolution&quot; is no longer the basis for current economic theory, many of the institutions, concepts, and terms used in economics come from the &quot;classical&quot; period of political economy, including monetary policy, quantity and quality theories of economics, central banking, velocity of money, price levels and division of the economy into production and consumption. For this reason debates about present economics often reference problems of classical political economy, particularly the classical gold standard of 1871-1913, and the currency versus banking debates of that period.

==== Currency and Banking Schools ====

Within the context of a fixed specie basis for money, one important controversy was between the &quot;Quantity Theory&quot; of money and the [[Real bills doctrine|Real Bills Doctrine]], or RBD. Within this context, quantity theory applies to the level of fractional reserve accounting allowed against specie, generally gold, held by a bank. The RBD argues that banks should also be able to issue currency against bills of trading, which is &quot;real bills&quot; that they buy from merchants. This theory was important in the 19th century in debates between &quot;Banking&quot; and &quot;Currency&quot; schools of monetary soundness, and in the formation of the [[Federal Reserve]]. In the wake of the collapse of the international gold standard post 1913, and the move towards deficit financing of government, RBD has remained a minor topic, primarily of interest in limited contexts, such as [[currency board]]s. It is generally held in ill repute today, with [[Frederic Mishkin]] going so far as to say it had been &quot;completely discredited.&quot; Even so, it has theoretical support from a few economists, particularly those that see restrictions on a particular class of credit as incompatible with [[libertarian]] principles of laissez-faire, even though almost all libertarian economists are opposed to the RBD.

The debate between currency, or quantity theory, and banking schools in Britain during the 19th century prefigures current questions about the credibility of money in the present. In the 19th century the banking school had greater influence in policy in the United States and Great Britain, while the currency school had more influence &quot;on the continent&quot;, that is in non-British countries, particularly in the Latin Monetary Union and the earlier Scandinavia monetary union.

==== Anti-classical or backing theory ====

Another issue associated with classical political economy is the anti-classical hypothesis of money, or &quot;backing theory&quot;. The backing theory [http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp830.pdf] argues that the value of money is determined by the assets and liabilities of the issuing agency. Unlike the Quantity Theory of classical political economy, the backing theory argues that issuing authorities can issue money without causing inflation so long as the money issuer has sufficient assets to cover redemptions.

== Controlling inflation ==
[[Image:US-Inflation-by-year.png|thumb|Annual inflation rates in the United States of America, 1914-2006.]]
There are a number of methods that have been suggested to stop inflation. [[Central bank]]s such as the U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] can affect inflation to a significant extent through setting interest rates and through other operations (that is,  using [[monetary policy]]).  High [[interest rate]]s (and slow growth of the money supply) are the traditional way that central banks fight inflation, using unemployment and the decline of production to prevent price increases.

However, central banks view the means of controlling the inflation differently. For instance, some follow a [[symmetrical inflation target]] while others only control inflation when it rises above a target, whether express or implied.

Monetarists emphasize increasing interest rates (reducing the money supply, [[monetary policy]]) to fight inflation.  Keynesians emphasize reducing demand in general, often through [[fiscal policy]], using increased taxation or reduced government spending to reduce demand as well as by using monetary policy.  [[supply-side economics|Supply-side economists]] advocate fighting inflation by fixing the exchange rate between the currency and some reference currency such as gold. This would be a return to the [[gold standard]]. All of these policies are achieved in practice through a process of [[open market operations]].

Another method attempted is simply instituting wage and price controls (&quot;[[incomes policies]]'). Wage and price controls have been successful in wartime environments in combination with rationing. However, their use in other contexts is far more mixed. Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon. In general wage and price controls are regarded as a drastic measure, and only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce the underlying causes of inflation during the wage and price control regime, for example, winning the war being fought. Many developed nations set prices extensively, including for basic commodities as gasoline. The usual economic analysis is that that which is under priced is overconsumed, and that the distortions that occur will force adjustments in supply. For example, if the official price of bread is too low, there will be too little bread at official prices. 

Temporary controls may ''complement'' a recession as a way to fight inflation: the controls make the recession more efficient as a way to fight inflation (reducing the need to increase [[unemployment]]), while the recession prevents the kinds of distortions that controls cause when demand is high. However, in general the advice of economists is not to impose price controls, but to liberalize prices, assuming that the economy will adjust, abandoning unprofitable economic activity. The lower activity will place fewer demands on whatever commodities were driving inflation, whether labor or resources, and inflation will fall with total economic output. This often produces a severe recession, as productive capacity is reallocated, and is thus often very unpopular with the people whose livelihoods are destroyed. (See [[Creative destruction]])

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page, and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:11, 18 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

Emphasis on inorganic compounds - is an hallmark component of weak textbooks and lousy instructors in inorganic chemistry (as in organic chemistry).  I know because I have taught this subject many times - we have all heard the refrain from beginning chemistry students - but, but professor, you must know how to name your compounds, shouldnt we?  Ans: not really,  Inorganic and organometallic chemists work more with formulas and get along marvelously.  Nomenclature is a topic that draws chemically illiterates like flies to honey.  So please, please do not let nomenclature stand at the front of this wikibook!  --[[User:130.126.226.125|130.126.226.125]] 00:36, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

== how is this different from physical chemistry? ==

I'm not an expert at chemistry, so I don't understand the difference between inorganic and physical chemistry.

| description = A raccoon is a nocturnal mammal in the genus Procyon of the Procyonidae family. Raccoons are unusual for their thumbs, which – though not opposable – enable them to open many closed containers such as garbage cans and doors. They are intelligent omnivores with a reputation for being clever and mischievous. Raccoons range from 50 to 100 cm in length (including the tail) and weigh between 4.5 and 16 kg. The raccoon's tail ranges from 20 to 40 cm in length. Male raccoons are generally larger than females.

The hind foot prints are deeper than the front because it carries most of the raccoon's weight. The hind foot has an elongated heel, while the heel of the front foot does not generally print at all.  The &quot;palm&quot; of the front foot may be shaped like the letter &quot;C&quot;, while the print of the hind foot looks somewhat like a human baby's hand print.  The left front foot prints next to the right hind foot and vice versa.

|range = Raccoons are found in urban areas as we as in the wilderness.  Tracks are often found on stream banks, or around garbage cans and on automobiles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Don't Break It'''! Easier said than done I know, but it suggests a certain caution when disassembling and reassembling systems and components. You should have a basic amount of knowledge about the configuration and hazards before attempting to disassemble and troubleshoot any system.  The general rule of thumb is if a diagnostic test can be done without damage to the unit....do it.

If a system schematic is available, be sure to have that in hand before beginning the troubleshooting process.  If no schematic is available, it may be a good starting point to develop some rough sketch.  This will help you logically understand the components for the system, and will assist in re-assembly if necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Is it Broken to begin with'''? May seem like a stupid question but knowing your intended results makes alot of difference. This knowledge will help determine when you have solved the problem and when to stop and pick up the pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Don't cause any more problems'''... This belongs with the [[System Troubleshooting/Don't Break It|Don't Break It]] rule but it relates to &quot;I wonder if I do this what will happen&quot; scenario. When attempting anything you should have a hypothesis about the expected result and look for those results. This will establish experience and help you grow as a troubleshooter. It is alright to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. Frying 10 capacitors in a single lab because you bottomed out the rheostat is not a learning experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Establishing a start and end'''. This is a vital component in the trouble shooting a system. Breaking systems down in this manner gives you a beginning and ending location for the troubleshooting.
In an electrical system this would be where the power enters the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most systems can be subdivided into smaller components.  This is due to the fact that most large systems cannot be done by one person alone.  Breaking the system into smaller components will simplify design and increase understanding of the big picture.  This also allows for versatility in design by plug-n-playing different components together to achieve a larger or customizable system. 

The jargon term for not knowing what the systems operations are but the expected results off of a given input is '''black box'''.  What this means is I do not necessarily have to know what the component does as long as I know what is sent and the result that is produced.  

You will run into may components that you are not sure of how they work but as long as you know what you are sending and the expended results are occurring they are normally working properly. Problems occur when a problem happens &quot;some of the time&quot; or under certain conditions.  There can be many problems with this and isolating the condition and component will further your understanding into the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once the system is sectionalized and the section of the problem is narrowed further you will find yourself testing components.  An understanding of each component's properties will help you greatly in understanding the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== An Evaluation of IT as A Professional Field ==

=== Finn's Criteria for Profession ===

Finn (1953) explained the characteristics of a profession: “. . . (a) an intellectual technique, (b) an application of that technique to the practical affairs of man, (c) a period of long training necessary before entering into the profession, (d) an association of the members of the profession into closely-knit group with a high quality of communication between members, (e) a series of standards and a statement of ethics which is enforced, and (f) an organized body of intellectual theory constantly expanding by research.” (p. 232). Recent situation of the field of IT is going to be evaluated in the following sections. 

=== An Intellectual Technique === 

Today, IT field has five domains, design, develop, utilization, management, and evaluation, including their own intellectual techniques (Seels &amp; Richey, 1994). For the design domain, the professional people design effective instructions from need assessment to evaluation phase by applying learning theories to design of instruction, making decision about delivery methods and its appropriate design issues, and assessing characteristics of people for instruction (What is instructional technology?, n.d.). To conduct that processes, there are many different models and tools, such as ADDIE model, Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction, Need Analysis, and etc. For the development domain, instructional technologies make their design document applicable in which the instruction is going to be implemented. Januszewski (2001) asserted that instructional development is an intellectual technique for educational technology. The field has gained the process orientation by concepts and activities collected under instructional development. The methodologies differ based on the product to be developed. For example, if the product is educational software, IT professional design story boards or event charts that are useful for the development phase of the software. For the utilization domain, IT professionals are in charge of knowledge utilization, classroom use of AV materials and technology, instructional program material implementation separated from design, and utilization of changes, policies and regulations, institutionalization. Classroom use of AV materials was identified as the first professional intellectual technique of IT (Finn, 1953). For the management domain, IT professionals can involve or conduct project management, resource management, delivery systems management, information management, and change management processes. For example, forming teams for the projects or controlling adaptation of an innovation into organizations are some of the tasks they are responsible. For evaluation part, professionals can perform problem analysis, criterion referenced measurement, formative, summative, and confirmative evaluations. For example, an instructional technologist can collect data regarding effectiveness of a training program and make decision about the program, participants, and overall impact on the organization.          

=== Practical Application of the Technique === 

We can easily observe a huge number of applications of instructional technology field. For example, usage of computers in general education as well as integration of technology into teacher training programs, web based learning environments, on-line universities, application of performance improvement interventions, training programs and evaluations, open universities, teleconference supported distance learning, multimedia product development companies, computer adaptive testing and so on. For every step of these applications, well trained instructional technologists are required.

=== Long Period of Training ===

Currently, the field of instructional technology has own master, philosophy of doctorate, and educational doctorate program overall the world. A number of people are graduated from the programs every year. The programs are located generally under educational psychology, curriculum and instruction, and educational administration departments with respect to their emphasized approaches. Even though each program differs from each other in some points, there are a lot of common courses and curriculum. Main areas emphasized in the IT curriculum are teacher training, K-12 education, interactive technologies or multimedia, human performance technology, and human-computer interaction. Graduates of IT can work as academicians, media specialists, performance consultants, multimedia or web based course developers and designers, training managers and etc. As Finn (1953) stated in his profession evaluation that the training period of IT has been more theoretical based rather than apprenticeship training. The programs propose that they teach all necessary competencies necessary for IT professionals. A survey results points out that many universities offering IT education includes many of the basics for training developers and instructional designers but there are still additional courses (Morlan &amp; Lu, 1993). Hence, the result illustrates that the university curriculum cannot meet the professional trainers and instructional designers in the field. This study also shows the improvement of IT programs to meet the professional need of the field. 

=== Association and Communication between Members === 

Today there are a number of associations dedicated to the field of IT. For example, Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT), American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI), International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE), Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE) are the most famous organizations (Associations and Organizations for Instructional Technology, n.d.). The establishment of these institutions effect greatly professional development by funding studies related to competencies and sponsoring conferences to encourage and proliferate research and development of the field (Larson, 2004). Quality communication between the members are being succeeded by not only conferences but also journals published. For example, Educational Research and Development and TechTrends by AECT, The Journal of Research fir Technology in Education and Learning and Leading with Technology by ISTE, Performance Improvement Journal and Performance Improvement Quarterly by ISPI, Educational Technology Review and Journal of Technology and Teacher Education by AACE are only a few part of the journal in the IT field. In addition to the conferences and journals, there are some listserv, such as ITFORUM, DISTED, EDTECH, EDUTEL, and WWWEDU (Associations and Organizations for Instructional Technology, n.d.). They support on-line discussion between the members of the field via using e-mail. 

=== Code of Ethics and Standards ===

With the support of the leading organizations, there are a number of standards and code of ethics. AECT’s A Code of Professional Ethics (2001) and ISTE’s Code of Ethics for Members of the Organization (2005) and National Educational Technology Standards (2000), and Standards of Performance Technology and Code of Ethics (2002a, 2002b) are the some of important examples.

=== Intellectual Theory and Research ===

On the contrary of Finn evaluation in 1953, currently the field of IT and its professionals are challenging not only practical but also theoretical concerns. The constant interaction between theory and practice are now clearer because the field of IT has determined its roots systems theory, behavioral psychology, and audio-visual education. The systems theories support the field with analysis and synthesis activities. This root also provides field with engineering thinking for the usage of educational activities. It extends the interaction between AV and communication thinking. Moreover individualized instruction and learning theories (Januszewski, 2001), programmed instruction and teaching machines, and psychological testing (Skinner, 1958) are only some of the examples of utilization stemmed from behavioral psychology in IT field. An AV root of the IT is extended with the addition of communication theories and systems theories. As well as three roots shape the theoretical foundations of the IT field, Human Performance Technology brings business theories, such as Scarce Resource Theory, Human Capital Theory, and Sustainable Resource Theory (Swanson, 1999). 

In the IT field, currently researchers can produce hypothesis based on the wide range scope of theories. That is why the field is open to expand and improve its knowledge and technique. Moreover, there are constant assessments of practical applications. 

As a result of this, new theories are being emerged to make the field’s practice making sense for all professionals. The huge number of scholar journals and publications are the strongest evidence for the improvement of intellectual theory and practice. 

=== Summary ===

The six criteria of Finn (1953) for a profession show that the field of IT has been already a profession. Even though it has some practical problems that are also the same in the other professions, it has been satisfying all of the criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The mouth is the entry point for our nutrition.  The most obvious function is to masticate, or chew, food to a size and texture able to pass through the [[../Esophagus|esophagus]] to the [[../Stomach|stomach]].  Many more things happen in the mouth.  Saliva contains enzymes that begin to break down food.  The nerves of the brain send signals to the rest of the digestive tract to prepare for digestion.  Both fluids and chewed foods have to be passed to the back of the throat and into the [[../Esophagus|esophagus]] without blocking the breathing tube (the [[../Trachea|trachea]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The esophagus is a soft tube that is usually about 25 centimeters in length.  When food or liquids are passed from the [[../Mouth|mouth]], it is pushed down the esophagus by circular muscles.  These muscles squeeze in top to bottom order, pushing the food and liquid down, like toothpaste being pushed through a tube.  At the bottom of the esophagus is a barrier called a sphincter.  This muscle is like a door that opens to let the esophagus contents enter the [[../Stomach|stomach]].  The sphincter then closes to keep [[../Stomach|stomach]] contents from coming up.  Sometimes this muscle doesn't work well and [[../Stomach|stomach]] juices splash into the esophagus causing acid reflux and heartburn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The stomach is the place where food and liquids that pass from the [[../Esophagus|esophagus]] are stored and prepared for digestion.  The upper part of the stomach is called the fundus.  This part of the stomach stretches to make room for large meals.  The food and liquid is then ground up by the lower part of stomach, call the antrum.  As the food is broken down to tiny particles, stomach juices, including acid and pepsin, begin to break down the food further.  Liquids tend to leave the stomach first.  When the food is small enough, it passes through the pyloric valve, into the [[../Small intestine|small bowel]].

: I think what Whiteknight meant here was that you need to create an &quot;umbrella&quot; to put all these pages under.  Since they appear to be chapters of a book, they need to be organized as chapters rather than as stand-alone books.  You are encouraged to continue creating pages, but they need a top level of organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The small intestine is where food breakdown continues and absorption of nutrition occurs.  The small intestine is about 7 meters long and is divided into three sections: duodenum, jejunum and ileum.  Different types of nutrition are absorbed in the different sections of the small bowel.

As food passes from the [[../Stomach|stomach]], it is bathed in secretions of the [[../Liver|liver]] (bile) and [[../Pancreas|pancreas]], breaking down fats and proteins and carbohydrates.  There are small, finger-like projections from the surface of the small bowel, call villi.  If you look under a microscope you can see where much of the nutrition breakdown and absorption occurs.

Eventually, most of the nutrients are extracted from the food and the waste is passed into the [[../Colon|colon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Robert M. Gagne'''

A true gentleman and scholar, Robert M. Gagne devoted his career to research in learning and the application of instruction.  

''The Legacy of Robert M. Gagne'' &lt;ref&gt;Richey, R.C.(Ed.). (2000). The Legacy of Robert M. Gagne. Syracuse, N.Y.: Clearinghouse on Information and Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;is an authoritative work on the contributions of Gagne to the field of instructional technology (IT). This edited book provides a historical overview of his life and work, including articles by six authors. This work examines Gagne's major ideas (models of human behavior learning, the cumulative learning model, learning hierarchies, domains of learning, mastery learning, and integrative goals for instructional learning). It examines the impact of these ideas on the IT field and concludes by asking how his work will impact the future of IT.

The following is a link to Wikipedia which also provides information on Robert M. Gagne.

==FREEFEM: a PDE solver==

=== Summary ===
The project freefem has two branches: the 2D solver (freefem++) is mature and well documented and used by many while the 3D solver (freefem3D) is still under construction but one is welcome to use it.

The code is open source and can be downloaded from the [http://www.freefem.org freefem web site]

To solve a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) or set of equations with freefem one must first write an algorithm which uses only linear  systems (one or more) of PDE as intermediate steps.

Then each system must be well posed, i.e. provided with admissible boundary conditions and written in ''variational form''.
For instance Dirichlet's problem

&lt;math&gt; -\Delta v=f~\hbox{ in }D,~~v|_{\partial D}=g&lt;/math&gt;

defines in an open set D of the plane a scalar function v(x,y) at every point (x,y) of D;  v would be the electrostatic potential in the vacuum  with charge density f(x,y) around objects of boundary əD at potential g(x,y).

The automatic triangulation, the finite element solver and the graphics are integrated in freefem and driven by a ''freefem script''.

 [[Image:FreeFEM%2B%2B_CS_Example_-_Dirichlet.png|600px|center|A snapshot of a PC screen executing freefem++]]

=== Example ===
The Dirichlet problem above can be solved with freefem++ by the following script

&lt;pre&gt;
border C(t=0,2*pi){x=5*cos(t); y=5*sin(t);}
mesh Th = buildmesh (C(50)); 
fespace Vh(Th,P1);     // says that we will use linear triangular elements
Vh u,v;                // defines u and v as piecewise-P1 continuous functions 
func f= x*y;           // definition of a function called f

real cpu=clock();      // optional

solve Poisson(u,v) 
      =  int2d(Th)(dx(u)*dx(v) + dy(u)*dy(v)) // bilinear part 
         - int2d(Th)( f*v)   // right hand side of the variational form
         + on(C,u=0) ;       // Dirichlet boundary condition (g=0)

plot(u); 
cout &lt;&lt; &quot; CPU time = &quot; &lt;&lt; clock()-cpu &lt;&lt; endl; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The brain is the organ that harbors our selves, our thinking, feelings, personalities and consciousness. We conclude this from experiments that demonstrate activity of the brain. How the brain works in detail is a great mystery to this day for most of the aspects mentioned, however.

=== What does the brain look like? ===
[[Image:Human_brain_NIH.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Macroscopic view: a human brain.]]

[[Image:Neuron1.jpg|thum|right|300px|Microscopic view: a neuron.]]

The brain fills the interior of our skulls and is composed of several lobes (round shaped parts that are interconnected). There is an exterior part - the grey substance(grey matter) - and an interior part - the white substance(white matter), as revealed by a cross section. The brain is mainly composed of neurons (cells that can transmit electrical signals) and supporting cells (glia cells). As for most other organs there are blood vessels and immune cells too. Neurons have a main body and many extensions. Dendrites are extensions to receive signals and one single axon transmits electrical signals to other neurons. The main body is a bit darker than dendrites or axons and are predominantly located in the grey substance, thereby giving it its color.

=== What is the function of the brain? ===

The brain receives input from cranial nerves and the medulla. These signals are processed by our brain. You can actually feel it right now, because you consciously know, that you are reading this page - which is a conscious visual input. Also you hear sounds, you feel emotions, you feel being touched, tickled and so on. All these are conscious reactions to input. Of course, we react to this input by changing our mood, moving or thinking. Body movements are being commanded by the brain through the nerves and the medulla, too. Cranial nerves and medulla therefore have fibers dealing with input and others that deal with output.

=== What organ system(s) is the brain connected with? ===

The brain is actually connected with almost every other organ of the body. We can sense the top of our head, our toe-tips and we can frown as well as walk. Also organs like the stomach, thymus or spleen are connected with the brain. We cannot feel these organs, which is an example of unconscious processing of input and output by the brain.

=== How does the brain interact with other parts of the body? ===

The brain connects to other organs by means of axons and dendrites. Electrical signals trigger reactions in connected organs, whereas sensory nerve endings (dendrites or other specialized structures) help collecting input. For example, in muscles electrical signals are converted into chemical signals eliciting muscular contraction via the sliding filament hypothesis.

=== How can you keep your brain healthy? ===

Exercising your brain will keep it in great shape and will help you to continue learning and become quicker in understanding. This includes reading, solving riddles or just being active: outdoors exploring nature, indoors doing sports. Watching TV, however, is passive and will not help you improving your brainy skills. Some sports like boxing or bungee jumping are known to damage neurons and you should avoid them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Watsinaname, welcome to wikibooks!

The APDIP project has been completed for some time now, and beside a little bit of proof-reading here and there no additional help is needed.

I started getting involved in the same way you are, I was using wikipedia to research things for school, and then I started uploading notes from my classes. What subjects do you like? Do you want to author books or do you want to edit existing books? We have many many books here that have been abandoned by their original authors, so if you find a book that you want to help out you are more then welcome to dive right in and start making improvements. Or, if you want to try writing your own new book, there is plenty of opportunity for that here too. 

Let me know what you are interested in and I can help to get you set up. You can ask me a question [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]] any time, and I typically answer pretty quickly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:24, 19 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter doesn't identify what any of the variables mean. It's as though it's a textbook on Acoustics written for people who already know about Acoustics.

I'm trying to understand Solving for the Position Equation. It doesn't state how you get from one point to another. Is that we are trying to reach the 
equation of x(t) and we actually reach this point twice? We do a little round trip with the variables A and B but I don't see what they mean. 

If anyone understands this please explain it more graphically. The Wikipedia article is actually of better help than the book on this matter...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The human body requires energy to function properly. Energy is obtained from the external environment by ingesting food. The digestive system’s main function is to transfer the energy found in food by breaking it down into small accessible units (nutrients) for cells to use. Material which is unnecessary is excreted. 

There are four processes that the digestive system performs to achieve its function. 
* '''Motility''': refers to the mixing and movement of food from the mouth to the anus with the help of smooth muscle that is found along the gastrointestinal tube. 
* '''Secretion''': the discharge of enzymes, water and other substances into the lumen of the digestive track by specialized tissues called exocrine glands.
* '''Digestion''': the breakdown of food into smaller pieces or the degradation of large molecules into smaller ones.
* '''Absorption''': the transport of nutrients in the blood or lymph to be circulated around the body.

The digestive system consists of structures along the gastrointestinal tube (mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small and large intestine) as well as accessory organs such as the salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder.

Many Linux distributions come with the popular [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache web server]] program pre-installed. It is quite common to use this in conjunction with [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] and [[w:PHP|PHP]] (or [[w:Perl|Perl]] or [[w:Python (programming language)|Python]]) to build websites. This is known as the [[w:LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] stack.

Instructions for installing and running Apache can be found at the [http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/ documentation page] of the [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache website].&lt;!--This is stupid, point to [[Apache]] or have a tutorial here--&gt;

'''FIT2D''' is a computer program for the processing of 2D X-ray diffraction images as obtained at synchrotron sources.

&lt;!-- The idea is to make this a wikibook that helps synchrotron users become proficient in processing XRD data more quickly and share their experiences--&gt;

==Background==

Many beamlines of synchrotron sources are fit with two-dimensional detectors and produce data in the form of two-dimensional diffraction patterns. These patterns can have various forms. There is a need for processing this type of information and the most common software used in the synchrotron community is FIT2D. It is available for free and an online manual is available. This wikibook is intended to provide an easy entry for new users as well as an opportunity for current users to pool their experiences and make them more readily available to the community.

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 1===

*'''''Veneres Cupidinesque'''''

This was a favourite phrase of Catullus's. He also uses it in poem 13.

===Lines 3-4===

*'''''passer... meae puellae - sparrow... of my girl'''''

This anaphora conveys a rhetorical tone, something Catullus uses frequently.

===Line 9===

*'''''modo huc modo illuc - now here now there'''''

The sound of this set of words imitates the way the little bird would have hopped around when it was alive.

===Line 10===

*'''''pipiabat - chirped'''''

The sound of this word imitates the sound the little bird would have made. Written in scanned form - pǐpǐābǎt - the combination of longs and shorts reflect the little bird's voice.

      <comment>/* McLuhan’s Views and Research */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Life of Marshall McLuhan===
On July 21, 1911 Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born to Herbert, a real estate agent, and Elsie, an actress, in Edmonton, Alberta (Marchand, 1998). The McLuhan family, which also included Marshall’s younger brother Maurice, made Winnipeg, Manitoba home. McLuhan was not a good student in grade school. But, later McLuhan earned a BA and MA in English at the University of Manitoba and won a University gold metal in arts and science (Marchand, 1998).

McLuhan was raised a Protestant and converted to Roman Catholicism which influenced his life and career (Morrison, 2001). In 1937, McLuhan began his professional career teaching at Catholic institutions staring at St. Louis University, a well respected Jesuit institution (Wolfe, 2004). In 1944, he began teaching at Assumption College, Windsor, Ontario. Finally in 1946, he taught at St. Michael's College, a catholic college in the University of Toronto (Wolfe, 2004). In 1952 he was appoint full professor and retired from teaching in 1979 (McLuhan Associates, ND).

In 1939, McLuhan married Corinne Lewis while he was working on his doctorial disertation on the work of Thomas Nashe and the verbal arts (Morrison, 2001).  The McLuhan’s had six children Eric, Mary, Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth and Michael (Marchand, 1998).  In 1965, his son Eric became his assistant and coauthored the book Media: The New Science published in 1988. (McLuhan Associates, 1986).

===McLuhan’s Views and Research=== 
McLuhan was an instructor of English who later became interested in communication technologies. His work involved linking media and technology to the human body (Kroker, 1995). McLuhan’s work and readings are very difficult because he jumped around and introduced new terminology to explain different concepts (Katz and Katz, 2001). McLuhan’s work influenced him to be a critic of popular culture. Katz and Katz (2001) summarize McLuhan’s views on technology as “…technology (also) works indirectly on society by affecting the ways in which the brain processes information from each new medium, how the mode of processing affects the senses and thus personality, and how personality, in turn, affects social organization” (paragraph 9). This synopsis of McLuhan’s view on technology is consistent with deep and complex thinking McLuhan brings to the field of communication technologies. McLuhan’s concern is how the technology or medium eventual affects society.

The coined phrase “the medium is the message” is McLuhan’s interperation of technolgy in a few words. The phrase refers to McLuhan’s view that more attention should be given to the medium or technolgy and less emphasis or focus should be on the content of the medium (Katz and Katz, 2001).  Thus the medium is a roadmap on how to rather than what to think (Katz and Katz, 2001). The underlying meaning is the medium has more influence on society than the content of the medium. As a note McLuhan’s book published in 1967 was titled &quot;The Medium is the Massage” in which message was spelled wrong (massage), by the typesetter (McLuhan Associates, 1986). But McLuhan asked the publisher not to correct the mistake because massage or broken down “Mass Age” was on target (McLuhan Associates, 1986).  

McLuhan defines media as technologies that create an extension of the human body (Munday, 2003). McLuhan uses the notion of extension to signify anything, like technology, that extends or uses the human body or mind in a different way (Kappelman, 2001). For example, a shovel is an extension of our hands to dig the earth. With the term extension McLuhan uses the term amputation. Amputation refers to the loss of other extensions due to the new technology (Munday, 2003). For instance the introduction of PowerPoint presentations amputates the use of the chalkboard in the classroom.  The concern McLuhan had with the notion of extension and amputation is the fact that most humans are excited about extensions while amputations are ignored or not thought of (Munday, 2003). An example of ignoring the amputations is the use of fuel to power our vehicles (the technology) is taken for granted, while depleting natural resources (amputation) and potentially harming the environment is not thought at the gas pump.

McLuhan also expressed views on the notion of a “global village”. According to McLuhan's son Eric, the term “global village” was used to describe how the technology of radio in the 1920 brought society closer together through the medium (McLuhan, 1996).  McLuhan authored a book entitled &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot; published in 1968 to discuss the “global village”.  

Driedger and Redekop, (1998) explain McLuhan’s meaning of “global village: as  “…media, and television in particular, serve to bring previously marginal groups out of their local villages, and directly in touch with the mainstream of society into a global village characterized by a heightened awareness and sense of collection responsibility” (p. 44). Thus the notion of the global village is the extent that technology has on the society and the demands that users of the medium had on other aspects of life (McIlwraith, 1994). For example, if television were the medium than those who viewed television would require the same level of involvement in different social situations (McIlwraith, 1994). 

In addition, to the “global village” McLuhan also discussed the notion of “hot” and “cool” medium. The concept of “hot” and “cool” medium deals with the level of involvement or intensity the medium requires of the participant (Katz and Katz, 2001). Katz and Katz (2001) compare print and telivision mediam as an example of “hot” and “cool” medium:

“The more intense and unrelenting the stimulus, the less involvement on the part of the audience, [McLuhan] says, classifying print medium …as ``hot'' because of their technological single-mindedness, and speech and television as ``cool.” [because] McLuhan argued that the television viewer is required to subconsciously connect the dots on his television screen in order to complete the picture, and hence is more involved, more participatory (paragraph 12).
Thus the notion of “hot” and “cool” medium deals with the requirements of the technolgy and not the content. This is consistant with McLuhan’s point of view. In addition, “hot” and “cool” medium are relative to comparing two mediums infering one medium is “hotter than” another (Katz and Katz, 2001).  Thus in the example above print medium is hotter then television medium.
McLuhan’s work eventually led to a tetrad of questions that basically summed up McLuhan’s work. The four questions in McLuhan’s tetrad are: what does it (the medium or technology) extend?, what does it make obsolete?, what is retrieved?, and what does the technology reverse into if it is over-extended? (Kappelman, 2001). The questions posed provide a framework to analysis the medium or technology and the affects on society. McLuhan’s tetrad of questions is as relevant today as, and probably more relevant, then in the past. The fact is that the fast paced technology driven world we live in today does apply to the rhetoric of McLuhan. If alive today, McLuhan would have had an appealing response and probably would be overloaded with the speed and quantity of technology that is touching ever facet of society.

===A Quick Thank You===

Hey, Bonaeludae, I'd just like to thank you for adding some info. to the [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus]] project that I'm currently running. Any help is appreciated, and I'm just saying thanks for your help, and also respecting my layout guide too. If you'd like to become a more permanent part of the project, leave a message on my talk page. :D
[[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 14:18, 5 May 2007 (UTC)



== Catullus ==

Hey Bonaeludae, it's Alakazam, of the Catullus project. The project has kinda fallen down over the months as I've been rushed off my feet with various things... and a lot of the previous contributors seem to be occupied as well.

However, from what I gathered from the message on my page, you're perfect material for this kind of thing.

Feel free to continue on the project at your leisure.

See: 
*[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/3|Catullus 3]]
*[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/51|Catullus 51]] 

for examples of model, comprehensive texts.

*I have had a note from an admin, Whiteknight, who says it is looking to be prime stuff from the sample that is complete.

*I'll add you as a member of the project if you like.

* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

A '''Wiener Filter''' is a filtering system that is an optimal solution to the statistical filtering problem.

== Statistical Filtering ==

=== Statement of Problem ===

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;The operator ''E[]'' is the '''expectation operator''', and is defined as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;E[x] = \sum x f[n]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;where ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[n]'' is the probability distribution function of ''x''.}}

''d[n]'' is the '''expected response value''', or the value that we would like the input to approach.

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_d^2 = E[d[n]d^*[n]]&lt;/math&gt;

''e[n]'' is the '''estimation error''', or the difference between the expected signal ''d[n]'' and the output of the FIR filter. We denote the FIR filter output with a hat:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}[n] = \sum_{k=1}^M w_k u[n-k+1]&lt;/math&gt;

Where the convolution operation applies the input signal, ''u[n]'', to the filter with impulse response ''w[n]''.  

We can define a '''performance index''' ''J[w]'' which is a function of the tap weights of the FIR filter, ''w[n]'', and can be used to show how close the filter is to reaching the desired output. We define the performance index as:

:&lt;math&gt;J[w] = E[e[n]e^*[n]]&lt;/math&gt;

''J[w]'' is also known as the '''mean-squared error''' signal. The goal of a Wiener filter is to minimize ''J[w]'' so that the filter operates with the least error.

=== Adaptive Filtering ===

Adaptive filtering is a situation where the coefficients of a filter change over time, typically in response to changes in the characteristics of the input signal.

=== Wiener-Hopf Equations ===

:&lt;math&gt;Rw_o = p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w_o = R^{-1}p&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''R'' is the autocorrelation matrix. ''w&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the optimal set of filter coefficients, arranged in a vector, and ''p'' is the cross-correlation vector.

== Wiener Filters ==

Wiener Filters are typically implemented with FIR filter constructions. This is because the wiener filter coefficients change over time, and IIR filter can become unstable for certain coefficient values. To prevent this instability, we typically construct adaptive filters with FIR structures.</text>

==Connotations of The Text==

The use of the metre, limping iambic, has a broken uneven effect, mimicking the dead end of his thoughts.

===Line 1===

*'''''miser - miserable; wretched; unhappy'''''

This is a favourite word of Catullus' usually used to describe himself. It can also be translated as &quot;love-sick&quot; and this translation creates a nearer tone that Catullus intended in the poem. This expression can also be seen in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/7|Poem 7]].

===Line 4===

*'''''ventitabas - you used to go'''''

The use of the Imperfect Tense shows how Catullus used to go everywhere Lesbia went - making him like Lesbia's shadow.

*'''''ducebat - where she used to lead'''''

The use of the Imperfect Tense indicates how Lesbia used to be in control of Catullus and she led him around as she pleased.

===Line 9===

*'''''nunc iam - now it has come to this'''''

This phrases emphasises the finality of the relationship and how it has ended once and for all.

===Line 14===

*'''''rogaberis nulla - you will be asked [out] by none'''''

Here the poet is trying to convince himself that Lesbia will lose out the most in the end. Nulla here is acting more as an adverb &quot;not&quot;

===Line 19===

*'''''obdura - endure'''''

The end of the poem finishes with a blunt imperative. This is Catullus trying to snap himself out of his misery.

His ideas and studies related to audio-visual field and the field’s professionalism was one of the critical scholar paradigm shifts to IT. He was believed as a person who changed the role of audio visual professionals’ role from support to leader ship and innovation. According to Januszewski (2001) Finn played one the key role for the shaping of the IT field because: (a) he was established the first academic department officially designated Instructional Technology, (b) he supervised many doctoral students in IT and most of them were involved in the development of the field, (c) he consulted to U.S. Office of Education where he could get funds for the major projects, (d) he not only consulted also worked with other major institutions for more AV education projects. In fact, it is easily observed that Finn spent his life to construct a professional field in the world of science. To understand Finn’s efforts related to field, his identification about six characteristics of a profession (Finn, 1953) was a good summary. By establishing an academic department and supervising doctoral students, he was successful to develop an intellectual technique and designs for applications, and a long period of training of a profession. With the funds and major project supported by both Office of Education and other institutions, the designs for applications were utilized in real situations. Based on them, a field’s standards and a statement of ethics and organized body of intellectual theory which are the advanced criteria for a profession were created and expanded. The interaction between the academic department and the projects which he conducted created a cycle that enhanced the professional development of IT and was source of members that were part of the professional organizations fostering communication for future improvements. 

Another point for Finn’s contribution was system foundation of IT. He believed that programming prescriptive explanation of system view was very important concept for education and an intellectual technique to make audio visual field a profession (Januszewski, 2001). Moreover, this concept was as important as for educational technology. In his writings related to automation and education, Finn (1957) emphasized the concept of system and programming for the development of the profession. Hence, he combined four concepts: (a) system, (b) control of information to long range scientific analysis, (c) need for wise decisions and (d) high technology together. In other words, every long range scientific analysis and wise decisions enhances accumulation of knowledge of the field in a system or controlled environment. These accumulations can be easily connected to high technology or state-of-art improvement with automation process.

[[File:Edgar Dale's cone of learning.gif|thumb|Edgar Dale's cone of learning]]

THE PICTURE TO THE RIGHT IS INACCURATE: In fact, Dale’s original model of the cone does not include any percentages, and is explicitly described by Dale as a visual aid about audio-visual materials. Dale’s cone of experience is essentially a “visual metaphor” depicting types of learning, from the concrete to the abstract. Dale did not intend to place value on one modality over another. The shape of the cone is not related to retention, but rather to the degree of abstraction.However, he does contend that, as one’s experiences move toward the bottom of the cone, more of the senses are engaged (such as hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, tasting). 

In Dale’s text, immediately before presenting the cone, he states: 
“Much of what we found to be true of direct and indirect experience, and of concrete and abstract experience, can be summarized in a pictorial device which we call the ‘Cone of Experience.’ The cone is not offered as a perfect or mechanically flawless picture to be taken with absolute literalness in its simplified form. It is merely a visual aid [original italics] in explaining the interrelationships of the various types of audio-visual materials, as well as their individual‘positions’ in the learning process…The cone device, then, is a visual metaphor of learning experiences, in which the various types of audio-visual materials are arranged in the order of increasing abstractness as one proceeds from direct experience…Exhibits are nearer to the pinnacle of the cone not because they are more difficult than field trips but only because they provide a more abstract experience. (An abstraction is not necessarily difficult. All words, whether used by little children or by mature adults, are abstractions.)&lt;ref&gt; Dale, E. (1946, 1954, 1969). Audio-visual methods in teaching. New York: Dryden. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cisco; Multimodal Learning Through Media:  What the Research Says. Refferenced from http://www.cisco.com/web/strategy/docs/education/Multimodal-Learning-Through-Media.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;



The Cone of Experience (1946) was the most important contribution of Edgar Dale in field of IT. In the cone, he explained inter-relations of the several audio-visual materials and their positions in learning processes. He expressed the divisions based on extreme two points between direct experience and pure abstraction. The divisions proposed in the cone were not accepted as exact demarcations. One audio-visual can be used with other audio- visual materials with respect to situation or purposes. 

Dale’s cone is one of the most important theoretical foundations of IT. Hence, the cone makes connection between concrete and abstract ideas which is one of the main principles of teaching and learning. It also helps the professionals to select media on the basis of the experiences aimed to transfer students. It seems a job aid. Moreover, it is an effective tool to support communication process because it makes communication depending on not only just words but also visual and experiential ways. He also emphasized the other components and diversity of sensory experiences. Hence, our experiences are not completely relied on visual or verbal symbols. Other concerns of our perception systems must be considered, such as direct experience, touching, sensing. The cone also fosters diversity in learning environment. As a result, the cone is a good combination of psychological/instructional and communication theories.

The second critical contribution of Dale (1953) was social frame of communication concept. He was one of the person believed the importance of mutual experience sharing was the most important consequence of communication. In other words, he emphasized the concept of feedback.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Robert Heinich ==

Heinich’s approach to management of instruction was one of the drastic changes of the field of IT. He argued classical schooling system and management of instruction. He believed that management of instructions must be product-oriented or education engineering based overall school environment (Januszewski, 2001). In his alternative paradigm, school teachers of the classical schooling system were not accepted as decision makers for instructional methods and media utilization. He changed this view and proposed that curriculum specials, including educational technologists were assigned to determine the content and delivery of instruction. Januszewski also stated that Heinich’s paradigm for management of instruction is one of the most influential one that causes to change from the view of AV aids controlled by teachers to educational technology which became the part of curriculum development. This great paradigm shift, even though he did not stress like the same language, was a step for being a profession by establishing an expandable body of intellectual theory. Moreover, this shift was made the concept of educational technology into school systems as a sub-system. Another interesting point is for Heinich’s ideas related to management; that were based on real applications of systems theory rather than pure science.

The four model of evaluation has been the most prominent model of training evaluation for over forty years (Kraiger, 2002). Even though this model is the most accepted one, there are tons of criticisms. Kirkpatrick developed the hierarchy of evaluation on the basis of his experiences in real life applications. In Kirkpatrick’s model (1979), there are four types of assessment stages: (a) reaction defined as likeness of the training programs by trainees, (b) learning defined as what facts, principles, and techniques learned during the training, (c) behaviors defined as what changes occurred in the job behavior of trainees at the end of the training, and (d) results what the result of training in tangible form of cost, performance, quality, production, or etc. The hierarchy of the model implies that without high level of reaction measures or outcomes, it is impossible to reach the superior levels. The four-model is classified in goal-based evaluation models (Eseryel, 2002) because the main criteria for evaluation are the goals determined previously. Every step goes further in the direction of them. The model helps the training professionals to determine outcomes of the training program covertly. To Kraiger (2002), Kirkpatrick’s model has been very popular because it is easy to understand the hierarchy by the practitioners.  

The Four-Evaluation model is the good analysis of a training program’s assessment points. If the training program and evaluation are the systems of improvement, those goal stages show us what we have to measure to understand effect of training on the organizations. Although there are too many criticisms about the model, it has been the origin for solving the evaluation problem of training. Most of the models in training field have been stemmed from the Four-Evaluation model (Kraiger, 2002). The model can be used not only for training but also for schooling. From that perspective, the model is in the concerns of IT from two different utilization areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The stars at night, are big and bright… That’s the first line to a famous song about Texas, and it’s especially true about the Panhandle Plains. With its wide-open spaces and rolling plains, this region boasts some of the clearest and brightest star-filled evening skies you’ll find anywhere in the Lone Star State. 

----
However, that’s just the beginning of the many glorious wonders you’ll find here. There is rugged beauty all around you, from the vast expanses of fertile farmland to the water-carved canyons. Scenic lakes are plentiful, too. 

----
This region’s northern edge begins at the Texas-Oklahoma border and stretches south to San Angelo. Travel west and you can step over into New Mexico, while Wichita Falls and Brownwood are anchor cities along the eastern rim.

----
The northern part of the region is dominated by Amarillo and its spectacular sights. Visitors hoping to find some nostalgia can find a piece of Americana along Route 66. Just to the south lies one of the state’s most beautiful natural attractions, Palo Duro Canyon State Park in Canyon. One of the largest state parks in Texas, it features more than 18,000 acres of majestic scenery, including walls that plunge nearly 1,000 feet to the canyon floor.

----
Head further south and you’ll find Lubbock, which boasts many attractions of its own. Buddy Holly, native son and rock-and-roll pioneer is honored with the Buddy Holly Center, while the city pays tribute to its settlers at the American Wind Power Museum. The Silent Wings Museum details the history of the World War II military glider program, and wine connoisseurs can visit the city’s three wineries and sample some of the state’s best vintage. 

----
To the southeast lies Abilene, definitely a must-see city. The Abilene Zoo is one of the five largest zoos in Texas, and nearby Abilene State Park features 621 acres of pecan tree-shaded beauty that was once a popular campground for Comanche Indians. A piece of Texas history can be found at Fort Phantom Hill, and Frontier Texas! Gives visitors an opportunity to experience life as an early settler on the Texas plains in this spectacular multi-million dollar interactive attraction. Buffalo Gap, just a few miles south of Abilene, consists of 15 structures that detail life on the Texas frontier from the late 1880s to the early 1920s.

----
You’ll also find attractions in the dozens of smaller communities that dominate this region. Towns like Eden, Stamford, Tuscola, Albany, Cross Plains, Sweetwater, Post, Hale Center, Plainview, and many more offer adventures that capture the imagination, feed the soul and entertain young and old alike. 

----
So saddle up, pardner, and ride into the wonder of the Panhandle Plains region!

      <text xml:space="preserve">When people think of Texas, they often visualize wide-open spaces and cactus as far as the eye can see. But when we say Texas is like a whole other country, we’re talking about places like the Piney Woods region. If you’re searching for scrub brush and tumbleweeds, you’ll be disappointed. However, prepare to be dazzled at the beauty and majesty that awaits you here. 

----
Specifically, the Piney Woods region contains thousands of acres of pine and pine-hardwood forests. Visitors will find a variety of loblolly, short leaf and some pockets of longleaf pine, as well as magnolia, elm, oak, ash, cypress and other trees. Located primarily in East Texas, this area boasts the state’s four national forests and five state forests nestled among the wooded acres here. For outdoor enthusiasts, this region is also home to many state parks and bodies of water that offer fun and enjoyment.

----
The grandeur of majestic, towering trees and eye-popping landscapes can be seen year-round, but this area is dominated by breathtaking colors during the fall when the sassafras, persimmon, maples, sweet gums, dogwoods, elms, and oaks can generally be counted on to offer up hues of golden brown, yellow, orange, red and even reddish purple.

----
Then, during the Christmas season, this part of Texas becomes truly magical. Town squares are transformed into holiday wonderlands with thousands of lights. Re-experience the childhood delight of old-fashioned and lighted holiday parades. Tour historic homes specially decorated for the holidays. See unique sights like the star-topped oil derricks in the World’s Richest Acre in Kilgore.

----
It is also quite beautiful in the spring, too. Blooming azaleas and dogwoods are occasions to celebrate. These spring specimens can be seen on trails in cities like Palestine, Woodville and Quitman.

----
Tyler seems to be an especially prolific site for flora. Apart from colorful spring flowers, this city is known around the world for its roses, and it’s also home to Tyler Municipal Rose Garden, the nation’s largest municipal rose garden.

----
In the southern portion of the region, the towering pine trees give way to mammoth bald cypress trees and lush swampland, found in Big Thicket National Preserve and accessible via neighboring cities Jasper, Kirbyville, Kountze, Silsbee and Saratoga. The awe-inspiring ecosystem is also home to amazing diversity, because here you can also find cactus, ferns and orchids, as well as pine and oak trees.

----
But beautiful landscapes are not the only things to see here, as this region is rich in Texas heritage and history as well. Discover how the Early Caddo tribe lived at the site of an ancient Indian settlement at the Caddoan Mounds State Historic Site in Alto. There, you can wander through reconstructed Caddo dwellings and ceremonial areas of this archaeological gem.

----
For a taste of Texas history during the time of its struggle for independence, look no further than Nacogdoches. One of Texas’ oldest communities, it was originally established as a Spanish fort in the mid 1700s and later the site of three short-lived republics. In 1832, what were considered the opening shots of the Texas Revolution were fired here, as citizens fought a Mexican garrison in the center of town and were successful in forcing the Mexican troops out of East Texas.

----
Signs of East Texas’ oil history can be seen throughout the region. Several historic towns such as Kilgore, Marshall, Joinerville and Longview celebrate their ties to Texas’ oil boom days with museums, attractions and other historical markers that mark the Lone Star State’s impact on the oil industry at the turn of the 20th century.

----
With the dogwoods, cypress, magnolias and other foliage, parts of East Texas exude a feeling of being in the Old South. Venerable plantation homes and graceful mansions further this impression. Take a horse-drawn carriage ride in Jefferson, or enjoy a relaxing and romantic trip on a paddle wheel-style riverboat in Uncertain, and soak in the Southern hospitality and charm of the region.

----
Enjoy the wonder and glory that awaits you in the Piney Woods!

The secondary assessment/survey is done once the primary survey is completed and non-life threatening injuries can be assessed. It can be after removing the athlete from the field. When performing this type of assessment it is vital for the clinician to gain as much information as possible in order to properly diagnose the injured person. This assessment involves many different things and can be done in steps. Clinician should be sure to get a thorough history on the individual, a thorough description of what the person felt, feels, how they were injured, what hurts the most, where hurts the most, etc. Clinician should also be able to determine if the individual has appropriate function of the injured area or if they are in need of EMS. 

The secondary assessment is truly the meat and potatoes once the oven has been preheated and everything is ready to go. This is where the clinician goes through step by step of a SOAP note or HOPS to figure out what happened. This can include but is not limited to inspection, bony and soft tissue palpation, ROM, special tests, circulation, and neurological. Secondary assessments are used in order to determine the injury, how the injury occurred, how severe the injury is, and to eliminate further injury.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;Cholecystitis&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
== Introduction: ==
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;• It is an inflammation of gall bladder. &lt;br&gt;
• Almost always occurs in association with gallstone.&lt;br&gt;
• It is one of the most common indications for abdominal surgery.&lt;br&gt;
• Its epidemiologic disturbance closely parallels to gallstone.

== &lt;b&gt;Types of Cholecystitis:&lt;/b&gt; ==

*&lt;b&gt; Calculus Cholecystitis.&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Inflammation of the gallbladder in the presence of gallstones.
*&lt;u&gt;It is classical to subdivide further&lt;/u&gt;:
**Acute Calculus Cholecystis.
**Chronic Calculus Cholecystis.


*&lt;b&gt; Acalculous Cholecystitis. &lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Give rise to clinical picture similar to calculus cholecystitis.
*&lt;u&gt;It is classical to subdivide further&lt;/u&gt;:
**Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis.
**Chronic Acalculous Cholecystitis.

== &lt;b&gt;Acute Calculus Cholecystitis: &lt;/b&gt; ==
* Precipitated 90% of the time by gallstone obstruction of the:
** Neck of the gallbladder.
***Gallstone impacted in Hartmann's pouch.
** Cystic duct.
* Caused by Bile infections:
** E.coli.
** Klebsiella sp.
** Streptococcus faecalis (Keighley).
** Strict anaerobes, e.g. Bacteroides sp.
** Gas forming organisms, e.g. clostridia.
** Typhoid infection.

* It is the primary complication of gallstones.
* One of the most common reasons for emergency cholecystectomy.


== &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;Sequel of Acute Cholecystitis attack:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  ==
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;When a certain degree of distension of the gall bladder 
    has been reached, the mucous membrane tends to be lifted away from the sides 
    of the stone and, as a consequence, the stone may slip back into the body of 
    the gallbladder, and any mucoid (from a mucocele) or mucopurulent contents 
    of the gallbladder escape by way of the cystic duct.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Less frequently, the impaction persists and an 
    empyema (pyocele) of the gallbladder results.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;On rare occasions, the distended, inflamed 
    gallbladder perforates.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
== &lt;b&gt; Clinical features of acute calculus cholecystitis:&lt;/b&gt; ==
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The onset is sudden.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Pain is located in mainly in the right hypochondrium.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
== &lt;b&gt;Diagnosis of Acute Calculus Cholecystitis:&lt;/b&gt; ==
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Ultrasonography will confirm the diagnosis.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

== &lt;b&gt;Chronic calculus cholecystitis: &lt;/b&gt;==
  &lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;Clinical features:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Right Hypochondrial pain.&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Radiation to between the shoulder blades is frequent and it may 
      associated with nausea and vomiting. Fatty foods often precipitate it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;During an attack, tenderness in the hypochondrium is present.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Murphy's sign may be (+).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The temperature and white blood count are elevated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Flatulent dyspepsia:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;Diagnosis:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Ultrasonography is usually the only investigation needed to show 
    gallstones.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;A bile duct &amp;gt;8mm is size requires investigation by endoscopic 
    cholangiography to determine the cause of the dilatation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

== &lt;b&gt;Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis: &lt;/b&gt; ==
*Particularly seen in patients recovering from:
**Major surgery.
**Trauma.
**Burns.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;NB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt;!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In these patients the diagnosis is often missed and the mortality rate is 20 %.

* &lt;b&gt;Diagnosis: &lt;/b&gt;
**Oral cholecystography is more useful than Ultrasonography in those presenting with chronic symptoms.
**Radioisotope scanning for presenting with acute symptoms.
**Cholesterol crystals in duodenal aspirate may also help.

== &lt;b&gt; Treatment: &lt;/b&gt; ==

Treatment of choice:

* Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
* Open cholecystectomy.
* Percutaneous transhepatic placement of a cholecystostomy tube.

The following is a recipe on how to make breaded mozzarella sticks.

==Ingredients==

* ¼ pound fresh [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* ½ cup seasoned [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==
# Preheat [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep fryer]] to 350°F (175°C).
# Slice mozzarella into sticks 1-3 cm in diameter.
# In a small bowl, whisk egg.
# Fill another small bowl with bread crumbs.
# Dip 3-4 sticks at a time into the egg.
# Shake excess egg off sticks and place them in the bread crumbs. 
# Shake bowl of bread crumbs, evenly coating all sticks.  Add more bread crumbs as needed.
# Place coated sticks to the side and repeat for remaining sticks.
# After all sticks have been coated, repeat the egg-dip and crumb-coat for each once more.
# Place all sticks in fryer basket and submerge in 350°F oil.
# Let sit for 30 seconds, gently rocking basket occasionally.
# Lift basket and let cool for a few seconds.  If cheese is not beginning to ooze out from half the sticks, re-submerge in oil for another 10-15 seconds, gently shaking the basket.  Repeat until the cheese is just starting to ooze out.
# Dump onto paper towel and pat off excess oil gently.
# Serve hot.

==Alternate - Mozzarella bites==
[[Image:Mozzbites2_577.jpg|thumb|right|Mozzarella bites]]
# Slice mozzarella into cubes 2-3 cm on a side.
# Dip 5-6 bites at a time into the egg.
# Continue with the rest of the recipe as above, and enjoy mozzarella bites.

'''''Berberis''''' ('''Barberry''', '''Pepperidge bush''', '''Pepperidge-bushis''') is a genus of about 450-500 species of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1-5 m tall with thorny shoots, native to the temperate and subtropical regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America. They are closely related to the genus ''[[../Mahonia/]]'', which is included within ''Berberis'' by some botanists. 

==Description==
The genus is characterised by dimorphic shoots, with long shoots which form the structure of the plant, and short shoots only 1-2 mm long. The leaves on long shoots are non-photosynthetic, developed into three-spined thorns 3-30 mm long; the bud in the axil of each thorn-leaf then develops a short shoot with several normal, photosynthetic leaves. These leaves are 1-10 cm long, simple, and either entire, or with spiny margins. Only on young seedlings do leaves develop on the long shoots, with the adult foliage style developing after the young plant is 1-2 years old. The wood is bright yellow.

The deciduous species (e.g. ''Berberis thunbergii, B. vulgaris'') are noted for good autumn colour, the leaves turning pink or red before falling. In some evergreen species from China (e.g. ''B. candidula, B. verruculosa''), the leaves are brilliant white beneath, making them particularly attractive.

The flowers are produced singly or in racemes of up to 20 on a single flower-head. They are yellow or orange, 3-6 mm long, with six sepals and six petals in alternating whorls of three, the sepals usually coloured like the petals. The fruit is a small berry 5-15 mm long, ripening red or dark blue, often with a pink or violet waxy surface bloom; they may be either long and narrow (like a bar, hence 'barberry') or in other species, spherical.

==Growing conditions==
Well-drained soils in full sun to full shade.

==Varieties==
''Berberis buxifolia'' ('''Calafate''') and ''Berberis darwinii'' ('''Michay''') are two species found in Patagonia in Argentina and Chile. Their edible purple fruits are used for jams and infusions; anyone who tries a berry is said to be certain to return to Patagonia. The calafate and michay are symbols of Patagonia.

''Berberis vulgaris'' ('''European Barberry''') is the alternate host species of the wheat rust ''[[../Puccinia graminis/]]'', a serious fungal disease of wheat.  For this reason, cultivation of this species is prohibited in many areas.

Some ''Berberis'' have become invasive species when planted outside of their native ranges, including ''B. glaucocarpa'' and ''B. darwinii'' in New Zealand (where it is now banned from sale and propagation), and ''B. thunbergii'' in some parts of North America.

==Uses==
The berries of some species are edible and rich in vitamin C, though with a very sharp flavour, other species can cause mild stomach upset; the thorny shrubs make harvesting them difficult, so in most places they are not widely consumed. They are an important food for many small birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. In Iran, the dried fruits, known as ''zereshk'', are more widely used, imparting a tart flavor to chicken dishes. In Ukraine, they are used as the flavouring in a popular candy of the same name.&lt;!--Of what name?  &quot;Zereshk&quot;?--&gt;

Several are popular garden shrubs, grown for their ornamental leaves, yellow flowers, and red or blue-black berries. They are also valued for crime prevention; being very dense, viciously spiny shrubs, they make very effective barriers impenetrable to burglars. For this reason they are often planted below potentially vulnerable windows, and used as hedges and other barriers.

==Maintenance==
Pruning can be difficult due to the numerous, sharp spines, so pruning in winter (while wearing heavy clothes) is strongly recommended. Barberries are well-adapted to shearing, and can also be cut to the ground for rejuvenation.

==Propagation==
Seed or cuttings.

Pan tomaca, also called Pa amb tomàquet is a sandwich style tapa originated in Catalunya but now enjoyed all over Spain. It means bread with tomato. It is lightly toasted bread, rubbed with garlic, then with fresh tomato and sprinkled with olive oil and salt and served with, for example, slices of cured ham. Pan tomaca is typically served as a starter or as a sandwich.

==Ingredients==
* two ripe red [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 loaf [[Cookbook:Baguette|French bread]]
* 120g (1/4 lb.) sliced [[Cookbook:Ham|Cured ham]]
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Sea salt]]

==Procedure==

# Peel the tomatoes. Optionally remove the seeds.
# Blend the tomatoes, 1 tbsp olive oil and salt to taste in an appropriate vessel with an immersion blender.
# Cut the French bread loaf in appropriate sized portions and open those in halves. Optionally toast them very lightly also to increase tenderness.
# Spread the mixture on one surface and sprinkle with olive oil. Place a slice of cured ham on top, and optionally cover with the other portion of bread for a sandwich, or leave uncovered for a tapa.

* Makes 4-6 servings.

==The gender problem revisited==
As we have seen before the three gender system that Dutch inherited from West-Germanic is evolving into something different. The situation today differs a bit from region to region and is still evolving, the South (Flanders) retaining much of the old system, but let us try to summarize northern usuage.

#there is a growing rift in how animate (persons) and inanimate (things) nouns are treated
#for persons ''natural gender'' (masc.-fem.) dominates
#for things ''grammatical gender'' (common - neuter) dominates
#personal, possessive even relative pronouns are increasingly reserved for persons
#for things demonstrative pronouns and pronominal adverbs dominate

Approximately we can summarize current usage as follows:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- 
! !! persons!! things
|-
|gender||natural||grammatical
|-
|contrast|| masc-fem || common - neuter
|-
|substantive&lt;br&gt;pronoun|| personal &lt;br&gt;hij,zij, hem, haar,&lt;br&gt;(het,) hen, hun,ze ||demonstrative&lt;br&gt;die,dat het, ze
|-
|adjective&lt;br&gt;pronoun||possessive&lt;br&gt; zijn, haar, hun||pronominal adverb&lt;br&gt; ervan
|}

===Double gender===
Diminutives of persons are an interesting group of words because they straddle the growing animate-inanimate rift. They often show signs of both natural and grammatical gender:

# ''Zij'' is een ''mooi'' meisje. ''Zij'' heeft een ''klein'' broertje. ''Hij'' is ziek.

Grammatically meisje and broertje are grammatically neuter as all diminutives. ''Mooi'' en ''klein'' therefore have no inflections after the indefinite article. These words are however frequently referred to by the feminine and masculine personal pronouns ''hij'' and ''zij'', following natural gender.

=Developing and Understand Auxiliary Modules in Metasploit 3=
This chapter covers the concept behind auxiliary modules, their structure and working examples on how to develop auxiliary modules. Most of the discussion in this chapter revolves around auxiliary modules development. Metasploit version 3 is written in the ''Ruby'' programming language. While going through this material without any Ruby programming knowledge will still give you good insights to the organization and capabilities of the framework; you will find this material most useful if you know Ruby language and have an intention of programming modules of metasploit.

__TOC__


==Auxiliary Modules Overview==
In metasploit any module that is not an exploit is an auxiliary module. Exploit modules always have a payload. Auxiliary modules are a fascinating feature of the framework allowing it to extend for a variety of purposes other than exploitation. You can create your own quick vulnerability scanners, port scanners, make MSF work as an FTP, HTTP or SMTP client and do a whole lot of other cool stuff. You have a ready to use code library at your disposal enabling quick development of such tools.

Throughout this chapter, we will look into various aspects and features of auxiliary modules and shall try to implement our own auxiliary module. This module will try to place files or delete files on web servers that allow the HTTP protocol's PUT and DELETE methods without any authentication. This is a good example of an auxiliary module since it isn't an exploit. It is just a simple tool to check web server mis-configurations.

==Auxiliary Modules Placement and Structure==
Auxiliary modules reside in the '''modules/auxiliary/''' directory of the framework main directory.  Given below is a basic definition of an auxiliary module.
&lt;br&gt;

 require 'msf/core'
 
 p &quot;My Auxiliary Module&quot;
 
 class Metasploit3 &lt; Msf::Auxiliary
 
 end         # for the class definition

Place this code in a file any where under '$HOME/.msf/modules/auxiliary' folder.

All auxiliary modules inherit from their base class '''Msf::Auxiliary'''. 
The line ''' p &quot;My Auxiliary Module&quot; ''' prints a line when msf loads. Now your module is part of MSF and is available
to you via various MSF user interfaces. Of course, as it is currently this module doesn't do anything other than printing
a line (which no other module does).

The first thing we need to do is to add some information about this module. This can be done in the initialize constructor for the class. Lets include the initialize constructor in the class definition.

    def initialize(info = {})
        super(update_info(info,
            'Name'           =&gt; 'HTTP Put method exploiter',
            'Description'    =&gt; %q{
                    This module exploits faulty web server configurations
                    allowing HTTP PUT and DELETE methods without any user validation.
            },
            'Author'         =&gt; [ 'Kashif [at] compulife.com.pk' ],
            'License'        =&gt; BSD_LICENSE,
            'Version'        =&gt; '$Revision: 4663 $',
            'Privileged'     =&gt; false,
            'Platform'       =&gt; [ '' ],
            'Arch'           =&gt; [ ARCH_X86, ARCH_PPC, ARCH_SPARC, ARCH_CMD ],
            'Targets'        =&gt; [ [ 'Wildcard Target', { } ] ],
            'DefaultTarget'  =&gt; 0,
            'Actions'        =&gt; [AuxiliaryAction.new('PUT_FILE', {}),
                                 AuxiliaryAction.new('DELETE_FILE', {})],
            'DefaultAction'  =&gt; [ 'PUT_FILE' ]
            ))
 
        register_options(
            [
                OptString.new('PATH', [ true,  &quot;path where to store the new file&quot;, '/']),
                OptString.new('DATA', [ false,  &quot;Data to write into the file&quot;, ' ']),
            ], self.class
            )
        
    end

First thing the constructor does is that it calls the constructor of its base class by calling the '''super''' method. All your modules should contain this call. Note the call to '''update_info''' method within the constructor. This method is used to update information about a module be it an exploit module or an auxiliary module. The options that each type of module takes differ slightly, for example, exploit modules contain a ''payload'' option while auxiliary modules don't.

(Detailed description of the options update_info can take comes here)

===register_options method===

Second call is to the '''register_options''' method. This method adds options that the user can specify before running the module.

==The datastore==

The options set by a user are available via a predefined hash named '''datastore'''. For example:

  print_status(&quot;the contents of the DATA variable are: &quot; + datastore['DATA'])

==Auxiliary Mixins==

Auxiliary module mixins provide useful features that you can use to enhance the auxiliary modules you create.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please review the [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Blocking_policy|oldid=833008}} policy under discussion] before voting.

== Key Points ==

*Definitions of who and when to block
*How to handle unblocking and unblock requests
*Proper demeanor when handling a block situation and admin responsibilities
*Discusses how and when to unblock, and how to handle an unblock request
*Specifies who can block/unblock to prevent wheel wars among admins

== Votes ==

*Only registered users with at least 20 edits can vote. 
*Vote ends one week after the last posting or consensus has clearly been reached.
*Add votes in the format '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

=== Decision ===

I'm closing this vote as failed and the proposal as needing more work. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:41, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

(Moved from my talk page)
I'm content with the policy except on the unblock and probably the Be Bold wording.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:54, 17 April 2007 (UTC)
:What specifically about those things do you not like? constructive criticism is very valuable in matters like this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:00, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
::Selection of the method or the process shouldn't be so clearly stated as depending only on the administrator that performed the block (he may not be available or unwilling to support the action, the only escape route is point 3 and finding a supporting administrator/user to post the request for evaluation may be seen as going against the original administrator, the one that performed the action. Because of that fact some sort of careful wording needs to be in place, users aren't obligated to interfere but the actual wording makes very hard to anyone to give any help, it makes it seem very confrontational) and a safeguard should be given to good-behavior or to help people that were wrongly blocked, for example if a user has been contributing and was blocked on a &quot;personal interpretation&quot; of policy or even claiming to have been victim of miss ID, we should be inclusive and give freedom to the user to further validate the block reason (engage in actions that are clearly specified) or work within the rules and so prove good will to participate.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:17, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:::The idea behind preferring an admin to undo his own block is to prevent wheel-warring, or admins fighting with each other. If we say that an admin ''can't' unblock a blocked user'', it will prevent admins from trying. If the mess with your block, panic, showed us anything, it's that lots of admins are willing to use that block tool without getting consensus first. A few people probably could have gotten in trouble over that incident, but because of the heat of the moment a few mistakes were excused. 
:::Also, this policy provides a section all about unblocking, where a user can edit their talk page to request an unblock and to work to that goal in a civil and orderly way. Without this policy, there is no proceedure for unblocking a person, and for alot of blocked people that means that there will be no hope whatsoever of returning. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

Not happy with this policy.  I don't like &quot;Wikibooks also does not have a &quot;three strike&quot; rule, so a vandal may be blocked immediately following their first offense&quot;.  I feel we should do our part to encourage people onto the project and we should never block for a first offence.  Also &quot;unblocking users is not an area where admins should be bold in making unilateral decisions&quot; is not exactly a great statement either.  Blocks are normally &quot;bold&quot; decisions as we don't have a straw poll before we block someone.  Likewise it's possible for an unblock to be a bold decision also.  Many administrators will refuse to get involved in such discussions meaning that consensus will be difficult to achieve.  Also I disagree with blocking open proxies as these are used for many valid reasons especially in countries where Wikibooks is blocked and countries where Internet use is heavily monitored.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:25, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:Whether we like it or not, ''we do block vandals on their first offense''. You also have to pay attention to the distinction between a &quot;vandal&quot; and a user who makes a problem edit. When we talk about blocking on the first offense, we are talking about vandals, not difficult, misguided, or new users. 
:And as to the boldness thing, I think that being bold in blocking is a terrible thing. You do not block without strong justification, you do not unblock without the same, and when in doubt you always ask for help or even try to reach consensus. Admins being bold and blocking/unblocking leads to dangerous wheel wars, and frankly I think that admins who do that should be de-admined on the spot. The open proxy thing is not even up for debate. 
:Besides the addition of the section on unblocking (which we dont have a process for yet), and the warning against wheel warring, there isn't anything in this policy that changes the way we do things around here. Opposing this policy wont stop the open proxy blocks, it wont stop people from blocking vandals on their first offense, and it wont stop admins from being reprimanded for wheel-warring. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:43, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
::Great arguement :)  So basically is there any point in voting on this policy if you say that nothing will change and we can't debate the open proxy blocks?  And who says we can't debate such a thing anyway?  One other point I take issue with is permanent blocks which should NEVER happen unless they are serial spammers - everyone can be reformed. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:49, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
:::This is mostly just an instance of writing policy to reflect current community actions. Alot of this content was spun off of the [[WB:ADMIN]] policy, in an effort to make that policy smaller and more nimble (it's easier to make changes to multiple smaller documents then to a single all-important one).  That's part of the reason why many things won't change, because alot of this is already policy. The unblock thing i think is really important to add, even if we dont accept this entire proposal. If we don't reach consensus on this proposal, I will definately want to add the ublock section to the [[WB:ADMIN]] policy.
:::As to the open proxy thing, i suppose we can debate it but i dont know if there is a point. I need some clarification on that, but i'm pretty sure that blocking open proxies is a WMF policy, not a local one. I'm under the impression that it isnt something that we can change.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:05, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:Xania, I support the 3RR if that is what you are referring to but I have a problem with that (it can be easily bypassed) I had posted about that on the talk page of the policy, and I know Whiteknight opposes it, but the text clearly blocks any block at first offense (expressly stated), as for the open proxy, the text is very permissive but states that they can be blocked on sight (if a user gives a good enough reason I believe that it would be a base for unblock (good will), I will keep my vote of support (at least this text will avoid blocks like the ones performed on me in the past) and addresses some information that wasn't present, but I will change my vote if it will help rewrite it to address for instance the 3RR (I like it as a final resolution to edit disputes, it preserves the status quo and would have resolved my problems (but would also remove the need for discussion, what can be seen as good and bad).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:02, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:''&quot;Any user who uses sock puppets or meat puppets to try to influence discussion or decisions, or breaks any policy or guideline should be blocked indefinitely along with all their sock puppets and meat puppet accounts.&quot;'' Does this really mean what it says, and is that really the intent? To parse: ''Any user who uses sock puppets (and) breaks any guideline ''''should'''' be blocked indefinitely.'' I can't agree to that. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:29, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

::Good catch, &quot;uses sock puppets or meat puppets to try to influence discussion or decisions&quot; would be a valid block and probably &quot;should be blocked indefinitely&quot;  (note that should isn't equal to must and protection is given to the first offense, it goes beyond questionable behavior to with intent try to fix a discussion, since with the actual way the decission process is run, numbers do have importance), using a puppet to break a policy or even a guideline also demonstrates bad intentions, any user can break guidelines if a good enough justification is given (almost any justification can be used but for the change to be reversed the community would have to opose it, and most will not result in a block if the user is clear about his intentions, ie: not using a puppet), and any block is granted acess to the unblock so if a wrong block is performed in step 3 the community can lift it). So the idea is to prevent a misrepresentation of actions only, but probably a rewording could make it clearer, probably stating &quot;community discussions or decisions&quot; as for policy (they can't be broken and using a puppet to do it seem acting in an even higher level of bad intention)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:09, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

::So then fix it ... Small things like this are not show-stoppers. That really is minor. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:23, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

:I guess consensus will be the ultimate solution to this, but I think you fundamentally misunderstand the role blocking holds on wikis. I expected you to understand not being bold about unblocking quite clearly after the Panic &quot;block saga&quot; since that was a very jeopardizing action. Being bold in that situation makes admins like rogues and we can't have that. Like Whiteknight said this is a policy that's already being used essentially and is becoming formalized; we're just trying to write it down. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:27, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

::Under the letter of this policy, SB_Johnny (who has sock puppets) should be blocked indefinitely if he is uncivil (which he has been in the past). This is absolutely '''not''' the way the policy is currently applied. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:13, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

:::You made a small grammatical change to reflect what the user who originally wrote that section actually meant. I fully believe that was a misunderstanding of the use of comma and was probably just overlooked. Having those two logically separate actions in the section about puppets is obviously just an error. The vote now includes this change which I thank you for correcting. A section about puppets clearly should discuss actions related to puppets and the current diff reflects what admins do and have done in the past. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:41, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

I voted &quot;oppose&quot;... not that I think it's a bad policy, but because having ''any'' policy on blocking serves no other purpose than to open us up to wikilawyering. en.Wikipedia has blocking policies (several, in fact), and they are plagued by this. Commons has no policies on this, and we do pretty well (and commons is almost as large as en.Wikipedia now!) --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:12, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

I voted &quot;oppose&quot;, because I don't think this should be a policy, but rather a guideline as has been discussed previously on the talk page for the proposal. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:34, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

{{comment}} I think this policy is nowhere near having consensus. Even with the &quot;minor&quot; change I advocated for, I still have major reservations about this policy (well expressed by SB_Johnny and darklama). I think we would be better served with a much more general document. I think that's clear and we should pull this policy from voting and head back to the consensus ''building'' process. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:21, 22 April 2007 (UTC)
:Then clear the page and all that if you wish. It's amazing how little gets done when something here is in a workable state and how much show-stopping criticism arises when it's time to make a real decision. I guess the solution is to have voting and discussion on voting and discussion to see if we can do more voting and discussion. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:47, 22 April 2007 (UTC)
::Gee, I wonder why this kind of reaction is directed at me instead of someone who actually has voted against the policy?

Under the guideline for voting my vote would have no effect at this stage so I will only comment. The project is almost four years old and it is only because there has been little real trouble that it has got away with not having a policy on blocking (or a real voting policy for that matter).  If we had a real method of voting, such as is used in the world in general, where a specified majority (51%, 60% etc.) would cause a decision to be made, then the blocking policy could be as simple as: &quot;An admin may block a user for a specified time for the following violations....  A user may appeal, if the subsequent vote upholds the appeal the block will be lifted.&quot;.  This is democracy - governing bodies make decisions and the masses approve or reject them with a majority vote.

It seems to me that the lack of a voting policy is pivotal to the problems that we are having in dealing with any problem.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:18, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
:In practice other wikis do not necessarily have blocking policies and get by fine (Commons for example with far greater traffic).

[[Image:Sa kidneybeans.jpg|right|thumb|Red kidney beans]]

'''Kidney beans''' are flavoursome [[Cookbook:Legume|beans]] used widely in cooking in many countries. They are generally found as dried beans, and the term &quot;kidney beans&quot; usually refers to red kidney beans.

Kidney beans are favourites for [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] recipes, as components of mixed bean [[Cookbook:Curry|curries]], and bean [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]].

Dried kidney beans will cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea unless they have been boiled briskly (a slow cooker will not do - it can even make things worse) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the very indigestible phytohaemagglutinin that they contain. Tinned kidney beans are quite safe as their preparation involves sufficient heat to destroy the toxin.

== Procedure ==

# Dried red kidney beans require soaking for at least 12 hours before use. Changing the soak water once or twice during soaking helps to prevent [[w:Flatulence|flatulence]] (farting). 
# Cook in a pot with 50% more water than is needed to cover the beans. Bring to a brisk boil for at least 20 minutes, then reduce to a [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] and cook with the lid not tightly fitted, for 1½ to 3 hours until the beans are tender. Alternatively, cook in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] at 15psi for 25 minutes and allow to cool / lose pressure slowly (about an extra 15 minutes).

**42 pts. 9 pts in Group I (localized disease,  but palliation recommended due to other medical factors), 19 pts in Group II (locally advanced), 11 pts in Group III (distant metastatic), and 3 pts with advanced recurrent disease. Treated with 1000 cGy per fraction. 25 pts received one course, 15 two courses (at monthly intervals), 2 patients received three courses (1000 x 2 then 700 x 1).  38 of 42 pts presented with bleeding; 11 pts presented with pain. 
**Pain: Of 9 pts evaluable, 2 had complete resolution, 2 had partial resolution. Bleeding: of 30 pts evaluable, 18 (60%) had complete resolution, 9 (30%) had partial resolution. 8 pts (27%) remained permanently free of bleeding. Tumor response: of 28 pts evaluable, 7 (25) had CR, 8 (28%) PR.
**Toxicity: 5 pts with serious complications
**Conclusion: &quot;We conclude that 1000 cGy single-fraction whole pelvis treatment can be an effective means of palliating advanced gynecologic cancer provided the patient has a life expectancy of less than 1 year. Patients with a longer life expectancy are at risk for both recurrence of symptoms and for treatment related complications.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sculpture I ==

Sculpture I usually serves as the introductory course that allows the student to become familiar with three-dimensional forms. A general knowledge of basic tools and concepts is introduced, setting the foundation for more advanced work. 


== Tools ==

There are a variety of sculpting tools that sculptors use to help define and form their figures. 

*Loop Tool/Rake Tool - This tool consists of a metal loop attached to a rod of wood. The metal loop is designed in such a way that the artist can easily &quot;rake&quot; across the surface of clay, plaster, and other materials to smooth and better define the form. This tool comes in a variety of sizes, suitable for all applications.

*Pin Tool - A small, sharp metal point attached to a rod of wood. This tool is designed for making sharp, pen-like impressions into surfaces, primarily clay. Many prefer to use this tool to &quot;sketch&quot; onto the surface of their subject when in the development stage.

*Hands - Often disregarded as a tool, this is actually the most important tool of them all. Never substitute your hands for another tool just because the other tool is specifically suggested for the application. Sometimes your hands can do the best work.



Please understand though that the artist is not limited by these tools alone. Many artists use whatever is available; as long as the intentions of the artist are portrayed in the sculpture, it doesn't matter what tools you use. There are an almost infinite amount of tools, with many different variations, which could be substituted for by any simple object.

== Materials ==

Unlike drawing in which you're restricted to pencils, pastels, and other concrete mediums, Sculptures can consist of any material you can obtain, making it a very free and expansive art form. Sculptures have been erected of aluminum foil, chicken wire, packaging tape, and even plants! The beginning sculptor, however, will want to become familiar with the most readily-available and common sculpting materials.

*Clay -
*Plaster -

Other materials and their uses will be covered in the following sculpture Wikibooks.

=Using Metasploit=
This chapter covers various aspects of using ''The Metasploit Framework''. 

For the time being, its a collection of assorted topics. Later these can be organized to make more sense.

__TOC__

==Using Databases with MSF==

MSF allows storing scan/exploitation results into databases for persistent storage. The framework supports using quite a few database back-ends. These include:

* Postgres
* MySQL
* SQLite (version 2 &amp; 3)

'''Note:''' Except for SQLite (which stores the database as a file), you need to start the database server for Postgres or MySQL before starting to use the databases with the Framework.

'''Note:''' Using the Framework with postgres requires edits to pg_hba.conf. Replace the default &quot;ident&quot; method with &quot;trust&quot; as shown:

[[Image:Pg_hba.png]]

'''Note:''' before using postgres, you must run  &lt;code&gt;$ gem install postgres&lt;/code&gt;.  This requires header files that come with postgresql-dev

'''Note:''' For best results use msfconsole to interact with a database from the Framework.

Database storage comes in handy for MSF in quite a few ways. The most interesting/hot topic of automated exploitation (someone please write a good article on that based on H.D's blog) works with database integration. MSF can scan hosts using nmap and store their states in the DB and then automatically tries to exploit vulnerabilities that have exploits present for them in MSF. Auxiliary modules such as scanners can also utilize databases to store different state information. You can even write your own quick scanner and have it store information in the underlying database.

===The Database Schema===

MSF creates a database for its usage. This database contains following tables

* hosts
* creds               
* refs                
* services            
* vulns               
* vulns_refs
* clients          
* events
* loots
* report_templates
* reports
* tasks
* users
* workspaces

You can easily view the structure of this database in your RDBMS.

'''Note:''' The folder framework_base_folder/data/sql/ contains SQL files that are used to create the database tables for a given RDBMS.

===Loading A Database Module===

Before starting to use databases with MSF, appropriate database module should be loaded. For msfconsole, this can be loaded by using the '''load db_*''' commands. Here is a sample session of using MySQL with MSF.

 root # /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld start     &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;# start mysql database server&lt;/font&gt;
 Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
 
 root # msfconsole                    &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;# start MSF console interface&lt;/font&gt;

 MySQL Database Commands
 =======================
 
     Command        Description
     -------        -----------
     db_connect     Connect to an existing database ( user:pass@host:port/db )
     db_create      Create a brand new database ( user:pass@host:port/db )
     db_destroy     Drop an existing database ( user:pass@host:port/db )
     db_disconnect  Disconnect from the current database instance

===Creating a Database===

The first time you want to use a database with MSF, you need to create it. Once a database is created, you can use it by just connecting to it in future sessions. The '''db_create''' command allows you to create a new database. Let's create a database named ''metasploit''

 &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;# Connect and user ''root'' with password ''mydbpass'' and create a database named metasploit&lt;/font&gt;
 msf &gt; db_create root:mydbpass@localhost/metasploit 
 [*] Database creation complete (check for errors)

Once a database is created, it is automatically usable for that session. For further sessions, you can connect to the db.

===Using an Existing Database===

If you have created a database previously, then for future sessions you can just use it with the '''db_connect''' command.

 root # msfconsole                    &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;# start MSF console interface&lt;/font&gt;

 =========================
 
     Command               Description
     -------               -----------
     db_add_host           Add one or more hosts to the database
     db_add_port           Add a port to host
     db_autopwn            Automatically exploit everything
     db_hosts              List all hosts in the database
     db_import_nessus_nbe  Import a Nessus scan result file (NBE)
     db_import_nmap_xml    Import a Nmap scan results file (-oX)
     db_nmap               Executes nmap and records the output automatically
     db_services           List all services in the database
     db_vulns              List all vulnerabilities in the database

 msf &gt; db_hosts
 [*] Host: localhost

===Disconnecting a Database===

If in a session you feel that you no longer have the need to use the database then you can disconnect from the database by simply issuing the '''db_disconnect''' command at the 'MSF &gt;' prompt.


===Dropping a Database===

When you just want to delete the database with all data in it (perhaps, you have taken a backup and are now looking to free up disk space), then you can do so by using the '''db_destroy''' command.

 msf &gt; db_destroy root:mydbpass@localhost/metasploit  &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;# Drops the metasploit database&lt;/font&gt;
 Database &quot;metasploit&quot; dropped
 

===Database Backend Commands===

When MSF is connected to a database, another set of commands called ''Database Backend Commands'' are available. These commands allow you to perform port scans on hosts, check for live hosts, what services they are running and the vulnerabilities that these services have.

    Command               Description                                         
    -------               -----------                                         
    db_add_host           Add one or more hosts to the database               
    db_add_note           Add a note to host                                  
    db_add_port           Add a port to host                                  
    db_autopwn            Automatically exploit everything                    
    db_hosts              List all hosts in the database                      
    db_import_nessus_nbe  Import a Nessus scan result file (NBE)              
    db_import_nmap_xml    Import a Nmap scan results file (-oX)               
    db_nmap               Executes nmap and records the output automatically  
    db_notes              List all notes in the database                      
    db_services           List all services in the database                   
    db_vulns              List all vulnerabilities in the database

The important one and most often used is '''db_nmap''' which will run nmap with specified commands and record the findings within the database. 

 msf&gt; db_nmap -sS -P0 192.168.1.1
 ...

To list the host(s) found in the scan...

 msf&gt; db_hosts
 [*] Time: Wed Mar 05 15:18:48 -0500 2008 Host: 192.168.1.1

To list possible vulnerabilities found in the scan of the host(s)...
 
 msf&gt; db_vulns
 ...

===db_autopwn===

You can use another database backend command '''db_autopwn''' to execute exploits against the host(s) from the database. [http://blog.metasploit.com/2006/09/metasploit-30-automated-exploitation.html H.D. Moore wrote about this functionality] when added to the framework -- for more information. 

 msf &gt; db_autopwn
 [*] Usage: db_autopwn [options]
        -h         Display this help text
        -t         Show all matching exploit modules
        -x         Select modules based on vulnerability references
        -p         Select modules based on open ports
        -e         Launch exploits against all matched targets
        -s         Only obtain a single shell per target system (NON-FUNCTIONAL)
        -r         Use a reverse connect shell
        -b         Use a bind shell on a random port
        -I [range] Only exploit hosts inside this range
        -X [range] Always exclude hosts inside this range</text>

= Utilizing MSF Mixins For Exploit/Auxiliary Modules Development =
Mixins are a handy mechanism in Ruby language to include functionality into a module. Although Ruby is a single-inheritance language, mixins provide a way to have multiple-inheritance of some sort. Metasploit makes good use of mixins. Understanding and efficiently using mixins is a vital part in the course of module development for MSF. This chapter aims to describe various mixins available, their purpose and functionality.

'''Please note ''' that mixins are normally not tied to a specific module category (Exploit, Auxiliary etc), though they appear under the one which most closely suits them. This means that you can use Exploit module mixins in Auxiliary modules and vice versa.

__TOC__

=== The Auxiliary::Report Mixin ===

This mixin is used to save host, service and vulnerability info to a database. It provides two methods '''report_host''' and '''report_service''' that are used to indicate the status of a host (Up or Down etc) and a service. To use this module you need to include it into your classes by using: '''include Auxiliary::Report'''

After including the mixin, you can use its method to save info in the DB. 

'''Please note ''' if you haven't loaded a backend database, calling these methods won't do anything and will not raise an error.

==== Auxiliary::Report.report_host() ====

This method takes in a hash argument. To save the status of a host that is up, you can call this method as:

 report_host(:host =&gt; datastore['RHOST'])

To specify that a host is not online (dead), pass the second parameter to the method that should be of type HostState.

 report_host(:host =&gt; '127.0.0.1', Msf::HostState::Dead)


==== Auxiliary::Report.report_service() ====

Similar to the report_host method, this method also takes a hash argument containing various key-value pairs. The hash can contain values for the following keys:

* addr (The hostname or address)
* port (The numerical port number)
* proto (Protocol can be ''' 'tcp' ''' or ''' 'udp' ''')
* name (Service name, like 'http', 'https', etc)
* state (service state of type Msf::ServiceState)

The code snippet below reports TCP port 80 to be open for localhost. Notice that the default value for state is '''Msf::ServiceState::Up''' so we don't need to specify the state parameter.
 
 report_service(:host =&gt; 'localhost',
                :port =&gt; 80,
                :name =&gt; 'HTTP'
               )


=== The Auxiliary::Scanner Mixin ===

The Scanner mixin allows modules to have the ability to perform operations on more than one host. The easiest and most common way to implement a scanner is to include the scanner mixin with a line like:

 include Auxiliary::Scanner

and then implement the run_host(ip) method in your module

 def run_host(ip)
    print_status(&quot;Processing IP #{ip}&quot;)
 end

Each host/IP is automatically passed to this function and you just have to implment your logic as if you were working on a single host.

Including the scanner mixin removes the '''RHOST''' option from the module options and adds a '''RHOSTS''' option to the module. This option allows you to specify network address ranges (like: 192.168.10.0/24, 11.23.45.6-11.23.45.56, etc). This allows module users to specify the hosts to scan.

==== run_host() ====
called with a single IP, with THREADS concurrent threads. The
best way to mass-test a range of addresses for a host-specific issue.

==== run_batch() ====
called with a group of IPs with the size defined by the
run_batch_size() method, with THREADS concurrent threads. This means it
will process multiple batches at the same time, so don't use this for
single-host testing (its useful for a few edge cases basically).

==== run_range() ====
called *once* for the entire range of hosts. This is useful
if you are going to be passing this range to another tool or doing some
network-wide test. For example, calling the nmap program.

==== USING MULTIPLE THREADS FOR SCANNING ====

The scanner module now has an additional feature of using multiple threads to have multiple hosts scanned in parallel. Including the scanner mixin now adds an additional '''THREADS''' option to your module with a default value of 1. Module users and/or developers can change this value to anything greater than 1 to have multiple-threaded scanning.

== Completeness and Formatting ==

I agree with Xania that formatting is relatively minor thing, and that it ''would'' make somewhat of a bias towards books written by those who know more about wiki markup to favor those books with good formatting. Also, I think that if we feel formatting is the ''only'' thing keeping something from becoming a &quot;featured book&quot; then we should collaborate to fix the formatting (for the sake of any authors that do not know how) and then it'd be good to go.

As far as content is concerned, I think that there needs to be ''some'' break-point as far as how in-depth the book goes on a topic, yes I agree with Xania that formatting isn't as important but I would beg to differ about the amount (and, even more importantly, the quality) of the content. I agree that a good book doesn't need to be that long (eg the survival guide, which covers a rather narrow topic but does so well; also chess only has 7 pages I think but they cover the most essential topics regarding the game) but I feel it does need to cover a significant amount of the proposed topic.

I think part of the problem might be that we need to think about whether we want this project to be a list of ''good'' books or a list of ''the best'' books on the project, because it seems to me at least that there's some disagreement of which is which. I'd suggest that perhaps we should develop a more specific set of standards so that we know what we're looking for in content particularly before we vote on something (because we have several guidelines for formatting but only 1-2 very general points as far as content is concerned). I myself would vouch for the ''latter'' since the project is, as far as I can tell, reader-oriented. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:I'm really trying to put our best books forward, because I think readers will be  more impressed by the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; then by a whole bunch of books that are  just &quot;good enough&quot;. I will entertain criticisms that I am being too myopic. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:10, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree completely with Whiteknight. It's far better to have a shorter list of truly excellent books than a long list of books that are just ok or even &quot;good&quot; (&quot;good&quot; is a really undescriptive word, and not really that high an accolade). I also don't like how we use the term &quot;good books&quot; in some places and &quot;featured books&quot; in others. Is there a difference? Is one an older naming convention than the other?
:: On Mattb112885's points, I think that both formatting and actual content are equally important. When looking at a textbook, there's nothing more daunting than a huge pile of unformatted text. No matter how thrilling the prose its, it's still just text and you won't learn much from it, in my opinion. On the other hand, substandard content cannot be improved by making it pretty; formatting alone does not a good book make. I believe that we need to require both good content, and good formatting, in order for a book to be featured. These are supposed to be the showcase of the website, and if they're lacking in either area, they're clearly not showing our full potential, or a standard for which to aim.
:: I also agree that we need to set some proper descriptive standards that encompass everything, so that we're all working from roughly the same page when voting.
:: Kind regards, [[User:Celestianpower|Celestianpower]] 22:01, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

::: That is true, it can't be completely UN-formatted, I'm just saying that as long as the basic formatting is there we probably shouldn't look past the book just because it doesn't use fancy templates and what have you, as long as whatever is there does the job. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:31, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

::::We also have to ask how much effort, exactly, does it take to properly format a book to a minimum standard? The breaking of different subjects into different headings is one of the most important, and easiest, steps in formatting a book properly. Using bold on keywords, or italics on items that need emphasis are good too, but not always necessary. Other formatting tools such as tables, image captions, definition lists, etc are all nice but certainly not needed (and not always applicable). In the end, the formatting required is very very small, but that minimum level should not be ignored. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:21, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

==Removing featured books==

Should books that pass the nominations be removed from the list? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:48, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

==Re-nominations==

[[Marketing]] has been re-nominated. Perhaps there should be some criteria for renomination.  I would like to see, as a minimum:

#A link to the original nomination.
#A description of how the concerns raised in the rejection have been addressed.

Marketing is an interesting example for re-nomination because voters suggested changes that would make it eligible for featured book status rather than rejecting outright. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 07:55, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

: I agree, this just makes more sense than simply repeatedly posting something and hoping it passes. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 11:19, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

::I changed the text of [[Wikibooks:Good books]] to say that a book may not be renominated for at least one month (which is arbitrary, i know), or until the criticisms from the first nomination have been addressed. Providing a link to the previous nomination, if it can be found in the archives, is a good idea too. The [[Wikibooks:Good books]] page is just a proposal right now, but if we keep doing what it says and nobody objects I think we could just make it into a guideline eventually. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 13:37, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Algorithms comments ==

I definitely like the idea of an Algorithms book, and I do somewhat enjoy the tone.  With respect to Xania's comment, the abbreviations and jargon are explained in the mathematical background, but you might have to wade through them to understand.  This book is much more formal/theoretical than it is technical, so there are some inherent limits to how friendly one can make it.  Friendliness would be brilliant, of course, but for an algorithms book (as opposed to a programming book), the priority is more to be correct than it is to be understandable.  Overall, we can forgive this book for not being completely accessible to the general public.  This book is likely suited for students in computer science programmes, and 'practical' computer programmers interested in catching up on their formal training -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:33, 4 May 2007 (UTC)
:I am a former computer science student and graduate yet I will not support any book which doesn't aim to be &quot;understandable&quot;.  The worst thing about computer science today is that jargon and technical language is unnecessarily frightening for unfamiliar users - and it doesn't need to be. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:15, 4 May 2007 (UTC)
::I have to be honest with you Xania, i dont see anything in this book that is particularly complicated or unaccessible. Remember that textbooks are not collections of articles, and that there is an intended reading order. If you start at the beginning of the book, and don't just flip to a random chapter, all the necessary terms and &quot;jargon&quot; are explained. Alot of the algorithms may not be intuitive or obvious, but that's because many of them deal with specific data structures. For instance, you dont need to know algorithms for manipulating a binary tree unless you know what a binary tree is in the first place. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 20:28, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

Xania - I'm still trying to decide how to vote on this one.  Could you offer some concrete suggestions on how the authors could make this book more accessible?  That is, not just &quot;avoid burying the user in jargon and technical language&quot;, but specific points that could be made clearer.  I would also be willing oppose if you could show a better way; otherwise, I'm leaning towards support.

Also out of curiosity, what kind of computer science did you study?  Theoretical computer science with automata and what not, or more practical programming-oriented stuff? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:44, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

::: Apologies for the late reply.  I now see the appendix and explanations of terms that I had previously confused me.  I'm willing to support this book.  I studied 'Computation' which is geared towards a very broad study of all things computer-related, from software programming, statistics, social consequences of computers and modern technology, using computers for learning, computer architecture and software quality.  Basically a little of everything. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:44, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

:::: Thanks for that.  I think that's why this book seemed a little bit incomprehensible at first; it really does lean towards the theoretical part of computer science (well, it's halfway in between theory and practical, I guess).    It will be a useful resource, though -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:30, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

== New look ==

I don't like the new look with the table of contents down the middle. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 02:39, 16 July 2010 (UTC)
:Looks like it was the result of deleting a &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt; by accident. I've fixed it.
::&lt;edit conflict&gt; never mind. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 03:38, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

== Archiving this stuff ==

Some of the nominations on the main page are two years old and long closed.  I was going to move them to an archive but not sure where.  I found a whole page of archives but they are all placed in a page of their own which seems very inconvenient and moving each closed nomination will be too time-consuming.  Can we not just archive them as we would archive anything else and have one page for each year of nominations?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:20, 16 March 2013 (UTC)

: Hm.  One-to-a-page is the way we archive deletion discussions, too.  The advantage, I suppose, is ability to automatically generate a link to it (or to them, if there are multiple nominations).  This is an instance where a bit of semi-automation to make the operation easier to do &quot;by hand&quot; would be a big help.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:05, 16 March 2013 (UTC)

::Yeah I forgot about the delete discussions.  Seems a lot of work for something that almost nobody would ever want to read again.  I'll leave it until somebody has the time to move them to their resting place or a bot does the work for us.  It would be much simpler if we just moved them all to one page and then copied the main comments and a link to the archive page onto the book's Talk page.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:13, 16 March 2013 (UTC)

::: The other example of this I've seen was on Wikinews, where someone tried to set things up so that requests for privileges would all be filed away neatly in per-request archive pages, and whenever someone requested any sort of a privilege, a complete list of all their past requests for any privilege whatever would automatically pop up.  Which makes all kinds of sense for Wikinews because it's quite common for any regular Wikinewsie to have multiple such requests, except that it was going to be too much work to maintain.  So there's clearly a market for a tool that would make this sort of per-request archiving easy to do.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:24, 17 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am concerned that this book is not as academically focused as it could be. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 23:54, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

I just found this wiki book by pure chance, and I think that it is a great thing to do. My concern is as follows:

There are three approaches that can be taken, academic, as stated by Remi0o, technically enabled, as in  the language HDM will understand - and basic beginer, someone trying to learn how to use metasploit. Has this been discussed anywhere? If maybe a few people can get together, and at least have a plan for all the sections that will be placed in the book, that would be a good idea I think. Thanks for looking :)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There’s an old saying, “Everything is bigger in Texas.” That’s especially true when talking about the Prairies &amp; Lakes region, because it’s the largest of all the travel regions in the Lone Star State. Here you’ll find that everything is big: Big cities, big attractions, and big fun!

----
Just how big is this region, you ask? Well, its northern border is the Red River, which separates Texas from Oklahoma, and its southern edge is more than 350 miles away, just a little southeast of San Antonio. This area has everything, from bustling big cities to quaint small towns, and from fast-moving rides to slow-moving experiences. There’s no doubt you’ll have a great time while you’re here.

----
If you’re looking for some really big adventures, look no further than the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Dallas, one of the largest cities in the country, is filled with fantastic attractions like the Dallas Museum of Art, the Dallas Zoo, Fair Park (home to the State Fair of Texas, held every September and October), Deep Ellum entertainment district, the Sixth Floor Museum, and so much more.

----
In Fort Worth, get a sense of the true cowboy spirit at the Stockyards National Historic District, the Stockyards Collection &amp; Museum, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, and Billy Bob’s Texas - the largest honky tonk in the world. You can also immerse yourself in culture at the Amon Carter Museum, Kimbell Art Museum, Bass Performance Hall, and more. There’s plenty of family entertainment, as well, at the Fort Worth Zoo, which includes an eight-acre exhibit featuring more than 200 animal species that are native to Texas.

----
While Dallas and Fort Worth may be the two largest cities in the region, there are many other cities in the metroplex that are home to attractions. In Arlington, experience Six Flags Over Texas, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, and Ameriquest Field - home of the Texas Rangers baseball club. Just a few miles away is Irving, and Texas Stadium, where the Dallas Cowboys play their home games every fall.

----
To the east lie communities such as Paris, Sulphur Springs, Commerce, Mount Vernon and more. There’s so much to see and do here, from visiting historical and heritage museums to visiting one of Texas’ outstanding state parks and taking in the fantastic events that are happening almost every weekend. You’re sure to find a friendly face and a fun-filled experience.

----
Head south and you’ll find Waco, the heart of the Prairies and Lakes region. This busy city features some remarkable sites, like the Dr Pepper Museum, Cameron Park Zoo, Texas Ranger Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, Texas Sports Hall of Fame, the Armstrong-Browning Museum, and the Mayborn Museum Complex. Nearby are water recreation activities to be found at Stillhouse Hollow Lake, Lake Brazos, and Lake Belton, just to name a few.

----
To the southeast lies the Bryan-College Station area, two cities that combine their wonderful resources to make a destination for every type of traveler. The sites found on the Texas A&amp;M University campus, the splendor of the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, and the elegance of the Messina Hof Wine Cellars are among the many options that will entertain the entire family.

----
Further south are attractions that provide glimpses into early Texas life in the communities of Burton, Washington, Bastrop, Lockhart, Seguin, Gonzales, Columbus, and more. For the ice cream fanatics in your travel party, don’t miss the chance to sample some of the many delicious creations found at Blue Bell Creameries in Brenham, home to the world-famous Blue Bell ice cream.

----
So, if you’re ready for a big time in Texas, plot your course and prepare for a big adventure in the Prairies &amp; Lakes region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Fusarium oxysporum''''', also referred to as '''Agent Green''', is a fungus that causes '''Fusarium wilt''' disease in more than a hundred species of plants. It does so by colonizing the water-conducting vessels (xylem) of the plant. As a result of this blockage and breakdown of xylem, symptoms appear in plants such as leaf wilting, yellowing and eventually plant death.

Interest in ''Fusarium oxysporum'' as a pesticide was first raised after the discovery in the 1960s that it was the causative agent in the destruction of the Hawaiian coca population.

The United States government was involved in a controversial program to use ''Fusarium oxysporum'' for the eradication of coca in Colombia and other Andean countries, but these plans were cancelled by president Bill Clinton who was concerned that the unilateral use of a biological agent would be perceived by the rest of the world as biological warfare. The Andean nations have since banned its use throughout the region. Use of biological agents to kill crops is potentially illegal under the Biological Weapons Convention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Downy and Powdery mildew on grape leaf.JPG|thumb|180px|Downy mildew (left) and Powdery mildew (right)]]
'''Downy mildew''' refers to any of several types of oomycete that infect plants.  In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vine-type vegetables.

The prime example is ''Peronospora farinosaas'' featured in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=134698 NCBI-Taxonomy]  and [http://www.inra.fr/Internet/Produits/HYP3/pathogene/6perfar.htm HYP3].

Cucurbit downy mildew (caused by ''Pseudoperonospora cubensis'') is specific to cantaloupe, cucumber, pumpkin, squash, watermelon and other members of the gourd family. The disease is one of the most important diseases of cucurbits worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a System of Equations? ==

A '''system''' of equations is any number of equations with more than one total unknown, such that the same unknown must have the same value in every equation. You have probably dealt a great deal, in the past, with ''linear systems of equations'', for which many solution methods exist. A linear system is a system of the form:

{{box|'''Linear Systems'''

&lt;math&gt; C_1 = a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C_2 = b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... &lt;/math&gt;

And so on, where the a's and b's are constant. }}

Any system that is not linear is '''nonlinear'''. Nonlinear equations are, generally, far more difficult to solve than linear equations but there are techniques by which some special cases can be solved for an exact answer. For other cases, there may not be any solutions (which is even true about linear systems!), or those solutions may only be obtainable using a ''numerical method'' similar to those for single-variable equations. As you might imagine, these will be considerably more complicated on a multiple-variable system than on a single equation, so it is recommended that you use a computer program if the equations get too nasty.

== Solvability ==

A system is '''solvable''' if and only if there are only a finite number of solutions. This is, of course, what you usually want, since you want the results to be somewhat predictable of whatever you're designing.

Here is how you can tell if it will ''definitely'' be impossible to solve a set of equations, or if it merely ''may'' be impossible.

'''Solvability of systems''': 
# If a set of n '''independent''' equations has n unknowns, then the system has a finite (possibly 0) number of solutions.
# If a set of n '''independent''' equations has ''less than'' n unknowns then the system has an infinite number of solutions.
# If a set of n '''independent or dependent''' equations has ''more than'' n unknowns then the system has no solutions.
# Any dependent equations in a system do not count towards n.

Note that even if a system is solvable it doesn't mean it has solutions, it just means that there's not an infinite number.

== Methods to Solve Systems ==

As you may recall there are many ways to solve systems of ''linear'' equations. These include:

* '''Linear Combination''': Add multiples of one equation to the others in order to get rid of one variable. This is the basis for [[w:Gaussian elimination|Gaussian elimination]] which is one of the faster techniques to use with a computer.
* '''[[w:Cramer's rule|Cramer's rule]]''' which involves determinants of coefficient matrices.
* '''Substitution''': Solve one equation for one variable and then substitute the resulting expression into all other equations, thus eliminating the variable you solved for.

The last one, substitution, is most useful when you have to solve a set of '''nonlinear''' equations. Linear combination can only be employed if the same type of term appears in all equations (which is unlikely except for a linear system), and no general analogue for Cramer's rule exists for nonlinear systems. However, substitution is still equally valid. Let's look at a simple example.

=== Example of the Substitution Method for Nonlinear Systems ===

{{example| Solve the following system of equations for X and Y

#&lt;math&gt; X + Y^2 = 4 &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; X^2 - Y^2 = 22 &lt;/math&gt; }}

Solution: We want to employ substitution, so we should ask: '''which variable is easier to solve for?'''. In this case, X (in the top equation) is easiest to solve for so we do that to obtain:

&lt;math&gt; X = 4 - Y^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the bottom equation gives:

&lt;math&gt; (4 - Y^2)^2 - Y^2 = 22 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 4 - 8Y^2 + Y^4 - Y^2 = 22 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Y^4 - 9Y^2 - 18 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; 

This can be solved by the '''method of substitution''':

Let &lt;math&gt; U = Y^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Plugging this in:

&lt;math&gt; U^2 - 9U - 18 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

{{NOTE|All Ys must be eliminated for this method to be valid. Do something like this when the same variable (or set of variables) appears ''in the same for every time''. If it's not in the same form '''every time''', i.e. if the equation was something like &lt;math&gt; Y^4 - 9Y^2 - 18 + e^Y &lt;/math&gt;, then the method would not simplify your calculations enough to make it worth doing.}}

Solving by factoring:

&lt;math&gt; (U - 6)(U - 3) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; U = 3,6 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus since &lt;math&gt; U = Y^2 &lt;/math&gt; we obtain '''four''' solutions for Y!

{{box|&lt;math&gt; Y = \pm \sqrt{3}, Y=\pm \sqrt{6} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Notice, however, that depending on where this system ''came'' from, the negative solutions may not make sense, so think before you continue!

Let's take into account all of them for now. Since we have Y we can now solve for X:

&lt;math&gt; X = 4 - Y^2 = 4 - U &lt;/math&gt;

{{box| &lt;math&gt;X = 1,-2&lt;/math&gt;}}

{{NOTE|Again, it may be true that only positive values of X make sense If only positive values of X and Y make sense then the ONLY solution that is of any worth to us is the solution &lt;math&gt; (X,Y) = (1,\sqrt{3}) &lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt; Y = \sqrt{6} &lt;/math&gt; results in a negative value for X.}}

Notice that even a small system like this has a large number of solutions and, indeed, some systems will have an infinite number, such as:

#&lt;math&gt; y = sin(x) &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; y = cos(x) &lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical Methods to Solve Systems ==

There are numerical equivalents in multiple variables to ''some'' of the methods demonstrated in the previous section. Many of them in their purest forms involve the use of calculus (in fact, the Taylor method does as well), but as before, they can be reduced to approximate algebraic forms at the expense of some accuracy.

=== Shots in the Dark ===

If you can solve all of the equations explicitly for the same variable (say, y) you can guess all but one and then compare how different the resulting values of y are in each equation. This method is entirely brute-force, because '''if there are more than two equations, it is necessary to guess all of the variables but one using this method''', and there is no way to tell what the next guess should be. Trying to guess multiple variables at once from thin air gets to be a hastle even with a computer.

Since there are so many problems with this method, it will not be discussed further

=== Fixed-point iteration ===

Again, the multivariate form of fixed-point iteration is so unstable that it generally can be assumed that it will not work. Weighted iteration is also significantly more difficult.

=== Looping method ===

This is one method that ''does'' work, and that is somewhat different from any single-variable method. In the looping method technique, it is necessary to be able to solve ''each equation for a unique variable'', and then you'll go around in a loop essentially, starting with an initial guess on (ideally) a ''single'' variable, say y, and then evaluating all equations until you return to your original variable with a new value y'. If the result is not the same as the guess(es) you started with, you need to make a new guess based on the ''trends in the results''.

{{NOTE|What kind of trends am I talking about? If you have a well-behaved system, an increase in y will consistently lead to either an increase or a decrease in y', so you can take advantage of this to see which way you need to adjust your original guess. DO NOT attempt to use the value for y' as a new guess!}}

More specifically, here is an algorithm you can use:

# Solve all equations for a '''different variable'''.
# Make a guess on one variable (or as many as necessary to evaluate a second one, if it's more than one it gets harder though, so it is recommended to use another method)
# Go through all of the equations until you end up recalculating the variable (or all of the variables) which you had originally guessed. Note whether the result is higher or lower than your guess.
# Make another guess on the variable(s). Go through the loop again.
# After these two guesses, we know whether increasing or guess will increase or decrease the recalculated value. Therefore, we can deduce whether we need to increase or decrease our guess to get a recalculated value equal to the guess.
# Keep guessing appropriately until the recalculated value equals the guess.

This technique is often necessary in engineering calculations because they are based on data, not on explicit equations for quantities. As we'll see, however, it can be difficult to get it to converge, and this method isn't that convenient to do by hand (though it is the most reliable one to do realistically). It is great, however, for inputting guesses into a computer or spreadsheet until it works. 

{{example|Solve this system:

#&lt;math&gt; y = e^{-x} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; y = ln(x) &lt;/math&gt; }}

First we need to solve one of them for x, let's choose the first one:

&lt;math&gt; x = -ln(y) &lt;/math&gt;

* To start off, we make a guess: y = 0.1 Then from the first equation, x = 2.303
* Plug this back into the second equation and you'll come out with y' = 0.834. The recalculated value is '''too high'''.

* Now make a new guess on y: say, y = 0.5. This results in x = 0.6931
* Plugging back into the second equation gives y' = -0.3665. The recalculated value is '''too low'''.

{{NOTE|Now we know that increasing the guess decreases the recalculated value y' and vice versa. Since the second value of y' is too low this means that we need the guess to be smaller than 0.5; likewise, since the first y' was too high we need it to be greater than 0.1. }}

* Lets now try y = 0.25.
* This results in x = 1.386 from the first equation and y' = 0.326 from the second. '''Too high''' so we need to increase our guess.

* Let's guess y = 0.3
* This yields x = 1.204 and thus y' = 0.185, which is '''too low''' indicating the guessed value was too high.

* Guess y = 0.28, hence x = 1.273 and y'= 0.241. The guess is therefore still too high.

* Guess y = 0.27, hence x = 1.309 and y' = 0.269. Therefore we have now converged:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; x = 1.309, y = 0.27 &lt;/math&gt;}}

==== Looping Method with Spreadsheets ====

We can do the guessing procedure more easily by programming it into a spreadsheet. First set up three rows like so:

      A         B      C
 1  y guess     x      y'
 2           =-ln(A2) =ln(B2)

In B2 we put the first function solved for x, and in C2 we have the second function solved for y. Now all we need to do is type in guesses in A2 until the value in C2 is the same as our guess (the spreadsheet will automatically calculate B2 and C2 for you). To make things even easier, put the line &lt;math&gt; =A2 - C2 &lt;/math&gt; into cell D2. Since we want y' to equal y, just keep guessing until the value in D2 is as close to zero as you like.

As a more in-depth example (which would be significantly more difficult to do by hand), consider the system:

{{example|Solve:
*&lt;math&gt; T = \frac{2P^2X^2 - 3e^{-X/T}}{T-2} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; X^2 = T^3 - P &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; 10P = T &lt;/math&gt;}}

In order for this to work, we only need to solve each equation for a unique variable, the expression need not be explicit! The following will work (assuming that X is a positive quantity), and this will be evident shortly:

*&lt;math&gt; T = \frac{2*P^2*X^2 - 3*e^{-X/T}}{T-2} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; X = \sqrt{T^3 - P} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; P = 0.1T &lt;/math&gt;

Now we need to ask: which variable would be the best to guess to start the iteration procedure? In this case the best answer is T because from this guess, we can calculate P from equation 3, then X from equation 2, and finally a new guess on T from equation 1, and use this new value as a gauge of our old guess.

{{NOTE|Generally you want to start the loop with a variable that allows you to calculate a second value with only that one guess. Try to algebraically manipulate your equations so that this is the case before solving, because we want to avoid guessing on multiple variables if at all possible.}}

Lets program this into the spreadsheet:

       A                B           C                        D                                        E
 1   T guess            P           X                        T'                                    T' - T guess
 2                   =0.1*A2    =sqrt(A2^3 - B2) =(2*B2^2*C2^2 - 3*exp(-C2/A2))/(A2 - 2)          =D2 - A2

Once all this is programmed in, you can just input guesses as before, with the eventual result that:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; P = 0.2453, X = 3.8098, T = 2.453 &lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Multivariable Newton Method ===

{{NOTE|You may want to skip this section if you don't know how to invert matrices, add them, or multiply them.}}

There is a multivariate extension to [[w:Newtons method|Newton's method]] which is highly useful. It converges quickly, like the single-variable version, with the downside that, at least by hand, it is tedious. However, a computer can be programmed to do this with little difficulty, and the method is not limited only to systems which can be explicitly solved like the looping method is. In addition, unlike the looping method, the Newton method will actually give you the next set of values to use as a guess.

The method works as follows:

1. Solve all of the equations for 0, i.e. let &lt;math&gt; 0 = F(x_1, x_2, ...) &lt;/math&gt; for all functions F in the system.

2. Guess a value for all variables, and put them into a matrix (X). Calculate the value of all functions F at this guess, and put them into a matrix (F).

3. We need to find estimates for all the '''partial derivatives''' of the function at the guessed values, which is described later.

4. Construct a matrix (to become the Jacobian) as follows: make an empty matrix with n rows and n columns, where n is the number of equations or the number of variables (remember, a solvable system generally has the same number of equations as variables. Then label the columns with the names of variables and the rows with the names of your functions. It should look something like this:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 
 --&amp; x_1&amp; y_2 &amp; ... \\
F_1 &amp;  &amp; &amp;  \\
 F_2&amp;  &amp; &amp; \\
... &amp; &amp; &amp; \\                    
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
5. Put the appropriate partial derivative in the labeled spot. For example, put the partial derivative with respect to x1 from function 1 in the first spot.

6. Once the Jacobian matrix is completely constructed, find the [[w:Inverse|inverse]] of the matrix. There are multiple computer programs that can do this including [http://www.allworldsoft.com/software/4-087-matrix-inverse-calculator.htm this one] (WARNING:Not 
tested software, use at your own risk!). Or you can do it by hand if you know how.

7. Matrix-multiply the inverse Jacobian with the transpose function matrix F (to make it a column matrix), then subtract this from the the transposition of X (again, make it a column matrix):

{{box|&lt;math&gt; X_{n+1}^T = X{n}^T - J^{-1}*F_n^T&lt;/math&gt;

'''Multivariable Newton Method Formula'''}}

8. The result is your next guess. Repeat until convergence.

==== Estimating Partial Derivatives ====

{{warning|You MUST make sure you carry out quite a few decimal places when doing this, because changing the variables by a very small amount may not change the function values too much, but even small changes are important!}}

A '''Partial derivative''' is, in its most basic sense, the slope of the tangent line of a function with more than one variable when all variables except one are held constant. The way to calculate it is:

Now we need to stay organized, so let's introduce some notation:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta F_i}{\delta x_j} &lt;/math&gt; is the partial derivative of function i with respect to variable j.}}

To calculate it:

# Calculate one function F at your guess.
# Increase ''one'' variable, x, by a very small amount &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;. '''Leave all other variables constant'''.
# Recalculate F at the modified guess to give you F'.

The partial derivative of the function F with respect to x is then &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta F_1}{\delta x} = \frac{F_1(x+\delta,y) - F_1(x,y)}{\delta} &lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example of Use of Newton Method ====

Let's go back to our archetypal example:

* &lt;math&gt; y = e^{-x} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; y = ln(x) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 1''': We need to solve each for zero:

* &lt;math&gt; F_1 = 0 = e^{-x} - y &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; F_2 = 0 = ln(x) - y &lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 2''': Lets guess that x = 2.303 and y = 0.1 (it's a good idea to choose guesses that satisfy one of the equations). Then:

&lt;math&gt; X = [2.303, 0.1] &lt;/math&gt;

The values of F at this guess are &lt;math&gt; F_1 = 0, F_2 = 0.734213 &lt;/math&gt;, and hence by definition:

&lt;math&gt; F = [0, 0.724213] &lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3-5''': Calculate the partial derivatives
Lets choose &lt;math&gt; \delta = 0.01 &lt;/math&gt;. Then:

*&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta F_1}{\delta x} = \frac{F_1(x+\delta,y) - F_1(x,y)}{\delta} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; = \frac{(e^{-2.303+0.01}-0.1) - (e^{-2.303}-0.1)}{0.01} = -0.1036 &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta F_1}{\delta y}= \frac{F_1(x,y+\delta) - F_1(x,y)}{\delta} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; = \frac{(e^{-2.303}-(0.1+0.01)) - (e^{-2.303}-0.1)}{0.01} = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivatives of F2 can be similarly calculated to be &lt;math&gt; {\delta F_2}{\delta x} = 0.433 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; {\delta F_2}{\delta y} = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Jacobian of the system is:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 
 --&amp; x&amp; y \\
F_1 &amp; -0.1036 &amp; -1 \\
 F_2&amp; +0.433 &amp; -1 \\                    
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 6''': Using any method you know how to do, you can come up with the inverse of the matrix:

&lt;math&gt; J^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 
 --&amp; x&amp; y \\
F_1 &amp; -1.3636 &amp; 1.8636 \\
 F_2&amp; -0.8069 &amp; -0.1931 \\                    
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 7''': The transposition of F is simply:

&lt;math&gt;F^T = \begin{bmatrix} 
 F \\
 0\\
 0.734213 \\                    
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore by doing matrix multiplication you can come up with the following ''modifying matrix'':

&lt;math&gt; J^{-1} * F^T = \begin{bmatrix} 
 \Delta \\
 1.3682\\
 0.1418 \\                    
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we should subtract 1.3682 from x and 0.1418 from y to get the next guess:

&lt;math&gt; x = 0.9373, y = 0.2418 &lt;/math&gt;

Notice how much closer this is to the true answer than what we started with. However, this method is generally better suited to a computer due to all of the tedious matrix algebra.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Lisp manipulation of C structures =

== Overview ==

Ultimately, dealing with a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; generated by a C or C++ program involves loading that structure into a buffer and picking out the individual fields. Similarly, sending such a structure involves composing a buffer.

Some type conversion is necessary when using [[Programming:Common Lisp/Strings|strings or characters]] in Lisp.

The preferred approach here is to use &lt;code&gt;'(unsigned-byte 8)&lt;/code&gt; for bits coming from or going to the C structure.

While character arrays may be cheap in other languages like C or permit exploiting the ''de facto'' nature of the ASCII character set, that's the wrong approach for ANSI Common Lisp. 

The ANSI specification does not guarantee that a character will contain ASCII or ISO-8859-1 or similar character sets. In fact, the ANSI spec only guarantees up to character code &lt;code&gt;96&lt;/code&gt; [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_char_c.htm] even though contemporary implementations may support Unicode.

Similarly to what's advised for [[Programming:Common Lisp/Files and Directories|Files and Directories]], simply read or write a vector of ''unsigned bytes''.

Anything in the rest of your Lisp program that needs to work with actual strings or characters should convert only as needed after reading.

== Reading ==
&lt;pre&gt;
(defun read-c-file (&amp;optional (file-path &quot;data.struct&quot;) (max-length 48))
  (with-open-file (stream (merge-pathnames file-path)
			  :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)
			  :direction :input)
    (let ((buffer (make-array max-length
			      :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)
			      :fill-pointer t)))
      (let ((actual-length (read-sequence buffer stream
					  :end max-length)))
	(setf (fill-pointer buffer) actual-length)
	(format t &quot;received=~a max=~a buffer=~s~%&quot; actual-length max-length buffer))
      buffer)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use of &lt;code&gt;fill-pointer&lt;/code&gt; for the array is optional but recommended to help track the actual length received, which may differ from what was attempted to be read.

== Writing ==
&lt;pre&gt;
(defun write-C-file (buffer &amp;optional length (file-path &quot;data.struct&quot;))
  (unless length
    (setf length (length buffer)))
  (with-open-file (stream (merge-pathnames file-path)
			  :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)
			  :direction :output
			  :if-exists :rename)
    (let ((written (length (write-sequence buffer stream))))
      (format t &quot;wrote=~a bytes buffer=~s~%&quot; written buffer)))
  buffer)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Processing ==

When processing the vector of &lt;code&gt;'(unsigned-byte 8)&lt;/code&gt; elements, convert each field of the corresponding C structure as needed based upon byte offsets. (Note that it's actually a ''[[Programming:Common Lisp/Sequences|vector]]'' despite being created with &lt;code&gt;make-array&lt;/code&gt;. The distinction is that this has only a single dimension.)

Extracting a ''string'' from the raw bytes:
&lt;pre&gt;
(map 'string #'code-char
     (subseq buffer *start-index* *end-index*))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Extracting just one byte:
&lt;pre&gt;
(subseq buffer *state-index* (1+ *state-index*))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course, you'll need to assign the resulting value from each of those prior two examples.

Meanwhile, assigning into the buffer of raw bytes:

&lt;pre&gt;
(setf (elt buffer *magic-number-index*) (logand #xFF *preamble-value*))
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's important to protect what you're assigning into; use of bitmasks like &lt;code&gt;logand&lt;/code&gt; work well for this.

For more than just one byte, such as inserting ''sequence2'' to become a subset within ''sequence1'', you could use:

&lt;pre&gt;
(replace sequence1 (map 'vector #'char-code sequence2)
	 :start1 a :end1 b)
&lt;/pre&gt;
or following the examples above:
&lt;pre&gt;
(replace buffer (map '(vector '(unsigned-byte 8)) #'char-code string-text)
	 :start1 *start-index* :end1 *end-index*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

A [[#Helper Functions|helper function]] is provided below that avoids an intermediate &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; from getting created.

== Helper Functions ==

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun map-replace (fn sequence1 sequence2 &amp;key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2)
  &quot;Alter elements of first sequence with those from second but after applying function
to that element first, performing each element in order.

Results will be identical to the following but without creating
intermediate vector:
  (replace sequence1 (map 'vector #'char-code sequence2) :start1 start1 :end1 end1)

See also: http://common-lisp.net/project/trivial-utf-8

Side-effects: sequence1 gets modified unless sequence2 is effectively nil.
Returns sequence1 after all modifications.
&quot;
  (loop
     for i upfrom start1 below (or end1 (length sequence1))
     and j upfrom start2 below (or end2 (length sequence2))
     do (setf (elt sequence1 i) (funcall fn (elt sequence2 j))))
  sequence1)


(defun network-bytes-to-number (buffer start-index total-bits)
  &quot;Convert network byte ordered sequence of unsigned bytes to a number.&quot;
  (unless (= (mod total-bits 8) 0)
    (error &quot;Please specify total-bits as total for multiples of eight bit bytes&quot;))
  (let ((value 0))
    (loop for i downfrom (- total-bits 8) downto 0 by 8
       for cursor upfrom start-index
       do (setf value (dpb (elt buffer cursor)
			   (byte 8 i) value))

	 (format t &quot;buffer[~d]==#x~2X; shift&lt;&lt; ~d bits; value=~d~%&quot;
		 cursor (elt buffer cursor) i value))
    value))

(defun number-to-network-bytes (number total-bits &amp;optional buffer (start-index 0))
  &quot;Convert number to network byte ordered sequence of unsigned bytes characters.&quot;
  (unless (= (mod total-bits 8) 0)
    (error &quot;Please specify total-bits as total for multiples of eight bit bytes&quot;))
  (unless buffer
    (setf buffer (make-array (/ total-bits 8) :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
  (loop for i downfrom (- total-bits 8) downto 0 by 8
     for cursor upfrom start-index
     do (setf (elt buffer cursor) (ldb (byte 8 i) number))

       (let ((value (ldb (byte 8 i) number)))
	 (format t &quot;number=~d: shift&gt;&gt; ~d bits; value=~d #x~2X; buffer[~d]==#x~2X~%&quot;
		 number i value value cursor (elt buffer cursor))))
  buffer)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Time &amp;amp; Epochs ==

If converting time values from another language, let alone operating system, be aware that the epoch (semantics for value &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;) may be different.

ANSI Common Lisp has midnight 1 January 1900 UTC as the value 0 while Unix and many C libraries use 1 January 1970. Simple arithmetic converts between the two.

What the heck is &quot;condensed cream of mushroom soup&quot;? --[[User:87.52.25.155|87.52.25.155]] 10:42, 21 April 2007 (UTC)
:Some nasty commercial muck that alludes to being something like mushroom, but isn't. &quot;Condensed&quot; meaning just add water and heat, to get a salty mess with &quot;natural flavours&quot;. Recipe should be amended to use fresh ingredients. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:04, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

If you omit the yucky soup and just add some cooled sauted mushrooms, that basic recipe would be very tasty. ttiizen

I am written concurrently two books, perhaps you will want to look on united discussion page. [[User talk:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Talk:Computer_programming/Object_oriented]] [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 20:09, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

Do you want to write a book about what procedural programming means or about Java? In the first case I will help you. In the second case the title given is not appropriate.

There is also a great book [[Object Oriented Programming]]. That books is describing OO on the programmer level. If you want to start to write rapidly OO or you want to understand existing program, you should read that book. If you want to understand philosophy of OO, if you want to learn theory of OO, this book is for you.

This book can be view as continue of [[Programming Languages/Procedural Languages|Procedural programming]]. If one want to continue to learn object oriented, it is recommended to start from the [[Programming Languages/Procedural Languages|previous]] book first.

== Real world example ==
Consider the real world example. You want to go out the room. You start to think how this mission can be accomplished. To make things simple, consider only the last faze of this mission, you are actually standing near the door. So, you think that you should just open the door and live the room, right? Consider that you actually percepts the world by entities: you distinguishes yourself, and the door from your environment. This entities has some interesting properties. The door can be closed or open, can have lock or not, for example. But actually, you don't care. You know, that you just want to open the door, and you know how this can be done to any door.

While I'll return to the previous example later on this book, meanwhile I want to concentrate on another example - the game twenty one (simplified version of [[m:en:Blackjack|Blackjack]]). 

Much of blackjack's popularity is due to the mix of chance with elements of skill, and the publicity that surrounds [[m:en:card counting|card counting]] (keeping track of which cards have been played since the last shuffle). Blackjack's precursor was ''vingt-et-un'' (&quot;twenty-one&quot;), which originated in French casinos around 1700, and did not offer the 3:2 bonus for a two-card 21. I want to introduce very simple version of this game. I will call this simplified version twenty one through out the book.

There are two players on this game. Let name the first player a dealer. Dealer takes the card and gives one card to the second player, only second player sees the cards. Second player has three options - to ask more card, to surrendered or to stay, that is to say enough cards for now. Every card has number of points associated with it. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10. Ace will be considered to be 11 always. The goal of the game is to have the highest total as long as it doesn't exceed 21; a player with a higher total than 21 is said to ''bust'' or have ''too many''. If the second player has more than 21 on his hand, he lose and must surrender. After the second player stays, the dealer gives cards to himself. If it have more than 21, so he just checks if second player is not cheating by just looking that it has less then 21, and second player wins. If it has less or equals to 21, than cards of the second player is opened and counted. If second player has more than 21, then he wins, if he has less, he lose. If there is draw, the dealer wins. Note, that if second player have 21, it can eventually lose, if dealer will have also 21.

I suppose, while blackjack is familiar to you, this simplified rules are new to you and looks very strange. It is done by two reason. First is to simplify the rules, so the code of this game will be short. Second is to give you to think how you thinks about this problem.
Clearly, you spited the games by entities. You note, this in this game participates two player and cards. Players has some basic functionality, and have some difference. Dialer has some advantage upon the second player. Cards are passive entity. It just has a property how many points it includes. Players makes some actions (surround, stay or ask more card) considering cards. It is very naturally to split the problem based on entities.

Not all the problem can be naturally splited based on entities. For example, if you want to calculate some of two numbers, just go and calculate. (While it is possible to think that number is entity that can be added, it is not naturally to do). In the real world there are problems that is easy to split to entities and problem that are not. From theoretical point of view it can be rigorously proved, that every problem that can be solved by [[Programming Languages/Procedural Languages|Procedural programming]] can be also solved by [[Object Oriented Programming]], and vice-verse, every problem can be also solved by [[Object Oriented Programming]] can be also solved by [[Programming Languages/Procedural Languages|Procedural programming]]. The question is what is more convenient to programmer, in what terms is easy to think about it. This book is not deals with this question, it just describes object oriented approach, and whether to use it in concrete situation is up to you.

A '''grape''' is the fruit that grows on the woody vines of the family [[../Vitaceae/]]. Grapes grow in clusters of 6 to 300, and can be black, blue, golden, green, purple, red, pink, brown, peach or white. 

==Description==
Plants in this genus are woody vines which climb using tendrils. The alternate leaves are simple, palmately veined and often lobes. Flowers are produced in clusters of 6-300. The fruits are berries with 1-6 hard seeds.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
Many species of grapevines exist, including:

*''[[../Vitis vinifera/]]'', the European winemaking grapevine. Native to virtually all of mainland Europe.
*''[[../Vitis labrusca/]]'', the North American table and grape juice grapevines, sometimes used for wine. Native to the Eastern U.S. and Canada.
*''[[../Vitis riparia/]]'', a wild vine of North America, sometimes used for winemaking and for jam. Native to the entire Eastern U.S. and north to Quebec.
*''[[../Vitis rotundifolia/]]'', the muscadines, used for jams  and wine. Native to the Southeastern U.S. from Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico.
*''[[../Vitis aestivalis/]]'', the variety Norton (AKA Cynthiana) is used for winemaking
*''[[../Vitis lincecumii/]]'' (also called ''Vitis aestivalis'' or ''Vitis lincecumii''), ''[[../Vitis berlandieri/]]'' (also called ''Vitis cinerea'' var. helleri), ''[[../Vitis cinerea/]]'', ''[[../Vitis rupestris/]]'' are used for making hybrid grapevines and for pest-resistant rootstocks.
*''[[../Vitis arizonica/]]'' A desert grapevine found in the southwestern US that is hardy against extremes of temperature. Can be used for wines.
*''[[../Vitis californica/]]'' A grapevine important to the California wine industry for its rootstock which is able to withstand pests and cooler weather. Native to California and Oregon.
*''[[../Vitis vulpina/]]''  Frost grape. Native to the Midwest east to the coast up through New York. 

There are many [[w:List of grape varieties|varieties]] of grapevines; most are cultivars of ''V. vinifera''.

Hybrid grapes also exist, and these are primarily crosses between ''[[../Vitis vinifera/]]'' and one or more varieties of ''[[../Vitis labrusca/]]'', ''[[../Vitis riparia/|../Vitis riparia/]]'' or ''[[../Vitis aestivalis/]]''. Hybrids tend to be less susceptible to frost and disease (notably phylloxera), but wine from some hybrids may have a little of the characteristic &quot;foxy&quot; odor of ''[[../Vitis labrusca/]]''.

==Uses==
They can be eaten raw or used for making jam, grape juice, jelly, wine and grape seed oil. Cultivation of grapevines occurs in vineyards, and is calleviticulture. One who studies and practices growing grapes for wine is called a viticulturalist.

Raisins are the dried fruit of the grapevine, and the name actually comes from the French word for &quot;grape&quot;. Wild grapevines are often considered a nuisance weed, as they cover other plants with their usually rather aggressive growth.

The leaves of the grape vine itself are considered edible and are used in the production of dolmades.

==Maintenance==
The most important maintenance requirement for grapes is regular pruning. Vines should be pruned back to spurs while dormant, in order to ensure good air circulation and keep the plants from getting out of hand. 

Adequate calcium should be maintained in the soil if growing for fruit.

==Propagation==
Cultivars are almost always grafted.

==Harvesting==

      <text xml:space="preserve">An inviting climate, combined with friendly people, make up a large part of the spectacular South Texas Plains region. While this part of Texas might feature some flat terrain broken only by mesquite and brush, there’s definitely nothing “plain” about this region. Rich in history and culture, the sights, sounds, tastes and experiences are sure to entice and intrigue you while you’re here.

----
This region - incorporating the southeast corner of the tropical Rio Grande Valley, the rugged beauty of the westernmost tip near Eagle Pass, and northwestern wonder that is San Antonio - is packed with adventures.

----
History buffs can travel across parts of Texas that conquistadors once traversed on their explorations, and visit locations where Franciscan monks set up missions to Christianize and educate the natives. Texas is said to have the second finest examples of Spanish mission architecture in the United States, some of which can be found in the mission district of San Antonio and Mission Espiritu Santo in Goliad.

----
In the eastern part of the region, the communities of Goliad and Fannin pay tribute via museums and historic sites to the sacrifices made by those who fought for the Lone Star State’s independence from Mexico. In the middle of the region, museums in Falfurrius, Alice and George West detail life for early settlers in this part of Texas.

----
For nature lovers, the semi-tropical Rio Grande Valley also is one of the best bird watching spots in North America, with nearly 500 bird species and more than 300 kinds of butterflies that call this area home. Located where major bird migratory routes converge, this region houses the World Birding Center, a network of nine sites with headquarters at Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park near Mission.

----
In Three Rivers, Choke Canyon State Park features ample fishing and boating opportunities on the massive 26,000-acre Choke Canyon Reservoir, while those who like to enjoy nature can hike, camp, picnic or just relax.

----
The Rio Grande Valley also is quite popular with winter visitors due to the area’s balmy weather. Conditions are inviting for those who want to escape the sleet, snow, ice and cold of more northern climes. These Winter Texans move into the Valley for extended stays, often returning year after year. The inviting climate and wonderfully mild winter weather means visitors can look forward to golf, tennis, fishing and other outdoor activities year-round.

----
While there is plenty of entertainment on this side of the border, neighboring cities in Mexico offer enchantment and intrigue for visitors’ young and old alike. The beauty and hospitality of the Mexican culture is evident throughout the region in the border cites of Eagle Pass, Laredo, Roma, Rio Grande City and McAllen.

----
Last, but certainly not least, is the gem of the region - San Antonio. The area’s largest city and one of the biggest cities in the state, San Antonio is home to destinations that are known the world over - the Alamo and the River Walk. Other family attractions include SeaWorld San Antonio, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, San Antonio Zoo, Guiness World Records Museum and Ripley’s Haunted Adventure, and the San Antonio Children’s Museum; but there’s so much more to experience. The city proudly showcases some amazing artwork, in places like the McNay Art Museum, Mexican Cultural Institute and the San Antonio Museum of Art, and provides some outdoor adventures at Natural Bridge Caverns, Brackenridge Park and the Natural Bridge Wildlife Ranch.

----
So, hola amigos, and welcome to the wonderful South Texas Plains!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Benzene-pi-MO-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|300px|Arenes, such as benzene (above), have regions of high electron density above and below their benzene rings.  Delocalised electrons from orbitals occupying these regions attract cationic or partially positively charged electrophiles.]]

'''Reactions of arenes''' is the title of Section 12.4 in ''Chemical Ideas''.

== Introduction ==
Arenes are much more stable and less reactive than alkenes.  Unlike alkenes, '''arenes do not undergo electrophilic addition''' reactions because doing so would destroy the arene's aromaticity (stability due to electron delocalisation in a ring).

[[Image:Bromine-adds-to-ethene.png|300px]]

[[Image:Bromine-does-not-add-to-benzene.png|300px]]

The characteristic reactions of arenes are entirely different.  They tend to undergo '''electrophilic substitution''', which involves an electrophile taking the place of a hydrogen atom on the arene's benzene ring.

[[Image:Bromination-of-benzene.png|400px]]

== Bromination of benzene ==
[[Image:Bromobenzene-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[w:space-filling model|space-filling model]] of [[w:bromobenzene|bromobenzene]]]]

=== Overview ===
[[Image:Benzene-bromination-overview.png|400px]]

=== Mechanism ===
[[Image:Benzene-bromination-step-1.png|300px]]

[[Image:Benzene-bromination-step-2.png|270px]]

[[Image:Benzene-bromination-step-3.png|300px]]

== Chlorination ==
=== Overview ===
Anhydrous conditions are essential whenever aluminium chloride, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is used — upon contact with water, an explosive reaction may occur, releasing corrosive hydrogen chloride gas and a great deal of heat.

[[Image:Benzene-chlorination-overview.png|400px]]

=== Mechanism ===
[[Image:Benzene-chlorination-step-1.png|300px]]

[[Image:Benzene-chlorination-step-2.png|270px]]

[[Image:Benzene-chlorination-step-3.png|300px]]

== Friedel-Crafts reactions ==

=== Friedel-Crafts alkylation ===

==== Overview ====
[[Image:Friedel-Crafts-alkylation-overview.png|400px]]

==== Mechanism ====

=== Friedel-Crafts acylation ===

==== Overview ====
[[Image:Friedel-Crafts-acylation-overview.png|400px]]

==== Mechanism ====
[[Image:Friedel-Crafts-acylation-step-1.png|300px]]

[[Image:Friedel-Crafts-acylation-step-2.png|230px]]

[[Image:Friedel-Crafts-acylation-step-3.png|300px]]

The electrophile at the centre of Friedel-Crafts acylation is the acylium ion, [RCO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Its carbon atom carries a large partial positive charge and is highly electrophilic, allowing it to react with very unreactive arenes such as benzene.  Bonding in the acylium ion is best described as a resonance hybrid of two canonical forms:

[[Image:Acylium-resonance.png|200px]] [[Image:Acylium-hybrid.png|50px]]

[[Image:Friedel-Crafts-acylation-mechanism.png|400px]]

== Nitration ==

=== Overview ===
Arenes react with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a highly electrophilic linear cation called the '''nitronium ion'''.  As a result, a nitro group, RNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, replaces a hydrogen atom on the arene's benzene ring.

[[Image:Benzene-nitration-overview.png|400px]]

Because NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is highly reactive, it is not readily available as a salt.  It must be generated ''in situ'' (in the reaction vessel) by the reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid with concentrated nitric acid, which together are called a '''nitrating mixture'''.

:HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

For every mole of benzene nitrated, one mole of nitric acid is consumed, so nitric acid is a reactant.  By contrast, sulfuric acid is regenerated once nitration has occurred, making it a catalyst.

[[Image:TNT-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[w:ball-and-stick model|ball-and-stick model]] of [[w:trinitrotoluene|TNT]], an arene bearing nitro groups]]

In order to limit the number of nitro groups added, the temperature must be kept below 55 °C.  Above this temperature, dinitro and trinitro compounds are formed, which are often dangerously unstable and prone to explosion. An example is TNT (''trinitrotoluene'', a trivial name for 2,4,6-trinitromethylbenzene).

=== Mechanism ===
[[Image:Benzene-nitration-mechanism.png|400px]]

=== Reduction of nitroarenes to arylamines ===
Tin in concentrated hydrochloric acid is an effective catalyst for the reduction of a nitroarene to an arylamine.

[[Image:Nitrobenzene-reduction.png|300px]]

== Sulfonation ==
[[Image:Benzenesulfonic-acid-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[w:ball-and-stick model|ball-and-stick model]] of [[w:sulfonic acid|benzenesulfonic acid]], the product of the sulfonation of benzene]]

=== Overview ===
[[Image:Benzene-sulfonation-overview.png|400px]]

=== Mechanism ===
Concentrated sulfuric acid contains some sulfur trioxide, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is thought to be the electrophile involved in the sulfonation of arenes.  SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a large positive partial charge on its central sulfur atom, which is electrophilic enough to attract delocalised electrons from a benzene ring.

[[Image:Benzene-sulfonation-mechanism.png|400px]]

== Hydrogenation ==
Benzene is very difficult to hydrogenate because doing so dispenses with the stable aromatic system of delocalised electrons.  To hydrogenate benzene requires a highly active catalyst and conditions of high temperature and pressure.

[[Image:Benzene-hydrogenation-overview.png|400px]]

The catalyst is based on very finely divided nickel and is called [[w:Raney nickel|Raney nickel]]. The conditions used in industry are a pressure of 30 atm and a temperature of 300 °C.  Three moles of dihydrogen, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are required to hydrogenate one mole of benzene.

== Summary ==
With the exception of hydrogenation, the reactions of arenes presented here are all '''electrophilic substitution''' reactions.  Arenes, especially benzene, have an exceptionally '''stable and unreactive aromatic system of delocalised electrons'''.  Consequently, arenes only react with the most reactive of '''electrophiles''' and special catalysts are required to generate the highly electrophilic species required, such as Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
[[Image:Bromobenzene-arenium-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[w:Arenium ion|Current evidence]] suggests electrophilic aromatic substitution proceeds via a high-energy, unstable tetrahedral carbocation intermediate]]

[[Image:Electrophilic-aromatic-substitution-general.png|400px]]

Once a suitably electrophilic species, E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, has been generated, it will react rapidly with benzene.  A highly unstable intermediate (containing a tetrahedral carbon) is formed, which significantly disrupts the delocalisation of electrons in the ring.  The intermediate immediately releases a proton in order to regain a fully aromatic ring and hence decrease its energy considerably.

[[Image:EAS-general-mechanism.png|600px]]

A more detailed look at the mechanism shows that a hydrogen atom from benzene is replaced by the electrophile.

&lt;b&gt;GallStones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


== Introduction: ==

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approximately 10% of the population have gallstones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The majority of the gallstones are asymptomatic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only approximately 30% of sufferers have surgery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Types ==
&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol stones (Approximately 6%, less common).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mixed stones (Approximately 90%, common).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pigment stones (Uncommon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Incidence of gallstones: ==
&lt;p&gt;Classically: Fat, fertile flatulent female of&amp;nbsp; fifty (forty).&lt;/p&gt;

== Commonest Causal Factors: ==

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cholesterol stones&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Approximately 75% of all gall stones are Cholesterol stones&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Excess of cholesterol relative to bile salts and phospholipids allowing 
    cholesterol crystals to form. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Infection can cause cholesterol gallstone.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oestrogens reduces gallbladder contraction and increases chances to 
        gallstone formation. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multiple pregnancies/contraceptive use.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Obesity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rapid weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Infestation with:&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Clonorchis sinensis, Ascaris Lumbricoides etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pigmented stones&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Approximately 25% of all gall stones are Pigmented Stones.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Black color Pigmented Stones:&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sufferer with Hemolytic disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sufferer with cirrhosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brown color Pigmented stones:&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sufferer are mostly Asian population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bacterial Infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mixed stones&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;mixed of cholesterol and pigmented. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Investigation ==

  &lt;li&gt;USG.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CT.&lt;/li&gt;

== Asymptomatic gallstones disease ==
(Symptomless)
  &lt;li&gt;Approximately 50% gallstone sufferer are Asymptomatic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generally do not require Surgical treatment. (Depending on the 
  indication).&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Relative Indication:&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Large stones ( &amp;gt;2-3 cm ) with high risk of cholecystitis.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;High or increased risk of malignancy (cancer).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sufferer's age above 70.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sufferer with Sugar disease (Diabetes): New evidence suggests that cholecystectomy should be done for the same indications as general population. thaere is no need of prophylactis cholecystectomy in asymptomatic gallstones in diabetics..&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sufferer with Immune diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
*Suggestive of gallstone disease.
**Sufferer with Dyspepsia.
**Vague abdominal discomfort.
***Around Epigastric region.
**Sufferer with increased flatulence.

== Symptomatic Gallstone Disease ==

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pain:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Known as &lt;u&gt;Biliary colic&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Usually Right Upper Quadrant (sided) chest/abdominal pain.&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Usually pain after oily food.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Quick pain which lasts few moments to few hours.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pain with discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pain often radiates (travels) towards&amp;nbsp; right scapula (back).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nausea and Vomiting may also present with pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acute Cholecystitis&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Occurs in approximately 10% of symptomatic gallstone disease.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Treatment of choice:&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open cholecystectomy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Percutaneous transhepatic placement of a cholecystostomy tube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapters first ==
I've thought about that it could be best to have the chapters at the top, above the explanation of what the book is about, because when you view a book, you first look at the 'index' which tells where everything is. Then you find the section that says &quot;about this book&quot;. This would make people who read normal books more familiar with online kind of books. What do you think?

{{Featured book}}
A &quot;zine&quot; is an independent publication, a DIY magazine-like thing. Because you do it yourself it can be pretty much anything you want it to be. This wikibook is not about the style or content of what you do with your zine, since it can contain almost anything you want (that's the joy of zines!), but instead is intended to help you with some of '''the practicalities of how to make a zine''', about putting paper and ink (or whatever) together to make something interesting that you can put out.
[[Image:Zines-fromlondonsymp07.jpg|thumb|322px|Look: some zines]]

This guide aims to be fairly international and not connected to any particular &quot;scene&quot;, so there aren't any addresses or country-specific things (e.g. about the postal system, legal system...). Hopefully you'll find it useful.

{{ZineMakingNav|Saloncino Bandini.jpg}}

To some extent the way you write your pages depends on what you're doing. If it's a zine of your hand-drawn cartoons then your best option is to hand-draw some cartoons. If it's an art zine then the appearance is going to be defined by what you're trying to achieve artistically. And so on. But here are some things to bear in mind:

== General considerations ==

&lt;!-- Note: this book is written in British English, please don't change &quot;colour&quot; to &quot;color&quot; --&gt;

* For most copying purposes, '''colour is much more expensive than black-and-white''' (for photocopying, printing, etc). That's why most zines are in black and white. There are lots of things you can do to add a bit of colour, such as using coloured paper/card for the cover, or including one or two full-colour sheets in your zine (rather than the whole lot; it depends on your production method whether you can do this), or adding some colour after the zines have been produced.
* If you're going to use a photocopier or a computer printer to print the pages, you'll probably find they don't print all the way to the '''edges''' of the paper, so you should probably experiment a little bit and make sure you don't go all the way to the edge on your &quot;master copy&quot;.
* Especially if photocopying, you'll probably find that '''subtleties of lightness and darkness''' won't come out very well. Stark black-and-white will photocopy most clearly.
* If you have access to a scanner, try scanning the master copy to a computer instead of photocopying. Benefits include the ability to see exactly how the printouts will look, and the ability to make adjustments, without having to use paper and ink.

==Materials==

=== Pen/pencil etc ===
[[Image:Pencil.jpg|thumb|right]]
Hand-written / hand-drawn things can be brilliant.

* Remember the point above about being able to copy it - if you photocopy something done with '''pencil''' on paper, often it comes out really '''faint'''. '''Biro (disposable ballpoint pen) can come out faint too.'''  You can fiddle with the photocopier's brightness settings to make it clearer, or if you can scan it into a computer you can make it come out much clearer and have a lot more control over it. Alternatively, just trace over the pencil lines with a dark pen. You might not like the way the lines can look doubled-up, but often the photocopier pretty much loses the pencil lines altogether and the end result looks pretty good.

=== Typewriters ===
[[Image:Smith Premier Typewriter.jpg|thumb|left]]
Typewriters are great and can make good-looking text that's not as boring as printed-out text from a computer, yet more legible than handwriting... but typewriters are becoming rarer and rarer these days so for many people they might not be available. However you can get a typewriter on eBay for pretty cheap, also check garage sales and thrift stores or even ask friends or relatives who have updated to computers.

=== Computers ===
[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right]]
OK, so computers are capable of quite a lot, and we can't possibly cover all of it here. You can type/draw things directly using your computer, you can add photos from your camera/phone/etc, you can scan drawings/writings/etc in.

* If your zine is really quite text-based then an ordinary '''word-processor''' like Microsoft Word or Open Office can be fine.
** If you want to make your zine look pretty and have things laid out interestingly then a word-processor gets a bit limiting and it's difficult to stop things looking a bit samey, so you might find it better to just use a graphics program. Alternatively you can write your text, then print it out and then use cut-and-paste or whatever to organise/decorate the text more interestingly.
** In most word processors you can use the '''columns''' feature to help arrange things. For example, use the page setup to set the pages as landscape, then use the &quot;columns&quot; options to specify that there should be two columns on each page. Hey presto, you now have a layout that can easily be typed and then folded to make the standard ''codex'' (book-like) folded zine.
* If you're going to be scanning and printing a lot, then a good '''graphics program''' is helpful. (The &quot;paint&quot; software that comes with your computer can be a bit frustrating!) Commercial programs like Photoshop and Paintshop Pro are well-known and they're very good. If you can't afford those, or even if you can, you should definitely check out the free and open-source equivalent, which is a piece of software called [[GIMP]] (http://www.gimp.org). Despite the weird name, it's a full-featured and very good piece of software, and you're very likely to be able to do everything you want to do with it. [[Inkscape]] (http://inkscape.org) is also good, especially for vector graphics. [[Scribus]] (http://www.scribus.net) is an open source publishing editor too.
* [[LaTeX]], a piece of Free software used for professional type setting, particularly in the maths and sciences, is another possibility.

=== Cut and paste ===

A lot of zine-making involves cutting and pasting, to compile your images and/or words. People also use it to incorporate things from other sources.

We're not going to consider anything about the legal/moral/political dimensions of making cut-and-paste works out of other people's stuff here. It can look brilliant; but at the same time if you're just taking someone else's work and dropping it into your own zine then you haven't really done anything. 

Practically, remember the thing about contrast if you're going to be making copies. Also remember that if you're cutting-and-pasting from '''glossy''' paper (such as magazines) then it can sometimes photocopy really badly because the gloss on the paper just shines when it gets in the photocopier, and you end up with a bright white thing instead of your desired image (at least partially).

If you've cut and pasted your stuff all together then it can be very helpful to '''photocopy''' it to get a kind of &quot;master copy&quot; that doesn't have bits everywhere.

=== Photos ===

Photos rarely photocopy nicely. Choose ones with lots of contrasts, not too much detail (e.g. a face rather than a crowd of people) and that aren't too dark. If you can, you can probably improve results by scanning a photo, adjusting it (fiddle with the brightness, '''increase the contrast'''), and printing it back out again.

=== Sewing ===

I've seen some really good zines that make use of sewing, cross-stitch, and crafty things like that. If you're going to be photocopying or something like that, then you can still do crafty things like this, as they can often come out quite well when copied (you'll need to have good colour contrasts though). If you're going to hand-make the crafty bits on each copy then of course you have more freedom and can make perhaps more exciting items, but of course you need dedication...

==Using the Fluid Simulator and Yafray to create realistic looking water == 

This tutorial will (hopefully) successfully walk you through creating semi-realistic looking water using the Fluid Simulator in Blender, then rendering in Yafray.

== Getting Started ==

When you first open blender there will be nothing but a blank cube.

# Make sure you are in object mode, and scale the cube up to about 5. Do this by pressing S in the 3d view and holding ctrl, move your mouse until the numbers in the bottom left of the screen are 5. Or select the object and press S then 5.
‎ [[Image:Watertut01.jpg|Where the 5's should appear]]
# Next, in the viewport shading box select wireframe. This lets you see through the cube.
[[Image:Watertut02.jpg|Where the wireframe box is (ignore red and blue thing)]]
# We are now going to enable the cube for Fluid Simulation. With the cube still selected in object mode, press F7 (object button) and then press the &quot;Physics Button&quot;.
[[Image:Watertut03.jpg|Where the fluid sim tab is]]
# You should see a tab labeled &quot;Fluid Simulation&quot; press Enable and then Domain. After pressing Domain several buttons will pop up, these will be used later.
[[Image:Watertut07.jpg|The fluid sim tab]]
# Make sure you are in top view now, if not just press NUMPAD7. Next press space&gt;Add&gt;Mesh&gt;Cylinder. 32 vertices is ok.
# Now middle click and drag in the 3d view to see the cylinder inside your beautiful box. (yay!) What's going to happen is the cylinder is going to be turned into liquid, and the big box is where the liquid can flow about. (it is the &quot;invisible wall&quot;)
# Move the cylinder to a corner of the cube, you can give it some height if you like. Now with the cylinder still selected press Shift-D to duplicate it. Move the new cylinder to the opposite corner.
[[Image:Watertut06.jpg|What you should have now]]
# On both of the cylinders go the fluid sim. tab and press Enable then Fluid. This tells blender that these cylinders are fluid.
# IMPORTANT!!!     After this, you MUST subsurf both of the cylinders, but don't apply it. Instead, when the cylinder shows a preview of the subsurf, click the &quot;X&quot; in the top-right of the subsurf preferences.
(noobie note: I don't know what the above step is for, adding the subsurf then click &quot;X&quot; removed it.)
# Switch to Object Mode then Right click on the big box (the domain) and press the big BAKE button. A little box will pop up and just click on the top option.
# Now you should see a blob looking thing appear in the cylinders, and it will fall to the ground and splash around. Your computer is &quot;baking&quot; the liquid. (Calculating where it should go)
[[Image:Watertut08.jpg|What you should have now]]
# As you see now, the liquid isn't very realistic looking. If you do a render, you will see. You would also see that the cylinders are appearing in the image. This is not wanted, so with both of the cylinders selected, press M then click on one of the little boxes that isn't already pressed. This moves them to another layer.
# Now we are going to move the camera to a different position for a better view. Move the viewport around until it's where you think will give you the best view and press '''SHIFT-NUM0''' to make the camera match your current view.
# Drag the newly placed camera back a bit, so the when NUMPAD0 is pressed most of the scene is in view. You should now have something that looks similar to this:
[[Image:Watertut09.jpg|What you should have now]]
# Now we are going to rebake the water at a higher resolution for a more detailed result. Select the goo looking mesh, (both blobs should turn purple if either is clicked) and go the fluid simulation tab again. Turn the resolution up to about 100 (or whatever you want) this rebakes the fluid for more detail. If you turn preview mesh up too, you will see it more detailed before rendering. Baking now may take a while.
# After its done baking, you are ready to change the material of the water to something better looking.
# First change the renderer to YafRay. Press F10 then under the big Render button select YafRay. Make sure Yafray is installed first, the option still appears if you don't.
# Change the background white by pressing F5 then click on the box that has world buttons appear when the cursor is hovered over it.
# You will see HoR, HoG, and HoB. Turn these all the way over to one. The preview should turn white.
# Now go to the material buttons (red sphere) and make everything look like the following:  (I think I circled all the changed options, but maybe not.) 
[[Image:Watertut10.jpg|What your material should look like]]
# After this is completed look through the frames by pressing right arrow, find one that looks cool then press render and you may get something like this:
[[Image:0100.jpg|Does it look like yours?]]

Hopefully you got something like that :) &lt;br&gt;
(that's all folks...)

If the render does not look smooth, apply a subsurf.

'''User Question:''' When I click Bake there is no box that shows up, I cannot get it to bake my fluids at all, all it does is add a
bunch of files to my hard drive and take a long time, What should I do?

'''Answer:''' Be sure to set the directory that you would like the files to be saved to, the option to do so is in the area where you changed the box to a domain very bottom there is a folder. Chose a directory and all will be good.

'''User question:''' When i click the bake button it says there can't be more than one domain object. I did everything you said to do but i don't understand why it says that.

'''Answer:''' The only solution I have found around that is to go to the top header and where it says &quot;SR:2-Model&quot; change that to actor and select the different objects until you find something that doesn't highlight.  Delete those.  I found that occasionally a domain &quot;disappears&quot; and when you make a new one causes this problem.  I have also found it better to set up the domain last around your scene to prevent this annoyance as well.

'''Note:'''  The domain object does NOT disappear - the Domain object IS the object on your screen which represents the fluid itself.

==Hand-making==

Hand-making is a good option if you're making very few indeed, or if it's based on crafty stuff, or a series of one-off things. Otherwise, remember that you've got every right to combine hand-making techniques with other techniques, such as photocopying the whole zine then sewing a front cover (or whatever).

==Photocopiers==
[[Image:Canon ir2270.jpg|thumb|left]]
Photocopiers are a big thing in zine-making, whether it's subtle use of the photocopier at work (or so I've heard) or the photocopier in the library. Some photocopiers will even do your stapling for you, which is very kind.

Many photocopiers do not copy all the way to the edge of the page, and some have quirks about the way they photocopy different shades/colours, so it's a good idea to try a print-run out once or twice and see if you can get it looking good, before you dial in &quot;500&quot; and press Go. It's a good idea to get used to a specific photocopier's quirks and then stick with that one, to avoid giving yourself a new set of headaches.

==Computer printers==

If you have a computer and a printer at home then it can be easy to print things out yourself, especially if you're not doing many. But after a while it gets:

# '''Expensive.''' Printer ink is really quite expensive, and (especially if you have any pages with large amounts of black on them) you'll be using up printer ink faster than you can possibly imagine...
# '''Frustrating.''' This is particularly true if you're doing double-sided things but your printer doesn't do double-sided, because you need to do a lot of sitting there feeding printed sheets back into the printer in the correct order/orientation/etc, and it can go wrong quite a lot too. It can also go a bit wrong because the printed sheets might be a bit damp or crinkly, so the printer goes a bit wrong in feeding the paper back in. Then there's also the stuff about getting it all to print out so all the folds line up nicely.

Anyway. If you are using your own printer then here are some tips:

* Remember to make sure it'll fit on the page. Most printers don't print right to the edge of the paper, which means that either the edges of what you've designed will be chopped off, or it'll be printed out slightly smaller than maybe you expected. You might find you need to leave an empty border around your work so that nothing gets chopped off.
* Do a bit of experimenting then '''make a template'''. Draw some lines (or try and set appropriate borders) in your software, print them out, fiddle about and repeat until you've got it about right, and save that file. You can use this as a basis for your pages then delete/hide any guiding lines before you print the pages out. This webpage has a couple of examples of templates: http://www.footprinters.co.uk/layout.htm
* A quick rule of thumb: if your zine doesn't fit in the page, resize it (in the print preferences or whatever) to about 97%.

==Getting them printed==

[[Image:Xerox_stand_in_Mumbai.jpg|thumb|right|You can get your zine printed for you at businesses all over the world]]

If you're strongly into DIY or anarchist things you might not want to use a company to print the things for you, and that's fine. But if not:

If you're getting to the point where you're making a lot of copies (more than a few dozen) then it's probably cheaper and easier to get the zines printed on your behalf, and will get you more uniform results. Of course there are various limitations with this: the printing companies are not likely to be willing to print every fourth page using tracing paper, for example. But you could easily get a printing company to make the zines and then do some &quot;post-processing&quot; on the zines to add your preferred cross-stitch/hole-punch/felt-tip customizations, which is quite a nice way of combining interestingness with painless production.

Printing companies typically vary '''a lot''' when it comes to pricing, so make sure you ask around for different prices. They can also vary in '''helpfulness''', and this can be quite important. Does the company look small and friendly? A small friendly company may be more inclined to spend time talking to you and making sure they get it right. Double points if the website gives the name, photo and direct phone number of the person who gives quotes.

Check: are they happy to do small print runs? Check that &quot;small print run&quot; means 50 rather than 50,000.

You don't particularly need to pick a nearby printers, because delivery is often included or inexpensive.

=== What info to tell the print shop ===

* What the finished zine will look like (e.g. 12-page A6 booklet)
* How many copies you want printed
* What weight of paper you want (e.g. 80gsm is normal printer paper, 120gsm is thick paper... ask them for advice if you're not sure)
* The color and shininess of the paper (e.g. white, glossy)
* What colors of ink you need (e.g. black, black and red, or full colour)
* If you want it delivered and how soon you need it done
* How you'll provide the original copy - either electronically (PDF, Word, jpg, by CD, email, etc) or 'camera ready' (on paper)

{{ZineMakingNav|Burgess-lark-cover-2.jpg}}

Most people who make zines aren't doing it as a profit-making enterprise, and if you are hoping to make a living from your zine then you're probably wrong. Most people who sell their zines put them at a price which kind of approximately covers the costs of making/distributing them, so that the zine-making process doesn't bankrupt them. A lot of smaller zines (e.g. ones made from a single page of A4) are given away. It's much less hassle not having to collect money etc. And a lot of zines are swapped for other zines rather than bought. It's up to you what you do, but don't expect to see some kind of profit margin on your zine; that's usually not how it works.

== Record shops / book shops ==

[[Image:Elliott Bay Books - author reading 01A.jpg|left|thumb]]

Lots of independent record shops / book shops are happy to carry zines. Some of them have stands for them and have a sale-or-return procedure in place to let you sell them. But even if they don't, you can often ask your friendly independent record/book-shop person if they wouldn't mind having them on the counter or wherever.

Sale-or-return is the typical agreement that shops do: they'll collect the money on your behalf, and you can come back in a month (or whatever) and collect your money (hopefully) or your unsold zines. Some shops have a time-limit, for example if you don't collect them within 6 months they assume you've forgotten about them and get rid of them. Some shops take a cut of the profit, and some don't.

== Distros ==

People who like zines and who really enjoy photocopying often set themselves up to distribute other people's zines - these are often called &quot;distro&quot;s. There are some large and well-established distros and millions of tiny one-person distros, but typically it's just a case of if they like it, they'll be happy to carry it for you. If you find distros which have stuff you like, or your stuff fits in with them, just ask...

Remember that it's typically all done for the love of it so it's not quite the same as approaching some publishing company. You don't need to be particularly formal, just send them a zine and/or have a conversation with them.

== Zine fairs ==

People who like zines and who really enjoy [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/like_herding_cats herding cats] often set up a &quot;zine fair&quot; or &quot;zine symposium&quot; or some such, in their area or for their particular scene. Have a look around to see if there's anything suitable.

== Carrying zines around ==

If you've got a nice load of zines freshly made and you want to take them to gigs, fairs, etc, you probably want to keep them looking nice, so it's a good idea to find a sturdy box to carry them around in. If you've only got a few then anything will do, but if you get to the point of having a lot to carry around then finding an old suitcase, camera-case, or some such case with a handle or strap can be really helpful.

== Different ways to fold a sheet of paper ==

These are just suggestions of course but they cover some of the main ways people fold sheets into ziney shapes. We'll start off by showing how to fold a single sheet to make multiple pages, but most people need more pages than that so they use multiple sheets of paper...

=== Folio (folding in half) ===

[[Image:Zinemaking-folding-folio1.png|left]] 
[[Image:Zinemaking-folding-folio4.png|right]]
This is easy to do, and if you're using a word-processor it's quite straightforward to get the software to do two columns and print out very appropriately.

The page numbering in the diagram to the left is for a one-sheet zine. You'll probably want more than four sides to write on so you'll probably need to attach multiple sheets together.

Note that the order of pages is not what your word-processor or your brain is likely to expect, especially if you haven't done this before. It can get even more confusing when you put multiple pages together. The example to the right shows how to fold 4 separate sheets folio-style, to produce a 16-page zine:
{{-}}

=== Quarto (folding in quarter) ===

[[Image:Zinemaking-folding-quarto.png|left]]

Note that some of the pages are upside-down relative to each other, so you probably can't do this very straightforwardly on a word-processor. But you like cut-and-pasting, yes?

If you want this to become a booklet-style paged thing (a &quot;codex&quot;) you'll need to make a couple of cuts after you've attached the pages together.
{{-}}
=== Folding into six ===

[[Image:Zinemaking-folding-sixo.png|right]]

One nice thing about folding into six is that with standard paper sizes like A4, you get a roughly square zine at the end of it, which is quite nice.

First fold the sheet into a Z-like shape (i.e. fold it 1/3 and 2/3 of the way along, in a zigzag). Then fold it once the other way. This gives 12 approximately square sides.

[[Image:Howtofold.png|center]]

== Cutting the pages ==

If you're making a big batch of zines then you're probably going to be doing a lot of cutting, either to separate the pages or to trim things or whatever. It can get a bit tedious and slow to do it all with scissors, but if you go to a largeish stationer's you can buy a cheap '''guillotine''' which will make things easier.


== Different ways to compile multiple sheets into a zine ==

=== Not attaching pages together ===

I've seen a lot of multi-page zines where the pages are not attached to each other, and generally that can work OK. It's certainly easier, but of course the zine is in danger of falling apart. It's up to you, of course.

=== Stapling ===

[[Image:Stapler-swingline-red.jpg|right|thumb]]

Stapling it yourself is easy to do and nice and cheap. You might find that a normal stapler only-just-doesn't-quite-reach to the middle of your page... argh!

If you go to a largeish stationery shop you can easily find a '''long-arm stapler''' which can make life a lot easier. A library or university nearby might also have one you can use if you ask (try bringing your own staples). Or if you don't have the money you can use a normal stapler folded out flat to push the staples though the paper into a soft surface, like carpet or dense foam. Once you have done that you can then fold the staple down with something flat like a ruler or blunt knife - a sharp knife can mark or cut the pages by accident, or you!

[[Image:SaddleStapler.jpg|center|300px]]

If you're doing really big fat zines (more than about 20 pages to attach together, at a guess) then sometimes you can knacker (create technical problems) the stapler by trying to do too much. You can buy heavy-duty staplers if you want to do lots of really big fat zines.

One nice thing about some fancy photocopiers is that they can do '''automatic stapling''', so if you have access to one of those then this can be a nice easy option. You might have to pay more for this of course.

=== Stitching/binding ===

You can make holes (often 3 or 5 holes is good) down the spine of the page and use ordinary needle and thread to bind the pages together. For example, if you make three holes, you would create a kind of tight figure-of-eight loop through the holes. This can bind things very nicely.

This is the basis of making a nicely-bound '''book''', so it's useful to know how to do this if you want to self-publish your epic novel. There's at least one reference on DIY book-binding in the [[Zine making/Other resources|other resources]] section of this book.

=== String ===

You can use a hole-punch to make one, or two, holes through the pages, and then tie a loop of string through to connect the pages. Don't make the loop too tight or no-one will be able to turn the pages properly.

== Single-page options ==

If you're printing onto a single page you can use clever folding and/or cutting to make a nice zine layout without needing to bind things.

=== Almost-cutting-through ===

If you take a piece of paper and fold it in half, then fold it in half again, you have 8 sides. You'd need to make a cut (along the line of the first fold) to make them into a booklet-like codex, but this gives you two separate pieces. One nice trick you can manage is to not make the cut all the way through - leave a small amount of un-cut paper in the middle, and this lets people turn the pages without completely separating the pieces.

=== No cutting, just folding ===

This doesn't give a booklet-like result (more of a thing to be folded out) unless you do some cutting. But it's easy to do and who knows, maybe it suits your purposes.


=== An 8-sided zine from 1 sheet with 1 cut ===

I've seen quite a few zines made using this trick. It's a really neat way of making a proper little zine out of one sheet - all 8 sides are on one side of your piece of paper, which is convenient for photocopying etc, although you can also put stuff on the reverse side for people to see when they unfold your zine. Here are the steps:

{|
| Design your zine all on one sheet, with the pages in this order (and the same way up as the numbers shown):
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-plan.png]]
|-
| Then crease the sheet along the two main directions (by folding it in half then opening it, once for each direction):
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-1.png]]
|-
| Now make another pair of creases, with the effect of dividing the long direction into quarters:
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-2.png]]
|-
| Then unfold again, fold in half, and make a cut with scissors as shown - you should be cutting through two thicknesses of paper, but only as far as those quarter-folds you just made:
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-3.png]]
|-
| Open it out again. The resulting page should have a cut in its centre, a bit like this:
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-4.png]]
|-
| Fold it in half along the long direction, such that all your pages are still on the outside:
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-5.png]]
|-
| Now push it inwards from each end, so that the inner bit pushes out in both directions to make a kind of cross-shape. Fold the resulting pages together so that your front page is outmost:
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-6.png]]
|-
| And there you have it, a little zine of 8 pages that needs no stapling or gluing:
| [[Image:Zinemaking-folding-8cut-7.png]]
|}

(Stones in the common bile duct)

== &lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; ==

*In 10% of cases stones are found in the common bile duct.
*Stones may form within the bile ducts.
**Known as &lt;u&gt;primary Bile ducts stones&lt;/u&gt;.
*In majority of cases stones migrate from gall bladder.
**Known as &lt;u&gt;secondary bile duct stones&lt;/u&gt;.

== &lt;b&gt; Clinical Features:&lt;/b&gt; ==

*Symptomatic.
**Rerely asymptomatic.
***e.g. Vague indigestion.
*Pain:
**Biliary Colic.
*Jaundice:
*Fever:
**Chills and fever are usually asociated with pain abdomen.

*Other symptoms:
**clay color stool.
**Dark urine.
**Symptoms associated with Pancreatitis.


== Charcot's Triad: ==
&lt;u&gt;Clasically seen in common-bile-duct-stone&lt;/u&gt;.

&lt;u&gt;Fluctuating Jaundice&lt;/u&gt; + &lt;u&gt;Pain RUQ&lt;/u&gt; + &lt;u&gt;Fever&lt;/u&gt; (&lt;u&gt;with rigors&lt;/u&gt;)

== Examination: ==

O/E:
*Icterus (+).
*Febrile.
P/A:
*RUQ tenderness.
*&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/u&gt;! Gall bladder not palpable.
**&quot;Courvoisier's Law&quot;.

== &lt;b&gt;Investigations:&lt;/b&gt; ==
*Blood:
**WBC: Normol. (Elevated when Cholangitis.)
**Alkaline Phosthotase: Very high in Obstructive jaundice.
**Serum billirubin: High.
**Serum Alylase: High when associated pancreatitis.

== &lt;b&gt;Radiological investigations:&lt;/b&gt; ==
*USG-Abdomen:
**Ultra sound Should be done:
***To know CBD size. (Normol ~8mm)
**To detect common duct stones.

*PTC:
**ERCP is prefered.

*ERCP:
**Indication:
***Sufferer with jaundice.
**Advantages:
***Shincterotomy.
***Papillotomy.
***stone removal.

== Complication: ==

*Suppurative Cholangitis:
**Dangerous condition which will give liver failure and death if not timely *surgical intervention and antibitic therapy.
*Impairment of Liver function:
**White Bile/Surgical Bile:
***Seen when liver function is seriously depressed.
*Hydro-Hepatis:
**Rare condition.
*Stone may ulcerate:
**Through the common bile duct to cause biliary peritonitis.
*Natural cure:
**Rarely stone may ulcerate through the bile duct into the duodenumto cause natural  cure.
*Acute Panrcreatitis.


==&lt;b&gt; PreOperation Treatment:&lt;/b&gt; ==
**AntiBiotic:
***Broad Spectrum.
**Analgesics.
**AntiCholinergic:
***Relaxant of Shincter of Oddi.
**Vitamin K.
**Glucose Drink.
**High Carbohydrate with Low fat Diet.
**Blood Transfusion:
***To be used during Operation.
**Mannitol.

==&lt;b&gt; Surgery:&lt;/b&gt; ==

*Operated when Jaundice is not present.

&lt;b&gt;Operation of Choice: &lt;/b&gt;

*Cholecystectomy.
*Choledochotomy:
**Supra-duodenal Choledochotomy.
**Retro-duodenal Cholodochotomy.
**Trans-duodenal Choledochotomy.

== &lt;b&gt;PostOperative Treatment:&lt;/b&gt; ==

*T-tube/drainage:
**Regular Bile examination:
***Color and quantity.
**If bile was White Bile, it's color should be normol within 2 days.
**The quantity of drainage Bile should decrease.
*Tube-Out after 7 to 10 days if:
**T-Tube Cholangiography/PostOP. Cholangiography:
***Should be performed bfore the T-tube removal.
**When Tube is clamped and if no pain around gallbaldder.
**There is no obstruction in the bile duct.
*Small silk suture at the edge of the wound and T-Tube pulled out.


*Color Of faeces:
**Pale or White:
***When there is obstruction.
**Normol yellow hue:
***When there is no obstruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Charybdis)Hey guys, i decided to write this tutorial for wikibooks. i hope you like it, its my first ever so it probably has some mistakes...
It just seemed like i couldent find a good tutorial on this, so i made one myself. Perhaps i will try to write another later.

: I am quite new to Blender and I have just done a few tutorials. I like them all but this one made me extra happy as the result looked so cool and it was easy to follow. Thanks! [[User:217.116.235.64|217.116.235.64]] 19:40, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

(Charybdis) thank you, I am glad to see my time was not wasted :)

Wenever I enable Domain FS for the Box, after I do that two cylider-like things appear, which of course, is the water. But they are uneven, so wen they bake, then fluid hits the floor at diff times.

sounds like your cylinders got off the same z axis. --[[User:Charybdis|Charybdis]] ([[User talk:Charybdis|talk]]) 03:25, 27 September 2008 (UTC)

(djmorrsee) i love this, i think the results are awesome. except the fact that it takes 7 hours to render the complete animation on my machine. but oh well

i was wondering if theres a way to make the fluid bounce around in a shape other than a cube?

when I render under YafRay the rendering window shows nothing. Also, under normal render, the fluid doesn't show up! Help!!![[Special:Contributions/74.185.212.232|74.185.212.232]] ([[User talk:74.185.212.232|talk]]) 22:22, 12 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cypress application notes are a good start, but they often do not have all the information required, have bugs, are out of date for more recent microcontrollers or are otherwise inadequate.  This is meant to be a fix to //add to// the existing documentation, not a wholesale copy-and-paste of the existing application notes.

== ADC ==

Q:
These PSoC chips can be set up to do 14 bit ADCs and 9 bit DACs.
But what is the (maximum) sampling frequency at 14 bits and 2 analog inputs?
What is the maximum sampling frequency if I'm happy with only 12 or 8 bits of resolution?

If I feed the signal to the on-chip PGA, crank its gain all the way up, and feed the PGA output to a ADC ... will I get 10 real bits of signal data, or am I getting nothing but noise?

A:
See [http://www.cypress.com/design/AN2239 Analog - ADC Selection - AN2239] by Dennis Seguine.
It discusses the trade off between sampling rate and resolution.
It specifically mentions
&quot;DELSIG8 ... output rate of 31 ksps ... (when) column clock equal to 2.0 MHz&quot;
and
&quot;DELSIG11 ... output rate of 7.8 ksps ... (when) column clock equal to 2.0 MHz&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One theory is that the moon came from the Earth. It is theorized that a Mars sized object struck the earth tossing huge amount of the mantle up into space. While much of this fell back to earth some of the matter collected together and formed the moon. This theory is supported by evidence that the Moon has the same composition of Earth's mantle and the same three isotopes of oxygen that Earth has.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''photosphere''' is the layer that we see when we look directly (foolishly) at the Sun. It is the ''sphere of light''. It sometimes is referred to as the Sun's surface, but in fact the Sun has no solid surface such as that of the Earth. The photosphere merely represents the outer boundary of the region in which most solar energy has been converted into visible light.

Beneath the photosphere is the '''convective zone''', a region in which huge columns of hot plasma rise and fall much like water boiling in a pot. On close inspection with properly filtered instruments, the photosphere appears as a great cauldron with the tops of these convective currents bubbling up in a seething sea. In certain wavelengths of light, the many convective columns give the Sun a slightly grainy appearance, sometimes referred to as granules or &quot;rice grains,&quot; for its similarity to rice boiling in a pot.

Much cooler than the core of the Sun, the photosphere has a temperature of about 10,500 degrees F, or about 5800 K.

Immediately above the photosphere is a relatively thin layer called the '''chromosphere''' (''sphere of color'') and beyond that a large and very rarified outer atmosphere called the '''corona''' (''crown''). The photosphere is so vastly brighter than these two regions that they cannot be seen except with special instrumentation or during a total solar eclipse when the photosphere itself is blocked out.

The '''Common Stalk Borer''', ''Papaipema nebris'', is a pest of a very wide range of host plants. 

== Description ==
Caterpillars are brown with a white dorsal stripe, primarily living inside the stalks or twigs of host plants, but migrating between hosts as they grow. Adults are gray moths.

== Symptoms and Signs ==
Tunnelling of stalks and twigs.

== Ecology ==
Overwintering as pupae in weedy areas. More problematic in no-till systems, since plowing under provides good control.

'''''Berberis thunbergii''''' ('''Japanese barberry''' or '''Thunberg's Barberry''') is a species of ''[[../Berberis/]]'', native to Japan and eastern Asia. It is widely grown as an ornamental plant, both in Japan and elsewhere in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Numerous cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for yellow, dark red to violet, or variegated foliage, erect growth, and dwarf size.

==Description==
It is a densely branched, deciduous, spiny, suckering shrub which grows 1-2 (3) m high, with a &quot;fountain-like&quot; form when unpruned, though cultivars may be fastigiate to nearly prostrate. It has deeply grooved, brown, spiny branches with a single (occasionally tridentine) spine (actually a highly modified leaf) at each shoot node. The leaves are green to blue-green, very small, spatula to oval shaped, 12-24 mm long and 3-15 mm broad; they are produced in clusters of 2-6 on a dwarf shoot in the axil of each spine. The flowers are pale yellow, 5-8 mm diameter, produced in drooping 1-1.5 cm long umbrella-shaped clusters of 2–5; flowering is from mid spring to early summer. The fruit is a glossy bright red to orange-red, ovoid berry 7-10 mm long and 4-7 mm broad, containing a single seed. They mature during late summer and fall and persist through the winter.

It is sometimes confused with ''Berberis canadensis'' (American Barberry), ''Berberis vulgaris'' (European Barberry), and other deciduous ''Berberis'' species; it is most readily distinguished by the flowers being produced in umbels, not racemes.

==Growing Conditions==
Well-drained soils in full sun to shade.

==Ecology==
In recent years it has become an invasive species in parts of the eastern United States; in Canada its cultivation is prohibited as the species can act as a host for ''[[../Puccinia graminis/]]'' (black rust), a rust disease of wheat. Currently there are breeding and selection programs aimed at producing cultivars that are either sterile or produce relatively little seed.

==Varieties==
*‘Argenteo-marginata’: Young foliage with white margins.
*forma ''Atropurpurea'': foliage purple or red.
*‘Atropurpurea-nana’: Foliage purplish red, semidwarf to 60 cm, dense habit, slow growing.
*‘Aurea’ Foliage bright yellow when emerging in spring, fading to yellowish green.
*‘Bagatelle’: Foliage reddish purple, dwarf to 30 cm.
*‘Crimson Pygmy’: see ‘Atropurpurea-nana’, above.
*‘Dart’s Red Lady’: Foliage dark purple, fall color red.
*‘Erecta’: Truehedge Barberry: Upright form, but not tight with age.
*‘Golden Ring’: Foliage purple with yellow margins. Fall color red.
*‘Green Ornament’: Foliage purple, upright form, heavy fruit set.
*‘Helmond Pillar’: Foliage dark red to purple, fastigiate.
*‘Kobold’: Dwarf to 40 cm, dense, heavy fruit set.
*‘Little Favorite’: see ‘Atropurpurea-nana’, above.
*‘Maximowiczii’: Leaves narrow, green beneath.
*‘Minor’: semidwarf, to 60 cm.
*‘Pink Queen’: Foliage reddish purple, variegated with pink.
*‘Pluriflora’: Corymbs dense, with 5-12 flowers.
*‘Red pillar’: Foliage purple, erect form.
*‘Rose Glow’: Foliage purple, but emerging leaves variegated with pink.
*‘Silver Glow’: Foliaged with mottled white variegation. Semidwarf to 60 cm.
*‘Sparkle’: Dense habit, heavy fruit set.

==Uses==
As specimens, hedges, or barrier plants. The flowers are an excellent nectar source.

==Maintenance==
Pruning is a rather hazardous undertaking. Fine-pruning is best done in winter, shearing better in spring when clippings can fall into the plant. Branches are somewhat fragile, so care should be taken when raking off clippings.

Readily transplants, but again transplanting is difficult due to the spines.

==Propagation==
Self-seeds readily. Cultivars propagated by cuttings.

==Pests and Diseases==
See ''[[../Berberis/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases.

==Creating and dropping tables==
===Create Table===
Tables are created by issuing the &lt;code&gt;Create Table&lt;/code&gt; statement. The statement must specify the table name, and any columns in the table.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table T (
    a integer,
    b char(10)
)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Drop Table===
Tables are dropped by issuing the &lt;code&gt;Drop Table&lt;/code&gt; statement. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Drop Table T
&lt;/source&gt;

===Alter Table===
Tables can be altered by issuing one or more &lt;code&gt;Alter Table&lt;/code&gt; statements. New columns can be added, existing columns can be dropped, and existing columns can be altered 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Alter Table T Add Column c float
go
Alter Table T Drop Column c
go
Alter Table T Alter Column b varchar(20)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

==Constraints==
{{info|See [[../Data integrity|Data integrity]] for information about data integrity constraints available in JET}}

===Primary Keys===
There are several ways to create primary keys in JET SQL. One can use the &lt;code&gt;Primary Key&lt;/code&gt; directive in the &lt;code&gt;Create Table&lt;/code&gt; statement, as shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table P1 (
    i1 int not null,
    c1 varchar(255),
    Primary Key(i1)
)
&lt;/source&gt;

The same table, with the same primary key, can be created using the &lt;code&gt;Constraint&lt;code&gt; directive, either as part of the &lt;code&gt;Create Table&lt;/code&gt; statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table P2 (
    i1 int not null,
    c1 varchar(255),
    Constraint PK_P2 Primary Key(i1)
)
&lt;/source&gt;

or afterwards, in an &lt;code&gt;Alter Table&lt;/code&gt; statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table P3 (
    i1 int not null,
    c1 varchar(255)
)
go
Alter Table P3 Add Constraint PK_P3 Primary Key(i1)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

If the table has only one column in its primary key, the constraint can be added to the column specification:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table P4 (
    i1 int not null Constraint PK_P4 Primary Key,
    c1 varchar(255)
)
&lt;/source&gt;

All but the last example, above, support multiple columns in the primary key, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table P5 (
    i1 int not null,
    c1 varchar(20) not null,
    c2 varchar(255),
    Constraint PK_P5 Primary Key(i1, c1)
)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Unique Constraints===

Unique constraints can be added in the same way, either in the &lt;code&gt;Create Table&lt;/code&gt; statement (shown) or with an &lt;code&gt;Alter Table&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table U1 (
    a int not null, 
    b varchar(20) not null, 
    c varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint U1_pk Primary Key (a),
    Constraint U1_uc Unique (b)
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

===Foreign Key Constraint===

A foreign key constraint can be added to a table in the &lt;code&gt;Create Table&lt;/code&gt; statement, as show below, or via an &lt;code&gt;Alter Table&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table F1 (
    a int not null, 
    b varchar(20) not null,
    c varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint F1_pk Primary Key (a, b)
)
go
Create Table F2 (
    i int not null,
    a int not null,
    b varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint F2_pk Primary Key (i),
    Constraint F2_fk1 Foreign Key (a, b) References F1 (a, b)
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

JET 4.0 introduced cascading updates and deletes to foreign keys. When a foreign key is created with &lt;code&gt;Update Cascade&lt;/code&gt;, the foreign keys are updated if the referenced columns are changed. &lt;code&gt;Delete Cascade&lt;/code&gt; causes the referencing rows to be deleted if the referenced row is deleted, and &lt;code&gt;Delete Set Null&lt;/code&gt; sets the foreign keys to Null if the referenced row is deleted.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table F5 (
    i int not null,
    a int not null,
    b varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint F5_pk Primary Key (i),
    Constraint F5_fk1 Foreign Key (a, b) References F3 (a, b)
        On Update Cascade On Delete Set Null
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

===Check Constraints===

Check constraints can be added in much the same way. Note that even though a check constraint may pertain to only one specific column, the constraint is declared at the table level, not the column level:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table F6 (
    i int not null,
    a char(1) not null,
    b decimal(15,2) not null,
    c decimal(15,2) not null,
    Constraint F6_pk Primary Key (i),
    Constraint F6_chk_a check (a in ('Y','N')),
    Constraint F6_chk_b check (b &gt;= 0 And b &lt;= 1000),
    Constraint F6_chk_c check (c &lt;= (Select Sum(a) From F5))
)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

==Indexing==

Table indexes help to improve the performance of queries made against a table, including implicit queries within other statements such as updates, deletes, and foreign key verification. Table indexes are created by issuing the &lt;code&gt;Create Index&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Indexes can be created with values in each column either ''ascending'' (&lt;code&gt;ASC&lt;/code&gt;) or ''descending'' (&lt;code&gt;DESC&lt;/code&gt;), meaning least-first or greatest-first. If not specified, an index will be created with ascending values in each indexed column. 

The following statements create a table with two indexes. The first index only covers column ''b'', but the second index covers both columns ''c'' and ''d''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table I1 (
    a int not null,
    b varchar(20),
    c varchar(20),
    d varchar(20),
    Constraint I1_pk Primary Key(a)
)
go
Create Index I1_idx1 On Table I1 (b)
go
Create Index I1_idx2 On Table I1 (c ASC, d DESC)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

Table indexes can be dropped by issuing the &lt;code&gt;Drop Index&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Drop Index I1_idx1 On I1
&lt;/source&gt;

===Unique indexes===

Normally, an index will allow duplicate values. Where each row must have a unique value in the indexed column, or a unique combination of values in the set of columns being indexed, the index can be specified as being ''unique''. This has a similar effect to adding a ''unique constraint'' (and is in fact how JET implements a unique constraint). NB: Nulls are not considered values, so if a column in a unique index or unique constraint is allowed to be Null, then multiple rows may have Null in that column.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table UI1 (
    a int not null, 
    b varchar(20) not null, 
    c varchar(20) not null,
    Constraint UI1_pk Primary Key (a)
)
go
Create Unique Index UI1_idx_ui On UI1 (c)
go
&lt;/source&gt;

===With Disallow Null===
Null handling is generally best specified on the table column. However, the &lt;code&gt;Create Index&lt;/code&gt; statement also supports an option to disallow any Null values in the indexed columns. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Index T5_idx1 On T5(c2) With Disallow Null
&lt;/source&gt;

===With Ignore Null===
Rows with Nulls in the indexed columns can also be completely excluded from the index, making the index physically smaller on disc and thus faster to search through.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Index T5_idx2 On T5(c1) With Ignore Null
&lt;/source&gt;

===With Primary===
The primary key columns of a table can be specified by creating an index with the special &lt;code&gt;With Primary&lt;/code&gt; option. 

It is generally better to create the primary key with the &lt;code&gt;Primary Key&lt;/code&gt; constraint directive, unless other options are required when creating the index on the primary key columns. One such example might be when one or more columns in the primary key should be indexed ''descending'' rather than ''ascending'', for performance reasons.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table P6 (
    i1 int not null,
    c1 varchar(20) not null,
    c2 varchar(255)
)
go
Create Index P6_idx_pk On P6(i1 Desc) With Primary
go
&lt;/source&gt;

===Dropping indexes===

Dropping an index when it is no longer required is easy too. Specify the index name, and which table the index is on:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Drop Index T5_idx2 On T5
go
&lt;/source&gt;

==Security==
When multiple database users, and optionally groups, have been added to the database, restrictions on what those users have access to in the database can be made by ''granting'' or ''revoking'' privileges on individual objects.

The following basic table privileges from the ANSI SQL standard are supported by JET (the basic &quot;CRUD&quot; privileges &amp;ndash; '''C'''reate, '''R'''ead, '''U'''pdate, '''D'''elete):

{| class='wikitable'
| Select || select data from the table
|-
| Delete || delete data from the table
|-
| Insert || insert new data into the table
|-
| Update || update existing data in the table
|}

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Grant Select on T1 to SalesGroup
go
Grant Select, Insert, Update on T1 to AccountsGroup
go
Revoke Update on T1 from AccountsGroup
&lt;/source&gt;

In addition, the following table privileges are supported by JET:

{| class='wikitable'
| All Privileges || grants or revokes all privileges in one hit
|-
| Drop || drop the table
|-
| SelectSecurity || view permissions on the table (i.e. other Grants)
|-
| UpdateSecurity || update permissions on the table 
|-
| UpdateIdentity || change the values in auto-increment columns
|-
| SelectSchema || query the design of the table
|-
| Schema || update the design of the table
|-
| UpdateOwner || change the owner of the table
|}

== Unwaranted assumptions ==

'''Defining Consciousness'''

The contributors should be applauded for recognizing that “Everyone has their own view of the nature of consciousness based on their education and background.”. However, concerning the definition of consciousness there are people who do not subscribe to the phenomenological/access difference (eg. Dennett, 1997).

Further unwaranted assumptions are made in the introduction. I quote:

:Phenomenal consciousness is much like the “perceptual space” of psychological and physiological research. It is the many simultaneous events that become the space of experience in general and it is now a legitimate target of scientific research.

What is here (above) taken to be a perceptual space I assume to be equivalent to “phenomenal space” (eg. Dainton, 2007). However, Dainton's concept of phenomenological space builds on neutral monism and his method critical phenomenology, a method that I believe Husserlian phenomenologists would consider akward to use. Some representationalists are likely to have difficulties with accepting this concept as well because of the neutral monism.

It is true that attempts have been made in defining consciousness. But there exists no consensus on any definition. Rather, what many scholars of consciousness would agree upon are some of the characteristics and concepts of consciousness (Farthing, 1992).


'''The purpose of consciousness studies'''&lt;BR&gt;
The purpose of consciousness studies could be stated more explicit, at least in less vague terms. After all, “virtual reality” is a metaphor that is not easily grasped on a first reading. David Chalmers has written a paper that I recommend for paraphrasing: http://consc.net/papers/scicon.html
Of course, it is only one take on the project for consciousness studies and people disagree about whether Neural Correlates of Consciousness (aka NCC) should be studied at all.

::Yes, the book is unashamedly about phenomenal consciousness and deals with Dennett's dissent as a side issue. The book was conceived as a supplementary text for physiologists so the problem here is how to link the philosophy of consciousness into the neurophysiology of consciousness. The most important connection between philosophy and neurophysiology is that both attempt to explain how our singular visual field, the &quot;view&quot;, is derived from two eyes which have lenses rather than pin-holes and different images in each. This is a physical problem that requires a physical theory although the philosophical contributions to the problem are fascinating. The &quot;perceptual space&quot; referred to is the &quot;“perceptual space” of psychological and physiological research&quot; rather than Dainton's version. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:54, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

:::Phenomenal consciousness exists indeed, but even those who believe in phenomenal consciousness may not accept access consciousness and it is hence an issue of waranting the dichotomy (P- and A-consciousness), rather than whether the category (phenomenological consciousness) exists or not. I am sorry for not being clearer on this. I cannot deny that there is subjective experience.
:::I strongly disagree with the idea that the most important connection between philosophy and neurophysiology of consciousness lies in explaining the visual field. Blind people are also conscious - there is something it it is like to be blind. To fully explain stereoscopic vision thru retinotopic mapping and thru the visual pathways in the brain is understandably an exciting topic for a physiologist, but it is not central to the field of consciousness studies, which seeks to understand consciousness thru all possible experiences without restrictions to sensory input. However, I admit that of all the senses, vision has been studied most extensively in neurophysiology and is therefore a good candidate in the search of correlates between consciousness and brain physiology. (Perhaps we're on the same page here.) [[User:Phenomena|Phenomena]] 09:26, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The brood nest is contained in the hive body. The &quot;hive body&quot; is the boxes containing the brood area and main food storage of the colony. The internal dimensions of the hive body and supers are critical to maintain proper bee space.

One option in the brood nest is the HSC fullydrawn smallcell brood frame.  It uses the 4.9mm cell size that restricts drone production and shortens time to capping and emergence.  It is an excellent option for those that are starting packages and do not have drawn comb.  Additionally the small cell is reported to have significant longterm effects on hive health.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Getting Started==

===Basics on the Bass===
The electric bass, otherwise known as the bass guitar (not to be confused with the double bass) is, as the name suggests, an instrument that plays in the bass range. In fact, the electric bass plays so low, that when people write music notation for it, the bass actually plays an octave lower than written!

It typically has the same features as most guitars: a neck, head, body, etc., although some modern versions will do without the head. The bass usually has only four strings, but five, six, seven, eight and even twelve stringed instruments are becoming more common. If you happen to use a five string bass, the string ''closest'' to your head is the added string; you can play anything you would play on an ordinary four string bass if you simply ignore that string, although it would be a good idea to learn how to use that string too, once you've gotten your ground.

===Tuning===
The usual tuning of the bass, starting from the largest string, is E-A-D-G, tuned in fourths, like a double bass. A ''fourth'' is a term from musical theory; on the electric bass, you can find the fourth of any note you start on by going five frets above it. For example, the open E string's fourth would be the A you play at its fifth fret, or, (since the bass is tuned in fourths), the open A you play on the next string down.

This raises a question: Why does the bass guitar let you play the same note in two different places, like the A above? The answer is ease of use - having the same note 'copied' into different positions on the bass guitar lets us play much more without moving our fretting hand as much.
====Alternate tunings====
Like any stringed instrument, there are a variety of tunings for the bass. Perhaps the second most common after the ordinary E-A-D-G tuning is &quot;Drop D&quot; tuning, where the E string is tuned down a whole-step lower, to the D below. This is more common in guitars, especially modern heavy metal guitar, but it is also useful in certain riffs for bass guitar.

===Wearing the bass===
Unlike a double bass, the bass guitar is worn like a guitar with a strap, or, (less commonly), like a guitar sitting down. Sitting down with a bass is uncomfortable for many people, because the instrument is actually a few inches larger than an electric guitar - making it less appropriate for playing sitting down.

===Playing technique===
There are two standard techniques for playing a bass guitar:
* '''Fingerstyle bass''', where one uses the index and middle fingers of their plucking hand to produce a fat, mellow tone; and
* '''Picked bass''', where a heavy guitar pick or a custom-made bass guitar pick is used for a harder attack and a more aggressive sound.
Of course, those sounds are only the typical output; a good bassist will learn to produce different sounds from practice. Those are not the only playing techniques, but merely the easiest and most vital for a beginner bassist to learn.

===Making the bass sound===
Unless the bass guitar is acoustic, the sound of a bass guitar is produced through an amplifier.

====How an amplifier functions, a brief aside====
The basic idea is that there are ''pickups'' located in the body of the bass guitar, which are magnetic. Plucking the metal strings above cause a vibration that generates a certain type of electrical signal because of these magnets; that electrical signal then travels through the input wire to the amplifier and produces a sound (possibly with other effects added before the sound is made).

====Using non-bass amps for bass====
There are amps made specifically for bass guitars but if one is not available a keyboard amplifier will work well.  Using a guitar amp also works fine, but the lower frequency notes lose their tone and the overall sound will not be as distinct. Guitars sound higher than bass guitars, so their amps reflect this difference.

==Scales==

The best way to begin learning bass is to study and practice scales. For example, an open A Major scale is easy to learn and is the foundation for learning many other scales.


Open A Major Scale: Ascending
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
    G:-------------1-2-|
    D:-------0-2-4-----|
    A:-0-2-4-----------|
    E:-----------------|
&lt;/font&gt;


When learning and practicing scales, it is common to work your way up and then down the scale.


Open A Major Scale: Ascending and Descending
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
    G:-------------1-2-|-1----------------|
    D:-------0-2-4-----|---4-2-0----------|
    A:-0-2-4-----------|---------4-2-0----|
    E:-----------------|------------------|
&lt;/font&gt;


Begin slowly and deliberately and increase speed as you become more comfortable with the scale.

Also, as you get more comfortable with the fingering, try transposing the scale up. for example:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
    G:-------------2-3-|-2----------------|
    D:-------1-3-5-----|---5-3-1----------|
    A:-1-3-5-----------|---------5-3-1----|
    E:-----------------|------------------|
&lt;/font&gt;

==Parts of The Bass==

Body: this is the main piece of wood from which the bass is made of 

Neck: the long part over which the strings are stretched

Pickups: Located on the main body under strings. Uses electromagnetic forces to detect sound. In the case of an acoustic bass guitar, this function is performed by the soundboard.

Tuners: Adjusts string tension, allowing the musician to control the pitch

Volume Knob: Controls volume

Tone Knob: Controls the treble

Bridge: Located near the bottom of the bass, this is what holds the strings in place.

==Techniques==

Plucking: The use of fingers to pluck strings to resonate sound.

Picking: The use of a plectrum to pluck strings.

Slap: The use of a variety of different hitting and hard plucking techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Animals are complex organisms that are made up of many complex systems of cells that work together to have homeostasis.
==The Organization of Cells==
===Tissues=== 
Tissues are made up of groups of similar cells that work together in order to perform a common function. Animal tissues can be split up into six types: 1) epithelial tissue, which consists of the outer layers of skin and internal protective coverings, 2) connective tissue; including bone, cartilage, and blood, 3) nervous tissue that makes up the nervous system, and 4) muscle tissue 5)brain tissue,6)the radius of the bone and the tissue of the nails.

===Organs===
Organs are made up of various kinds of tissue that work together to perform a common function. The organs are created by the specialization of stem cells found during the early stages of development. Each of the organs formed serves a specific function or did serve a specific function at some point, but later became a vestigial structure, this makes each organ unique.

===Organ Systems===
An organ system is made up of different organs that work together in order to perform a common function. An example of an organ system is the respiratory system which is made up of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and lungs.
==The Respiratory System== 
The function of the respiratory system is to provide an animal's body with the oxygen required for aerobic respiration. Respiration itself can be defined as basically being the movement of gas in and out of an organism.
==The Circulatory System==
The function of the circulatory system is to distribute the oxygen and nutrients needed by the organism. In humans, the circulatory system consists of the heart, blood, veins, arteries, and capillaries. Also included in the circulatory system is a protein called hemoglobin, which serves a transport vector for carbon dioxide and oxygen. Another component of this system includes the heart, which utilizes corresponding contractions at specific interval.

==The Nervous System==
The function of the nervous system is to respond to both the external and internal stimuli of an organism.
==The Digestive System==
The function of the digestive system is to break down the food particles an animal eats into smaller molecules that provide energy and nutrients for the organism. The digestive system in humans consists of: the mouth, the stomach, the small intestine, the large intestine, the pancreas, and the liver
==The Excretory System==
The excretory system is involved in the re-absorption of water, and the disposal of waste products and other non-useful material.

==The Muscular System==
The muscular system functions in locomotion of the body in response to stimuli and in order to counteract environmental pressures. Some pairs of muscles in the muscular system are made in opposing pairs such as the Biceps and Triceps where one contracts as the other relaxes. Another muscle is smooth muscle such as that found in the stomach, which contains tight junctions, which prevents the highly acidic HCl from damaging other sensitive organs. Finally there is cardiac muscle which is found solely in the heart hence why it is called cardiac tissue. This cardiac tissue contains junctions that allow the interconnection of the cytoplasm between cells and therefore allowing quicker contractile signal transfer.

===Intro===
If you haven't done anything to the default blender startup, starting blender will produce the basic 3D window with a light, a camera, and cube, the buttons window, and the ever-present basic drop down tabs at the top of the screen known as the user preferences window. This is the default setup for modeling, but now that we are starting animation, we are soon going to be looking at a new(ish) set up. You'll see what I mean.

===Setup===

[[Image:ScreenLayout.png|400px|Changing to animation mode]]

Now the first thing we need to do is enter 'animation mode.' To do so, look at the top of the window, the 'user preferences window.' You should see file, add, timeline, game, render and help. What we want is the little drop down menu next to 'help' that you've probably never touched much less noticed. It should read something like: 'SR:2-model' with little buttons on both sides of the text. Click the button on the left side that looks like two little arrows to open a drop down menu. Click on 1-Animation.

===About this setup===
[[image:AnimationSetup.png|400px|The Animation Mode]]

No, Blender didn't just go crazy, but as you can see, there are some changes that need to be explained. Blender has just opened a set of new windows, each with its own functions and commands. You can probably recognize three of them. The 3D view is still there, but it's been resized smaller to fit the new stuff. Our old friend the buttons window is still there at the bottom, and of course the user preferences window is still at the top. But enough of what's the same - you're wondering what the heck all the new stuff is for.


There are now three new windows in all. From top left going clockwise, the first is the Scene window.  This window is used for finding objects and such located throughout your 3D environment. By clicking on any one of the objects listed here, its counterpart in the 3D viewscreen will be selected. You can also select and tinker with your world settings and render layers from this window. The next window is the IPO ('''I'''nter'''PO'''lation) curve window; it is the window that displays data concerning how your objects will actually move, and can begin to look very technical as we progress. Don't worry, it's normal.  The final window is easier to miss. It is essentially a timeline, and is rather thin located between the 3D view/IPO windows and the buttons window. This is the Timeline window. For what we'll be doing for now, it will basically function as a kind of VCR. It is essentially the time codex associated with your animation. Clicking anywhere on the timeline will show you the animation as it is at that point, like fast-forwarding/rewinding then pausing. Like any good VCR the timeline window is equipped with the Play, Stop, Fast-Forward, and Rewind button set.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy (sugar). The chemical reaction is:

&lt;math class=&quot;chem&quot;&gt;light + 12H_2O + 6CO_2 \rightarrow C_6H_12O_6 + 6H_2O + 6O_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It is because of this process that plants are defined as autotrophs;  they make their own food, as opposed to heterotrophs which consume each other and the autotrophs for food.  The photosynthetic process itself has two main parts:  the light-dependent reactions in which the energy of sunlight is used to load energy into the energy transfer molecule common to all life forms: Adenosine Triphosphate or ATP and to load the high energy electron carrier abbreviated NADPH with high energy electrons.  The energy needed to power these steps is collected by chlorophyll molecules found arranged into photosystems in the chloroplasts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Newton's Laws==
Newton is the scientist who founded the physics of motion by stating five fundamental laws of physics.

=== Newton's First Law === 
''Any object at rest or in uniform motion will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless an external force is applied to the object.'' . 

=== Newton's Second Law === 
''To change an object's state a Force must act on the object .''Force is a quantity that acts on object to perform a task '' . For examples a pulling or pushing Force used to move the table . Force used to break a piece of wood

To make an object accelerates, a force must act on the object. This force is found to be proportional to the object's mass and acceleration:
: F = m a

===Newton's Third Law ===
''When a force acts on an object, the object exerts an opposing force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to the force acting on the object.''
: F = - f = - m a

===Newton's Fourth Law ===
''The net force acting on an object at rest or in equilibrium is zero ''.

===Newton's Law of Gravitation===
''The gravitational force of the Earth acts on any object above the earth is directly proportional to the mass of the Earth and the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the Earth and the object.''
: &lt;math&gt;F = G\frac{ mM }{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikipedia:Wall Street Crash|The Stock Market Crash]] ==

{{dynamic navigation|title=Timeline of the Great Depression|body={{:US History/Great Depression and New Deal/Timeline}}}} 

The 1920's were a time of unbelievable prosperity. The stock market was going through the roof and the United States seemed to have the formula for limitless prosperity. However, the same formula that generated all of that profit would also be the cause of Black Tuesday.
Investment during the 1920's was based on the unstable basis of margin buying. Investors bought borrowed money from their brokers, who went to banks for that money. When stocks failed and investors needed to default, the money was permanently lost.

However, adding to the crash of '29 was the slowing economy. The desire for consumer durables (expensive items refrigerators, radios, and automobiles) went down as Americans became satisfied with what they had. This in turn affected the companies and workers that produced these items. A downward spiral was set in motion. 


The US stock market crash occurred in October of 1929. The value of common stock and shares dropped by 40%, resulting in a global depression. 

Payment plans for merchandise were usually only short term payment plans. This was put in place so that consumer debt services could absorb a greater part of the consumers income. This resulted in debt being diminished more quickly and effectively. The only negative effect of this was that it did not allow for excess purchasing capacity, which could have absorbed the surplus production more effectively. 

Furthermore, the general credit structure served to weaken the economy. Farm prices were plummeting, but farmers were already in deep debt, and crop prices were too low to allow them to pay off what they already owed. Banks suffered failure as the farmers defaulted on loans. Some of the nation's largest banks were failing to maintain adequate reserves and making unwise business decisions. Essentially, the banking system was completely unprepared to combat an economic crash.

Credit also related to the stock market. Investors bought shares &quot;on margin&quot; while at the same time taking out a loan to pay for those shares. The investors hoped that by the time the shares were sold, they would make enough money to pay back the loan and interest, and also have some profit remaining for themselves.  The practice of buying on margin led to an extremely unstable stock market. Investors' uncontrolled purchases on margin eventually led to a collapse of the stock market on October 24, 1929, also known as ''Black Thursday''. 

International influences also caused the Great Depression. Nations adopted the practice of ''Protectionism'', under which foreign goods were subject to ''tariffs'', or import duties, so that foreign products would cost more and local products would cost less. The reduced cost of local goods would then boost the local economy at the expense of foreign competitors. The United States enacted extremely high tariffs. However, other nations retaliated against the United States by establishing their own tariffs. Thus, American businesses lost several foreign markets.

International credit structure was another cause of the Depression. At the end of World War I, European nations owed enormous sums of money to American banks. However, these debts were rarely repaid. The smaller American banks were crippled because farmers could not pay debts, while larger banks suffered because other nations could not pay debts.

The problems of overproduction, under-consumption, inability to collect debt, and the stock market crash together had a devastating affect on the economy. The ''Great Depression'', the largest collapse of the economy in modern history, changed the lives of millions of Americans.

== Depression ==
There were several events that inevitably caused the Great Depression; one of those being the overall decline in demand. “At least in part, the Great Depression was caused by underlying weaknesses and imbalances within the U.S. economy that had been obscured by the boom psychology and speculative euphoria of the 1920’s. Around 1928, demand for new housing had faltered and this lead to declining sales of building materials and unemployment among construction workers. The automobile industries and other factories had to reduce production rate, and farm prices were getting worse. Another important factor was under consumption. The amount of people not buying products in order to save money was creating serious repercussions. &lt;ref&gt;Norton, Mary Beth. A People and A Nation. Boston: Wadsworth, Cenage Learning, 2007, 2009.Print. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Modern Economic Poetry. “About The Great Depression.” N.p., n.d. Web. 2/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many jobs were quite scarce but as for the rich and the top forty percent of the nation little has changed with their jobs. Things such as the dust bowl and the stock market crash is what caused the major changes in employment rates. Also a new beginning started for women because for once they were able to find more jobs than the men were and especially African American women found jobs quicker.

All industries suffered a great deal through the depression including the movie industry. However, movie theaters found ways to stay alive. To counter the effects of the depression, they would resort to gimmicks such as lowering the price of a ticket to $0.27, giving away a cash prize for a lucky winner, and giving away prizes such as dinner plates. These gimmicks worked but that was not the only reason why people during that time still attended the movies. They wanted to get away from the troubles in their lives and escape into a world without all of those hardships even for just a couple of hours. Movies were also popular because it was a place where people could go simply to be part of a community of people.

The Great Depression was a severe economic downfall for the United States. By 1932, unemployment had surged to twenty-five percent, while stock prices plummeted by over eighty percent.  It is the longest and most severe depression that Western civilization has ever seen.  Not only did it affect the United States of America, but many other European countries.  The United States loaned a lot of money to European nations during World War 1.  However, a lot of these countries did not have money at the end of World War 1&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/depression/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Banks made the mistake of making many risky loans in the 1920's which then turned bad around 1929 when real-estate and stock markets went bad as well as prices dropping in the agricultural business.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Over eighty-five thousand businesses had declared bankruptcy. Banks could not collect debt from bankrupt businesses and began to close, causing the loss of the savings of millions of Americans.Because banking business was going bad many Americans started pulling their savings from the banks for fear of losing it. Some stared investing it in gold while others just simply kept it under their mattresses. Because many people were losing their money they formed crowds outside of banks to demand that the banks pay them their money that was rightfully theirs. These crowds outside of the banks were known as “Bank runs”.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; This led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to create the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provides a hedge against this sort of loss.What is more important is that the farmers living in the South-central cities of the United States suffered almost all the kind of hardships since the first day the depression came into life. They traveled to the West, especially to California, and hoped to find better opportunities in life. Once the great depression deepens most families were unable to pay rent and were evicted from their homes to stay in Hoovervilles. Over a million men went out desperately to search for any kind of work. Teenage boys and girls left their families to try and take care of themselves. 

Hoovervilles also known as shanty towns, were started in 1930. They were formed from coast to coast in several cities in the U.S. People would build these houses out of anything they could find. For example, lumber, tin, cardboard, tar paper, glass, canvas, and more. It was very crowded and this increased the probability of illnesses. Since they did not have any running water or bathrooms the living conditions were very dirty and unhealthy. Because of these terrible living conditions, there was a lot of illnesses. These houses did not offer much protection, if any, to elements such as rain, storms, and the cold winters.

The steep decline in purchase of manufactured goods resulted in more than 70,000 factories being closed by 1933.  As car sales dropped from 4.5 million in 1929 to 1 million in 1933, Ford laid off more than 2/3 of their Detroit factory workers.   By 1933, almost 1/4 of industrial workers were unemployed, and average wages fell by 1/3. 

During the great depression a man by the name of Benjamin Thompson is said to have invented the soup kitchen. A soup kitchen, also known as a bread line or a meal center, is a place where people would volunteer to hand out free food to hungry and homeless people. For a great number of unemployed Americans, the meals they received from a soup kitchen would be their only meals that day. One particular soup kitchen in Chicago was sponsored by American gangster Al Capone in an attempt to clean up his image to the public and to the police. 

In 1930, a confluence of bad weather and poor agricultural practices known as the ''Dust Bowl'' compounded the Depression's effects on farmers. The dust bowl is a large southern area of the US where during the 30’s, there was a great deal of winds, droughts, and clouds of dust. The number of dust storms known as “black blizzards” began at around 14 storms but rose to nearly 40 storms. This made normal everyday activities such as breathing, eating, and going for walks a very difficult task. Children had to wear dust masks when they walked to and from school. Women would hang sheets and rags over the windows in a futile attempt to keep the dirt and dust out of their houses. Sustained drought and continued planting and harvesting over poor seasons led to the destruction of ground cover that held soil in place, hence ''Dust Bowl''. This, along with other economic factors, reduced farm revenue by 50 percent.  Many farmers were forced to move to the cities in order to survive.

All of this turmoil and chaos caused rising unemployment rates and thousands of people began to look from employment elsewhere. It was at this time when the term migrant labor really came into effect. “Migrant labor is a term applied in the United States to laborers who travel from place to place harvesting crops that must be picked as soon as they ripen.” Migrant labor has existed in other parts of the world, but not to the same extent as it did in the United States during this time. Migrant workers had the option of either being an independent worker or work for a contractor. A contractor is someone who supplies the farmer with workers. There were also two kinds of migrant workers; urban dwellers and permanent migrants. The difference between the two is the simple fact that urban dwellers are seasonal, whereas permanent migrants follow the crops from one place to another in order to make a living. Despite that fact that the individual had the option of being an independent worker or work for a contractor, work came with little reward to the person performing the labor.  For instance, from a report on migrant labor it indicated that “their exclusion from federal and state legislation that protect other workers against exploitation and unfair labor practices is one of the reasons contributing to the low wages paid to farm workers. Many of the federal labor policies, enacted in the 1930’s, were promulgated at a time when the family farm was the predominant production unit and family members provided the labor. While the family farm is no longer the predominant production structure, large corporate controlled farms that employ large numbers of migrant workers currently benefit from these policies at the expense of workers.”The conditions in which these men worked and the jobs they performed weren’t any better compared to the way these men were treated. Migrant labor is one of the most hazardous of all occupational categories; not including mining. In addition, their housing and health conditions were the poorest of all occupational groups. Most migrant workers lived in dirty conditions next to irrigation ditches and did miscellaneous jobs such as bailing, picking, and cultivating and harvesting crops. &lt;ref&gt;Migrant Workers. “Critical Role, Working Conditions, Migrant Stream…” Net Industries. 2011. Web. 3/27/11.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Infoplease.com. “Migrant Labor.” N.p., n.d., Web. 2/20/22&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Report on Migrant Farm Worker Conditions. “Farm Worker Conditions.” N.p., n.d. Web. 3/30/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through these hard times not only did racism increase but also discrimination. Before the great depression women of all class and race were barred from many jobs and were paid a lot less than men. Although the depression was an extremely difficult time for white Americans, it was even worse for other races and especially for African-Americans.  In the south in 1930, one organization called the Black Shirts recruited about 40,000 people but made it known that no African-American would be given a job. He started the slogan &quot;No Jobs for Niggers Until Every White Man Has a Job!&quot; Northern African-Americans suffered about as much as the southern ones.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation-Eighth Edition by Norton, Sheriff, Katzman, Blight, Chudacoff, Logevall, Bailey. Page 718&lt;/ref&gt;  Jobs that white workers had considered “beneath them” before the depression began to seem more desirable.  African-American unemployment was at almost 50% by 1932.  In the Southwest, the claim that Hispanic workers were “stealing jobs” from whites was also prevalent.  The labor department deported 82,000 Mexicans between 1929-1935, and many more (almost half a million people) returned to Mexico, either voluntarily or after being tricked or threatened into believing they had no other choice.  Many of these people had immigrated legally, but lacked the proper documentation to prove it, and officials also ignored the fact that children born in the U.S. were citizens.  Discrimination against women was also prevalent – many believed that women were stealing jobs from men.   The presumption was that men should support their families by working and women should be homemakers.  In a survey conducted in 1930 and 1931, 77% of schools refused to hire married women as teachers, and 63% fired female teachers who married while employed there.

== The New Deal ==

The 1929 stock market crash and subsequent economic collapse left America fearful and feeling helpless. Jobs were gone, farm prices had plunged, businesses had failed, and many banks were shaky. In the '20s, banks had began to loan money to stock-brokers, as the Stock Market had become a hot investment. Banks let brokers use the stocks themselves as collateral. In the 1929 crash the stocks dropped in value, and investors could not repay the banks; the banks were left holding near-worthless collateral. Banks then went broke, pulling productive businesses and farms with them. A panicking bank would call in loans and foreclose mortgages in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. Penniless farmers had had to finance the next year's crop by using their homes as collateral: now they lost them. Families lost not only their source of income but their life savings. Through all this, President Herbert Hoover held to a platform of limited federal intervention. Democratic candidate for president Franklin Roosevelt insisted that the federal government had to play a much greater role. He supported direct relief payments for the unemployed, declaring that such governmental aid was a matter of social duty. He pledged a '''New Deal''' for the American People.  

People were desperate for a leader who would demonstrate some idea of what to do to begin to turn things around. Demonstrations of this desparation ranged from the Bonus Marches through grassroots actions by farmers facing foreclosure to sophisticated agitation by Nazi, Socialist and Communist activists. As Roosevelt remarked to John Nance Garner, his Vice President, as they rode to the inauguration in January 1933 &quot;I had better be a good president or I will be the last one&quot;.

After he took office,in a program called &quot;the Hundred Days&quot; ,Roosevelt immediately began to take steps against  the Great Depression. He had campaigned with a platform offering a [[Media:''New Deal'' to Americans]]. The nation did not have to wait long to see what FDR had in mind. On March 6, two days after taking office as President, he issued an order closing all American banks for four days. Throughout his Presidency he would show himself a master of the use of language. Instead of calling it an &quot;emergency bank closure,&quot; Roosevelt used the euphemism of &quot;bank holiday.&quot; He then summoned Congress for a special session.

When Congress met, Roosevelt suggested the Emergency Banking Bill, which was designed to protect large banks from being dragged down by the failing small banks. This bill authorized the reopening of solvent banks strong enough to survive and reorganize the banks that were not. This banking plan would only work however, if people were confident enough to deposit their money into the banks that were reopened. On his next fireside chat, Roosevelt asked the American people to support this new plan and pledged that if they did it would “restore our financial system”. The next day when the banks opened, people lined up to deposit their money into the banks. On the day after the passage of the Emergency Banking Act, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Economy Bill. The act proposed to balance the federal budget by cutting the salaries of government ''employees and'' reducing pensions to veterans by as much as 15 percent. 

Roosevelt warned that the nation would face a $1 billion deficit if the bill would fail. Like the Emergency Banking Act, it passed through Congress almost instantaneously. 

To protect American farmers, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)in May, 1933. Farm incomes, relative to the rest of the economy, had been falling for years. Most importantly, the AAA attempted to increase farm prices. Under the ''act, producers of seven agricultural products - corn, cotton, dairy'' products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and wheat - would set production limits on themselves. The AAA required the government to then tell individual farmers how much they should plant. The government rewarded farmers who complied by paying them for leaving some of their land unused. The Act was extremely controversial, however. People argued that it was inappropriate for the government to pay farmers to produce ''less'' while many people were forced to starve due to the Depression.

After Roosevelt was elected President, the Emergency Relief Administration -– which Hoover had created in 1932 –- was renamed the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA).  In November of 1933, the Civil Works Administration (CWA) was created under the auspices of FERA.  By 1934, the CWA had hired 4 million construction workers on a temporary basis -- the program only lasted a few months, during the winter of 1933-34.  These workers earned $15 a week, and predominately constructed or repaired buildings and bridges.  Another work relief program, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), began in 1933.  The CCC only hired unemployed, unmarried men between the ages of 18 and 25.  The jobs provided were hard work – building dams and roads, constructing parks and creating trails, planting trees, fighting fires, and other outdoor manual labor.  Their pay was $30 a month (or $1 a day), and $25 of that went to their parents.  Minorities were hired and received equal pay, but the program was segregated.  200,000 African-American workers were hired, and there was a separate Indian division which hired 80,000 Native American workers.  During the 9 years the CCC existed, it employed around 2.5 million men.

Congress and the President created several new government agencies to combat the Great Depression. The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Public Works  Administration provided employment for many Americans; they hired people to work on roads, buildings, and dams.The Civilian Conservation Corps offered to pay $1 a day to unmarried men who would work hard labor. The Civilian Conservation Corps was segregated by race and women were not eligible for the program. Even though the program did not help women it did help provide work for some 2.5 million men from different backgrounds with jobs.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) accomplished similar goals; it sought to build an infrastructure in the Southeast to provide electricity to rural areas.  TVA workers taught farmers ways to improve their crop yields (crop rotation and fertilizer use), replanted forests, controlled forest fires, improved wildlife habitats, and built hydroelectric dams to generate power.  It was given authority to build power lines in new areas and set guidelines for electricity distribution.  TVA hired local unemployed white males for conservation, economic development, and social programs (such as a library service).  TVA recognized the legitimacy of labor unions –- its blue collar employees were unionized, which was a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to unions.  Women were not hired for construction work, although the cheap electricity provided by TVA attracted textile mills which hired women.  It still exists today, and covers most of Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provided insurance for bank deposits. The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, provided for the regulation of the stock market in an attempt to prevent another crash like that in October, 1929.

In June, 1933, Congress addressed the problems of the industrial sector with the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). The NIRA established the National Recovery Administration (NRA), which attempted to stabilize prices and wages though cooperative &quot;code authorities&quot; involving government, business, and labor unions.  The NIRA also established a national public works program, the Public Works Administration (PWA).  The PWA was focused on large-scale public works projects, which were built by private companies who hired workers (it didn’t directly hire the unemployed like the WPA).  Between 1933 and 1939 when the PWA was closed down, road projects (streets and highways) were the most common, but it funded and oversaw the construction of projects as large as airports, hydroelectric dams, Navy warships, bridges.  PWA projects also were responsible for the construction of 70% of new schools and one-third of new hospitals during this time.  Through the PWA, the NIRA lowered unemployment and created infrastructure still in use today.

Section 7(a) of the NIRA ensured collective bargaining rights of workers, effectively allowing them to unionize.  These protections granted to workers led to large-scale union organizing, strikes, and violence on both sides.  On August 5, 1933, the National Labor Board was established in order to handle labor disputes and enforce the protection of collective bargaining rights provided for by the NIRA.  It was abolished on June 29, 1934 and replaced with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The National Labor Relations Act (also known as the Wagner Act, named after the New York senator who proposed it) forced employers to deal with unions elected by their employees in elections overseen by the NLRB, in addition to prohibiting unfair labor practices.  Over 3/4ths of these elections were won by either the American Federation of Labor (AFL) or the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

The NRA adopted a ''blanket code'' under which the businesses would agree to a minimum wage of twenty to forty cents per hour, a workweek of thirty-five to forty hours, and the abolition of child labor. Companies that voluntarily complied with the code were allowed to display the NRA &quot;Blue Eagle&quot;. Blue Eagle flags, posters, and stickers, with the slogan &quot;We Do Our Part,&quot; became common across the country. In addition to blanket codes, codes specific to certain industries were also adopted.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:BlueEagle.jpeg]]&lt;br&gt;''NRA Blue Eagle''&lt;/center&gt;

In an attempt to stimulate economic recovery, NIRA inadvertently promoted monopolies, allowing competing businesses to work together to create industry-wide regulations and establish standards like minimum prices for their goods, maximum work hours, and minimum wage.  The goal was to eliminate competition between these businesses, in the hopes that it would no longer drive down prices or wages.  However, these cartels were dominated by big businesses, which put their smaller rivals at a disadvantage.  The NRA was tasked with supervising these groups, but NRA staff did not have the administrative skills or experience necessary to stand up to large corporations.  Since the government helped set but did not enforce the NRA guidelines, it was already ineffective by the time it was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935.

== The Second New Deal ==

Immediately after Roosevelt passed the first New Deal he received a great deal of support from congress. However, not long after the &quot;First Hundred Days&quot; a growing division was revealed throughout the nation. Many people encouraged the government to take so much control over the fight against poverty and inequality, while many others argued that the government had too much power and wanted them to stop expanding even further than they already had. This created a great deal of pressure from all sides for president Roosevelt and so he came up with the &quot;second new deal&quot;. Roosevelt's New Deal had enjoyed unprecedented popular and congressional support, but that would not last. The seeming unity of the First Hundred Days masked deep divides withing the nation,and once the immediate crisis was averted, the struggle over solutions began in earnest. As some tried to stop expansion of governments power, others pushed for increased governmental action to combat continuing poverty and inequality. &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation-Eighth Edition by Norton, Sheriff, Katzman, Blight, Chudacoff, Logevall, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;

The Works Progress Administration (later renamed the Works Projects Administration) was established after the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act (which Roosevelt called “the Big Bill”) was passed on April 8, 1935.  The bill provided $4 billion in new spending, most of it intended to create public works programs.  In addition to stimulating economic growth, the WPA put about 1/3 of unemployed Americans to work, who earned an average of $50 a month.  These workers built 650,000 miles of roads and highways and 125,000 public buildings.  In addition to this, they built bridges, parks, swimming pools, reservoirs, and irrigation systems, as well as teaching 1.5 million adults to read and write.  The WPA also had cultural programs that provided jobs for about 40,000 unemployed artists.  The Federal Writers Project put over 6,000 writers to work writing pamphlets and articles, as well as guidebooks showcasing the history, landscape, and culture of all 50 states.  The Federal Art Project resulted in the creation of thousands of murals, sculptures, and paintings in public buildings.  The Federal Theater Project sent actors and crews to perform plays in communities across the nation.  Similarly, the Federal Music Project sent unemployed musicians across the nation to perform, teach, and conduct groups of amateur musicians.

In 1935, the Congress passed the Social Security Act. The Act provided for the creation of the Social Security System, under which the unemployed and the unemployable (such as senior citizens) received welfare payments from the government. All eligible workers were required to pay social security taxes on their wages and their employers also contributed an equivalent amount. The workers that paid into social security then received retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A People and A Nation&quot; the eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also granted money to the states for use in their own welfare programs.A program that came about because of Social Security was called the Aid to Families with Dependent Children. This was a program that offered help to families that had children with certain needs and who also had no fathers.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; Although the social security act did help many people out tremendously, it did have some drawbacks. One big drawback was that the law did not cover agricultural labor, domestic service, and casual labor not in the course of the employer's trade or business. This meant that most people of color who worked as farm laborers or in hospitals and such didn't receive any benefits. This also meant that teachers and nurses, mostly women workers were also not covered.Unemployment had decreased-but 9 million people were still without work. Also in 1935 enormous dust storms enveloped the Southern Plains, killing livestock and driving families like the Montgomery from their land. Millions of Americans still suffered. As their dissatisfaction mounted,so,too,did the appeal of various demagogues,who played to the prejudices and unreasoning passions of the people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A People and A Nation&quot; the eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Youth Administration (NYA), established in 1935, funded part-time jobs for 1.5 million high school students and 600,000 college students who were at risk of not being able to afford to stay in school.  It also provided full-time employment and education to around 2.7 million youths that were not students.

The efforts of the Democratic President and Congress were opposed by a conservative Supreme Court. In 1933, the Court had ruled in favor of some state New Deal programs. However, by 1935, the Court had begun to rule against the New Deal. For example, the Court ruled in a case nicknamed the ''Sick Chicken Case'' that the National Industrial Recovery Act Code relating to the sale of &quot;unfit&quot; poultry, as well as all other codes under the act, were unconstitutional. In 1936, the Court ruled that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was also unconstitutional.

== Roosevelt's Re-election ==

In 1936, Roosevelt won re-election in a landslide, losing only the states of Maine and Vermont.  The press did not pick a winner early.  They wanted to make it look like an even race even though Roosevelt was far ahead of his opponent.  Landon, Roosevelt’s opponent, tried to make Roosevelt look like a dictator.  Roosevelt however, did not attack his opponent.  This made many people like Roosevelt even more&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kennesaw.edu/pols/3380/pres/1936.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Roosevelt and Congress proceeded by passing more New Deal legislation. This time, the Supreme Court did not oppose Roosevelt. The Second Agricultural Adjustment Act, for example, replaced the first Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act set minimum wages for workers in interstate industries. The Wagner Housing Act provided for the construction of homes for the poor.

Despite such programs, the New Deal did not end the Great Depression by itself. That task was accomplished by the Second World War, which led to the growth of jobs in industries related to war, which then led to the growth of the overall economy. However, the New Deal did provide much-needed relief to suffering Americans.

== Sit-Down Strike ==

Sit-down strikes began among rubber workers in Akron, OH in the early 1930s, and became the method of choice by the mid-30s.  This tactic had clear advantages over traditional (walk-out) strikes. Workers stayed in the factories and were able to prevent the use of strikebreakers by doing anything they could to keep the owners and/or police away which included throwing random objects out of windows. They also had shelter, and they weren’t isolated (as they would be in the picket line or working at their stations), often forming a community of sorts with other workers.

One of the most significant sit-down strikes of the era occurred in Flint, Michigan during the winter of 1936-1937.  The United Automobile Workers (UAW), formed in 1935, learned that General Motors only had 2 factories that made the dies (industrial tools that use a press to bend, shape, or cut material) used to form their car body components, one in Flint and one in Cleveland.  The UAW had planned to start the strike after the New Year, but when workers at the Cleveland plant went on strike on December 30, the UAW announced that they would not settle the Cleveland strike until an agreement covering all GM plants in the nation had been reached.  When the UAW learned later that day that GM planned to move the dies out of the Flint plant, they called a meeting during lunchtime at the union hall across the street, explained the situation, and sent their members back across the street to begin the strike.

The local police attempted to enter the plant on January 11, but the workers on strike fended them off with fire hoses and thrown car parts.  GM got an injunction against the strike in February, but instead of going along with it, the UAW spread the strike to another plant.  GM finally got fed up with these sit-down strikes and so they obtained a court order to evict the workers but this did not work because the workers held their ground, risking fines and imprisonment.  When this did not work, the Michigan governor was advised to send in the National Guard to end the strike but he refused.  GM reached an agreement with the union on February 11 which established the UAW as the official representative for its members who were GM employees.  Chrysler followed GM very soon in giving into the UAW's terms.  Ford, however, held out until 1941 before they agreed to recognized the unions.  The UAW’s membership skyrocketed in the next year.  In 1936, there were 48 sit-down strikes.  In 1937, there were 477.

== Racism in the 1930's ==
In the 1930s, the Ku Klux Klan was declining after its rebirth in the '10s and '20s. Yet racism was still strong in the South. And the Northern Migration of African-Americans during World War I and the Depression exposed them to resentment in many Northern cities. They need not fear for their lives, as in the Mississippi or even rural Ohio, but they were given dangerous places to live, hired less often than their Caucasian co-workers, and could be fired at the blink of an eye. 

Many New Deal programs gave black Americans opportunities they had often lacked in the past, while also helping to bring their daily struggles to light. Such federal programs as The Federal Music Project, Federal Theatre Project, and Federal Writers project enabled black artists to find word during the depression, often times creating art or stories which portrayed the historic and present situation of blacks in the South. Projects chronicling the lives of former slaves were also begun under the auspices of these programs. At the same time competition for WPA (Works Project Administration) jobs in the South during the thirties also brought to light the persistence of inequality even in the government.Since the WPA required that eligible employees not have refused any private sector jobs at the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; for such jobs, African-Americans (who were paid less on average then whites in the South) might be refused WPA jobs which whites were eligible for. Such discrimination often extended to Hispanic-Americans in the Southwest as well. Despite such difficulties, WPA head Harry Hopkins worked with NAACP leaders to prevent discrimination whenever possible resulting in general support for the programs (and the government) by the black community.

Black Americans also received increased visibility during this decade for less auspicious reasons, resulting in bitter political conflict within the Democratic Party. While the South had been solidly Democratic since the Civil War, the Roosevelt administration actively appealed to African-Americans to join their party, thus alienating many Southerners. The growing divide between Northern and Southern Democrats over the issue of race came to a head in April 1937, when a bitter fight over an anti-lynching bill took place in the House of Representatives. In the wake of a gruesome double lynching in Mississippi (only one of more than a hundred which had taken place since 1930)The House passed the anti-lynching resolution, despite the opposition of all but one Southern member. Declaring that the South had been &quot;deserted by the Democrats of the North&quot; former Roosevelt supporters in the Senate carried out a six week long filibuster which resulted in the withdrawal of the bill in February 1938. This bitter political fight was indicative of the racism and regional conflict still firmly entrenched in America in the 1930s.

== Memorial Day Massacre ==

On Memorial Day in 1937, in Chicago, a group of workers and their families marched towards the Republic Steel Plant to support some strikers. However, the police stopped them en route. One of the workers threw something at one of the policemen and this gave the police reason to attack the workers and as a result 10 men were killed and 30 people (including women and children) were wounded. These people did not receive much sympathy from fellow Americans because they were tired of the violence. Instead the people praised the police force for stepping in and containing the disruptive group of people. &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation-Eighth Edition by Norton, Sheriff, Katzman, Blight, Chudacoff, Logevall, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of lives lost because of all of the strikes and picket lines, organized labor gained a lot of ground in the 1930s. The National Labor Relations Board became very effective in reducing the violence. They mediated the disputes instead of letting the people take the matters into their own hands, as they had been doing for so long. The unionized workers made up about 23% of non-agricultural workers. Because of these changes they were able to raise their standard of living. By 1941 union workers were able to buy not only a new pair of shoes for each of their children every 2 years, but also a new coat for them and their wife every 6 years &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation-Eighth Edition by Norton, Sheriff, Katzman, Blight, Chudacoff, Logevall, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Roosevelt Recession ==

Between 1933 and 1937, the U.S. economy improved slowly but surely -- total personal income of Americans rose from $38 billion in 1933 to $70 billion in 1937.  In the same period, employment also rose from 27.9 million to just over 36 million, and unemployment dropped from 12.8 million (25.2% of the American labor force) to 7.7 million (14.3%).  However, people were also much more cautious in their spending than in pre-crash years.  This and a growing labor force resulted in more goods being produced than consumed, relegating large amounts of unsold goods to warehouse shelves.

In the months between his second inauguration and September of 1937, Roosevelt ordered a reduction in federal spending on emergency employment projects.  The number of workers employed on WPA and other projects were cut from 3.7 million to 1.9 million.  Funding for PWA projects was also greatly reduced during this period.  Unemployment rose from 14.3% in 1937 to 19% in early 1938.  In April of 1938, Roosevelt sent a new spending program to Congress totaling $3.75 billion, which they approved.  More than $1.4 billion went to the WPA and almost $1 billion went to the PWA, with the rest being split among other federal programs.  Although the economy recovered shortly thereafter, unemployment didn’t return to 1937 levels until World War II.

      <comment>/* Honey as fermented drink */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Honey as fermented drink==
I note with interest that there is no mention of honey as a fermented drink. Mead has long been made throughout much of Europe and Africa, and still is made traditionally today in some areas. It can be (often is) quite alcoholic, but does not need to be so - in fact, early stages of the fermentation when alcohol levels are very low are traditionally reserved for children in Africa (e.g. [[w:Tej|Tej]] in Ethiopia and surrounds). Non-alcoholic recipes such as [[Cookbook:Ginger beer|this ginger beer]] recipe adapt well to being made with honey instead of table sugar, and are generally the better for it too.

: Teaching Pathfinders about the use of honey as a fermented drink would be against the principals of the church which sponsors the organization.  It was an intentional omission. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 13:17, 23 April 2007 (UTC)
::Ah, fair enough. I won't be offended if you &quot;archive in page history&quot; this comment then. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:17, 23 April 2007 (UTC)
:::I don't mind having this in the talk page at all.  The question might come up again.  In fact, it might not be a bad idea to note the existence of mead (without endorsement).  It's probably better to acknowledge its existence than it is to totally ignore it. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:24, 23 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Good and bad example for contact area flatness */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
==Heatsink Design==
What characteristics make a heatsink a good one? There's a number of factors to consider: 

High heatsink surface. It's at the surface of the heatsink where the thermal transfer takes place. Therefore, heatsinks should be designed to have a large surface; this goal can be reached by using a large amount of fine fins, or by increasing the size of the heatsink itself. 

Good aerodynamics. Heatsinks must be designed in a way that air can easily and quickly float through the cooler, and reach all cooling fins. Especially heatsinks having a very large amount of fine fins, with small distances between the fins may not allow good air flow. A compromise between high surface (many fins with small gaps between them) and good aerodynamics must be found. This also depends on the fan the heatsink is used with: A powerful fan can force air even through a heatsink with lots of fine fins with only small gaps for air flow - whereas on a passive heatsink, there should be fewer cooling fins with more space between them. Therefore, simply adding a fan to a large heatsink designed for fanless usage doesn't necessarily result in a good cooler. 

Good thermal transfer within the heatsink. Large cooling fins are pointless if the heat can't reach them, so the heatsink must be designed to allow good thermal transfer from the heat source to the fins. Thicker fins have better thermal conductivity; so again, a compromise between high surface (many thin fins) and good thermal transfer (thicker fins) must be found. Of course, the material used has a major influence on thermal transfer within the heatsink. Sometimes, heat pipes are used to lead the heat from the heat source to the parts of the fins that are further away from the heat source. 

Perfect flatness of the contact area. The part of the heatsink that is in contact with the heat source must be perfectly flat. A flat contact area allows you to use a thinner layer of thermal compound, which will reduce the thermal resistance between heatsink and heat source. 

==Good and bad example for contact area flatness==

Good mounting method. For good thermal transfer, the pressure between heatsink and heat source must be high. Heatsink clips must be designed to provide a strong pressure, while still being reasonably easy to install. Heatsink mountings with screws/springs are often better than regular clips. Thermoconductive glue or sticky tape should only be used in situations where mounting with clips or screws isn't possible. 
Measuring heatsink performance; thermal resistance θ
Heatsink performance is measured in °C/W (or K/W - since we're dealing with temperature differences, there is no difference between Celsius and Kelvin scale here). We refer to this as thermal resistance (θ).
An example for what these values mean: if a thermal load of 20W is applied to a heatsink, and this causes the temperature of the heat source to rise by 10°C, the heatsink has a rating of 10°C/20W = 0.5°C/W.

A θ value is valid only for a certain power load and a certain temperature range.

The thermal resistance of standard coolers for PC CPUs is usually not specified by the heatsink manufacturers, and if it is, it's often inaccurate or intentionally skewed for marketing purposes. You cannot judge heatsink performance by comparing θ specifications from different manufacturers.

The θ values specified by manufacturers specialized in heatsinks for industrial applications (especially large passive heatsinks) are usually more accurate, though.

Heatsink testing is not an easy task; many of the heatsink reviews found on the countless cooling-related sites on the net are not done properly.

==Heatsink materials==
The thermal conductivity of the heatsink's material has a major impact on cooling performance. Thermal conductivity is measured in W/mK; higher values mean better conductivity.
As a rule of thumb, materials with a high electrical conductivity also have a high thermal conductivity. See this Wikipedia article for more information on thermal conductivity. 

Alloys have lower thermal conductivity than pure metals, but may have better mechanical or chemical (corrosion) properties.

The following materials are commonly used for heatsinks: 

Aluminum. It has a thermal conductivity of 205W/mK, which is good (as a comparison: steel has about 50W/mK). The production of aluminum heatsinks is inexpensive; they can be made using extrusion Due to its softness, aluminum can also be milled quickly; die-casting and even cold forging are also possible (see part 2 of this guide for more information about production methods). Aluminum is also very light (thus, an aluminum heatsink will put less stress on its mounting when the unit is moved around). 

Copper's thermal conductivity is about twice as high as aluminum - almost 400W/mK. This makes it an excellent material for heatsinks; but its disadvantages include high weight, high price, and less choice as far as production methods are concerned. Copper heatsinks can be milled, die-cast, or made of copper plates bonded together; extrusion is not possible. 

To combine the advantages of aluminum and copper, heatsinks can be made of aluminum and copper bonded together. Here, the area in contact with the heat source is made of copper, which helps lead the heat away to the outer parts of the heatsink. The first heatsink for PC CPUs with an embedded copper piece was the Alpha P7125 (for first-generation Slot A Athlon CPUs). Keep in mind that a copper embedding is only useful if it is tightly bonded to the aluminum part for good thermal transfer. This is not always the case, especially not with inexpensive coolers. If the thermal transfer between the copper and the aluminum is poor, the copper embedding may do more harm than good.

==Alpha P7125 base plate==
The copper plate helps spread heat across the base plate. 
 
==AVC heatsink with copper core==
The copper core helps the heat move to the upper parts of the heatsink. 
 
Thermalright heatsink (prototype) with large heat pipe in the center
A heat pipe provides substantially better thermal transfer than a solid piece of copper. 

Silver has an even higher thermal conductivity than copper, but only by about 10%. This does not justify the much higher price for heatsink production - however, pulverized silver is a common ingredient in high-end thermal compounds.

{{todo|where clauses, grouping and grouped selection, ordering, external tables, sub-queries, virtual tables, OwnerAccess option}}

{{JET:TOC}}
Data can be retrieved from tables using the &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; statement. The statement takes the following basic form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select [{limit-clause}] {column-list}
    [Into {new-tablename}]
    From {table-expression}
    [Where {where-clause}]
    [Group By {group-by-expression}]
    [Having {having-clause}]
    [Order By {order-list}]
    [With OwnerAccess Option]
&lt;/source&gt;

{| class='wikitable'
| &lt;code&gt;{limit-clause}&lt;/code&gt;
|
* All (default) &amp;ndash; select all matching rows
* Distinct &amp;ndash; select matching rows that have unique values for the columns selected
* DistinctRow &amp;ndash; select matching rows that have unique values in all columns accessed, whether selected or not
* Top ''n'' [Percent] &amp;ndash; restrict the number of matching rows returned to ''n'', or ''n''% of all matching rows
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt;
| Either an asterisk (*) to specify that all available columns are returned; or a comma-separated list of expressions that evaluate to output columns, where each expression can be of the form:
: ''expression'' [As display-name]
and can be consist of a column from a table or view, a function call, a constant, or a nested expression.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{new-tablename}&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of a non-existing table into which matching rows will be inserted.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt;
| A list of tables, views, or sub-queries, either comma separated or with explicit join directives. Each table / view / sub-query can have an optional alias, of the form:
: ''expression'' [alias]
e.g.
: From account_details a, contact_details c, invoices i
A table may be specified as being in an external database by using the &lt;code&gt;In&lt;/code&gt; clause, specifying a Windows path to an external database in which the target table resides. The external database can be another JET database, or any other database that the JET drivers can connect to (include [[w:XBase|xBase]] and [[w:Paradox (database)|Paradox]] databases).
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{where-clause}&lt;/code&gt;
| A set of expressions restricting the rows matched in the tables or views specified in {table-expression}. The where-clause can include multiple expressions separated by logical &lt;code&gt;And&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Or&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Not&lt;/code&gt; operators, and grouped by parentheses (...)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{group-by-expression}&lt;/code&gt;
| A comma-separated list of expressions that evaluate to the output columns on which to group, when returning aggregated data (e.g. sums, counts)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{having-clause}&lt;/code&gt;
| A set of expressions restricting the matching rows when returning aggregated data
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{order-list}&lt;/code&gt;
| A list of columns by which to sort the matching rows
|}

Here is a simple select statement that returns all rows in a single table, with every column in that table, and sorted by one column:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select * From S1 Order By a
&lt;/source&gt;

In JET SQL, much as in other SQL dialects, operations on tables, views and sub-queries are pretty much identical; for the rest of this section, ''table'' can be read as either a physical table, a view, or a sub-query utilised as a ''virtual table''. More will be said about sub-queries and virtual tables later.

==Column lists==

The simplest &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; is the asterisk, which specifies that all available columns from the ''tables'' listed in the &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt; are returned:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select * From S1
&lt;/source&gt;

Individual columns can be selected from a ''table'' by specifying a comma-separate list of column names, and each column can be given an alias if desired:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select a, b as TheSecondColumn From S1
&lt;/source&gt;

Where there are multiple ''tables'' in the &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in the potential for two result columns to have the same name, the ''table'' name (or an alias for the ''table'') can be used to specify which column to return. The following two statements achieve the same result, with the second statement using table aliases to make the statement a little more concise:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select Invoice.InvoiceNumber, Invoice.CustomerNumber, Customer.CustomerName
    From Invoice, Customer
    Where Customer.CustomerNumber = 10 And Invoice.InvoiceNumber = 123

Select i.InvoiceNumber, i.CustomerNumber, c.CustomerName
    From Invoice i, Customer c
    Where c.CustomerNumber = 10 And i.InvoiceNumber = 123
&lt;/source&gt;

In addition to columns from the specified ''tables'', columns in the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; can be expressions. Such an expression can be a mathematical equation, a function call, a string concatenation, a constant, or a mix of these. Here is an example showing how an extended price can be computed from an item price and a quantity, and how a constant can be introduced as a column:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select ID, (ItemPrice * ItemQuantity) As ExtendedPrice, 'A' As ReportPart
    From OrderItem
&lt;/source&gt;

==Joining tables==

Querying data often requires looking in more than one table for an answer, especially when good database design principles have been followed. SQL allows a single &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; statement to do this by joining ''tables''.

Joining two or more ''tables'' together can be achieved in JET SQL, much the same as in other SQL dialects. Here are some sample tables for examining join syntax in JET SQL:

{|
| style='vertical-align: top' |
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Table J1'''
! JobName
|-
| bus driver
|-
| doctor
|-
| electrician
|-
| painter
|-
| sales clerk
|}
| &amp;nbsp;
| style='vertical-align: top' |
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Table J2'''
! WorkerName !! JobName
|-
| Mary || bus driver
|-
| Raphael || electrician
|-
| William || painter
|-
| Bruce || doctor
|-
| Juanita || doctor
|}
|}

===Cartesian join===

A '''[[w:Cartesian product|Cartesian join]]''', sometimes called a ''cross join'', is where each row in the first ''table'' is joined with each row in the second ''table''. This type of join can be useful when generating a list of all possible combinations from two or three categories. The syntax for a Cartesian join is the simplest join syntax; just list the ''tables'' in the &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt; separated by a comma:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select J1.JobName, J2.WorkerName From J1, J2
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
JobName              WorkerName
-------------------- --------------------
bus driver           Mary
doctor               Mary
electrician          Mary
painter              Mary
sales clerk          Mary
bus driver           Raphael
doctor               Raphael
electrician          Raphael
painter              Raphael
sales clerk          Raphael
bus driver           William
doctor               William
electrician          William
painter              William
sales clerk          William
bus driver           Bruce
doctor               Bruce
electrician          Bruce
painter              Bruce
sales clerk          Bruce
bus driver           Juanita
doctor               Juanita
electrician          Juanita
painter              Juanita
sales clerk          Juanita
(25 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Inner join===

There are two ways to achieve an '''inner join''', where each row in the first ''table'' is joined to one or more rows in the second ''table'' by an expression. The first way is an extension of the Cartesian join, above, with a &lt;code&gt;{where-clause}&lt;/code&gt; expression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select J1.JobName, J2.WorkerName From J1, J2
    Where J1.JobName = J2.JobName
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, an inner join expression can be given in the &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt;. This is no different in a practical sense to the previous example, but some people find that it more clearly shows the type of join and its constraints, as distinct from expressions used as selectors or filters in a &lt;code&gt;{where-clause}&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select J1.JobName, J2.WorkerName
    From J1
    Inner Join J2 On J1.JobName = J2.JobName
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
JobName              WorkerName
-------------------- --------------------
bus driver           Mary
electrician          Raphael
painter              William
doctor               Bruce
doctor               Juanita
(5 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Outer join===

Joining two ''tables'' such that the first ''table'' is joined to no rows, or one or more rows, from the second ''table'', requires a '''left outer join'''. Another way of looking at this join is that all rows selected from the first ''table'' are returned, whether or not there are rows from the second ''table'' to join to; an inner join only returns rows from the first ''table'' that can be joined to rows in the second ''table''. In JET SQL, the left outer join requires a &lt;code&gt;LEFT JOIN&lt;/code&gt; statement in the &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt;, with the details of the join specified after the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; part of the statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select J1.JobName, J2.WorkerName
    From J1
    Left Join J2 On J1.JobName = J2.JobName
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
JobName              WorkerName
-------------------- --------------------
bus driver           Mary
doctor               Juanita
doctor               Bruce
electrician          Raphael
painter              William
sales clerk          &lt;NULL&gt;
(6 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The converse of a left outer join, where the second ''table'' is joined to no rows, or one or more rows, from the first ''table'', is a '''right outer join'''. In JET SQL, the right outer join requires a &lt;code&gt;RIGHT JOIN&lt;/code&gt; statement in the &lt;code&gt;{table-expression}&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select J1.JobName, J2.WorkerName
    From J1
    Right Join J2 On J1.JobName = J2.JobName
&lt;/source&gt;

===Multiple joins===

When a &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; statement joins more than two ''tables'', each pair must be nested within parentheses to group the joining tables together:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select *
    From ((J1 Left Join J2 On J1.JobName = J2.JobName)
    Inner Join J3 On J2.WorkerName = J3.WorkerName)
    Left Join J4 On J3.x = J4.x
&lt;/source&gt;

==Limit clause==

The &lt;code&gt;{limit-clause}&lt;/code&gt; restricts the quantity of data returned by a query, and whether or not duplicate rows are returned. If it is not specified, then the query will return everything that matches the selection criteria, duplicates and all. This is the same as saying &lt;code&gt;Select All&lt;/code&gt;.

{|
| style='vertical-align: top' |
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Table L1'''
! ID !! FullName !! JobTitle
|-
| 1 || Joe Bloggs || painter
|-
| 2 || Milly Jones || doctor
|-
| 3 || Robert Green || electrician
|-
| 4 || Joe Bloggs || author
|-
| 5 || Lee Wong || accountant
|-
| 6 || Joe Bloggs || painter
|-
| 7 || Lee Wong || plumber
|}
| &amp;nbsp;
| style='vertical-align: top' |
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Table L2'''
! AccountNumber !! ID
|-
| 123456789 || 1
|-
| 987654321 || 2
|-
| 134679258 || 3
|-
| 976431852 || 4
|-
| 456789123 || 4
|}
|}

===Distinct===

&lt;code&gt;Distinct&lt;/code&gt; removes any rows with the same values from the result set. Without &lt;code&gt;Distinct&lt;/code&gt;, there would be three rows for the name Joe Bloggs with an account, but with &lt;code&gt;Distinct&lt;/code&gt; there will only be one Joe Bloggs row returned by the following statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select Distinct FullName
    From L1 Inner Join L2 On L1.ID = L2.ID
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
FullName
--------------------
Joe Bloggs
Milly Jones
Robert Green
(3 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===DistinctRow===

&lt;code&gt;DistinctRow&lt;/code&gt; removes any duplicated table rows from the result set, taking into consideration all columns from tables that have columns in the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; subtly different to &lt;code&gt;Distinct&lt;/code&gt; which only takes columns in the &lt;code&gt;{column-list}&lt;/code&gt; into consideration.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select DistinctRow FullName
    From L1 Inner Join L2 On L1.ID = L2.ID
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
FullName
--------------------
Joe Bloggs
Milly Jones
Robert Green
Joe Bloggs
(4 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;DistinctRow&lt;/code&gt; is ignored when there is only one table selected from.

===Top ''n''===

&lt;code&gt;Top ''n''&lt;/code&gt; is used to limit the number of rows returned, to either a specific number of rows, or to a percentage of the complete result set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select Top 4 * From L1
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
ID          FullName             JobTitle
----------- -------------------- --------------------
1           Joe Bloggs           painter
2           Milly Jones          doctor
3           Robert Green         electrician
4           Joe Bloggs           author
(4 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select Top 40 Percent * From L1
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
ID          FullName             JobTitle
----------- -------------------- --------------------
1           Joe Bloggs           painter
2           Milly Jones          doctor
3           Robert Green         electrician
(3 row(s) returned)
&lt;/pre&gt;

I am an avid person when it comes to learning, especially if it’s a subject that&lt;br&gt;interests me. That’s why I have joined Wiki – a free repository filled with all sorts&lt;br&gt;of different subject matter. Although I have little, if any, credentials or the ability&lt;br&gt;to offer writing a book covering a certain topic, I will do what I can to help keep&lt;br&gt;Wiki going.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Sometimes you need to have a form edit data structures that are recursive.  In other words: a structure that references itself.

This example has nodes that have links.  These links in turn point back to nodes.  This is an example of a self-referential data structure.  This is common when manipulating graphs.  Workflow systems frequently use these structures.

== Link to Working Example ==
[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/10-full-examples/87-graph-editor/GraphEditor.xhtml Graph Editor]

== XML Schema ==
Here is a sample XML Schema with a recursive data type (a data type that includes an instance of itself):

&lt;code&gt;graph.xsd&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot; attributeFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Graph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
         &lt;xs:documentation&gt;Comment describing your root element&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
      &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
      &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
         &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;graph-name&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
                  &lt;xs:documentation&gt;The name of the graph&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
               &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;/xs:element&gt;
            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;graph-description&quot; minOccurs=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;node&quot; type=&quot;nodeType&quot; minOccurs=&quot;0&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
                  &lt;xs:documentation&gt;A node that has zero or more links&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
               &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;/xs:element&gt;
         &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
   &lt;/xs:element&gt;
   &lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;nodeType&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
         &lt;xs:documentation&gt;A node in a graph with 0 to n links&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
      &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
         &lt;xs:element name=&quot;node-id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
               &lt;xs:documentation&gt;node identifier&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
            &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
         &lt;/xs:element&gt;
         &lt;xs:element name=&quot;links&quot; type=&quot;linkType&quot; minOccurs=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
   &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
   &lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;linkType&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
         &lt;xs:documentation&gt;A link from one node to another.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
      &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
         &lt;xs:element name=&quot;link-id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
               &lt;xs:documentation&gt;link identifier&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
            &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
         &lt;/xs:element&gt;
         &lt;xs:element name=&quot;node&quot; type=&quot;nodeType&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
   &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Most of this is straight-forward XForms code.  
But there is one very tricky line.  This is when you click on a node listed in the list of links and you want to make the node you just selected the current node.

The trick is is to use the position() to match the index() value.  When the position matches the index you can set the current-node-id equal to this node.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('path')/current-node-id&quot;
value=&quot;instance('saved-data')//node[node-id=instance('path')/current-node-id]/links/node[position()=index('repeat-node1')]/node-id&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Thanks to Fraser for the tip!

      <comment>/* The pH Scale Indicatiors and Neutralisation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several main points within the metals topic, which are:
Alkali and Transition Metals, The Reactivity Series, Displacement Reactions, Metal Extraction from their Ores, The pH Scale Indicators and Neutralisation, and Salts.



== Alkali and Transition Metals ==

The alkali metals are Group one of the periodic table, except for Hydrogen, which is not an alkali metal. They are the most reactive metals on the periodic table, and they get more reactive as the periodic table goes down. This is because the number of electron shells increases, meaning that the forces of attraction between the outermost electron and the atoms neuclei are weakened, since the shells in between the neucleus and the furthest shell have a shielding effect on the forces of attraction.  (This is to do with Covalent Bonding).

== The Reactivity Series ==


== Displacement Reactions ==


== Metal Extraction from their Ores ==

== The pH Scale Indicatiors and Neutralisation ==
The pH Scale goes from 0 to 14. 

1 2 3 4 5 6   7      8 9 10 11 12 13 13 
  ACIDS     NEUTRAL      ALKALIS 

An indicator is just a dye that changes colour depending on the level of the pH of the solution. For example, if the solution is a weak acid than the indicator would change to a orange colour (4 on the pH scale). 

The strongest acid has a pH of 0 and the strongest alkali has the pH 14. A neutral substance has the pH 7 (e.g. pure water).

== Salts ==

Rhetoric is a term that is widely used in many forms. Some use the term in association with political rhetoric, to name the voice and stance, as well as the language that becomes the nature of politics.  Rhetoric can be thought of as the way in which you phrase what you are saying, and the forces that impact what you are saying.  If you think about the different groups of people that you communicate with, you will see that you use different forms of rhetoric with each of them.  You talk to your friends differently than you talk to your parents, or your teachers, or your employers.  Each group you associate with calls for a different form of language, of voice, of rhetoric to be used.

For the purposes of writing, when we refer to rhetoric, we often talk about it as the art of persuasion.  Here, rhetoric fits into three distinct categories:
* '''Pathos''' ('''Emotion''' based persuasion)
* '''Ethos''' ('''Credibility''' behind the persuasion)
* '''Logos''' ('''Logic''' based persuasion)

== Pathos ==


Pathos is often the rhetorical vehicle of public service announcements.  A number of anti-smoking and second hand smoking related commercials use pathos heavily.  One of the more memorable shows an elderly man rising from the couch to meet his young grandson who, followed by the child's mother, is taking his first steps toward the grandfather.  As the old man coaxes the young child forward, the grandfather begins to disappear.  As the child walks through him the mother says &quot;I wish your grandpa could see you now.&quot; The audience is left to assume that the grandfather has died, and an announcer informs us that cigarette smoke kills so many people a year, with a closing statement to the effect of &quot;be there for the ones you love.&quot;  This commercial uses powerful words (like &quot;love&quot;) and images to get at the emotions of the viewer, encouraging them to quit smoking.  The goal is for the audience to becoming so &quot;enlightened&quot; and emotionally moved that the smoking viewers never touch another cigarette.

== Ethos ==

Basically credibility. Are you reliable? 

Ethos encompasses a large number of different things which can include what a person wears, says, the words they use, their tone of voice, their credentials, their experience, their charge over the audience, verbal and nonverbal behavior, criminal records, etc.  At times, it can be as important to know who the person presenting the material is, as what they are saying about a topic.

Many companies, especially those big enough to afford famous spokespersons, will use celebrities in their ad campaigns in attempts to sell their products.  Certain soft drink companies have used the likes of Ray Charles, Madonna, and Britney Spears to sell their products, and been successful in doing so.  The thing you need to ask yourself is: what do these celebrities add to the product other than their fame?

Often times ads for medical products or even chewing gums might say that four out of five doctors/dentists recommend a certain product.  Some commercials may even show a doctor in a white lab coat approving whatever is for sale.  Now, provided that the person you are viewing is an actual doctor, this might be an example of a good ethos argument. On the other hand, if an automotive company uses a famous sports figure to endorse a product, we might wonder what that person knows about this product.  The campaign and celebrity are not being used to inform the consumer, but rather catch their attention with what is actually a faulty example of ethos.

Similarly, one can imagine that you would not use a bald person to promote a product claiming to regrow hair, or a male to sell feminine hygiene products.

How does this apply to writing?  To begin, if you are going to cite an article of racial equality published by the Ku Klux Klan, or a Neo-Nazi organization, this might send up a red flag that this particular article might be written from a biased viewpoint.  You may always want to research an author to see if they have a background to claim what they are writing as truth.  Also, if you are trying to present a formal paper project, you may want to increase your positive ethos by using appropriate terminology.  Writing that &quot;abortions are all whack and stuff&quot; is probably not the best way to convince your audience of the point of your article.  It may happen that you as a writer adopt different voices for different assignments, but the word choice and your approach to the assignment should reflect what it is you want to say.

== Logos ==

&quot;THIS IS THE BOOOOOMB You want to use this stuff, it's the meat and potatoes of your essay. I don't need to relish on this, as cold hard facts speak for themselves.&quot;*

*False facts like this one are one example of faulty logos.  To look into the matter further, one needs to take a look at the two different types of logos and how they function.  These two types are known as &quot;deductive&quot; and &quot;inductive.&quot;

=== Deductive Logic ===

A deductive logical argument is one that works from the top to the bottom.  It begins with what is known as a &quot;major premise,&quot; adds a &quot;minor premise,&quot; and attempts to reach a conclusion.  A major premise is a statement that names something about a large group, a minor premise takes a single member, and the conclusion attempts to prove that because this single member is a part of the larger group, they must also have the trait named in the original statement.  For example:

: MEN ARE TALL - a major premise as it works with a large group of people
: BOB IS A MAN - a minor premise as we hear about only one individual of that group
: BOB IS TALL  - we attempt to make a conclusion based upon what we have already been told

Now, if it is true that men are tall, and that Bob is a man, then we can safely infer that Bob must be tall.  However, beware the logical fallacy.  Though it may be true that in certain cultures men are, on average, taller than women, certainly this is not always the case.  Being that our major premise is not altogether true, we can now say that this argument is flawed.  Furthermore, we might ask what our definition of &quot;tall&quot; is.  Tall is different if we are talking about the average population, or basketball players.  Also, what is a man?  Do transgendered individuals count?  We see that the problem becomes far more complex the more we look into it.

=== Inductive Logic ===

As some would argue that a deductive argument works from the top down, toward a conclusion, some comment that an inductive argument works from the bottom up.  This is mildly misleading.  What is meant by this is that an inductive logical argument begins with a firm affirmation of truth, a conclusive statement.  By getting the audience to agree with this statement, the argument moves to the next &quot;logical&quot; step.  It proceeds in this manner until the argument has led you from one seemingly reasonable conclusion to another that you may not have originally agreed with.  Take the following as an example.  Move through the argument slowly, making sure you understand and agree with each step in the process (and please forgive the religious content, you'll come to see it is irrelevant anyway).

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= The human soul is inherently free.  This is its very nature.  We are confined to our mortal, earthly bodies, but our souls must be kept free, or the nature of the soul is entirely negated.  If one chooses to believe in a soul, they can only believe that it embraces this (vague idea of ) freedom.  

At conception, a child is given a soul.  Some may argue that it is not until birth, but if those very same persons are pro-life, they confuse their arguments.  Thus, if someone is pro-life, and believes in a soul, they must believe in the freedom of that soul, and also accept that the soul is granted upon conception.

A soul cannot die.  By the same means by which it is free over the body, a soul claims immortality while the body decomposes and is ruined.  To deny that a soul is immortal is again to deny the very essence of a soul.  Thus, if someone is pro-life, and believes in a soul, they must believe in the freedom of that soul, the immortality of the soul, and also accept that the soul is granted upon conception.

A soul cannot be born.  It is immortal and cannot die, it is not earthly, it forever exists, and cannot be born.  There are tales in Greek mythology of Athena’s birth, yet she bounds from her father’s head a fully decorated woman.  She was not born.  She existed previously, as Milton writes the Son in Paradise Lost.  If one accepts the Bible’s teachings, there can be no reincarnation, another form of birth, a rebirth.  Thus, if someone is pro-life, and believes in a soul, and does not accept reincarnation, they must believe in the freedom of that soul, the immortality of the soul that is always and forever (which cannot be born and cannot die), and also accept that the soul is granted upon conception.

A soul being always an essence, and not being able to be reincarnated, can only exist outside of the body, somewhere, until the act of conception occurs.  That soul must then be placed in the body that was forever intended to receive it, as it belongs nowhere else.  The soul is fated to that one body.  Thus, if someone is pro-life, and believes in a soul, and does not accept reincarnation, namely a practicing Catholic, they must also believe in the freedom of the soul, and in the concept of fate.  Fate, however, completely opposes the idea of freedom.  One cannot then believe in a soul, for it immediately enforces a belief in fate which directly negates the belief in the soul.  If our actions are written in a Divine plan, we are not free to make our own choices.  Every action has been scripted.  

Do not worry, it must be that you were meant to read this. |caption=A sample inductive argument by Ben Doberstein.}}

Having seen this, some might say that the argument defeats Catholicism from an atheist standpoint.  Others might find that it argues for the secularization of religion.  Still, there are ways in which it supports Catholicism at the same time.  

Though the argument might seem as if it is disagreeing with the Catholic religion, and some would agree that it is, we must always be looking for the logical fallacy.  Upon closer inspection, you may notice that all this argument truly does, in one reading of the text, is to explain the complexity of God through the mind of a human.  Catholicism has argued since the beginning that God is impossible to fully explain using the conceptions of man.  In that way, this argument only supports that conclusion.

Be aware that there will be logic fallacies hidden in almost every argument.  If there is more than one side to an argument, such as in religious or political debates, it is most likely because the argument is impossible to prove.  Hence, there will be a logical fallacy present.

=== Common Logical Fallacies ===

; Non Sequiturs
: Latin for &quot;does not follow&quot;
: ''Example:''  Luke wears glasses, so he is intelligent. - Note that glasses do not reflect someone's intelligence.

; Red Herring
: The premise is not relevant to the conclusion
: ''Example:''  Our teacher should be fired.  A teacher should be nice and never give any homework, and give everyone A+'s.  These are values that tutors cannot uphold. - Logically, the teacher should not be a tutor.

; False-Cause Fallacy
: Because A happened before B, it means that B happened because of A.
: ''Example:''  Since Mrs. Smith took over the orchard, we've sold 20% more apples. - Certainly it could simply be that they are now in season.

; Ad Hominem
: Attacks the debater rather than the argument of the debater.
: ''Example:''  Don't believe this candidate.  She/He is a dumb-dumb head.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Indus Valley Civilization existed from 5500 BC to about 1300 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization covered most of Pakistan and  Northwestern India during it's golden age which was from 2600 BC to 1900 BC.
==Geography==
The Indus Valley Civilization covered much of modern-day Pakistan and Northwestern India. It was situated around the Indus river and the Ghaggar-Hakra river.The main cities of the civilization were Harrapa, Mohanzodro, Kalibanga, Lothal. Harrapa was the largest city in terms of area and Mohanzodro had largest population. Lothal had a Dockyard which reflect that people had sea trade to the eastern countries like Egypt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The geography of Canada is an diverse as the cultures that now exist in it. From the rainforests in British Columbia to the tundra in the Northwest Territories to the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick.



= Appalachian Region =

Today some of the best and most extensive broad-leaved deciduous forests in the world still flourish in the Appalachians. To the north are the conifers (red spruce and balsam fir, which grow at the highest elevations) and the northern hardwoods: sugar maple, buckeye, beech, ash, birch, and red and white oak. The western slopes of the Great Smokies, with their abundant rainfall, produce trees that have reached record maximum height and diameter. Among these are the yellow poplar, buckeye, eastern Canadian hemlock, and chestnut oak.

The Appalachian forest is a highly complex interdependent system. It forms one of the great floral provinces of the Earth. There are the trees that bear luxuriant bloom, such as serviceberry, redbud, hawthorn, yellow poplar, dogwood, locust, sourwood, and many others. Among the numerous shrubs with particularly showy flowers are the rhododendron, azalea, and mountain laurel. Certain summits of the southern Appalachians are called heath balds—open meadows or grasslands interspersed with thick growths of heath.

Ferns, mosses, and mushrooms of many species also are part of the complex Appalachian plant life.

Bison, elk, and wolves, used to be common in the Appalachian, but now they, like caribou and moose, are mostly found in the northernmost corners of the region. Scattered through other areas are the black bear, white-tailed deer, wild boar, fox, raccoon, beaver, and numerous other small animals.

= Coastal Plains =

The Atlantic coastal plains support a diverse waterfowl community including dabbling, diving and sea ducks as well as geese. Key species include black duck, blue-winged teal and common eider.  Millions of sea birds also use this area throughout the year and an estimated 4.8 million shorebirds travel through the Atlantic Provinces every fall.

Many plants inhabit the sandy areas. These plants are small, slow-growing, and adapted to living in areas where many other plants cannot survive.  The conditions where they grow are low in nutrients, and subject to disturbance by wind, waves, and changing water levels.  They do not compete well with other more aggressive plants and therefore can not establish in undisturbed, fertile areas.  An example of a habitat where Coastal Plain Flora could thrive is an exposed, gently sloping, sandy or gravel lake shores. Pine forests cover the land.


= Great Lakes =


The Great Lakes region are filled with birds, amphibians and mammals. Black bears, moose, Canadian lynx, bobcats and timber wolves roam the Northwoods of Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan and Huron. The small pockets of deciduous forests ringing the lower Great Lakes are inhabited by white-tailed deer, eastern chipmunks, red squirrels, cardinals, wood thrush and screech owl. Throughout the region, migrating waterfowl, song birds, sandpipers and plovers rest and refuel along the region’s streams, rivers and wetlands, and various types of frogs and salamanders crowd in the wetlands.
 
This biodiversity is set in an diverse range of ecosystems, including deep and shallow aquatic systems, wetlands, streams and rivers, tall-grass prairies, deciduous forests, coniferous forests, boreal forests, cliff faces and beaches.


= St.Lawrence Lowlands =


Although the vegetation is typified by a broadleaf forest of sugar maple, American beech, basswood, white oak, red oak, shagbark hickory, black walnut and butternut, farm fields and man-altered sites are the norm today. Wildlife that thrives in this zone today must be able to take advantage of agricultural crops and suburban habitats. Many common species, such as white-tailed deer, grey squirrel, coyote, starling, house sparrow and ringbilled gull, are recent arrivals to this region. Reptiles include several endangered species (eastern spiny soft-shelled turtle, Blanding's turtle, box turtle, and fox snake, among others) and eastern Canada's only lizard, the five-lined skink. The climax forest in the deciduous forest zone is dominated by sugar maple and American beech, with hemlock dominant on shady north-facing slopes. White pine, red pine and red oak dominate the dry ridge tops.

In the mixed wood forest zone, undisturbed sites consist of sugar maple, yellow birch, eastern hemlock and white pine. Boreal species such as white spruce, black spruce and balsam fir dominate in cool, damp habitats. Moose, wolf, snowshoe hare, martin, spruce grouse and other boreal species intermix with species more typical of southern areas such as the cardinal, white-tailed deer and raccoon.


= Interior Plains =

Trees and shrubs are most commonly found in the eastern region. Trees found in the Prairies include white spruce, black spruce, balsam fir, tamarack, water birch, Bebb willow, peachleaf willow, wolf willow, lodgepole pine, box elder, choke cherry, black cottonwood, eastern cottonwood, bur oak, trembling aspen, and balsam poplar. Just a few of the other plants that grow here are spear grass, wheat, blue grama grass, sagebrush, yellow cactus, prickly pear, buckbrush, chokecherry, Saskatoon berry bush, alkali grass, wild barley, red sampire, sea blite, Parry oat grass, June grass, yellow bean, sticky geranium, bedstraw, chickweed, needle grass, thread grass, snowberry, American silverberry, rose, silverberry, dryland sedge, black hawthorn, greasewood, plains larkspur , death camas, wild lupine, smooth aster, prairie sedge, and cattail.The only large carnivore in the Prairies is the black bear.

The area has several species of snakes and lizards, including the plains garter snake, gopher snake, western rattlesnake, western terrestrial garter snake, short-horned lizard, and prairie skink.


Predatory fish in the Prairie waterways include northern pike, carp, and sauger. They prey on such fish as the lake whitefish, goldeye, lake chub, brassy minnow, emerald shiner and yellow perch.


Just a few of the insects are the German cockroach, boreal spittlebug, silver-spotted skipper, spring azure, American copper, monarch butterfly, mourning cloak, eastern black swallowtail, migratory grasshopper, and pallid-winged grasshopper.

Three of the mollusc species in the Prairies are the valve snail, umbilicate promenetus, and globular pea clam.

= Canadian Shield =


==The Boreal Shield==

Trees to the north are coniferous, but broadleaf trees appear further south and trees normally found in much warmer climates, such as the yellow birch and sugar maple, can be found in the south of the ecozone. Bogs and other wetlands, cover one-fifth of the land. Tree species that can be found here include the white spruce, black spruce, balsam fir, tamarac, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, white pine, red pine, jack pine, eastern white pine, red maple, mountain maple, eastern red cedar, eastern hemlock, black ash, speckled alder, pin cherry, and paper birchwhite birch.

The yellow rumped warbler, blue jay, evening grosbeak, gray jay, common nighthawk, raven, mourning dove, cardinal, wood thrush, rock ptarmigen, willow ptarmigan and white-throated sparrow are just a few of the songbirds found here. The forests hold such species as spruce grouse, ruffed grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, and the pileated woodpecker. Spring brings large flocks of waterbirds to nest and breed in the wetlands or just to feed for the rest of their migration further north. They include the common loon, sandhill cranes, hooded merganser, American black duck, wood duck, Canada goose, great blue heron, ring-necked duck, and bufflehead. Shorebirds and seabirds found off the eastern coast include the herring gull, double-crested cormorant, and Atlantic puffin, along with various murre, eider, tern and pelican species.

Yellow-spotted salamanders, blue-spotted salamanders, eastern redback salamanders, and eastern newts can be found in moist areas. The common snapping turtle and painted turtle are two of the turtle species that live in the ecozone. Two types of garter snake, the maritime garter snake and common gartern snake, as well as the redbelly snake, make their home here.

    
Predatory fish in the ecozone include the lake sturgeon, brook trout, lake trout, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, sauger, and walleye. Some of the fish that they prey upon include cisco, (lake herring), blackfin cisco, lake whitefish, rainbow smelt, lake chub, golden shiner, and yellow perch.

The valve snail, ordinary spire snail, eastern elliptio, arctic-alpine fingernail clam, and globular pea clam are just a few of the mollusc species in the Boreal Shield.

    
Insects are common in the Boreal Shield; some of the species include the German cockroach, red turpentine beetle, boreal spittlebug, spring azure, American copper, monarch butterfly, mourning cloak, and bush katydid.


==Taiga shield==

A patchwork of wetlands, forests, meadows, and shrublands covers this area. The northern edge of the ecozone is delineated by the tree line, and it is north of this that the more typical arctic tundra begins.

Trees in the Taiga Shield include black spruce, jack pine, green alder, paper birch, willow, tamarack, white spruce, balsam fir, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, white birch, and dwarf birch.

Wolves, black and grizzly bears and the lynx are the larger predators. Smaller predators include the coyote, red and arctic fox, muskrat, wolverine, weasel, mink, marten, otter, and least weasel. The smaller herbivores include the snowshoe hare, beaver, brown lemming, red-backed vole, northern red-backed vole, and red squirrel.

     
Spring migration brings a multitude of bird species through this region, including various ducks, geese, loons and swans. Some stay, but others continue north to the arctic to breed. Representative birds of prey are the osprey and bald eagle. Shorebirds and seabirds found here include northern phalarope, Bonaparte’s gull, arctic tern, greater scaup, mew gull, Characteristic waterfowl are the arctic, pacific, and red-throated loons, red-breasted merganser, and the green-winged teal.

The American copper butterfly is found here, as are the molluscs muskeg stagnicola, arctic-alpine fingernail clam, and globular pea clam. those are the animals.

= Intermountain Region =


The Canadian Intermountain is a landscape of varying elevation and climate that has resulted in a tremendous diversity of habitat types, including desert, grasslands, shrub-steppe, riparian, wetlands, dry and moist coniferous forests, and alpine tundra. Since there are enormous variations in climate and vegetation, there are many different kinds of animals, ones that can survive in dry, desert areas, others that can live in wet, rain forests and other that habituate high mountain altitudes. The alpine tundra is too harsh for trees, yet plants and animals nestle near the ground. Although harsh in climate, there are hot springs occasionally dotting the mountains. In the subalpine area, trees are small and stunted, mostly fire and cold tolerant conifers. The bent and gnarled bodies of spruce and fir trees tell the story of hard summers and harder winters near the mountain tops. There are forests of both coniferous and deciduous trees thriving in the moderate climate. Trees such as Douglas fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, yellow cedar, white spruce, lodgepole and Ponderosa pine, birch grow in great variety because of the long growing seasons and temperate climate.

The region hosts a diverse range of wildlife: over 1,500 species of native vascular plants, 373 bird species, 43 species of native freshwater fish, 29 species of amphibians and reptiles and 94 species of native terrestrial mammals. As many as 24 waterfowl species occur here, totalling an estimated 1.6 million breeding birds. The region is frequented by 198 types of landbirds, 17 waterbird species and 18 breeding shorebird species.

= Western Cordillera =


Plants in the ecozone are as varied as the landforms they grow on. Vegetation that may be common in one area are often completely absent from another. Trees in the area include Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, interior Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, western white pine, Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine, trembling aspen, western hemlock, Rocky Mountain red cedar, balsam poplar, paper birch, black spruce, white spruce, and western larch. Some of the other species found here are sagebrush, rabbitbrush, antelope-bush, mountain avens, bunchgrass, pine grass, and bluebunch wheat grass.

The large herbivores include caribou, mule deer, white-tailed deer, moose, mountain goat, California bighorn sheep, and American elk. The large carnivores are the black bear, grizzly bear, wolf, lynx, bobcat, and cougar. Some of the small herbivores here are hoary marmot, yellowbelly marmot, Columbian ground squirrel, beaver, golden-mantled squirrel, yellow pine chipmunk, redtail chipmunk, beaver, northern bog lemming, and pika. Small carnivores that are found here include coyote, red fox, marten, wolverine, muskrat, badger, marten, mink, pallid bat, and striped skunk.

Birds of prey such as northern saw-whet owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, burrowing owl, cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, northern goshawk, and turkey vulture are found here. The shorebirds and seabirds of the area include long-billed curlew, spotted sandpiper, American bittern, common snipe, killdeer, and black tern. Songbirds of the Montane Cordillera include Stellar’s jay, black-billed magpie, sage thrasher, white-throated swift, red-winged blackbird, cedar waxwing, cassin's finch, house finch, purple finch, brown creeper, and American dipper. Waterfowl that are found here include sandhill crane, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, mallard, gadwall, redhead, ring-necked duck, canvasback, and Canada goose. The birds of the forest include blue grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, spruce grouse, chukar, California quail, Lewis' woodpecker, and downy woodpecker.

Some of the characteristic frogs and toads of the area are the wood frog, spotted frog, and western toad. One of the salamander species present here is the long-toed salamander. Snakes found in the region include rubber boa, common garter snake, racer, western rattlesnake, night snake, and western terrestrial garter snake. One of the lizards found here is the western skink

Fish species that live in the ecozone include lake whitefish, chiselmouth, lake chub, peamouth, leopard dace, and redside shiner. White sturgeon and sockeye salmon both come to freshwater to spawn.

Molluscs found here include pig-toe, western-river pearl mussel, western floater, and arctic-alpine fingernail clam.

A few of the insects that live here are red turpentine beetle, boreal spittlebug, spring azure, mourning cloak, and migratory grasshopper.

= Arctic Region =


==Arctic Cordillera==

Not much can grow in the harsh conditions, where killing frosts can come at any time during the year and even soil is rare. Three-quarters of the land here is bare rock; and even lichen have a hard time to grow. Trees here are barely recognizable, always stunted versions of themselves. Plants that do grow here are usually tiny species that often grow in thick insulating mats to protect themselves from the cold or are covered in thick hairs that help to insulate and to protect them from the bitter wind.

Some of the plant species found are arctic black spruce, arctic willow, cottongrass, kobresia, moss species, wood rush, wire rush, purple saxifrage, Dryas species, sedges, Diapensia, arctic poppy, mountain avens, mountain sorrel, river beauty, moss campion, bilberry, and arctic white heather.

The conditions here are far too harsh for reptiles and amphibians to survive, and insects are also rare here.

Muskoxen and barren-ground caribou are the only large herbivores in this ecosystem, while polar bears and the arctic wolf are the only large carnivores to be found here. Smaller herbivores include the arctic hare and the collared lemming. Arctic foxes and ermines are some of the smaller carnivores found here. Marine mammals include narwhals, beluga whales, walrus, and ringed and bearded seals.

The furry-legged rock ptarmigan is a common bird in this desolate place. Characteristic birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more common shore- and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, common ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and lapland longspur. The snow goose, common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl that live here.


==Northern Arctic==

The entirety of the Northern Arctic lies above the tree line, so no full-sized tree species can be found here. Very few plant species can survive in these conditions. Plants are generally stunted and become more so to the north.

Some plants found here include purple saxifrage, mountain avens, arctic poppy, arctic willow, Dryas species, kobresia, sedges, cottongrass, moss, dwarf birch, northern Labrador tea, Vaccinium species, alder, alpine foxtail, wood rush, wire rush, moss campions, white arctic heather, arctic bladder campion, yellow oxytrope, mastodon flower, arctic lousewort, mountain sorrel, pygmy buttercup, river beauty, chickweed.

Only about twenty mammal species live here. The largest are the carnivorous polar bear, and arctic wolf and the herbivourous barren-land caribou and muskox. The smaller carnivores found here include arctic fox, ermine, and wolverine, while smaller herbivores include the snowshoe hare, arctic hare, brown lemming and collared lemming. Aquatic mammals that live in the waters off the coast include walrus, ringed seals, bearded seals, beluga, narwhal, and various other whales.


Most of the bird species migrate to the Northern Arctic in spring to mate, leaving in fall. Birds of prey that can be found in the northern arctic include gyrfalcon, rough-legged hawk, and snowy owl. Waterfowl include snow goose, brant, Canada goose, eider, oldsquaw duck, red-throated loon, arctic loon and king eider. Shorebirds and seabirds include the red phalarope, parasitic jaeger, red knot, dunlin, long-tailed jaeger, northern fulmar, glaucous gull, white-rumped sandpiper, black-bellied plover, and ruddy turnstone. Some forest birds of the ecozone are the willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, hoary redpoll, snow bunting, lapland longspur, and horned lark.


No reptiles or amphibians can survive the conditions here.


==Southern Arctic==

The southern edge of the Southern Arctic is the tree line, a transition zone north of which no full-sized trees are found. Anything north of the tree line is defined as the arctic. The low temperatures, low precipitation, and high winds in most of the ecozone encourages low plants. Stunted forms of tree species such as dwarf birch, alder, arctic willow, white spruce, black spruce, tamarack, least willow, net-veined willow and blue-green willow grow here.

Other plant species that grow in the Southern Arctic include the heath, lichen, northern Labrador tea, Dryas, sedge species, sphagnum moss, cottongrass, ericaceous shrubs, Vaccinium, fragrant shield fern, shrub birch, crowberry, bearberry, moss campion, blueberry, mountain cranberry, cloudberry, and alpine club moss.


North of the tree line, life becomes difficult for animals as well as plants. Most impressive of the animals here is the caribou and their massive migrations. Many birds also migrate, though they fly over the ecozone as much as land in it.


Larger carnivores in the Southern Arctic include the grizzly bear, black bear and polar bear as well as wolves. The most common large herbivores are barren-ground caribou, woodland caribou, moose, and muskox. Smaller carnivores, such as the red fox, arctic fox, lynx, coyote, weasels, wolverine and ermine prey on smaller herbivores, which include the arctic ground squirrel, brown lemming, showshoe hare, arctic hare masked shrew, tundra redbacked vole , and beaver. Aquatic mammals include walruses, various seals, belugas, and narwhals.


Many birds migrate here in the spring to breed, but spend the long cold winters further south. Many others pass over the Southern Arctic during their migrations to breed still further north. Four characteristic birds of prey include the snowy owl, gyrfalcon, osprey, and rough-legged hawk. Waterfowl that can be found here include Canada goose, yellow-billed loon, arctic loon, red-throated loon, tundra swan, whistling swan, snow goose, oldsquaw duck and sea ducks. Some common shorebirds and seabirds in the Southern Arctic are the semi-palmated plover, red-necked phalarope, lapland longspur, parasitic jaeger, and semi-palmated plover. Songbirds also live here, including the snow bunting, raven, American tree sparrow, and hoary redpoll. Willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan and spruce grouse are a few of the ground-dwelling birds.


This ecozone is too harsh for either reptiles or amphibians to live in.


Three species of molluscs that live in the Southern Arctic are the muskeg stagnicola, arctic-alpine fingernail clam, and globular pea clam.

*A common Operative Treatment for cholecystitis and cholelithiasis where Gallbladder(GB) is removed by surgical method.

*Commonest choices for removal of gallbladder are: 
**Making small wound/s in the abdomen:
***e.g. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
**Making comparatively big wound in the abdomen:
***e.g. Open Cholecystectomy.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;b&gt; They both have indications and contraindications.

=== Contraindication: ===
*Contraindicated if laparascopic cholecystectomy is indicated and can be performed.

=== Advantages: ===
*Better exposure during surgery
*Less risk of wound infection
*Shorter hospital stay
*Less days off work

=== Disadvantages: ===

*Larger incision is made and leaves large scar.
*Longer hospital stay
**&amp;ge; 5 days.
*Longer recovery time.
*Post-operative pain.

== PreOperative management: ==

***I.V cholangiography.

== Anaesthesia ==
*Commonly:
**Endotracheal Sedation.
(Anaesthesia will not be mentioned here.)

== Simplified steps: ==

=== Step I ===
==== Incision. ====

Types of Incision: 
*Upper Right SubCostal Incision.
*Kocher's Incision.
*Modified Kocher's Incision.
*Transverse Incision.

=== Step II ===
==== Mop placement ====
* 2 wet mops are placed.
*#One Wet Mop is placed to displace the duodenum, the transverse colon and coils of small intestine.
*#Second Wet Mop is placed slightly to the left of the &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;ommon &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;ile &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;uct (&lt;b&gt;CBD&lt;/b&gt;) to displace the stomach to the left.

=== Step III ===
(After 2 wet mop placement.)
==== Exposure of GallBladder: ====
Exposure of GallBladder is done by:
*Retraction of liver.
**Inferiror surface of the right lobe of the liver is retracted upwards by retracter.
*** e.g Deaver's retracter.

=== Step IV ===
==== Removal of &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;all&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;ladder. ====

&lt;big&gt;2 common methods for removal of GB: &lt;/big&gt;

===== Duct first method: =====
*Cystic Duct and Artery are dissected first and divided, after which &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;all&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;ladder is removed.
**Indication:
***Indicated if no presence of adhesions or exudates in CBD, CHD, CD.
**Contraindication:
***Contraindicated in the presence of adhesions or exudates in CBD, CHD, CD.
**Advantages:
***Less chance to injure:
****CBD.
****Right Heptic Artery.
**Disadvantages:

=====Fundus First method:=====
*Dissection is started from Fundus of the &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;all&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;ladder and gradually proceeded towards the Cystic Duct, which is divided last of all.
**Indication:
***Indicated in the presence of adhesions or exudates in CBD, CHD, CD.
**Contraindication:
***Contraindicated in no presence of adhesions or exudates in CBD, CHD, CD due to disadvantges.
**Advantages:
***Gallbladder can be removed in the presence of adhesions or exudates in CBD, CHD, CD.
**Disadvantages:
*** More chance to injure:
****CBD.
****Right Heptic Artery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology/Prostate:TOC}}
'''Cryotherapy (Cryosurgery)'''


==RT vs Cryotherapy==
*'''University of Calgary''' (1997-2003) -- EBRT vs Cryotherapy
**Randomized. ''Trial closed prematurely due to slowing patient accrual.'' 244 patients of 480 planned, localized prostate cancer (T2-T3N0, PSA &lt;=20 ng/ml, volume &lt;=60 ml), PLND if GS 8+. Excluded clinically bulky patients. Neoadjuvant ADT 3 or 6 months. Arm 1) EBRT (median dose 68 Gy, max 73.5 Gy) using 4F box vs Arm 2) cryoablation using argon/helium and 2 freeze/thaw cycles. Early cryotherapy failures (within 6 months) were not scored as protocol failure, and underwent salvage cryotherapy. QoL assessment. Primary endpoint was failure rate at 3 years
**'''2010''' PMID 19937954 -- &quot;A Randomized Trial of External Beam Radiotherapy Versus Cryoablation in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer&quot; (Donnelly BJ, Cancer. 2010 Jan 15;116(2):323-30. Published Online: 24 Nov 2009) Median F/U of surviving patients 8.3 years
***Outcome: 3-year failure rate (using nadir+2) cryo 17% vs. EBRT 13% (NS); 5-year rate 25% vs. 25% (NS); 7-year rate 27% vs. 32% (NS); 5-year DSS 96% vs. 96% (NS); 5-year OS 90% vs 88% (NS). Biopsy (+) cryo 8% vs EBRT 29%
***Toxicity: GI Grade 3-4 cryo 3% vs. EBRT 7%; GU Grade 3-4 cryo 9% vs. EBRT 6%; intercourse 4% vs. 26%
***Conclusion: Essentially no difference, but with long-term follow up, trend favors cryotherapy
***Editorial (Lee WR, Duke) PMID 19924796: Noninferiority design, 10% margin, concern about patients with early failure and  salvage cryotherapy with 6 months as &quot;nonfailure&quot;. Overall, cryotherapy not likely to be a lot worse than EBRT
**'''2009''' PMID 19691092 -- &quot;A randomized trial of external beam radiotherapy versus cryoablation in patients with localized prostate cancer: quality of life outcomes.&quot; (Robinson JW, Cancer. 2009 Oct 15;115(20):4695-704.)
***Outcome: Cryotherapy more acute GU dysfunction (SS), no difference in late GU dysfunction. Cryotherapy worse sexual function at 3 months (SS) and 3 years (SS)
***Conclusion: No long term QoL difference, except worse sexual function after cryoablation
**Comment: low RT dose

*'''University of Western Ontario''' -- EBRT vs cryotherapy
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped prematurely due to slow accrual.'' 64 of planned 150 patients, cT2c-T3b. Neoadjuvant ADT for 6 months. Arm 1) EBRT vs. Arm 2) cryotherapy
**'''2008''' PMID 17579613 -- &quot;Randomized trial comparing cryoablation and external beam radiotherapy for T2C-T3B prostate cancer.&quot; (Chin JL, Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 2008;11(1):40-5. Epub 2007 Jun 19.)
***Outcome: Treatment failure EBRT 45% vs. cryotherapy 64%. 4-year bPFS 47% vs. 13%. Mean bPFS 41 months vs 28 months. No difference in DSS and OS
***Toxicity: Serious complications uncommon; EBRT more frequent GI toxicity
***Conclusion: Low numbers, but cryotherapy is suboptimal primary therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer

==Cryotherapy for salvage after RT==
See [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Recurrence_after_RT#Cryotherapy]]

==Salvage RT after cryotherapy==
*'''Allegheny General (Pittsburgh)''' (1990-99)
**49 pts treated for isolated local recurrence after cryotherapy (rising PSA or positive biopsy; negative metastatic workup). 88% had high risk disease initially (PSA&gt;10,G&gt;=7,or &gt;=T2b).
**RT was 3D-CRT in 45 of 49 pts, 64.8 Gy (median dose) to the P+SV.
**PMID 11068312, '''2000''' &amp;mdash; &quot;Salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer recurrence after cryosurgical ablation.&quot; Burton S et al. Urology. 2000 Nov 1;56(5):833-8.
***Median f/u 32 m. Biochemical control in 61%; associated with higher RT dose (&gt; 64 Gy), lower pre-RT PSA. 
***No grade 3-4 acute GI or GU toxicity. 1 pt with urethral stricture. No pts with urinary incontinence.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Uniform Circular Motion==

===Speed and frequency===

[[Image:Coordonnees polaires plan.png|thumb|A two dimensional polar co-ordinate system]]

Uniform circular motion assumes that an object is moving (1) in  circular motion, and (2) at constant speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;; then

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2 \pi r }{v}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the radius of the circular path, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the time period for one revolution.

Any object travelling on a circle will return to its original starting point in the period of one revolution, ''T''. At this point the object has travelled a distance &lt;math&gt;2\pi r&lt;/math&gt;. If ''T'' is the time that it takes to travel distance 2&amp;pi;''r'' then the object's speed is

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}= 2\pi r f&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt; f = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

===Angular frequency===

Uniform circular motion can be explicitly described in terms of polar coordinates through angular frequency, ''&amp;omega;:

&lt;math&gt;\omega =  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;theta; is the angular coordinate of the object (see the diagram on the right-hand side for reference). 

Since the speed in uniform circular motion is constant, it follows that

&lt;math&gt;\omega =  \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

From that fact, a number of useful relations follow: 

&lt;math&gt;\omega = {{2 \pi} \over T} = {2 \pi f} = \frac {v} {r} &lt;/math&gt; 

The equations that relate how &amp;theta; changes with time are analogous to those of linear motion at constant speed. In particular,

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \theta_0 + \omega t \!&lt;/math&gt; 

The angle at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;, is commonly referred to as ''phase''.

===Velocity, centripetal acceleration and force===

The position of an object in a plane can be converted from polar to cartesian coordinates through the equations

&lt;math&gt;x = r \cos \theta \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = r \sin \theta \!&lt;/math&gt;

Expressing &amp;theta; as a function of time gives equations for the cartesian coordinates as a function of time in uniform circular motion:

&lt;math&gt;x = r \cos (\theta_0 + \omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = r \sin (\theta_0 + \omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiation with respect to time gives the components of the velocity vector:

&lt;math&gt;v_x = \omega r (-\sin (\omega t)) = -v \sin (\omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_y = \omega r \cos (\omega t) = v \cos (\omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

Velocity in circular motion is a vector tangential to the trajectory of the object. Furthermore, even though the speed is constant the velocity vector changes direction over time. Further differentiation leads to the components of the acceleration (which are just the rate of change of the velocity components): &lt;!--TODO : this section needs more diagram goodies--&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_x = - \omega ^2 r \cos (\omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_y = - \omega ^2 r \sin (\omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

The acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity and oriented towards the centre of the circular trajectory. For that reason, acceleration in circular motion is referred to as ''centripetal acceleration''.

The absolute value of centripetal acceleration may be readily obtained by

&lt;math&gt;a_{cp} = \sqrt{a_x ^2 + a_y ^ 2} = \sqrt{(\omega ^2 r)^2 (\cos^2 (\omega t) + \sin^2 (\omega t))} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_{cp} = \omega ^2 r = \frac{v^2}{r} &lt;/math&gt;
  
For centripetal acceleration, and therefore circular motion, to be maintained a ''centripetal force'' must act on the object. From Newton's Second Law it follows directly that the force will be given by

&lt;math&gt;\vec{F_{cp}} = m \vec{a_{cp}}&lt;/math&gt;

the components being

&lt;math&gt;F_x = - m \omega ^2 r \cos (\omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_y = - m \omega ^2 r \sin (\omega t) \!&lt;/math&gt;

and the absolute value

&lt;math&gt;F_{cp} = m \omega ^2 r = m \frac{v^2}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the mundane things are the most painful. However, it doesn't have to be that way because of evolved, user-friendly templates. Thankfully, LaTeX allows for very quick letter writing, with little hassle.

==The letter class==
To write letters use the standard document class ''letter''.

You can write multiple letters in one LaTeX file - start each one with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{letter}{''recipient''}&lt;!----&gt;}} and end with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{letter}&lt;!----&gt;}}. You can leave ''recipient'' blank. Each letter consists of four parts.
# Opening (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\opening{Dear Kate,}&lt;!----&gt;}}).
# Main body (written as usual in LaTeX).
# Closing (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\closing{Yours sincerely,}&lt;!----&gt;}}).
#: LaTeX will leave some space after closing for your hand-written signature; then it will put your name and surname, if you have declared them.
# Additional elements: post scripta, carbon copy and list of enclosures.

If you want your name, address and telephone number to appear in the letter, you have to declare them first signature, address and telephone.

The output letter will look like this:

To move the closing and signature parts to the left, insert the following before \begin{document}:

{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\longindentation=0pt&lt;!----&gt;}}

The amount of space to the left can be adjusted by increasing the 0pt.

==Envelopes==
===Using the {{LaTeX/Package|envlab}} package===
The {{LaTeX/Package|envlab}} package provides customization to the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\makelabels&lt;!----&gt;}} command, allowing the user to print on any of an assortment of labels or envelope sizes.  For example, beginning your LaTeX file the following way produces a document which includes the letter and a business-size (#10) envelope on the following page.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{letter}
\usepackage[businessenvelope]{envlab}
\makelabels
}}

Refer to the [http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/envlab/elguide.pdf &lt;tt&gt;envlab&lt;/tt&gt; user guide] for more information about this capable package. Note that the {{LaTeX/Package|envlab}} package has issues displaying characters outside the base ASCII character set, see [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=547978 this bug report] for more information.

===Using the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package===
Here is a relatively simple envelope which uses the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package which is used because it vastly simplifies the task of rearranging things on the page (and the page itself).

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
% envelope.tex
\documentclass{letter}
\usepackage[left=1in,top=0.15in,papersize={4.125in,9.5in},landscape,twoside=false]{geometry}
\setlength\parskip{0pt}
\pagestyle{empty}

\begin{document}

FROM-NAME

FROM-STREET ADDRESS

FROM-CITY, STATE, \ ZIP

\vspace{1.0in}\large
\setlength\parindent{3.6in}

TO-NAME

TO-STREET ADDRESS

TO-CITY, STATE, \ ZIP

\end{document}
}}

[[Image:Envelope.jpg|none|100px|frame|A sample envelope to be printed in landscape mode.]]

===Printing===
The above will certainly take care of the spacing but the actual printing is between you and your printer.  One user reports that printing envelopes created with {{LaTeX/Package|envlab}} is relatively painless.  If you use the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package, you may find the following commands useful for printing the envelope.

 $ pdflatex envelope.tex
 $ pdf2ps envelope.pdf
 $ lpr -o landscape envelope.ps

Alternatively, you can use the latex dvi output driver.

In the first line, dvips command converts the .dvi file produced by latex into a .ps (PostScript) file. In the second line, the PostScript file is sent to the printer. 
 $ latex envelope.tex &amp;&amp; dvips -t unknown -T 9.5in,4.125in envelope.dvi
 $ lpr -o landscape envelope.ps

It is reported that &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; creates the right page size but not &lt;tt&gt;dvips&lt;/tt&gt; despite what it says in the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} manual. It will never work though unless your printer settings are adjusted to the correct page style. These settings depend on the printer filter you are using and in CUPS might be available on the &lt;tt&gt;lpr&lt;/tt&gt; command line.

==Windowed envelopes==
An alternative to separately printing addresses on envelopes is to use the letter class from the KOMA package.  It supports additional features like folding marks and the correct address placement for windowed envelopes.  Using the {{LaTeX/Environment|scrlttr2}} document class from the KOMA package the example letter code is:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
% koma_env.tex
\documentclass[a4paper]{scrlttr2}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{url}


\setkomavar{fromname}{Joe Bloggs}
\setkomavar{fromaddress}{21 Bridge Street \\ Smallville \\ Dunwich DU3 4WE}
\setkomavar{fromphone}{0123 45679}

\begin{document}

\begin{letter}{Director \\ Doe \&amp; Co \\ 35 Anthony Road
\\ Newport \\ Ipswich IP3 5RT}

\KOMAoptions{fromphone=true,fromfax=false}
\setkomavar{subject}{Wikipedia}
\setkomavar{customer}{2342}
\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am writing to you on behalf of the Wikipedia project
(\url{http://www.wikipedia.org/}), an endeavour to build a
fully-fledged multilingual encyclopaedia in an entirely open
manner, to ask for permission to use your copyrighted material.

\ldots 
 
That said, allow me to reiterate that your material will be used
to the noble end of providing a free collection of knowledge for
everyone; naturally enough, only if you agree. If that is the
case, could you kindly fill in the attached form and post it back
to me? We shall greatly appreciate it.

The output is generated via
 $ pdflatex koma_env

[[Image:Koma_env.png|none|150px|frame|A sample letter with folding marks ready for standardized windowed envelopes.]]

Folding the print of the resulting file koma_env.pdf according the folding marks it can be placed into standardized windowed envelopes DIN C6/5, DL, C4, C5 or C6.

In addition to the default, the KOMA-package includes predefined format definitions for different standardized Swiss and Japanese letter formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:50, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

==Also ==
Do you want me to delete the mispelt one (talk &amp; user page).  If you are going to use this account it may be best if I block the misnamed one so that the confusion doesn't arise again?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adobe Media Player  ==
Adobe Systems Inc. has released its new Adobe Media Player and has double use across the techy world. It allows users to playback video content when either online or offline. A preview example of the new player was at the NAB 2007 show, exhibitors were able to witness how the newest media player gives more personal video experiences to users while offering content publishers new abilities &quot;to distribute, track, and build businesses around their media assets.&quot; The unveiling of Adobe’s Media Player and its offline multimedia playback versatility has seen amazing reviews by analists and system administrators as technologocal breakthrough, especially since no media players (read: Windows Media Player, Apple Quicktime, and RealPlayer) currently allow for user download, and integration between playback systems. Control is something that media companies desire the most. They are even leery about the release on the web. 
Adobe Media Player users will be able download it for free, thus gaining access to enhanced Flash playback, download and view content offline, full-screen resolution, viewer ratings and favorite feature that downloads the newest episodes of a user’s favorite Television shows or even podcasts. It will also be able to give users the ability to use the Web’s most popular video formats without browser limitations. Major  technological deals are expected in the following months. The beta download of Adobe’s Media Player is scheduled later this year. A free download will come before the close of 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Video Encoding==

This is the key point of Internet distribution. Once your positive content is encoded it can be copied and distributed all over the world without limits. You can be the person to set that video free! We look at how to use a Mac and Micro$oft to encode Video for the Internet and DVD's using Free Software. If someone wants to bring a linux computer that can capture Video, get in contact, and we can have a go at that too afterwards. This is a key workshop for putting video online in any format even youtube!

==Setup==

Minimum - One Windows PC; One Mac with OSX 10.3.9 or later; Camera for capturing.

==Intro == 
Look at You Tube, and Archive.org and Democracy player. 

Different ways of encoding Video: 

* For immediate viewing [ aka streaming ] - see You Tube
* For download. This can be used for screening from a laptop, putting onto DVD, or as a podcast. - See Archive.org and Democrasy player

Demo Democrasy Player and the Democrasy Now programme. The story behind the station and the technology used for podcasting. 

== Capturing Video, Converting from a DVD or File,  or Exporting from a Video project ==

There are 3 main ways you will probably have video that needs encoding

* On a tape: You will need to &quot;capture&quot; the file to the computer's hard disk
* On a DVD or digital file - you will need to convert it to a suitable file format to put up online
* As a video project you are editing, you'll have to export the file from the Video editing program.

===From Tape=== 

====Aims and background info==== 

To capture video from a video tape to a hard disk. Normally this would be as a DV file. &quot;DV&quot; stands for ''Digital Video'', and is a way of compressing the video into a file. DV files are high quality and very large, taking up a lot of room on your hard drive. They are normally used for editing. We are going to use them as a source file for video encoding. It is best if the original file is as high quality and as compatible as possible. DV files are both high quality and very compatible. 

On PCs, DV files are usually &quot;avi&quot; files which have a &quot;.avi&quot; extension. 
On Macs, DV files are usually &quot;mov&quot; files, with a &quot;.mov&quot; extension (and sometimes a &quot;.dv&quot; extension).

==== Windows Capturing and saving as DV  file from tape / Premiere Project ====

Free Software - Stoik Video Capture 
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Stoik_Video_Capture - Download Stoik 

Premiere Pro [paying software]

Saving as a DV avi 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Video_producion/save_dvavi_from_premiere_pro

==== Capturing from tape / Saving to Dv file Mac==== 

You would normally do this with iMovie or Final Cut Pro
More detailed help with screenshots to come

==== Saving to Dv file Mac from Final Cut Pro==== 

This guide is aimed at those using PAL Video. As such you should have Default PAL setting for your FCP project. 

To set this up: 
File &gt; Audio / Video Settings &gt; 

Your Sequence Preset should be DV PAL 48 kHz
And Capture Preset should also be DV PAL 48 kHz

Then when you export your project, the default settings will be correct. 

File &gt; Export &gt; Quicktime movie 

Give the file a .mov extension

===Encoding Video for the Internet from a file=== 



==== Summary and Background Info ====

There are many formats in which you may wish to make your video available. For this lesson we are going to concentrate on two types: 

* flv - flash compatible format for streaming
* xvid / mpg4 / mpeg for preview/ full screen sharing

We assume that you have a DV file of the video you want to encode. If not, look elsewhere on this page for how to create a DV file from Tape or your video project.

==== Windows  Encoding with Super ====

Where to download and help / guides 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Video#SuPer_-_Free_Software_encoder

==== Using FFmpegx to change a DV file to mp4 or flv==== 

We are going to create a flv file and a mp4 file from the DV .mov file exported from FCP

There are guides for using ffmpegx here 

http://web.archive.org/20030604081134/homepage.mac.com/major4/

More to come...

===Encoding from a DVD=== 

====Aims and background info==== 

Encoding a file ready for the internet from a dvd used to be so much hard work. There were about 4 different programs needed to do it.  Now the process is getting easier with some tools that use free software command line tools and give you one front end [gui] to make using them easier.  

For this lesson we are going to make a xvid in Gordian Knot and an mp4 in Handbrake. These are aimed at creating a file of screening quality.

==== Mac: Handbrake ====

Although there is a newer version these help files concentrate on Handbrake 0.7 as it can be used by more operating systems i.e. 10.3.9 and up. 

Download Handbrake 0.7.1 : http://handbrake.m0k.org/?page_id=8

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The NAB Experience ==
Here is a place where students can comment on the NAB experience they had in the Spring of 2007.


== Jonathan's Reflections ==
Well, I have had a few days to think about and process all of the amazing content we as a class got to experience at the NAB conference in Las Vegas. It was in one word, breathtaking. As you walked into the doors of the conference, it was a smack in the face of all media companies, tools, systems, and software that you could imagine. If there was one word that could describe the goal of many of the companies there it would be integration. Everything was adaptable to different software and worked parallel with that software. It was almost overwhelming. Much of the innovations started in the software category. Something quite amazing was a new plug in for the Final Cut Studio 3 called color. It made color correction a thing of the past, now you can virtually paint on your work and make it crisp and clear. As far as equipment goes, the newest and well simply worldchanging piece of equimpment was the Red Camera. It records digital footage in 4k lines of resolution. And the most impressive thing about it is its price. starting at under $20,000, it's affordable! Peter Jackson shot a short film with it; using it only for 2 days of shooting. I had the opportunity to view the film, and the picture quality is the best I have ever seen. Another important aspect of the camera is the digitizing stage. Recording in what they call Raw Red. The compression for the footage is remarkable. I got to see the newest technologies and experience something that I will never forget. I am definitely going back.



== Alyssa's Reflections ==
The NAB is a multi-media experience like nothing else in the world.  It is where all the best in the business get together for one week and show their latest and greatest technologies.  I was amazed at all the knowledge in one place. The learning experience is unlike anything I could have ever got in school.  I learned more in four days than I could of in four weeks of class at school.  I went from booth to booth talking to the experts about their specialty in multi-media. My favorite booth was the Adobe booth.  One Adobe design expert took 45 minutes and showed me how all their new Adobe suite CS3 is all integrated together.  He explained it in such an easy fashion, I learned stuff about programs that I even have on my computer, which I never knew about.  Even when I went to a booth about surge protectors, the guy that worked there explained to me why surge protectors are needed and how they work.  The people at the booths, for the most part, were so nice and explained their equipment very thoroughly. On Tuesday for lunch we shared a table with two guys from the Panasonic booths and they shared with us what they did.  One of the guys was an independent film producer from LA and the other was a commercial producer from Phoenix.  Where else do you get to sit down and talk with film producers from LA, then the NAB?  On Wednesday for lunch we sat with three guys that run their own equipment rental company out of Atlanta, and they shared with us some of their expertise. So, despite the horrible perversion that Las Vegas represents, the show itself was a very worthwhile experience.  I learned so much about multi-media and got to meet so many cool people.

'''The shapes of molecules''' is the title of Section 3.3 in ''Chemical Ideas'' and it covers the topic of '''molecular geometry'''.

== Introductory examples ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Water molecule ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Water-2D-dot-cross.png|&lt;center&gt;dot-cross diagram&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Water-2D-flat.png|&lt;center&gt;bond-line diagram&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Water-with-lone-pairs-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;ball-and-stick model with lone pairs displayed&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Water-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;ball-and-stick model without lone pairs displayed&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Hydrogen fluoride molecule ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Hydrogen-fluoride-2D-dot-cross.png|&lt;center&gt;dot-cross diagram&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Hydrogen-fluoride-2D-flat.png|&lt;center&gt;bond-line diagram&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Hydrogen-fluoride-with-lone-pairs-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;ball-and-stick model with lone pairs displayed&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Hydrogen-fluoride-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;ball-and-stick model without lone pairs displayed&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Polyhedra ==
=== Tetrahedra ===
You have probably come across tetrahedra before in maths, although you most likely called them triangle-based pyramids. Tetrahedra have four vertices (corners), four faces and six edges.  Each face is an equilateral triangle.

The tetrahedron is one of the most important shapes in chemistry because a very great many molecules contain them. Tetrahedral molecules don't actually contain little pyramids.  What they do contain is a central atom bonded to four other atoms.  The four atoms surrounding the central atom occupy positions that you can imagine as the vertices of a tetrahedron.

In the image gallery below, the central atom is coloured magenta and the surrounding atoms are coloured white.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tetrahedron-1-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;a tetrahedral molecule&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Tetrahedron-2-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;to see the tetrahedron, connect the surrounding atoms with lines&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Tetrahedron-3-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;the lines form the edges of the tetrahedron&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Tetrahedron-4-3D-balls.png
Image:Tetrahedral-angle-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;tetrahedral angle ≈ 109.5°&lt;/center&gt;
Image:AX4E0-2D.png|&lt;center&gt;chemists represent tetrahedra using hashed and wedged bonds&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Methane-2D-small.png|&lt;center&gt;this is how chemists represent methane&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Methane-2D-flat-small.png|&lt;center&gt;this 'flat' representation - GCSE-style - is simpler but less realistic&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The angle between any two bonds in a tetrahedral molecule is approximately 109.5°.  The tetrahedral angle can be calculated  as accurately as required because it is equal to cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(–⅓).

=== Octahedra ===
You may or may not have met an octahedron before. Octahedra have six vertices (corners), eight faces and twelve edges.  Each face is an equilateral triangle.

Octahedra are very important in chemistry because many [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Complexes|transition metal-based molecules]] are octahedral.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Octahedron-1-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;an octahedral molecule&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Octahedron-2-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;to see the octahedron, connect the surrounding atoms with lines&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Octahedron-3-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;the lines form the edges of the octahedron&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Octahedron-4-3D-balls.png
Image:Octahedral-angle-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;octahedral angle = 90° exactly&lt;/center&gt;
Image:AX6E0-2D.png|&lt;center&gt;chemists represent octahedra using hashed and wedged bonds&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sulfur-hexafluoride-2D-small.png|&lt;center&gt;this is how chemists represent sulfur hexafluoride, SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sulfur-hexafluoride-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;a ball-and-stick model of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Image:Ammonium-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;tetrahedral:&lt;br&gt;[[w:ammonium|ammonium]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Molecular geometry and lone pairs ==
You can use the so-called ''AXE method'' to calculate the shape of a molecule.  It is based on molecules that have a central atom, which we label A.  Atoms or groups bonded to A are labelled X.  Lone pairs are labelled E.  A molecule with three lone pairs and two atoms/groups bonded to it would be denoted AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  The table below shows how X and E and molecular shape are related.

Valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR) is used to predict the shape of a molecule once X and E are known. This sounds more complicated than it is.  You consider any X's and E's to be regions of charge that position themselves as far apart from each other as possible, in order to minimize the forces of electrostatic repulsion between each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''complex''' is a compound in which a central metal atom is surrounded ligands that form dative covalent bonds with it.  Complexes are discussed in ''Chemical Ideas'' Section 11.6: ''The d block: complex formation''.

== Why are transition metal complexes usually coloured? ==
You might like to look at [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Spectroscopy|the spectroscopy page]] to remind yourself of how and why light interacts with electrons in molecules. You could also have a look at [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Atomic orbitals|the atomic orbitals page]] to see what shape d orbitals are.

=== Partially-filled d orbitals split by ligands ===
In a nutshell, transition metal complexes are coloured because their central transition metal atoms have a '''partially-filled d subshell''' that is '''split''' by the surrounding '''ligands'''. ''Partially-filled'' means at least one d orbital is half-filled or empty '''and''' at least one d orbital is half-filled or full, i.e. that the d subshell contains between 1 and 9 electrons. ''Split'' means that the within the d subshell, there are now different energy levels, whereas without the ligands, the five d orbitals that make up the d subshell all have the same energy.

==== This is really a university-level topic ====
For the purpose of exams, students of Salters A-Level Chemistry are not required to understand how or why ligands cause the d subshell to split, just that it happens. Students who go on to study chemistry at university will learn about the interactions between metal atoms and ion with ligands in much greater detail, where they will encounter [[Wikipedia:Crystal field theory|crystal field theory]] (electrostatic effects of ligands on d orbitals) and [[Wikipedia:Ligand field theory|ligand field theory]] (covalent bonding of ligands to metal atoms and ions).

==== Ligands split d orbitals ====
[[Image:Electron-config-d0.png|thumb|200px|right|Without ligands, all five d orbitals have equal energy.]]
A complex needs ligands to be coloured. Without ligands, all five d orbitals are equal in energy (''degenerate'' is a word often used here — it simply means ''of the same energy''). When ligands are present, some of the d orbitals become higher in energy than before, and some become lower. This happens because some of the d orbitals are nearer the ligands than others so they experience more repulsion from the ligand electrons and thus have a higher energy.

==== An empty d shell cannot absorb visible photons ====
[[Image:D-orbital-split-octahedral-empty-2D-wide.png|thumb|200px|right|Empty d shells have no electrons to absorb photons]]
A coloured complex needs partially-filled d orbitals.  Empty d orbitals cannot produce colour because they lack electrons.  Electrons are needed to move from a lower-energy d orbital to a higher-energy d-orbital by absorbing a photon of visible light. Complexes of Sc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; are colourless because Sc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (electron configuration: [Ar]3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) has empty d orbitals.

The same is also true of all elements that come before Ti in the periodic table — none of these have any electrons in their d orbitals. For instance, K has d orbitals but they are unoccupied and as such, complexes of K cannot absorb photons promoting a d electron from a d orbital to a higher energy one, since K doesn't have any d electrons.

==== A full d shell cannot absorb visible photons ====
[[Image:D-orbital-split-octahedral-full-2D-wide.png|thumb|200px|right|If all d orbitals are full, d electrons have nowhere to go once they gain energy.]]
If a complex has an empty d shell, there are no electrons to move.  If a complex has a full d shell, there are no vacancies in any d orbitals for an electron to move into. Complexes of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (electron configuration: [Ar]3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) are colourless because the d orbitals of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are full.

=== How do ligands split d orbitals? ===
We noted above that the presence of ligands around a transition metal atom or ion splits the five d orbitals into two groups, one group higher in energy and one group lower in energy than they were before the ligands arrived. ''Chemical Ideas'' p. 271 offers a short and sweet explanation which is ideal for revision and exams. This section attempts to present a deeper explanation. It is more detailed than the ''Salters Advanced Chemistry'' specification requires, but this may be exactly what you want to know if you're interested.

==== Ligand electrons repel d electrons ====
Ligands have lone pairs of electrons that they use to bond to transition metal atoms or ions. The presence of these ligand electrons repels the transition metal's electrons in its d orbitals. The metal d electrons can't go anywhere to avoid the repulsion, so the only effect is that their energy increases.

==== Ligands affect different d orbitals differently ====
Ligands do not affect each of the five d orbitals to the same extent. A d orbital that brings its electrons close to the ligands will increase a great deal in energy.  A d orbital occupies space away from the ligands will increase in energy a little, but not as much. As you can probably imagine, the exact positioning of the ligands determines which d orbitals they will affect the most.

==== Splitting in octahedral complexes ====
[[Image:D-orbital-split-octahedral-2D.png|thumb|right|200px|In an octahedral complex, two d orbitals become higher in energy and three become lower in energy. The two higher-energy d orbitals are given the label e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and the three lower-energy d orbitals are labelled  t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

In an octahedral complex, the d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are increased in energy the most.  We refer to the d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals collectively as the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; d orbitals.

The images below illustrate the orbitals d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt; (left) and d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; (right) and their positioning within an octahedral complex. The central transition metal atom or ion is grey, the six ligands are red and the orbitals are yellow.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ML6-3dz2-3D-phaseless.png|200px]] [[Image:ML6-3dx2-y2-3D-phaseless.png|200px]]&lt;/center&gt;

Let us continue to consider an octahedral complex. The remaining d orbitals, d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; see their energy increase to a lesser extent.  We refer to the d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals collectively as the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; d orbitals.

The images below illustrate these three orbitals in relation to the central metal atom and ligands in an octahedral complex. Compare these images of the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals with those of the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; above. You may be able to see that the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are, on average, further away from the ligands than the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals. This is the reason for splitting.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ML6-3dxy-3D-phaseless.png|200px]] [[Image:ML6-3dxz-3D-phaseless.png|200px]] [[Image:ML6-3dyz-3D-phaseless.png|200px]]&lt;/center&gt;

==== Splitting in tetrahedral complexes ====
[[Image:D-orbital-split-tetrahedral-2D.png|thumb|right|200px|In a tetrahedral complex, three d orbitals increase in energy while two decrease. The three higher-energy d orbitals are given the label t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the two lower-energy d orbitals are labelled e. This is the opposite order of energy to that found in octahedral complexes.]]

In a tetrahedral complex, the d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are increased in energy the most.  We refer to the d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals collectively as the t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; d orbitals.

The remaining d orbitals, d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt;, see their energy increase to a lesser extent.  We refer to the d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals collectively as the e d orbitals.

=== Don't worry about e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; ===
You don't need to know the labels e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; for exams and you certainly don't need to worry about where they came from — it's a long and pointless story! If you like pointless stories, here's a taster: some mathematicians came up with e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; when they invented [[w:group theory|group theory]].  Some mathematically-minded chemists later borrowed the labels and the theory to describe aspects of [[w:molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry]].

== Cyclic compounds and intramolecular reactions ==
Exam questions often ask you to identify a functional group that forms part of a ring. Here are some examples:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:GBL chemical structure.png|&lt;center&gt;This compound contains an ester group that is part of a ring. Cyclic esters are called lactones.&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Lactams.png|&lt;center&gt;Here are some simple cyclic amides.  Cyclic amides are called lactams.&lt;/center&gt;
Image:2-azetidinone-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;Amides in four-membered rings are called beta-lactams or β-lactams. All penicillins contain a β-lactam ring.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

If a cyclic compound contains a ring with less than six members (i.e. three, four or five membered rings), the ring will be under '''strain''' and functional groups that make up part of the ring will often be much more reactive than they would in a straight-chain compound.  For example, amides are normally very unreactive, but the amide group in a β-lactam ring is relatively easily hydrolysed because the four-membered ring is very strained and hydrolysis converts the ring to a straight chain, relieving the strain.

Cyclic compounds are often formed by '''intramolecular reactions''', meaning reactions in which different parts of the same molecule react with each other.

For instance, if a molecule contains both an alcohol part (hydroxyl group) and a carboxylic acid part (carboxyl group), the two groups can react to form an ester.  The reaction is identical in all respects to normal esterification (acid + alcohol → ester + water), except that the acid and alcohol are not two separate molecules but two different ends of the same molecule.

Intramolecular reactions are usually much faster than intermolecular reactions, because the reacting groups are tethered together and are thus much more likely to collide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

== Form Factors ==

[[Image:Sharp LH0080A.jpg|thumb|right|A Sharp Z80 microprocessor, with a Dual-Inline Package (DIP) with 40 pins.]]

A matter that is peripheral to the subject of microprocessor design, but not wholely unrelated is the subject of form factors, sockets, and interfacing. When it comes to microprocessors and microcontrollers there is no standard size or shape, no standard connectors, etc. An Intel Pentium chip cannot plug into the same socket as an AMD Athalon chip, even though they are both IA32 chips, and both of them can run the same software. The size, shape, number of connectors and orientation of the connectors are known collectively as the '''form factor''' of the chip. Each separate form factor requires a specific interface for the chip to connect to called a '''socket'''.

== Connectors ==

== Sockets ==

== How to donate a dvd formatted lecture series on undergraduate calculus? ==
I would like to donate A video taped lecture series on Calculus which have been converted to dvd format.  How do I go about doing this?  The lecturer is willing to send the dvds to an appropriate uploader, but does not know much about computer programming himself.  The lectures were taped at The University of Missouri - Kansas City.

Please send any information you have to:     micheleforan@sbcglobal.net

Thankyou

:This is a hugely generous offer.  The problem we face at the moment is where to put such content, as the disk server storage costs alone are going to be significant.  Still, there may be some significant support for this sort of content.

:It should also be noted that Wikimedia projects generally try to avoid having MPEG content, mainly because of licensing restrictions by the MPEG Licensing Authority that would require us to charge a fee for placing the content on our servers that would have to be paid per user that accesses the content.  There are volunteers, however, that would very much be willing to convert the video content to other formats that have a more open license structure compatable with Wikimedia projects, so it isn't as big of a deal as it may seem.

:I'm going to make some enquiries on your behalf and see what we can do with an offer like this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:18, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== ==effect of impurities on boiling point of water== ==
hi I am Anne D'souza. Iam doing a chemistry project on the effect of impurities on the boiling point of water.I have cariied out the experiment using various quantities of sugar in the same amount of water.Besides explaining the colligative property of elevation of boiling point,i need additional information.Can anyone please help me out?

== Adding a Book to a Bookshelf ==

'''How do I add my book to a bookshelf?'''
The instructions are not at all clear.  Saying &quot;be sure to add your book to a bookshelf&quot; is not helpful if one is not told how to do it.  I have started a book called [[American Literature]], and I tried to place it in the Language and Literature bookshelf, but I could see no way to add it to the list of books there.  Ugh!!!!!

== Embedding an Image from Commons ==

Okay, I have followed the instructions to a T.  I even cut and paste the command straight from a Wikipedia article, and I just could not get an image onto my textbook page.  I have spent way too long, trying and retrying and researching this problem.  [[User:Logophile|Logophile]] 08:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:Support for images from Commons has sometimes been problematic in the past, however it should be fairly straight forward at the moment.  I have included an example here on how to accomplish this using an image from Commons right here in this reply, which I hope you can copy.

== Full solutions to Calculus problems ==

I was wondering if there would be a interest in uploading fully worked out solutions to Calculus I &amp; II problems similar to some of the problems found in Schaum's or REA problem solvers? I've put together about 100 problems in MS Word on Integration techniques showing detailed step by step methods to solve them.  

Formatting them into Wikibook pages would require a fair amount of work but I don't think it would be impossible.

Before I got started though I'd like to know what people's thoughts are about this.  Would this justify a new text book or should they be a extension of the existing Calculus textbook?  Each of these solutions take up about a 1/2 to a full page in MS word so by uploading and formatting the lot of them it could easily fill up a couple hundred screens worth of content.

: This sounds like a nice idea. However, we can only allow it if the steps shown in the book are by you (and not a book you bought) and you're releasing them under the GFDL. I've seen answer books here before, (either wikiversity or wikibooks seems fine for them) so I'd say putting it here is fine. I wouldn't mind putting in some work on this, I know how to do LaTeX formatting (a markup which makes it very easy to typeset mathematical problems. If you're still here, just respond and publicly say that you'll license them out under the GFDL, and I'll give you my e-mail. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 19:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

==Is a list of Nepal postal codes appropriate here?==
Some editor at Wikipedia has typed in [[Wikipedia:List of postal codes in Nepal]]. I checked, and it's very difficult to find this on the web -- perhaps impossible unless your computer is set to whatever alphabet they use in Nepal. The article doesn't fit in Wikipedia and there's a deletion discussion going on now. Would Wikibooks be a proper spot for it? If you allow it in, you'll likely be getting others. If it were easy to find on the Web, I'd just want to delete it, but my heart goes out to all those letter writers and package senders distraught over not having the proper Nepalese postal code on their mail to Nepal. Can we not assist these needy people? I've asked over at Wikisource and it doesn't fit over there. [[User:Noroton|Noroton]] 23:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, I just dont think that this fits here either. It certainly is admirable, but it doesnt qualify as textbook material. If we had a book on Nepalese geopolitical areas, this might make an acceptable appendix or something, but we dont have a book like that. Unfortunately, i think this is going to be deleted until the WMF creates a &quot;wikigeography&quot; or something. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:51, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''condensation reaction''' is a reaction in which two molecules combine to form one molecule, eliminating a small molecule, such as HCl or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, in the process.

== Peptide bond formation ==
Two amino acids can react with one another to form a dipeptide, linked by a ''peptide bond''.  A peptide bond is nothing more than a secondary amide functional group linking two amino acid ''residues''.  A water molecule is eliminated as a result.

In the illustrations below, two glycine molecules undergo condensation to form GlyGly (''glycylglycine'' or ''2-(2-aminoethanamido)ethanoic acid''), expelling a water molecule.

'''Dame's Rocket''', also known as Damask Violet, Dame's Violet, Dames-wort, Dame's Gilliflower, Night Scented Gilliflower, Queen's Gilliflower, Rogue's Gilliflower, Summer Lilac, Sweet Rocket, Mother-of-the-evening and, Winter Gilliflower (''Hesperis matronalis'') is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the mustard family, Brassicaceae. A native of Eurasia and cultivated as a traditional garden plant elsewhere, Dame's Rocket was brought to North America in the 1600s and has since become naturalized there; it is considered an invasive species in some areas.

==Description==
The plant is often confused with look-alike native phlox species in North America, but the former can be easily identified by its alternate (rather than opposite), toothed lanceolate leaves (5-15 centimetres in length, larger towards the base of the plant) and showy flowers, which have four rather than a phlox's five petals.

Reaching a maximum height of one metre (3 feet), Dame's Rocket shoots up quickly in spring and enters full bloom by May. The plentiful flowers, in elongate clusters atop strong hairy stalks, are large (2 cm) and vary in colour from white to lavender purple, some being a variegated intermediate between the two. A double-flowered variety is known. The flowers are also highly fragrant; the genus name ''Hesperis'' is Greek for evening, a reference to this plant's sweet aroma becoming evermore conspicuous towards evening.

The blooming season may last until August, but exceptionally warm weather can hasten the blooms' passing. Seeds are produced in long (5-10 centimetres) pods containing two rows of seeds separated by a dimple.

==Growing Conditions==
Moist soil with good drainage in full sun to partial shade is preferred, but the plants are undemanding and will quickly crowd out native wildflower species if given the chance to become established. Extensive monotypic stands of Dame's Rocket are visible at great distances.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Ecology==
The successful spread of Dame's Rocket in North America has been attributed to its prolific seed production and because its seeds are often included in prepackaged &quot;wildflower seed&quot; assortments. Although the plants typically produce only a low-lying rosette their first year, in subsequent years blooming and seed production occurs in tandem throughout the blooming season. The plants are most commonly seen in roadside ditches, dumps and in open woodland settings. Dame's Rocket does however make for an attractive, hardy garden plant and probably does not pose a threat in urban settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of Structural methods==
The initial pargraph makes it sound as if no model building work was done at all in the early 80's due to a lack of computing power.  That's misleading.  It was just much more expensive, less automated and at a less advanced stage.  Evans and Sutherland's machines were being used for enzyme models and to guide choices in synthesis of variant inhibitors.  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 11:22, 31 October 2010 (UTC)

==Enzyme Target?==
The following phrase needs to be changed:  sildenafil citrate (Viagra), which targets the catalytic subunit of NADPH (Jeremy); 

NADPH is a small molecule that provides reductive power for synthetic processes. What is the exact enzyme targeted by viagra?</text>

'''Television picture tubes (CRTs)''': black and white components, manufacturing steps, uses, and detailed description/instructions of how to process the cathode ray tube (CRT).

==Components of the picture tube (CRT)==

* '''Glass bulb'''; also known as  ''bulb'',  ''tube'', or  ''CRT''
* '''Electron gun''', with associated components  &lt;small&gt;''see'' [[Television Manufacture and Repair#Electron gun|'''Electron gun''']] ''below''&lt;/small&gt;.
* '''Phosphor coating'''
* '''Liquid paint,''' inside conductive coating; also known as Aguadag or Dixonac
* '''Bakelite base''' (plastic)
* '''Spray''', outside conductive coating

==Electron gun==

;Parts of an ''electrostatic focus electron gun'' (in order of sequence)

#'''Glass Wafer''' with encapsulated wires, for external/internal access to the gun proper. The internal connections consist of thick, stiff wires attached to supporting glass, and 2 or 3 rods (depending on gun type), which hold the gun components rigidly in place (vital). Other stiff wires supply a base for connections to the components. For external use (NOT under vacuum), soft copper wires are extended from the bottom of the ''glass wafer'' (to which a Bakelite base will be attached in a later operation). This base will provide easy '''electrical access''' from the chassis to the elements of the gun. 
 
Filament''', a wound tungsten element (much like an element in a light bulb) coated with an electrical, non-conductive coating. The filament produces more than 1,472 Degrees F of heat at 6.3 Volts,  @ 600  Milliamps. For proper conversion/activation of the coating, increased voltages are necessary as high as 13 1/2 volts. The coating resides atop the cathode cylinder, whereas the filament resides ''inside'' the same cathode cylinder electrode. This initiates a process called &quot;thermionic emission&quot;, which releases many electrons and ions in a cloud-like form. These particles are then propelled by applied voltages (voltage differential), through the 1st grid aperture, and thereby accelerated by, and through. the 2nd grid aperture. The beam is then formed, directed and focused, by other associated elements inherent in the electron gun (See the following additional components:

#'''Cathode Cylinder,''' hollow metal electrode which is enclosed in the G 1 structure, the top of which is coated with with a mix of 3 chemical coatings. There is more about the composition and explanation of the 3 coatings later in this book. These coatings readily emit electrons/ions when heated in a vacuum. The filament (just described) is situated ''inside'' that cylinder, which  supplies the heat needed for the generation of the electrons/ions. 

#'''First grid [G1],''' Applied voltage differentials, control the initial quantity of electrons/ions, which will be released by the  cathode-generated electron/ion stream on command from a broadcast signal sent from an external source. Then, the potential difference between the cathode and G 1 starts to accelerate that stream into the influence/region, where the second grid takes command.  

#'''Second grid: [G2],''' (usually 300 Volts positive), accelerates the electron beam (stream) even faster to and through the anode electrode.

'''Split-anode:''' where 2 structures are physically separated, but joined together,{electrically},  with a wire, {so as the 2 structures, may be considered as one and the same, voltage-wise}.

'''Note:''' In electromagnetic-focus electron guns, focusing is achieved by the use of a permanent magnetic-generating device, attached to, (or part of), the YOKE, which encircled the outside of the neck of the CRT, (like a ring on your finger). This is  commonly referred to as THE ''' FOCUS COIL.''' These types of guns have a '''one-piece, Anode structure.'''

'''Focus ring:''' A metallic  ring, appearing, (but not connected to), and residing, between two structures, {see above, &quot;split-anode&quot;}. This type of gun was called an '''&quot;Electrostatic Focus Gun&quot;,''' indicating that focus was achieved '''INTERNALLY''', automatically, by applied voltage, as it was part of the Gun-structure assembly itself. It was responsible for SHAPING the Electron/Ion Stream, which  ultimately reduces the Electron Stream to a pin-point DOT, exactly at the point of impact, on the Phosphor screen. ALL necessary voltages, to create the required magnetic fields, which do the work, are provided by the circuitry of the TV set. See '''“Magnetic Focus Electron Gun&quot;''' below.

'''Crown:'''  The very top of the Electron Gun [Anode], (cylinder), upon which '''&quot;Spiders&quot;''' and '''&quot;Getters&quot;''' are attached. See next:   

'''&quot;Spiders&quot;:'''  10 to 12 pieces of bendable metal,( shaped like a spider’s legs ), emanating in a full circle, from the Crown , '''(TOP)''' of the anode. The Spiders made contact with electrical coating, which will be put inside the tube (glass envelope). 

'''Note:'''   The '''Spider’s''' primary function was, to make contact with a conductive coating (Aquadag), painted uniformly throughout the whole interior of the CRT. This, was needed to carry the high voltage, (10,000 to 25,000 volts), necessary for the tube to function properly. The Aquadag, highly electrical-conductive coating, is painted over the  metal button, (&quot;anode button&quot;), which is  melted into the side of the glass bulb. This '''Anode button connection, is common to both the inside and the outside of the bulb.'''  When a heavy-duty wire, emanating from the high-voltage supply circuit of the T V set, is attached to it, the electrical circuit is completed, providing High Voltage to the Electron Gun part. Unfortunately, it is '''ALSO called the &quot;ANODE&quot;, alongwith the Gun structure element.''' The secondary use was, that it held the Electron gun in place, during the '''SEALING-in process,''' linking the Electron Gun, into the Bulb, (described later herein).

'''&quot;Getter&quot;:''' A &quot;U-shaped&quot; element, with a bar across the top, attached to, and sitting upon, the very top of the &quot;Crown&quot;, (top part of the [Anode], Gun Structure). This bar contains an element called &quot;Barium&quot;. The bar is heated up, by an external source of radio-frequency waves {&quot;R F&quot;}, (much like a kitchen microwave oven heats microwavable products ).  Except that, that the type of R F equipment, supplying this energy, was meant specifically to heat metal. The R F applied, was from a hand-held coil, emanating from the R F generator, [BOMBARDER], which is attached to a non-conductive, pole-like stick, which is meant to isolate you, from the Electrical energy, when in use. That application of R F, is done immediately after processing the Gun,  [Cathode coating,] and removing the CRT from the Oven [Tipping-off].  When the R F heats the Barium, embedded in the Cross-piece, it activates it. This causes a Chemical reaction, which absorbs any gas, '''remaining inside the CRT.''' It also leaves a deposit,on the glass of the neck of the tube, directly opposite of the &quot;Getter&quot; location.

'''Note:'''  A good indication, of whether or not, there was a high degree of vacuum, coupled with a low residual gaseous condition is, that when the Barium is activated, [by R.F. heating of the Getter] , it has the ability to absorb any/all gasses. If few gasses are absorbed, the inner side of the glass neck, where the getter is located, assumes a '''BRIGHT SILVERY LOOK''', [like a highly-polished mirror]. If there is a poor vacuum, and/or, a high gas content, a smokey-black or dirty-brown coating, deposits on the neck, instead of the bright silvery effect. 

Later on, when Oxygen enters  the tube, {for any reason}, the coating, (whether silvery, smokey-black, or dirty-brown), registers its  appearance on the glass neck, by another Chemical reaction, hereby becoming '''CHALK WHITE'''. If high voltage is presented to the CRT at THAT time, large sparks (and splats), are heard , seen, (like lightening bolts ), bouncing between the elements, (Grids and Gun-Anode of the Electron Gun ). At that point, the CRT will NOT function. If left on long enough, damage to the electrical circuitry in the T V set, will ensue, to the point, if left on yet, even longer, the entire T V set, will have to be scrapped. ( See Bombarder later on herein,... SPIDERS singing and hammering the neck of the CRT ). 

All of these elements, are provided a way, to have Electrical charges introduced to them, via a Wafer-like glass piece, (as previously disclosed), which is attached as part of the Gun structure, and supports all the Gun Elements. They effectively provide the leads, from the outside, (the T V chassis), to the elements themselves, which are inside the vacuum. Those voltages are necessary, for the CRT, to function normally.

'''&quot;Yoke&quot;''': '''Last, but not least,''' and NOT a connected part of the Electron Gun, but necessary for the Gun to be properly operated, is a series of coils,(although constructed as one piece). It is positioned on, and around the outside of the neck of the CRT. When the CRT is inserted neck-first into the yoke, the yoke is positioned snug up against the bulb, where the neck of the CRT, joins the bulb proper. In normal operating conditions, when different voltages are applied, according to instructions from the signals received, such causes the Electron Stream to be directed, left-to-right,(horizontally), and up-and-down (vertically). Note: in some TV sets, an external focus coil, [magnetically-focused], is also attached to the Yoke. 

The '''Yoke''' function/arrangement,(NOT including the Focus coil), is generally referred to, as   '''&quot;SWEEP CIRCUITS&quot;.''' ( Given that name because the Yoke is responsible for the Electron Beam to be &quot;swept&quot;, [Horizontally], from left to right, AND to be &quot;swept&quot; [Vertically], from the top of the screen to the bottom of the Screen). It is responsible for breaking up the picture into 525 evenly spaced Lines, of information, (American System), versus '''1,080 lines''' for the HDTV System, (which provides more detail), than the  '''525-Line System).'''

==='''Magnetic Focus Electron Guns'''=== 
  
*'''Note''': Among the first television tubes appearing in the U.S. were those of the &quot;Magnetic Focus&quot; type. The Electron gun in those tubes, did NOT have &quot;split Anode&quot; parts, as indicated earlier, but a single gun structure, (Electrode), simply noted as the &quot;Anode&quot;.  It also did NOT contain a &quot;Focus Ring&quot;  as an integral part of the Electron Gun, as  focusing was achieved by another coil, constructed as an integral part of the Yoke, which encircled the outside end of the neck of the CRT .  

NOTE: An '''&quot;ELECTRON&quot;''', is a '''sub-atomic particle''', of an atom. first discovered in 1897 by J J Thomson who estimated its charge to mass ratio to be over a thousand times that of the hydrogen atom. Its mass is accepted to be 9.1093826E-31 kg.
An ION consists of at least One complete Atom, which is called a '''&quot;Monoatomic Ion&quot;''' containing many parts. Other IONS may also be composed of a bunch of atoms; these are called '''&quot;Polyatomic Ions&quot;'''. It has been calculated that Monoatomic Ions, might weigh as much as 2,000 times, or more, than an Electron. Therefore, '''Polyatomic Ions''' might weigh as much as Ten Thousands, or more, than an Electron. Ions with negative charges are called '''&quot;Anions&quot;,''' and positively-charged Ions are called '''&quot;Cations&quot;'''. The type of Ions, released from the Cathode Coating, of course, depends on the type(s), of Coatings used, to compose the Coating. (Generally, the 3 coatings will consist of a combination of any of the following chemicals: Calcium, Barium, Strontium or Cesium, dependent on the Gun Manufacturer's preference/choice).

Electrons are easily manipulated, whereas Ions, (many times heavier than Electrons), as just disclosed, are much harder to influence, (with the '''same-strength magnetic field,''' of an Ion-Trap). The Ion-Trap, easily bends the Electron Stream, but because of the '''Ion’s much heavier mass,''' there is very little, if any, effect on the Ions, (whether positive or negative).  Ions, in a Vacuum, when concentrated, can be a  very DESTRUCTIVE energy force, particularly on the Phosphor Coating. The Phosphor Coating, was meant to display video information, NOT resist, ION bombardment. '''''See below Aluminizing Preparation''', also, the '''power of concentrated, controlled IONS.'''''

'''Note:''' Later on, a thin coating of aluminum applied in front of the Phosphor Screen, again allowed the &quot;Straight Gun&quot;, (needed no ION TRAP),to be used. There, the Aluminum took the brunt of the impact by the IONS, accompanied by Electrons, in the '''combined Electron/Ion stream.''' It went through the aluminum coating and delivered the information to &quot;draw&quot; the picture, which was signaled by the sending source. The magnetic field, generated by the '''&quot;YOKE&quot;''', was/is,  powerful enough to control the Ions (while the Electrons went along for the ride), but none-the-less, they caused the screen to light up '''(fluoresce)''' even brighter, than that of Electrons alone, for any given amount of particles [generally referred to as Electron Stream].  '''(See &quot;Aluminizing&quot; below).''' 

The Electron/ION pinpoint Stream, initially has the power to penetrate the aluminum layer, going forward, but NOT have enough force, to bounce back out, [in the opposite direction]. Further, that Aluminum Shield, also causes all light to be directed/ reflected, toward the viewer, making a far brighter picture, than that, with a phosphor-alone, NON-aluminum protected, Bent-gun CRT.

=='''CATHODE COATING'''==

This emitting of Electrons/Ions, are produced by a  heating element, (much like a conventional 100-watt light bulb), which is fitted into the hollow Cathode cylinder, directly below the flat, and opposite the coated side, of the Cathode Cylinder. These coatings, (stimulated by the intense heat of the Filament {800 Degrees C, 1,472 Degrees F and '''upwards'''}. And '''upwards''', because in the conversion and activation of the Cathode Coating, voltages, as high as 13 1/2 Volts, are applied to the filament. Then, via instructions from the set-up, of the T.V., obeying  directions from the Televising source, the Cathode Coating, through the G1 assembly, releases varying amount of Electrons. This varying intensity of the combined Electron/Ion Stream, dictated whether the Phosphor would glow brighter, less brighter, or have NO brightness at all. SEE testing, later on herein, for the characteristic, known as, &quot;Cut-off&quot;. This is how the picture may depict White and all shades of Gray, eventually to Black, [lack of Electrons impacting the Phosphor Coating]. 

Generally there is a combination of Three (3) materials, containing  many diverse Ions, which are deposited on the flat, top-side of the round metallic cylinder,(CATHODE), which is to be the recipient of the heat, generated by the filament. 

The '''FIRST''' Coating of the Triple-combination, was chosen because it liberated Electrons/Ions very quickly, after the filament lights up, but, would only do so, for several years.
 
The '''SECOND''' coating, took a little longer to start providing the Electrons/Ions, but, it could continue to do so, for five (5) to Ten (10) years.

The '''THIRD''' coating, took longer yet to begin to supply the Electrons/Ions, but, could continue to do so for a long time.  NOTE: Once the Third Coating, was heated long enough, it could then continue to provide enough Electrons, to present a good picture for Twenty (20) years or longer.  NOTE: That is why, as sets aged, they would take longer and longer to provide a good picture, but eventually worked pretty good.  

The '''Cathode Coating,''' {physically, about1/2 the diameter of a  #2 pencil-eraser and as thick as Three (3) sheets of 20 lb Paper}, was deposited on the flat, outer top-surface of the Cathode Cylinder, (which contained the heating element, the “Filament”).

'''NOTE:''' That tiny amount of Cathode coating, '''(theoretically),''' could produce enough Electrons for the CRT, for '''over 100 years.'''The combined coatings, generally consisted of the chemicals, Calcium, Barium and Cesium.  

As disclosed earlier, in considering a Black and White Picture Tube, the more Electrons present in the pinpoint stream of electrons, the brighter the phosphor glowed in that one spot '''(PIXEL/Picture Element'''). The lesser amount of electrons which are contained in the Electron Stream, (less mass), a less lighter/darker image is portrayed. This way, all shades of black-to-gray-to-white, could be portrayed. As color Television Tubes were starting to appear in the Nineteen-Fifties, the varying  amount of Electrons, increased/decreased, the Color of the impacted Phosphor, ('''INTENSITY''').  

According to ONE (1 )of the laws of physics, entitled '''“Double-Quadruple Principal&quot;''', the Japanese 1,080 Horizontal-line system, (double the amount of Horizontal lines projected than that of the American 525 Line-system ), provides a Four (4 )times BETTER picture that the U.S. 525 line system. See EXPLANATION, of Double-Quadruple principle NEXT. 

'''EXPLANATION:''' of “'''Double-Quadruple Principal“'''.  If a One (1 ) inch hose, can pump 100 gallons of water per minute, then a  Two ( 2 ) inch hose can pump, 400 gallons of water, NOT the 200 gallons per minute, that '''“common sense”''' would dictate. The Double Quadruple law, [Principle,] impacts many other common-day occurrences, perhaps unknown to lay people and even most of the populace.
NOTE: Since 2004, A PURPORTED NEW TECHNOLOGY, again sponsored by the Japanese, uses a BLUE laser beam top create/read DVD's. They cite that the Blue laser beam is thinner than the RED laser beam. THIS IS TRUE! BUT THEN THEY SAY, THAT BECAUSE USING THE ''THINNER'' BLUE LASER BEAM, IN CONJUNCTION WITH A &quot;CHANGE OF THE NUMERICAL APERTURE 0F 0.85, THEY ARE ABLE TO WRITE/READ, AS MUCH AS 5 TIMES AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY COULD WHEN USING THE RED LASER BEAM. The author herein, thinks that with a different change of numerical index, the RED laser COULD do the same thing.  But then they do NOT have the citing of superior technology, as a means to sell the system/product. IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY FOR MORE AND MORE INFORMATION TO BE RECORDED/DISSEMINATED. That is why, a GROUP  of 14 major leading consumer electronics,personal computer and media manufacturers, which are world-known corporations, (Blu-ray Disc Association), have banded together to exploit this wonderful NEW technology! ? ! ? 

Back To the Double-quadruple principal, as it refers to &quot;Wind Generators&quot;, (another misnomer).   
 
Another '''MORE COMPLEX Example:''' A certain '''“Wind Generator”''' produces One Thousand Watts of electricity in a 7 mile an hour wind. If you increase the wind speed to 14 MPH the same windmill will produce Four (4) Thousand watts of electricity. Then if the original diameter of the Wind-Blades are Three (3) feet, and you increase the Wind-Blade diameter to Six (6) feet, you then produce 4,000 Watts of electricity in the 7 MPH wind. Now if you do both upgrades at once, (double the wind speed AND double the blade diameter), you now will produce Sixteen (16) Thousand Watts of Electricity, in the Six (6) foot Wind-Blade, in the 14 MPH wind ). See cifaldi,carmine in GOOGLE, relative to Patent #6,372,978 B1,[4-16-2002]. It discloses complete details, of an '''Hybrid Solar Heating System,''' with extended Storage Capability. It uses the '''Sun and the Wind,''' as the sources for generating heat, through what is commonly termed, &quot;Renewable-Energy&quot; Sources.  

Most of the information herein relative to '''“Electron Guns”''' has reference to those “GUNS” used for presentation in Black &amp; White Television. The following, is some extra information regarding “Electron-Beam Color Guns”.

=='''COLOR  PICTURE TUBES'''==

In a REGULAR Color CRT, there are Three (3), '''{Black and White}''' guns, physically arranged together, as '''One unit''' in a triangular configuration. The single unit, comprised of the Three (3)gun arrangement, are called, the '''“Red Gun”''', the '''“Blue Gun”''' and the '''“Green Gun”'''. However, they all produce '''Electrons,''' which '''are''' '''COLORLESS.''' The Colors ascribed to the GUNS, are really for the sake of convenience and ease of discussion. The Tube contains Three (3), Phosphors, deposited on the face of the CRT, in the form of minute dots, EACH, DOT BEING, all RED, OR all BLUE OR all GREEN, only. They  are also arranged in a triangular configuration. For a 25&quot; color tube, there are approximately '''333,000 dots of Phosphor,''' of '''each Color.''' 

The Electron guns, situated in '''TRIANGULAR array,''' in the far end of the  neck of the CRT, are positioned such, that Electrons emanating from the '''“RED”''' gun could impinge '''ONLY''' the Red-colored Phosphor dots, but '''NOT''' Blue '''nor''' Green Phosphor Dots. This was because of an ingenious use of a '''“SHADOW MASK SCREEN”,''' ( much like a common window screen ). 

This Shadow Mask Screen is fixed in place, a short distance in front of the Color Dots of Phosphor, the '''{TRI-COLOR} SCREEN'''.  It is located between the top of the Electron Gun and the Tri-color Screen.  In turn, the '''“BLUE”''' Gun, could only impact the Blue Phosphor Dots, (but NOT the Red Nor the Green Dots). Similarly the '''“GREEN”''' Gun  Electron Stream could only impact Green Phosphor Dots, but like-wise, could NOT impact the Red, NOR the Blue Phosphor Dots.

Later advanced models Color CRTs,with a different arrangement, consisted of BANDS (strips ), of the Three colors (in vertical array). The extremely fine portions of all Three color Bands  were bounded {by dark Blue bands, in the Horizontal Axis). The Bands of TRI-Color bits, likewise were used to achieve all colors and Thousands of variations, which was possible, with the '''“Tri-Color Dot” Phosphor''' arrangement.

=='''HOW TELEVISION IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE ELECTRON GUN'''== 

Typical voltages and/or applied voltages for general Television Tubes were as follows, {with all voltages DC positive, except where indicated}:

'''Filament'''          6.3 V  AC @ 600 MA;

'''Cathode'''            -5 V ; 
 
'''(G1)'''              10 to 30 volts ; 
  
'''(G2''' )             250 to 400 V ; 

'''Focus Ring'''        0  to 300 V ; 

'''Anode/Spit-anode'''  8,000 V  to  30,000  Volts. 

Electron Guns, operating at higher than 25,000 Volts, required '''“WARNING-LABELS”''', of possible '''radiation''' side-effects. 

'''NOTE''': The Warning Label recommendation was, that there should be at least Three (3) feet or more, between the viewer and the  face of the Tube! As Tube sizes increased, so did the necessity for increased High (Anode) Voltages. Therefore, a  proper Viewing-Distance Chart, was thereby developed.  

This was not as bad as it sounds because the X-ray radiation was bound by the  '''&quot;INVERSE SQUARE LAW&quot;''', (as you double the Distance away from an X-ray source, Radiation, [in Millirems], decreases by the inverse of the Square of the Distance, in Centimeters, from the source. The Inverse-square law should NOT be confused with the INVERSE of the Double-quadruple law.  THEY ARE MILES APART!  

At a meager '''6.3 volts, A.C.''', drawing  '''600 milliamps''' of current, there  was  heat generated to approximately '''800 degrees (C''' ), or '''1,472 degrees ( F )''', so as to cause the Electrons and Ions to be emitted in a cloud.  Then, different voltages, presented by, and to, the gun, shaped the Electron/Ion beam, focused it and ultimately propelled it as a pinpoint stream '''into''' the Phosphor Screen. Then by instructions  from the transmitting signal, either to the Cathode or G1,(both types of signal control, were used), it directed the resultant, focused electron-beam, to display a  “mirror image” picture, of the one being sent from the Televised source onto the phosphor screen, to be viewed.

The filament ( '''Heater''' ), supplied the heat necessary to liberate Electrons/Ions 
from the Three (3) coatings. TECHNICALLY, there was  enough coating  to supply Electrons/Ions for  One Hundred (100 ) years. Some CRT’s, were  found to be still working, (with an acceptable picture), after Fifty (50) years

=='''REPROCESSING OF USED CRT'S, or in, TUBES WHICH FAILED IN-PLANT'''==

Originally, (circa 1944), DUMONT T.V. sets, used a  magnetically-deflected, electronically-focused '''“straight-gun”''', where the Electron/Ion beam was sent directly to the screen. Unfortunately, it was found, after a period of One (1) to Three (3) years, that the Straight Gun, produced a burn in the visible screen, which RESEMBLED the pattern, being  broadcast by the T.V. Station.  In 1946, television programming  was only broadcast One (1) or Two (2 ) hours a day, in the New York, METROPOLITAN AREA), which included parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. At 5 P.M., on Ch 5, Allen B. Dumont, '''(WABD)''', showed '''“HOWDY-DOODIE”''',  5 days a week. But, none-the-less, some people left their T V. lit up all day, hoping to see whatever else MIGHT be broadcast (hence the signal being bombarded/burned into the Phosphor Screen ). Come to think of it, was it good or bad advertising to see the WABD Signal (pattern ), burned into your screen, while the set was NOT even turned on ? ! ?

Worse yet, with T.V. being a novelty, people were NOT sure how to use the T.V.,so they always left their T.V. sets turned on, Ten (10) to Fifteen (15) hours a day. Even when there was  NO station-identification signal being broadcast, they STILL left their T.V. sets turned ON. However, all of the propelling voltages, relative to the Electron Stream, were still being performed, (albeit with no video information), showing a fully-illuminated, bright screen). In those cases, after  X  amount of hours, in the alternative to having the WABD Test Pattern displayed, you had an un-interesting '''“Skull and Crossbones'''-like effect, as the phosphor began to have that image etched onto itself. It would now NEVER disappear, even when normal video information was only meant to be seen. This obviously, was un-acceptably ever-present, on the Phosphor Screen Screen. 

The only remedy was to cut the CRT open, wash out that burned screen and cause a  new screen to be deposited. However, some tubes, which were exposed to that constant Ion/Electron bombardment for many years, ignored that distracting, ever-present occurrence, continued to suffer that annoying effect, because, replacing the CRT was the most expensive part in the T.V. Set. 

'''NOTE:''' Even when that burned-screen tube was returned for replacement, the Manufacturer attempting to reprocess, ('''“REBUILD”''' OR “'''RE-GUN''' “) the CRT, found that even when removing the old phosphor screen, such still revealed, that “Skull and Crossbones” or '''“TEST-PATTERN”''' effect. That was because that “Picture” of a Skull and Crossbones was etched/BURNED-INTO the glass itself, and then the Bulb would thereby be useless. That is one of the reasons, we have “Screen Savers” today. But, “Straight” Electron Guns,  '''EVENTUALLY''' were/are, the ones of choice, with the advent of perfection of  the Aluminizing process/techniques.
 
'''Note:''' Since the Television bulb WAS far the most expensive part of the T.V. Tube, many enterprising “Re-Builders”, later on, purchased that “useless’ CRT, (even though, the Skull and Crossbones was BURNT into the Glass itself), for only a small fraction of the original Bulb cost. It then underwent remedial action (involving acids), which were used to obliterate that defect, by '''ETCHING''', uniformly, the entire inner face of the CRT. After that treatment, there was absolutely NO WABD pattern nor the Skull and Crossbones defect, visible. Of course, you now also need a  new Electron Gun and all the materials and work needed to fabricate a working CRT. The end result of this process, came to be known as a “Rebuilt Picture Tube”. It not only cost much less money, but many times, it contained an upgraded (more modern), Electron Gun and the use of newer, better, Phosphors. Thereby it actually  produced a SUPERIOR picture, than that provided originally. That Rebuilding process, also conserved raw materials AND energy, and at a price, more people could AFFORD.

NOTE: Rebuilt picture Tubes needed 2 additional steps, in its manufacture. The FIRST, ('''&quot;RE-NECKING&quot;)''' was, cutting the neck of the (under-vacuum, of the used CRT). A new piece had to be added, so that the CRT may then go through the manufacturing process. This was done on a '''GLASS LATHE.''' The Glass Lathe had a &quot;HEAD&quot;, which could hold the Tube firmly in place, while rotating. On the other end of that lathe bed, was a much smaller &quot;Head&quot;, (resembling) a three-jawed unit, (spring- loaded), which held the new neck, to be sealed into the CRT. This jawed head, also revolved at the same speed, as the Head end (holding the Bulb).
 
Underneath the neck area, there was a series of Gas Jets, (8 to 10 in number), dependent on the model of the lathe), arrayed in a gentle, '''u-shaped,''' '''upward setting.''' This series of jets had access to '''Oxygen and Illuminating Gas''' and/or '''Oxygen and Hydrogen Gas,''' [Oxy/Hydro], (as needed). The Oxy/Hydro, was NEEDED, when glass work had to be done on the Bulb proper, because it was a different type of Glass, than the neck, which required a hotter working temperature, than that which could be achieved by the Illuminating-gas/oxygen combination. The Glass neck itself, was composed of &quot;lead glass&quot;, which could be worked a  much lower temperature, that that, of the BULB proper), Therefore, it was much easier to work with, at the lathe and at a later to be performed,  Sealing-in process, of the Electron Gun. The inside atmosphere of the Bulb proper and the neck, had access to a mild stream of air,(upon command from the lathe operator), so as to counteract the driving force of the Gas-fired Jets, when the Glass of each, Bulb and new neck, was melted together.

NOTE: An important part of the &quot;RE-NECKING&quot; operation, was a BUNSEN BURNER. This was used to pre-heat the glass, that was to be heated, melted and for cooling (annealing), after the high temperature work was done. The u-shaped setup-up of gas jets were also available to pre-heat and/or anneal, but was not of much use, when working on the BULB proper.

The Second step, was to remove all labels and coatings (Aquadag-like), present on the OUTSIDE of the  glass Bulb. This was generally done by '''&quot;STRIPPER&quot;,''' designed specifically to emulsify, or otherwise remove the coating from the outside of the Glass Bulb. It was then rinsed off, with clean City water. The inside of the bulb was also washed, (to get rid of all the material previously used to manufacture the original), with a weak mild acid, such as Ammonia Hydroxide. When the Bulb, finally resembled that, of a brand new Bulb (Blank), it was then sent to the Screening Room, to be processed with other like-bulbs, as well as the brand new Bulbs. (See Actual Screening Process, later herein).

=='''BENT ELECTRON GUNS AND ION-TRAPS'''==

A very important Electron Gun UPGRADE, for &quot;Straight-gun&quot; Tubes, as the replacement Tube, was the '''“Bent Gun”,''' which allowed few, if any Ions to bombard the Phosphor Screen. The “Straight gun”, went out of favor, because the Bent Gun was designed so that the Electrons and Ions, which were generated, were separated, and '''MOST''' of the Ions, were NOT permitted, to impact the Phosphor Screen. Then, the Electrons were gathered together, shaped to form an Electron Stream '''{Electron Beam}''', accelerated in the initial part of the electron gun, and propelled, to allow the stream to impinge on the Phosphor Screen. The separation device, called an '''“Ion-Trap”''', allowed the Electron Stream (only), to proceed to its assigned task. The Ion-trap was a spring-loaded permanent magnet, which fit around the outside neck of the CRT,(like a ring on a finger), that when rotated/aligned properly, allowed only the Electrons to provide the received broadcast, video instructions. For a while Straight Guns were out of favor. NOTE: As technology evolves the “Straight Gun” will again be revived. (See later herein).

NOTE: That term “Ion-Trap” is a '''misnomer'''. It should have been termed an “Electron Beam Bender”, because basically it did NOT trap Ions, but '''it had that effect.''' Because both Ions and Electrons, emanated from the Cathode coating in a straight line, neither could be sent to directly to impact the Phosphor Screen, because of the purposeful mis-alignment of the Gun structure. The Ion Trap Magnetic field interceded, by bending the Electrons in the stream, so that '''THEY COULD''' be directed into the Phosphor Screen. The ION-TRAP was of sufficient strength to, and DID, influence the Electrons, but Ions which were, '''THOUSANDS of times heavier,''' than an Electron, were less affected. Therefore, the stream of Electrons, was bent by the magnetic field of the Ion-trap, and transmitted the video information, onto the screen. The IONS were generally allowed to dissipate, harmlessly. However, there was at least one exception to this rule, in the Author's personal knowledge, (See '''EXCEPTION''' later herein).

'''EXPLANATION:''' of '''Ion-Trap's limited ability.'''

Since the Electrons generated, contained an electrical charge (negative), they were influenced (bent) by the permanent magnet, and allowed to be collected, shaped, {focused}, propelled, so as to impact the Phosphor Screen. As long as the Ion-Trap, was properly arranged/positioned on the neck of the CRT, it retarded tremendously, if NOT, stopped the screen '''Ion Burning.''' The much HEAVIER Ions, whether Positive or Negative, (even though both contain electrical charges),{although most IONS, derived from the Cathode-material composition, WERE negative), such was irrelevant. BOTH Positive and Negative Ions, were LITTLE-effected, by the limited strength, of the Ion-Trap Magnetic Field. In the main), they COULD NOT/DID-NOT, impact the Phosphor Screen. 

The author feels that there is an analogy here, between a '''&quot;BLACK HOLE&quot;''', as proposed by '''STEPHEN HAWKING,''' that some light particles may escape the Black-hole, '''{HAWKING RADIATION)''' because of their location around the periphery of the Black-hole. In that regard, by the same reasoning, there probably '''ARE''' some Ions, (because of THEIR location), which ARE able to impact the Phosphor Screen. They would be only slightly affected by the weak magnetic field of the Ion-trap but some Ions, could impact the Phosphor Screen. (See '''CROSSOVER-POINT, LATER HEREIN)'''. The much stronger Magnetic Field, generated by the Focus Coil, CAN '''EASILY''' handle the IONS. Because of their much heavier weight (THOUSANDS of Times heavier than the Electrons), compounded by that fact that their speed, [see Herman Minkowski and Einstein below], increased their weight by 200 times, added their contribution, to the penetration of the Aluminum Coating. The brightness achieved, (certainly NOT, minimal), was evident. The combined Electron/Ion Stream is a potentially destructive source of energy. (Remember, the hint, of Phosphor Screen, AND, Glass burns, which ultimately led to  ('''&quot;Screen Savers&quot;)''' 

'''&quot;EXCEPTION&quot;'''

The &quot;Trapped&quot; IONS, usually continue to rattle around in the Electron-Gun structure, until they are finally dissipated and do  NOT effect the desired result. In a '''RARE CASE''', a  mis-positioned Ion -Trap, (around the neck of the CRT), somehow, WAS POSITIONED (BY a technician), such that it caused the Ions, NOT, to be immediately dissipated, but instead, to actually concentrate and blast a circular hole, in the Anode Electrode, of the Electron Gun, (about the size of half a #2 Pencil eraser).   '''NOTE: JUST LIKE BUCK ROGERS OR FLASH GORDON, A HAND-CARRIED PISTOL-LIKE WEAPON, THEY CALLED A “BLASTER&quot;, or a RAY-GUN!''' See WWW.cifaldi.org, clik on photos, clik on Carmine, clik on Ray Gun , for a hand-drawn picture of a hypothetical &quot;RAY GUN&quot; dated Jan 17, 1965
'''NOTE: The “Ion-Trap” magnet system, was discontinued, and since the 1970's, is NO longer being used.'''

Later on, it was accepted by the Scientific Community that Electrons, '''DO have some weight,''' {trillionths of a gram ?}, (454 grams to the lb ; 28.375 Grams to the ounce}. Traveling in the vacuum, at near the speed of light, the Electron stream, impacts the T.V. Phosphor screen AND causes TINY PARTICLES of phosphor to fluoresce, {&quot;light up&quot;). This is accomplished, according to instructions, as coded, from the sending source, via the Electron Gun.  Even though, the Electrons are virtually weightless, according to MR. '''Hermann MINKOWSKI)''',{one of Einstein’s Professors},(they do have some mass). He had rightly '''suggested,''' that '''“SPEED INCREASES  MASS”). Neither man, suspected that the '''Electron DID have mass.'''

'''Later on''', as '''EINSTEIN (1879 to 1955)''' HIMSELF, TAUGHT, that any object, attaining  near the Speed of Light, (186,300 Miles per second), can have its Mass {weight}, multiplied by 200 times or more.  &quot;EXPLANATION&quot;, of Speed increasing Mass: Since more electrons are NOT added, to a single Electron, then the extra mass, (weight), must come from something/somewhere else. It comes from the Energy, (called '''Kinetic energy)''', put in, to get the Electron, (or '''any particle/mass)''', to move that fast. The Kinetic Energy, is therefore added to the Energy, of the Electron at rest. '''Then therefore, since '''E ='s  M C squared,''' {in which Mass can be converted to energy and Energy can be converted to mass}, then, the '''Electron, or Ion, or ANY particle, WILL get heavier, because of the Energy put into it, to make it go that fast.'''
 
'''Therefore, since the Electron Beam proceeds at, or near, the speed of light, its impact, causes the selected portion of the impacted particles of Phosphor to '''light up''', {Fluoresce,in terms of DECAY TIME}, '''momentarily.''' That effect, (on a particular particle of Phosphor, was later defined as a '''“PIXEL&quot;,'''  [Picture Element]. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON &quot;PHOSPHOR&quot;, and &quot;DECAY TIME&quot;, see Sections LATER HEREIN, labeled '''&quot;PHOSPHOR&quot;''' and '''&quot;DECAY TIME&quot;'''.  

Then, when the Electron Beam moved on to the next Phosphor particle, the Phosphor light slowly died out,'''[“DECAYED“]'''.  NOTE: The smaller the diameter, of the projected Electron Stream, the smaller amount of Phosphor particles, which are to be impacted. The &quot;down-sizing&quot;, (reduction of the diameter), of the Electron Beam, enables the production of a finer, '''MORE lifelike, picture,''' (which is characterized as &quot;DEFINITION&quot;).   '''HDTV'''  achieves '''excellent Definition,''' because of related  circuitry, which provides information on '''1,080''' HORIZONTAL lines, instead of '''525''' HORIZONTAL lines. This means more/smaller detail may be shown because it breaks the picture into more parts. Therefore, '''Four (4 ) times as much information''' is able to be displayed,by HDTV, than the '''525-line system''', as dictated by the '''“DOUBLE-QUADRUPLE LAW”''' (SEE Explanation later herein).  

'''NOTE:''' The combined, (increased) mass of Electrons/Ions, propelled at such a velocity, may easily penetrate the aluminum, impinge on and light up, the phosphor particles. However they do not contain enough energy, to reverse course and re-penetrate, out, the Aluminum shield, back towards the Electron gun. Additionally, the Aluminum cover, which is bright and shiny, additionally functions, as a reflector. Therefore all (100 %), of the available light-energy, is directed toward the viewer.

=='''PHOSPHORS'''==

&quot;Electro-luminescent&quot; materials, deposited on the inner face of CRT’s, when impacted by energetic charges, causes them to '''“FLUORESCE”'''. When struck by the Electron/Ion Stream, they '''“GLOW”''' brightly and then start to lose energy and then the glow '''FADES''' out. That occurrence, in effect, is characterized by the word '''“PERSISTENCE”.''' The amount of time it takes PERSISTENCE to occur/be measured, is known as “DECAY” time. Phosphors come in different DECAY times, which depend on the ultimate use, for which the CRT will be used, {'''Special Purpose Tubes}.'''  

The Phosphors come in the following Persistence ranges: Extremely Short;  Ultra Short; Very Short;  Short;  Medium Short; '''Medium;'''  Medium Long; and  Long. The Phosphor used in Black and White Picture Tubes, is called &quot; P4 &quot;, and is of Medium Persistence, and the Phosphor, which is yellow, tends to favor a faint bluish caste. The preferred Phosphor, to be used in Special Purpose Tubes, for '''direct  photographic purposes,''' was a '''P1 type.''' It also was a medium persistence phosphor.  The Phosphors used in Color Tubes (P31), [Red, Blue and Green], are also of Medium Persistence. There are 3 small {5&quot;) CRT's contained in projection T.V. Sets.  Each of them, are composed of  One color, [their own], '''ONLY,''' covering the whole face, of each CRT.

=='''“DECAY TIME”'''==

&quot;Decay Time&quot; is ascribed, as the period of time, (in Milliseconds ), it takes  the Phosphor to lose brightness, from One (1) Foot Candle, to less than One (1 ) % of that amount, for a Pixel to return from its excited (brightest) state, to little, or NO brightness. For example: for a  Radar Tube, you wanted a phosphor with a long persistence. You didn’t want the blips, {which do represent a rather large airplane}, to disappear, or blink on and off, (unless the program called on it to do so).

But, for a Child’s Arcade-like Game, you want a phosphor with an extremely short persistence, (much like a ”REFRESH RATE” ABILITY), as to prevent “BLEEDING” {Colors mixing into the edge(s), of other colors}, thus the blurring of information, when it is presented at high speed. This is because, the more intricate (life-like), pictures of people are portrayed, in an action program, (when calling  for extremely fast action), demands that the Phosphor particles dim very quickly. If they do not dim fast enough, the brightness of One (1) Pixel, mixes in with the excitation, (INCREASING OR DIMINUTION), of another.

'''NOTE:''' Phosphors, are tested for '''Decay-time,''' but such process can also be called '''PERSISTENCE'''.  Phosphors, also come in different tints/colors. The combination generally used for a Black &amp; White Picture Tubes is a “P4” Phosphor, which has a Medium Persistence, with a Blue/White tint. Color Tubes employ “P 31” Phosphors, with Medium Persistence also.  For Photographic  uses, certain '''Special Purpose,  Black &amp; White CRT’s,''' used a '''“P 1” Phosphor.''' That was because the EXPERTS doing the filming, determined that the Greenish Tint hue, was better than the Tint of the P 4 Phosphor, (more Blue), for filming, with a Motion Picture Film Camera, [DIRECTLY  from the face of the CRT], (pre-VCR/DVD time).

=='''SWEEP CIRCUITS'''==

“Sweep” circuits, provided by an external device surrounding the neck, [called a YOKE,] are responsible for '''“DEFLECTION”''', {moving the Electron Stream  from  Left to Right and from the top to the bottom}, which presents the picture. In the American Version (pre H D T V ), 525  lines of video information, per second, is produced onto the screen. (more later ). In certain tubes, such as '''Oscilloscope''' tubes, [Sweep-circuits,] '''DEFLECTION,''' is created by electrodes, attached to the Electron Gun itself (internally). That type of Gun  was known as an '''“Electrostatic-Deflection Type”'''.

=='''INTERLACED SCANNING, 525 HORIZONTAL LINES OF INFORMATION'''==

The American Television system was based on the SWEEP Circuits providing  '''525''' lines of Horizontal information, via a system called “INTER-LACED” scanning”.  This was controlled by the Horizontal frequency of '''16,750''' Cycles (now Hertz), per second, which drew pictures, based on the following procedure: First, '''262½''' '''ODD''' lines of information a (&quot;Field&quot;) were transmitted/received. Then, '''262 1/2 EVEN''' lines, of information had the same thing done. Both, the Even and the Odd-numbered Fields, were combined, which was then called a &quot;Frame&quot;. The rationale between breaking a Frame in '''(2)''' sections, was because it took less Bandwidth to send over the airwaves. (With the advent of Cable and '''&quot;Streaming&quot;,''' that rationale is now irrelevant). Each Frame was then repeated twice, making a total of ''''''(60''')''' Frames per second.

'''(60)''' frames a second corresponded with '''(60)''' Cycle Alternating Current, in the U.S., which at that time, showed that such actions would prevent/reduce flickering effects. This happens so rapidly, that combined with the '''RETENTIVITY''' of the phosphor to hold and slowly reduce the light generated by the high-velocity impact of the concentrated focused pinpoint electron beam, (called DECAY TIME), fools the eyes into seeing a complete image ('''“SNAPSHOT}”'''), thus producing a  full completed moving picture, in “real time”.

'''COMPUTER''' uses, favor '''“PROGRESSIVE SCANNING”''', (transmitting of  information of the Horizontal, in sequential form. That scanning method scans (lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.. in order),  as opposed to '''“Interlaced”''' scanning, and is also projected at '''(60)''' Frames/second.

=='''ELECTRON GUN'''==

An Electron Gun, an early upgrade of the Straight gun, known as a '''“BENT GUN”''' type, has '''electro-magnetic focusing provided externally,''' by a “focus ring,” (encircling the glass neck and an associated part of the YOKE). The gun was designed  so as to be able to separate Electrons from Ions. Both, are generated/liberated from the '''“Cathode COATING''', (generally a combination of Calcium/Barium/Strontium or Cesium Oxides). 

'''Imagine the Electron Gun, analogous with the operation of an automobile.'''

1. Turning on T.V. Set Applies Voltage to Filament..... '''(Start the Engine)'''

2. Apply 10 Volts of positive voltage to G 1..........  ('''Put Car in FIRST gear &amp; start moving)''' 

3. Apply 300 Volts, positive to the 2nd Grid......... '''(Put Car in Second gear &amp; accelerate)'''

4. Apply necessary voltage to achieve Focus...........'''(Head for the proper destination)'''

5. Apply 14,000 Volts to the anode .................  '''(Floor Throttle to achieve top Speed)''' 
 
6. Electrons light up Phosphor coating .............  '''(Ability to see the destination)'''

=='''MANEUVERING, SHAPING, THE ELECTRON STREAM (BEAM),“DRAWING “A PICTURE.'''==

This information applies to the “bent-gun”,  '''Electro-magnetically focused GUN.''' Picture the round-shaped Cathode coating, releasing Electrons/Ions in a “cloud”. Then by applied voltage differentials, between the Cathode (negative charge) and G 1 (Positive charge), the Electron/Ion cloud, becomes a '''“STREAM” of Electrons''' and are accelerated through the round hole (aperture) of G 1. Now comes the  hard part to envision:

=='''FOCUS  ACHIEVEMENT'''==

'''First, let’s get rid of the Ions.''' A “Bent-gun” is so aligned, that NO Ions, NOR Electrons can impact the Phosphor Coating, because of the '''Electron-Gun's, purposeful mis-alignment.''' An externally-mounted permanent magnet, (called an '''ION TRAP''' ), spring-loaded, fits around the outside of the neck of the CRT. This magnet may be moved Forward or Backward, as well as being able to be rotated by a Technician, in a 360 Degree alignment, around the neck of the CRT.

With the T.V. turned on and producing all necessary voltages, proper alignment, influences the stream of ELECTRONS to be  “bent”, and successfully go through the '''G 2 aperture.''' The electrons, ARE, easily influenced by the limited strength, produced by the Ion-Trap’s magnetic field. Almost all the  '''IONS''' generated/released by the Cathode Coating are '''NOT able to be bent''' by that weak magnetic field, generated by the ION-Trap, because they are'''more than 2,000 times, more massive ('''heavier'''), or more, than the Electrons.''' '''NOTE: Some Ions may be EVEN 10,000 times more massive than the Electrons, {ALL Electrons, negative or positive (Positrons) have the SAME weight}'''  Therefore most  Ions cannot access the G 2 aperture (hence, the name “ION-TRAP”). Having said that, some IONS do access the G 2 aperture, because they emanate from the peripheral areas of the cathode coating. The few Ions which do evade capture by the Ion-Trap, proceed alongwith the Electrons. Later, in their   journey Ions, are easily handled, by the more powerful magnetic field(s), generated by the '''SWEEP-CIRCUITS''' AND the '''FOCUS COIL,''' whether internal or external.

Here comes the '''tricky part''': Since the actual Cathode coating deposition, has a much larger diameter than the '''G1 aperture,''' Electrons emitted from the LEFT side of the Cathode, have to move Up and In, where eventually they will  '''“Criss-Cross”'''  each other. The Electrons emitted from the LEFT side of the Cathode Coating  will head toward the RIGHT side of the G2 aperture, while the Electrons emitted from the RIGHT side of the Cathode Coating, will head to the LEFT side of the G 2 aperture.

Yet again, Electrons from the TOP-SIDE of the Cathode Coating, head to the BOTTOM-SIDE of G 2. Similarly, Electrons  from the BOTTOM-SIDE of the Cathode head toward the TOP-SIDE of the G2 aperture. In fact, Electrons from every point (in a '''360 Degree Circle )''',each and ALL, head for THEIR opposite location, ever-narrowing a  funnel-like shape, until it reaches into a very FINE POINT ( DOT ). However, it does NOT stay in that fine point. The '''CROSSING MOMENTUM CONTINUES''', so that the  Electron Stream , starts to form a  new funnel arrangement. At that transition point, when the very fine Dot starts its expansion, is called the '''“CROSS-OVER POINT”)'''  and again, starts to expand (funnel-like). 
 
As the Electrons keep on heading, toward the Phosphor Screen(picture), with the new momentum of expanding ever larger, it enters the influence of the Focus-generated  magnetic field. Then, the Electron stream is then subjected/forced to again to begin to attempt another “Cross-over”, which ultimately results, into the desired focus achievement, '''EXACTLY AT THE POINT OF IMPACT OF THE PHOSPHOR SCREEN. ''' 

The '''Focus Coil''', for use with a '''BENT-GUN''', is mounted on the outside of the neck, adjacent to, and immediately to the rear of, part, of the '''“YOKE”''' assembly. The YOKE sees/controls, the '''ENTIRE COLLECTION OF the ELECTRONS (STREAM)''', and by various voltage signals [creating varying strength magnetic fields], move the Electron Stream, Left or Right, Up or Down, with the Stream being treated as One complete part. ( See more of “YOKE”, later herein).

At that time, the funnel, fully opened, starts to narrow again, attempting yet again, to achieve a CROSSOVER somewhere in the Bulb proper. Under the influence of the Focus Coil’s strong  magnetic field, the Electron Stream is heading to impact the  Phosphor, while also trying to achieve a 2nd  Crossover. If the Focus Coil voltage is too LITTLE, the Electron Stream wants to CROSSOVER,  far BEYOND where the Phosphor coating is (technically, beyond the outside of the CRT). If too MUCH voltage is applied to the Focus Coil, it creates a '''stronger Magnetic Field,''' and '''ACHIEVES CROSSOVER''', far in '''FRONT''' of the Phosphor Screen, (attempting a  3rd Cross-over, by the time it hits the phosphor Screen, making a large, [silver-dollar size], dot stream of Electrons).

But, with the proper Focus Voltage applied, the '''Pinpoint Dot''' of the '''Electron Stream,''' lands '''EXACTLY''' at the Phosphor Particle '''DEPOSITION'''. Therefore the Electron Stream is '''STOPPED from effecting the 3rd Crossover''', '''(PERFECT FOCUS)'''. The smallest pinpoint Electron Stream is impacting exactly at the Phosphor particles. That is exactly what is NEEDED to effect '''maximum sharpness/clarity,''' of the transmitted video material. 

Too much/too little Focus voltage, and the Electron Stream does NOT impact the Phosphor particle(s), exactly were they are supposed to, therefore showing a  '''“FUZZY”''' ('''OUT OF FOCUS )''' picture. But, by fine-tuning the Focus Voltage, we make the Electron Stream attempt to start the '''“CROSSOVER”,''' directly at the Phosphor coating, thereby allowing all the Electrons to go to their broadcasted (signal) positions. This creates a '''SHARP, in-focus image,''' '''(UNLESS)''' there are too many Gas Molecules present inside the CRT.  If the Electron Stream collides with too many GAS  molecules, even when the Electron Stream is perfectly effected, the striking of too many Gas molecules, WILL deflect the Electron Stream, so as to present a “Blurry” picture, '''DESPITE''' the Focus Coil’s perfect functioning. The Pin-point stream, will be deflected up or down or left or right of where it is supposed to go. Due to the decay time involved, you will then see an AVERAGE, of all those points, hence BLURRY. The more Gas Molecules present, the more collisions, the even more BLURRY the picture.

=='''HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION (HDTV),'''== 

'''HDTV''' is a '''1,080''' horizontal lines SYSTEM, promoted by the Japanese, which is becoming very popular in the U.S. (circa '''2003)'''. Unknown by the Television Industry, a '''1,050-line System,''' '''Ultra High Definition (UHD)''', was actually INVENTED, constructed and used by an American, '''Carmine A. Cifaldi,''' in his CRT-manufacturing company, in Paterson, New Jersey,(in 1956). At a request from a Medical Facility in Philadelphia, he hand-crafted a special-purpose Electron Gun, (later,used as an integral part of his Patented, '''Video Telephone System,''' '''12-30-1999''' entitled, '''HIGH RESOLUTION OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM)'''. He constructed the '''modified Electron Gun,''' in '''combination with,''' a '''special, high decay-speed, Green-tinted Phosphor, [P11}, in the Special-purpose CRT.''' The P11 phosphor was superior to all other phosphors, for motion picture photography,(pre-VCR/DVD times).

=='''ULTRA  HIGH  DEFINITION  SYSTEM ( UHD )'''==

'''Cifaldi’s ULTRA-HIGH DEFINITION (UHD) Electron Gun,''' was used in a '''CRT,''' which had  a medium persistence Phosphor,(P11), [which has a greenish appearance]. It was meant to be used, in conjunction with, an high-quality, super-fast, Motion Picture Camera, which used High-speed film, to '''photograph directly, from the face of, the CRT'''.  It recorded an actual, live, laproscopic gall-bladder-removal operation. The film was then used for future reference, and as a training tool, for teaching prospective/future surgeons, (especially for Third-world countries).  That Electron gun/system, ('''see EXPLANATION, HOW UHD WAS ACCOMPLISHED and EXPLANATION of gun design below)''', was '''NOT''' patented, because the Television Industry was '''NOT''' able/ready to use it, (mainly because of '''“Bandwidth” constrictions,''' the way the signal was transmitted, through the air). However, '''HDTV''' is routinely credited today, as being  of Japanese origin. Whatever the case, HDTV, when coupled with “Flat Panel” devices, using digitalization of signal, produces  pictures, rivaling, (even exceeding), the finest photographs of the day,(circa  2003). 

==='''HOW UHD WAS ACCOMPLISHED'''===

'''Note:'''  '''Cifaldi's''' '''1,050'''-line system, can produce a '''(4)''' times better picture (finer detail), than the '''525-'''line system, as dictated by the '''“Double-Quadruple Principle.&quot;'''   Further, '''NO''' extra  equipment is needed by the home-viewer, because the necessary circuitry, will be already built into the T.V. Set. '''Cifaldi's      '''U H D''' system was achieved in '''1956,'''''' by using  the  '''“INVERSE” of the Double-quadruple Principle,''' in the '''following manner:'''  

'''EXPLANATION'''  as to how the ''“Double-Quadruple Principle&quot;'' was used, to reach the desired result. Normally, the '''APERTURE,''' [hole] in Grid One ('''G 1)''',of the Electron gun, is approximately '''40,000''' of an inch in diameter. Using an Electron Gun, containing a G1 aperture of '''(20,000)''' of an inch, '''[1/2''' the diameter of the normal], has decreased the round, circular shape of the electron beam, '''(2)''' times). Therefore, the electron beam impacts '''twice''' as many smaller particles of phosphor, in '''(2)''' ways. That is '''(2)''' times from East to West, (information '''ON''' the lines themselves), and yet '''(2)''' times, from '''North to South,''' (number of lines, from '''525''' to '''1,050''' lines, hence the '''&quot;double-quadruple&quot;''' appellation!   

NOTE: (See '''Blu-ray Technology)''', later herein, which uses basically the same principal for a Blue/violet Laser beam, to write/read, as pioneered by '''Cifaldi''' in Electron Tube technology in '''1956'''. It can produce as much as '''(5)''' times more information, than the heretofore-used '''red-laser''' beam).  

In '''1956,''' that is exactly what Medical people wanted, in conjunction with, an easier-to- photograph, [in pre-color, black &amp; white days], alongwith a Green-tinted (Phosphor) Screen  (P 11). They wanted to photograph a laproscopic Gall-bladder removal operation, directly  from the face of the CRT. [That was pre-VCR/DVD time].       

Full implementation of ''' the 1,050 line system,''' is the fact, that T.V., sets in use in the '''1970’s''' could '''NOT''' use those signals, (as mandated by the FCC). Therefore they were '''NOT''' allowed to be Broadcast over the air-waves, because of limited '''Broadcasting Bandwidth''' space. '''EXCEPT,''' 

BEGINNING IN THE '''1980'S''', we NOW had wide-spread use of Digital signalization, being broadcast through '''Cable, [first, co-axial, then fiber-optically}. Satellites [for a fee,] also fed television through '''“STREAMING”,''' 

''STREAMING'' breaks the picture down,'''(1)''' line at a time, converts the information into digital format, compresses the information, and then transmits it, over the airwaves. The T.V set, receives the signal, (one line at a time), and decompresses it, transfers it to the phosphor screen. It does this so rapidly, that in conjunction with the persistence, (decay time),of the phosphor, it presents a full, complete picture, to the eye.    

Such  '''techniques,'''(digitizing signals), project  beautiful reproduction of video information. Because of those advances in technology, the pictures being shown, [circa '''2,000,'''] can, many times, often look far prettier/more realistic, than those in actual life. This includes the ability to modify the pictures, by removing blemishes, lightening-up some feature/darkening others, adding more/less color, even changing the tint or the color, etc.

NOTE: Effective '''June 12, 2009, ONLY''' digital signalization will be used. Analog television sets, will still be able to receive the signal, over the air, with the aid of a converter box, (converts digital signals into analog signals). Digital signals received over cable,to analog sets will still  be O.K., because the cable company, will have THAT ability already '''included''' also, with its service.

==='''STREAMING'''===

The use of '''“STREAMING”''', encoding of '''“DIGITAL SIGNALS”''' (CODED AS A SERIES OF '''0'S''' AND '''1'S'''). In that format, they are providing even finer, better detail of data. Digitizing signals, are now allowing PREVIOUSLY un-allowed transmission of signals to be Broadcast,(equipped with Conversion boxes), directly to Television sets by the Satellite providers. '''Over-the-air, Station Broadcasting,''' as practiced in the early days of Television, in the 1950's, and still dome today, (by RADIO), is rarely used (circa '''1990'''). Television signals received from Satellites in '''Geo-synchronous orbit,''' with associated equipment, is yet another important, viable use, of transmission.  

The '''negative side''', for that type of transmission '''is''', that '''inclement weather''' conditions may '''interrupt''' signal receipt at any time. The receiving DISH must '''NOT''' become mis-aligned, because that would result of weakening or even the total loss of signal. On the '''plus side,''' the  signals may be received, where there are '''NO''' Cable lines. With certain equipment, such as an '''INVERTER,''' '''[changes Direct Current into A.C.], (Alternating Current)],''' {as in your home}], coupled with the use of batteries, [as in your car]. Then SOME signals may EVEN  be received/used, where '''NO''' Electricity, is available from traditional sources, (where there is '''NO''' Cable '''NOR''' Electric line availability). One wire, of a regular electrical extension cord, serving as an Antenna will suffice, to bring those T.V. Station signals in, to the TV Set, which may receive air-borne signals [T,V.]. This is pursuant to an order, issued many years ago and STILL in force, [circa '''2007,'''] as '''mandated by the F T C}.''' '''NOTE''': However, '''starting in '''June 12, 2009,''' those signals will '''NO''' longer be broadcast '''over the air.''''''

=='''HOW THE TELEVISION PICTURE TUBE (CRT) IS MANUFACTURED:'''==

'''STEP ONE'''

'''Preparing the Glass-Bulb (Tube) for Phosphor Acceptance: ''' 

#1A A clear, clean Television Bulb, (as manufactured by Corning Glass), whose neck is placed over a standpipe, is connected to a  fluid (water-like) pumping station which re-circulates a mild acid (Bi-fluoride or Caustic Soda ), for 30 seconds and then rinsed with fresh, clean Tap-water (10 to 15 seconds).

#1B It is then placed and CLAMPED on an  hydraulically-operated '''“Tilt Table”''', which will be able to rotate smoothly, in a 240 degree arc, so as to not cause ripples when pouring  A '''SLURRY, of PHOSPHOR,''' and  '''DISTILLED/DE-IONIZED water,''' which will be introduced into the Tubes, in the next step of manufacture. This apparatus, '''(Tilt Table)''', can rotate  FROM the '''Horizontal upright''' Tube (neck up) position, TO  the '''Horizontal''' reverse or '''neck-down position '''

=='''PURE WATER,  REQUIRED FOR DEPOSITION OF PHOSPHOR, IN PICTURE TUBES'''==

There are only 2 types of water acceptable, to be used, in the manufacturing process, (deposition of Phosphor on the inside face of the Tube). The best, of course, is '''DISTILLED water.''' The problem with that is, the cost of the amount of distilled water, to be used, is prohibitive. All of the water will be immediately discarded, after the Phosphor is dispersed. Having said that, there are times in the year, when distilled water is absolutely required, unless extraordinary steps are taken. '''De-ionized water problems, EXPLANATION LATER herein.'''

The other type is '''&quot;DE-IONIZED&quot; water.''' The initial problem with the use of DE-IONIZED water, is that it  requires a substantial amount of capital, to purchase a '''UNIT.'''  You need a UNIT, capable of producing water, at the size commensurate with the amount of Tubes, expected to be manufactured, on a daily purpose. See UNIT composition, next.

'''One unit,''' consists of the following parts: 

A. '''De-ionizer''' Machine.

B. At least a '''One Thousand Gallon Stainless-Steel,''' (''' S. S.''' ) '''Storage Tank,'''

C. At least '''TWO, 250-400 Gallon, ( S. S.) &quot;BATCH&quot; Tanks,''' (depending on production requirements).

D. An appropriate-sized, '''Rock/Sand/Activated-charcoal Filter.'''

E. An '''High-Volume Stainless Steel Water Filter.''' 

F. An '''High-Volume Stainless-Steel Water Pump.''' 

G. All the '''accessory Stainless-Steel''' and/or plastic piping, valves, fittings and hoses, relative thereto. 

The '''1,000 Gallon (S.S.) Tank''', is the recipient, of the water being continually being De-ionized, and sent to it, for use, or for Storage, (whenever there is no screening taking place). 

The '''2 Batch Tanks,''' each receive a full tank of water, on command, to be used in the following manner: Since ALL dissolved metals/ions, have been removed, the Water has a '''PH of 7.0 (neutral).''' '''Above 7.0 the water is considered ALKALINE.''' '''Below 7.0, the water is considered ACIDIC.''' In preparation to receive the Phosphor, the water is conditioned in the following manner: Add a gallon of water, containing an '''appropriate amount of Barium Acetate,'''
(which assists the '''Potassium Silicate,''' '''[&quot;KASIL],&quot;'''which will be added to the Phosphor slurry later on). This assists the Phosphor, to adhere to the Glass face, done in the next step. Water, drawn from the first tank, will be used for the screening. The Barium is then allowed to be dispersed throughout the Batch Tank, on its own, for at least half an hour. 

If necessary, the '''disbursement may be accelerated,''' in the following manner. This is done by the use of  a Stainless Steel Pump, drawing water from, and emptying back into, '''(Re-circulating),''' the S.S. Tank, for at least 5 minutes. While the water in the first Batch Tank, is being used, the other Batch Tank is made ready the same way, so IT, is ready for instant use. When the first Batch Tank has been drained of all it's water, then the 2nd is readily available and used. Then the First Batch Tank, is again filled, from the 1,000 Gallon Storage Tank, and made READY, yet, for another cycle.

There are '''2 types of De-ionizers:''' The first, is a unit which has 4 Columns, which contain Resins to remove Dissolved Metals, both of the ANION and CATION variety, from the water being processed. The Columns are arranged, in sequential use; Anion-extraction Resins in the 1st and 3rd columns and Cation-extraction Resins in the 2nd an 4th columns. There is a electrical resistance meter, which constantly measures the resistance of the water passing through. For water containing very little dissolved metals, the meter will show 2 Million Ohms, (or HIGHER), resistance. As the Resins '''ADSORB''' the dissolved metals, the Resistance Meter, keeps dropping lower and lower.

When the Meter shows around 50,000 Ohms, (showing '''better and better conductivity,''' which is NO good for our purposes, because as it shows more and more metals being extracted from the water), The adsorbing powers are badly diminished. At that point, it is time to get rid of the metals, that the Resins  adsorbed, from the water passing through. This is accomplished, by a process called '''&quot;REGENERATION&quot;.''' Through the use of '''Muriatic Acid''' (in one set of columns, and '''Caustic Soda,''' in the other set of columns, the metals, which were '''&quot;ADSORBED&quot;''' (on the surface of the Resins), are stripped off, and flushed into the Sewer line. The DE-i is then ready to remove the dissolved metals, for another Cycle, (depending on the hardness of the water supply), for, from 100 to 150 Thousand gallons of water. The regeneration process is always the same, in using both the Muriatic Acid and the Caustic Soda, and is pretty straight forward in the 4-Column DEi. It is trickier to accomplish in the MONO-BED DE-i. Therefore, we will only discuss the complete Regeneration process, of the second type of DE-i, the MONO-BED. 

The '''Second type''' of De-i unit, is called a '''MONO-BED'''. This is a tall, (7 or more, feet high), about 18&quot; in diameter, single column unit, (generally a High-Capacity feed-through, (200 gallons per hour, or more). It contains both Anion and Cation-extracting Resins, '''[called BEDS,]''' mixed together. There is a '''&quot;porthole&quot;''' window, in the side of the mono-bed, which enables you to see the Resins in the unit. When it is working properly, in removing dissolved metals, you can see a '''homogeneous mix''' of '''light-brown Resins''' and '''dark-brown Resins.''' These '''resins not only look different,''' they also are of very different weights. This weight difference is for a very important reason. To '''regenerate''' the Resins, (when the Conductivity meter reads about 50,000 Ohms ), the Resins must first be '''separated,''' and '''stratified.''' The
light color [tan], resins, [also lighter in weight], form the upper layer, above the lower layer, and also heavier, dark-colored [Brown] Resins.

'''CAUTION:''' Do NOT allow the conductivity to get too low, as that means the Resins are saturated, and the Resins '''lose''' the '''adsorbing characteristics.''' Water containing metals, will be in the processing where you then run the risk of poisoning the Phosphor Coating, [which will not be immediately seen]. '''You WILL see it,''' after an Oven-Baking process, but even then, it could NOT be seen with the naked eye. An Ultra-violet light would be needed, to make the Phosphor fluoresce, as it would be seen, when the Tube is under Vacuum and being bombarded by the Electron Stream.''' If '''poison spots''' are detected at that time, then all that time, labor and effort are LOST, and you must re-wash the inside of the Bulb, and '''start all over again.'''

Normal water-flow operation, starts from the top of the Column, down through the Resins and then into the 1,000 Gallon S.S. Storage Tank. The '''Regeneration''' of the Resins, starts out with the separation of the Two Resins, done in the following manner: City water, at a controlled, reduced, water flow, is introduced into the DE-i, from the bottom of the unit, towards the top, (opposite normal operating-procedure). The water will go up though the Resin Bed and out to the Sewer system, via a &quot;Sight-drain&quot;. You can see and '''&quot;feel&quot;''' the water coming out of the De-i, as it enters the sight drain [water pouring out of a pipe, into a funnel like arrangement drain. Looking into the Porthole, and adjusting the water flow, you will see the lighter [Tan] Resins, start to separate from the mixed Bed, and &quot;HOVER&quot; '''(stratify)''', over the Brown [Resins], part of the bed. 

When you start to see that happening, you must check the water emanating the DE-i, as it enters the sight drain. By putting your hand in the water-flow, and rubbing your thumb and forefinger together, you will be able to ascertain, whether any resins, (normally the lighter ones), are also being expelled from the unit. Since the lightly-colored, [Tan] resins, are also the lightest, they are not readily discerned, as being dis-charged from the outgoing water. The thumb-forefinger monitoring will &quot;see&quot;, '''(feel),''' the resins emanating, [if any].

With '''careful monitoring,''', of water pressure/flow, you can separate the two types of Resins and not discharge the Resins, out with the waste water. '''CAUTION:''' If you are not careful, you may lose the whole Bed, if the pressure/water-flow is too high. At that time, the Unit will have NO functionable ability. The result is that, the unit must be put out of service, opened up and a new mix of Resins must be added. THIS IS COSTLY IN TERMS OF MONEY AND TIME. But, you do have some leeway, because of the Height of the Column, it takes more energy, for the Resins, to fight the effects of gravity, (which help keep the Resins, from being water-flowed out). Sometimes you may lose ONLY the lighter Resins. Even then, you will still have to replace those, if you lose them. There is no easy way to replace the lost Resins. You must pull apart, (nuts, bolts, and gaskets), the Mono-bed Column.

Assuming you successfully separated the Bed, then through a series of valves and bypasses, Caustic Soda is introduced to strip the dissolved metals adsorbed of one of the separated Resin beds, without impinging on the other.  Then Muriatic Acid, is introduced to strip the dissolved metals from the other bed (again, without impinging on the other Bed). This is accomplished by a clever arrangement of piping and valves, inherent with the construction of the MONO-BED.  When that is done, City water, is introduced, sequentially, from the the top, to the bottom and out the Regular Sewer Drain. This flushes all acids and dissolved metals, into the Sewer system. Checking the Conductivity Meter, as the fresh water is flushing, will reveal that conductivity is heading back up to 1 Million Ohms. The water may be used, for Screening purposes, at any time when the meter rises up to 250,000 Ohms, even while it continues on the way up [to Millions of Ohms, resistance]. 

Now, to put the unit back into operation, first, you must RE-MIX the Bed. This is accomplished by water, directing the water-flow, rising from the bottom upward. '''It will be assisted by compressed air, on command by the operator.''' This will cause an agitated disturbance, through the bubbling-up of ALL resins, ( but by a valve arrangement, in a closed loop, so you can NOT lose any resins). You may continue this &quot;merry-go-round&quot; arrangement, until you attain the homogeneous Light/dark Bed, once again. The De-i is then ready for a new cycle.    

'''Prior,''' to the water entering either De-i, it must first be particle-free of all solids and most organisms. With either type of &quot;DE-I&quot;, water from the local Water Company starts its journey, through the Rock/Sand/'''Activated-Charcoal filter,''' where it filters out all solids, present in the water. (There are more than you think, or would like to know). NOTE: Normal water-flow is from the top of the unit to the bottom. At the top you have a layer of rocks, (about the size of marbles). Below that, you may have another layer of stones, (about the size of peas). Then, comes a layer of Activated charcoal. Finally there comes a substantial amount of sand. Below the sand, you have a Screen filter (fine enough to NOT let the Sand escape, but porous enough to allow, an un-restrictive water flow)  

The layer of Rocks, Stones and Sand, trap the largest particles first, then smaller particles, then even smaller particles yet. '''Activated-Charcoal,''' also neutralizes many different organisms, contained in the water, which will be removed, later, by the Stainless Steel Filter. NOTE: Normal water flow is from the top of the Filter down through the mix, then to the next separate, (additional), S. S. Filter. You must flush out the solids, periodically, that the Rock/Sand/etc. Filter, has trapped. This is commonly called '''&quot;BACK-WASHING&quot;.''' You do this, by reversing the water flow, (AGAIN THROUGH A SERIES OF VALVES AND PIPING), with the water coming from the bottom of the unit, through the top of the unit, and then, out to the Sewer drain.

On to the S.S. filter. This filter has the ability to trap all particles AND organisms, down to 1 Micron in size. NOTE: In the summer time, during the Hot weather, algae and other micro-organisms proliferate. By use of a material called &quot;filter-aid&quot;, the S.S, filter may the trap particles as small as One Tenth of a Micron.

Finally, from the S.S. Filter, the water is directed into the 1,000 Gallon S.S. Storage Tank. From there it is released into the Batch Tank, (as needed). The Two Batch Tanks, are serviced by 1 Stainless Steel Pump, through a series of piping and valving, which allows water to be drawn from either tank, on command.

'''EXPLANATION: As stated earlier, De-ionized Water problems, FORCE EXTRAORDINARY METHODS TO BE USED.'''   

Earlier herein, it was stated that, during certain times of the year,(extended warm-climate periods), the Distilled water HAD to be used. That is because of an abnormally high Bacteria count, coupled with insufficient Chlorine treatment by the Water Company, supplying City water. It has overwhelmed the filtering capacity, of the DE-i UNIT. Myriads of the &quot;BUGS,&quot; are killed in the DE-i unit, and their remains, degenerate into a non-soluble oil. When the Water containing them, is introduced into the Tube for screening, the dead organism's remains, form protective bubbles around themselves. After the Tube is screened and the Phosphor is properly introduced, it is time for &quot;DECANTING&quot;, (POURING THE WATER OUT OF THE TUBE). The bubbles, formed at the water line, drag lines through the Phosphor, to an un-acceptable level, in the finished product, thereby resulting in the necessity of washing out the unacceptable screen, to try again. 

There are 2 possible cures for such a problem. The '''first,''' is to use a WATER-Softener, added with an &quot;eye-dropper&quot;, directly into the bulb, after the slurry is introduced. This will dissolve bubbles with air in them. Sometimes, it will also dissolve the BUGS's  protective bubbles, but sometimes it will NOT. Those bubbles, {unlike bubbles normally found in water}, have very little air in them, because they are tightly wrapped around, the dead organism.

The '''2nd solution ALWAYS works,''' but it involves an extra step, &quot;PUMPING&quot;,using  vacuum, EQUIPMENT  and extra labor. However, assuming you have Ten Tubes on the Screening table, they may ALL be connected, simultaneously, via a 2&quot; diameter metal manifold to the Vacuum pump. From the manifold, this High-Vacuum rubber hosing, [3&quot; in diameter], is jammed into the neck(s) of every tube, connecting the Tube(s),  to the Vacuum Pump.  When the mechanical vacuum pump is turned on, in about 3 minutes, enough air has been evacuated from the system, that the air pressure diminishes [reluctantly], very rapidly. The Bubbles, ('''even with minute particles of air),''' will be seen to get larger and larger, (as they resist being ruptured), but, then they ALL burst, leaving the water, bubble-free. At that point, when the settling time of the Phosphor is completed, the connections between the Vacuum Pump and the Tubes, are dis-connected. Then, the tubes may be safely decanted.

=='''ACTUAL SCREENING PROCESS'''==

'''INTRODUCE WATER IN THE BULB TO A THICKNESS OF 3 to 4 INCHES.'''

#1   One (1) to Three (3) gallons, (depending on size), of pure '''De-ionized''' or '''Distilled water,''' (containing the 1/10 th % Barium Acetate reagent), is introduced into the bulb. Next, to start the actual screening process, a water/phosphor slurry, is introduced, from a shower-like dispensing piece of hand-held equipment, called a '''“THISTLE-TUBE”''' (described later herein).  
 
==='''INTRODUCE PHOSPHOR SLURRY INTO BULB, USING THE THISTLE TUBE'''===

The amount of phosphor for each Tube proportioned therein, ranges from approx., Five (5) to Fifteen (15) Grams of Phosphor, (28 1/3 Grams to the Ounce), relative to the size of the Bulb. A '''PHOSPHOR SLURRY''' composed of Water, Phosphor AND Potassium Chloride, may dispense anywhere between Three Hundred (300) and Seven (7) Hundred Cubic Centimeters (C C ‘s), [relative to tube size]. The Potassium Chloride, {alongwith the Barium Acetate, previously put into the Batch Tank}, are combined. This will aid in the distribution of the phosphor-settling procedure. The Potassium Silicate also assists in uniform distribution of the Phosphor, by preventing '''&quot;CLUMPING&quot;''' of Phosphor particles, as well as '''&quot;Pin-holing,&quot;''' [as the name implies: small open areas, of NO phosphor coating].  

Note: An Electron Beam, can NOT portray video information, where there is NO phosphor. More importantly, the Potassium Silicate acts like a &quot;glue&quot;, to help the Phosphor particles adhere to the glass face, when the water is being poured out of the bulb, and when it is dried. Without the addition of the Two chemicals, (Barium Acetate &amp; Potassium Silicate), or even a poor ratio of one to the other, 90 % of the phosphor would exit the Bulb, when the water/slurry is pouring out, after the allotted SETTLING time. 

A '''Thistle-Tube,''' consists of a Three ( 3 ) inch  I. D., funnel-like top, about Four ( 4 ) inches high, which also has  a Fifteen (15 ) inch long, hollow, plastic tube, that has a, 1/2 inch INNER diameter. At the bottom end of the tube is a '''THIMBLE-like Cap,''' which has Fifteen (15 )or Twenty ( 20 ) holes, uniformly distributed in all sides, with Four ( 4 ) angled outward holes, ( North;  East;  South; &amp;  West), in the rounded convex bottom of the Thimble-Cap.

==='''PHOSPHOR DEPOSITS ON INNER FACE OF TUBE:'''===

The Phosphor slurry, is poured into the top of the funnel, drops down the long 15&quot; Plastic pipe and exits the Thimble-Cap end, which thereby disperses the Slurry, much like a shower head. While the Slurry is pouring out, the entire Thistle-tube is rotated, continually, 360 degrees, until emptied, so that the phosphor is uniformly dispersed into the water. The outer stream of slurry, should be directed at a point, just before where  the top of the water level, meets the wall of the Bulb. The phosphor is then allowed, undisturbed, to '''“SETTLE”,''' deposit uniformly, on the inner-side of the glass face. 

To aid a uniform deposition of the Phosphor on the Glass, a stream of hot water, is directed ( by a hose), on the outside of the Bulb, (where the Waterline is). The '''difference in Temperature,''' between the water in the bulb AND the outside periphery of the Bulb, sets up '''CONVECTION CURRENTS,''' which assist the Phosphor to be deposited evenly on the face, (as opposed to a heavy concentration in the center, and much lighter edges).  When Settling is completed, it leaves an almost perfectly clear solution, with the Phosphor laying down on the inner face of the Tube. The Settling time is Ten (10 ) minutes.  

Then the table is slowly, evenly tilted, (Tilt-Table Hydraulically '''“DECANTED”'''), so that the water pours out completely, (taking care not to encourage a '''GURGLE,''' { air attempting to enter into the Bulb, while water is attempting to leave the Bulb }. If you allow water to pour out and leave enough room for air to come in to replace the water pouring out, the newly deposited Phosphor will NOT be unduly disturbed. To be absolutely certain that air-intake and water outflow, can both be accommodated, do the following: Get a 1/2&quot; I.D. plastic or polyethylene tubing about 14&quot; in length, warm in hot water, until it becomes pliable, Bend it in a 1/2 &quot;U' shape, and pour or douse cold water through it, and it will retain '''THAT''' shape. When the Slurry has finished being introduced, insert the bent plastic/polyethylene tubing in the neck of the Bulb, such that both ends will point in the &quot;UP&quot; direction when the table has been decanted 90 Degrees. No matter how fast the water pours out, there is absolutely NO chance, for any screen-disturbing gurgles, to occur.  

Total elapsed Phosphor-coating time, including “settling” time , is about Thirteen (13 ) minutes, for a Table-Load of Eight (8) to Ten (10 ) Bulbs.

==='''FORCED-AIR DRYING OF NEWLY-DEPOSITED PHOSPHOR COATING ( SCREEN )'''===

#2 When ALL water has left the Bulb, leaving  it completely empty, un-clamp the Tube from the table (when the neck is pointed to the ground and do NOT allow any residual water to flow back onto the screen. Place the tube (neck first), over a thin Standpipe which is connected to a mild, slow-speed, warm-air dryer (much like a hair dryer), which will dry the wet screen (including the interior of the bulb). NOTE: The top of that pipe should be closed-off, so as to NOT blow air, directly on the freshly-deposited phosphor. But the Pipe, WILL have holes emanating from all around the sides of the pipe, near the top, [NOT in the neck]. The Screen-dry time takes about Ten (10 ) Minutes.

=='''PREPARING SCREEN FOR LACQUER DEPOSITION FOR THE ALUMINIZING PROCESS:'''== 
#3 Remove the Bulb from  the Dryer, and gently, lay the Tube on its side. While the bulb, is on its side, with the  opening  in the  neck, (facing you), re-wet the phosphor screen, using a 3/8 th or 1/2” curved, inner-diameter, polyethylene tube (approx 1/2“ long), with a solution containing distilled or de-ionized water. The solution contains a 3% Potassium Chloride addition, [the Phosphor-binding/anti clumping chemical]. When re-wetting, care should be taken, NOT to pour the solution directly on the Phosphor Screen. Let it be started, to be poured, into a side of the tube, and then, when there is about 250 CC's poured in, lift the tube and swirl the water all over the Phosphor face, re-wetting the entire Screen. Do NOT unduly disturb the phosphor coating.  

NOTE:  Do NOT use tap water, as this will absolutely contaminate ('''“poison”''') the screen. This contamination will not be readily discernible in the initial stages of manufacture, but after baking (a '''later step)''', you will see '''round colored spots,''' [even though this is a black and white screen (tube)], appearing all over the screen. These colored spots, would ALWAYS  be seen and therefore unacceptable to the viewer). Next: Allow the Tube to drain, momentarily, and then place the tube on a piece of equipment, which may rotate the Tube. The centrifugal force generated will even out any excess water remaining on the face. Place the Tube on a 'Screen-dryer&quot;, and dry the screen. After baking, an Ultra Violet shining on the tube face, (in broad daylight, would make the screen light up) {fluoresce}, as if it were being impacted by the Electron Beam while under vacuum. Green spots,(like measles), would indicate COPPER contamination, Brass spots show as Blue, whereas Purple-colored spot will indicate IRON contamination. If the bulb is allowed to continue to completion, eventually, when video information is displayed, Green, Purple and Blue spots, (in stationary positions), in ALL White display scenes, would make the picture(s) un-acceptable. This would be much like Station identification burns/skull and crossbones burns that were the bane of the old Straight-Gun, non aluminized, Black and White Dumont Television Tubes, (circa 1945). Except, this time, the '''Color spots will show up in Black And White, Picture Tubes.'''

=='''APPLICATION OF LACQUER COATING:'''==

Again, re-wet the just dried screen, (as we just did), but this time, introduce WATER, with a Twenty Percent (30 %) mix, of a fine polymer lacquer, and a (10 %) Potassium Chloride, gently onto the same Screen. Allow to drip for One ( 1 ) minute. Place the newly-lacquered Bulb on a spinning machine {at Thirty (30 ) RPM}. The centrifugal force, as before, generated, causes the lacquer to spread evenly, over the entire screen area.  Elapsed time about Three (3) minutes.

=='''WASH AWAY LACQUER IN ALL AREAS OF THE INSIDE OF THE BULB, EXCEPT THE SCREEN:'''==

#4 Since we '''do Not want''' residual lacquer to be positioned over the entire inside of the Bulb, '''  ( we really do NOT want it on the Screen either),''' but it serves an extremely important function, '''{which will be revealed later}''', and '''MUST BE DONE [temporarily].'''  Place the  neck of CRT around a flexibly-curved, [1/2 U-shaped], plastic pipe on another spinning, [6 RPM] machine, which dispenses water in a fine non-splashing stream of water. This will wash out, trim, away) all lacquer and water, from the interior of the bulb (while spinning), '''EXCEPT''' the Phosphor Screen. Start the washing at the interior of the bulb, (while revolving), beginning at about Three (3) inches from the top inside face, of the Bulb, from where the Phosphor Screen lies.  Elapsed time about Three (3) minutes.

''' NOTE:''' This lacquer will be baked out in a later operation, but for now, will protect the Phosphor Screen from the '''Aluminizing application''' to be performed next. If the lacquer is not removed properly, then in that case, when the CRT is functioning in a normal T.V. set, it will be reduced to a Gas, where its molecules will interfere with Electron Beam and cause a '''“Fuzzy”''' of '''“Blurry''' picture, when in use. More importantly, the Gas molecules will attack the Cathode Coating, by depositing a BLACK, non-Electron-releasing substance, which would interfere with, and '''dramatically shorten the life of the Cathode Coating, hence the Tube.'''

'''NOTE,''' some more: Certain erudite Engineers, developed a device, which could apparently re-activate the Electron-creating Cathode Coating, by removing the Black layer of substance, from its surface. The coating underneath was still able to produce Electrons, but the black surface coating prevented their release. They called this process '''“re-activation”''' or '''“rejuvenation”''' of the CRT. It REALLY WORKED and could restore,  IMMEDIATELY, the presentation of the picture from a low light output picture to a beautiful high light (normal) picture. In fact some tubes were even better than new, because there was always a slight layer of black deposition, deposited thereon, from other sources. The terrific positive end-result was because of the way the Reactivation device worked. 

''''''Here IS THE SECRET:''''''  A High Voltage, probably as high as 1,000 volts, was placed for (1) fraction of a second only, between the cathode and G1 (when normally they are NOT interconnected). In fact they had to be separate, for the T.V. Tube/Set to function properly. That High-Voltage created an ARC, which blasted/vaporized, the unwanted coating, away.  Because that process also created a great amount of heat, the resultant was observed immediately. Remember, Electrons are generated from the Cathode Coating, by the heat,(800 Degrees C), supplied by the filament. 

'''RE-DRY THE WET LACQUERED SCREEN:'''

# 5 Put the mostly lacquer-free Bulb back on the dryer and dry everything, once again.  Elapsed time about Ten (10) minutes.

==='''COAT THE INSIDE WITH AN HIGHLY-ELECTRIC, CONDUCTIVE COATING:'''===

# 6  Place the screened tube on a piece of equipment, which may be rotated, that has a tube holder, and is able to spin the Bulb as slow, or as fast, as the operator desires. Using a tiny brush (about Two (2) inches in length, and about 3/8ths&quot; wide, containing bristles about 1/2 “ long. Apply, [paint], a black conductive coating (AQUADAG/ Dixonac), to the entire inside of the bulb.  Make sure that the coating  touches, and completely contacts/surrounds, the Anode button, (the metal anode button fused into the bulb). That metal button, is  common to the INSIDE of the tube, as well as to the OUTSIDE. Ultimately, it will become the '''path for High Voltage to come into the Electron Gun)'''. 

It may be &quot;PAINTED&quot;, with hand-brush-applying strokes, (throughout the entire bulb), or by spinning the bulb, while holding the brush still. The spinning-machine action, causes the paint to be spread, uniformly, throughout the whole inside. Spinning and painting round Tubes is no problem. Rectangular tubes are a bit more tricky to so do. NOTE: Take care, that the coating does NOT splash/impact,(from the brush), onto the Phosphor Screen.  Elapsed time to achieve painting about, Three (3) minutes.   '''DRY THE INSIDE AGAIN'''

# 7  Place the Bulb  neck, around another low-speed-air Screen Dryer, to dry the conductive coating painting. Time to dry Dixonac coating about Seven (7) minutes.

=='''PLACE TUBE UNDER VACUUM TO APPLY ALUMINUM OVER THE WHOLE INSIDE OF THE BULB'''==

# 8  '''ALUMINIZING PROCESS:''' Remove the tube from the dryer. Place the neck, around a Electrode, protruding upward in an Aluminizing  Machine, up to the “Yoke” area, (where the neck, joins the bulb proper). That confirms that the Tube is tightly enclosed in the machine, so the Tube may be put under Vacuum. The Electrode, contains a (Tungsten), heavy-duty-use-cycle Coil. Place a pre-measured piece (slug) of aluminum, (about 3/8 ths long by a 1/4 of an inch thick) in the Coil, (much like the filament in a light bulb, which is in a  horizontal alignment. Starting the Aluminizing Machine up, a Vacuum Pump, (part of the machine/operation), draws a vacuum on the enclosed CRT. 

'''VAPORIZE ALUMINUM SLUG, WHICH DEPOSITS THE ALUMINUM, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INTERIOR.'''  ''''''EXCEPT, SEE BELOW''' 
'''
When the Vacuum is completed, on command, the Tungsten coil, (at 12 to 14 Volts), dispensing between  45 to 60  Amps of electricity, causes the aluminum slug (pellet), to slowly melt into a liquid ball. It then finally disburses, (like a cloud of steam), until the whole slug of Aluminum has been evaporated from the Coil, (also called '''“SPUTTERING”). '''The resultant cloud of Aluminum particles would then condense/solidify, thereby attached, uniformly, '''(SEE EXCEPT BELOW),''' over the entire inside of the Bulb, (including the Phosphor Screen AND the Aquadag conductive coating).  Elapsed time about Twenty (20) Minutes. Some systems may be able to draw a Vacuum on as many as 6 tubes, at a time, in any given instance. But, they are '''&quot;SPUTTERED&quot;''', '''sequentially,''' thereby effectuating the process, in as little as 30 minutes, [5 minutes per tube].

'''EXCEPT:''' In instances of '''poor vacuum-achievement,''' (at any time, for any reason), then in that case(s), the aluminization results in a heavy deposition, [in the form of a BULLS-EYE], in the center of the screen, with much less of an ALUMINUM deposition, around the periphery. The poor vacuum attained, may be because of improper seating/sealing of the bulb into the unit, or because the process is timer-controlled, {ready or not, here I come}. This may occur as different tube sizes are processed, and the timer is not adjusted accordingly. Or perhaps, NOT under direct command of an operator, OR even because, it WAS under operator command, and he made an error. Sometimes, [depending on the system used], when the sputtering is NOT controlled by a gas-pressure device, [or for many other reasons], when the vacuum is NOT low enough, the resultant will be poor.

'''Unfortunately,''' this result will NOT be seen, until the CRT is fully processed and at one of the final stages of '''manufacturing-&quot;TESTING&quot;.''' Few test regimes, plan for detecting this problem, and most CRT manufacturers never detected it, until it was returned from the consumer.  SEE '''&quot;BLANK-OFF&quot;,''' in '''TESTING.'''  SEE '''HYPOTHESIS''' next. '''In fact, this author is the only person/manufacturer known, [including ALL the well-known major manufacturers, such as RCA, Sylvania, GE], ever, even testing, for it. 

The '''HYPOTHESIS''' for this anomaly is '''as follows:''' When the filament in the unit is activated, the tremendous amount of heat generated, forces all gasses, [developed or residual], to compress those gasses, in an equal diameter, in '''ALL DIRECTIONS,''' to the outer extremities of the inside of the evacuated tube, away from the tremendous heat. This condition, presents very little opposition, for the vaporizing Aluminum which is to be deposited, in the center of the bulb. While, it also presents more opposition, to the vaporizing aluminum particles, which were supposed to be deposited, in the extremities. Therefore, there is a greater amount of Aluminum vaporized/positioned, in the center area, than that, of the extremities. 

The '''REASON'''  FOR THE'''BULLSEYE !'''  '''The quest for BLANK-OFF!'''  See '''BLANK-OFF below.''' The Electron Stream, needs the power of at least 5,000-10,000 Volts [dependent on tube size], placed on the Anode, for the Electron/Ion stream, to be able to penetrate, {and illuminate), the Phosphor, residing in front of the deposited, solidified aluminum. While the Electron Stream has the speed/power, to penetrate the thinner portions of the Aluminum deposition, it is '''NOT able to penetrate the thicker center-parts''' of the aluminum, (presenting a Black BULLS-EYE,image). If you continue to reduce the high voltage, the BULLSEYE attains an ever-widening diameter. Lowering the high voltage towards 5,000 Volts, would reveal the BULLSEYE DARK AREA, growing such, that it now occupies more area, than the lighted portion, (outer edges), of the CRT.

'''BLANK-OFF occurs,''' when the High Voltage is continually reduced, (down to approximately 5,000 Volts), with '''NO appearance of the dark BULLS-EYE,''' and the Screen goes to black. Yow will find that, that brightness of the '''RASTER,''' [a '''fully-illuminated WHITE screen,''' displayed with NO video information], is excellent. This BLANK-OFF of the raster, while never approaching actual outside use, is important, because it indicates that the Aluminum was deposited, in an excellent, low-gas environment. NOTE: Whenever such a perfect Aluminized Tube Raster is displayed, perfect focus is easily demonstrated, by the appearance of sharp, horizontal scan lines, going into, or out of focus, '''as the focus voltage is increased/decreased.'''  

'''WHY DOES THE BULLS-EYE OCCUR IN THE PERSON'S HOME, BUT NOT IN THE COMMON TESTING PROCEDURE(s) ?''' The '''ANSWER to that question is''': Many different voltages, are generated from STEP-UP/STEP DOWN TRANSFORMERS, inherent in the T.V. Chassis's. The High Voltage circuit, (FLY-BACK TRANSFORMER), chiefly  responsible for accelerating the Electron Stream, is extremely sensitive, to the varying voltage inputs from the local Power Company(ies). Generally, the Power Company(s), will deliver NO lower than 108 Volts A.C., but NO higher than 125 volts. Prolonged exposure to either extremity, will cause problems, in different chassis voltages, but especially in the High-Voltage generation. Further, many times, as the set ages, voltages become critical, because in those days, the also were controlled by small tubes, in associated circuits. These tubes started losing power, with age, also. 

In the final analysis, the BULLSEYE problem occurs:

'''1),'''  when the CRT has been '''poorly sputtered,'''

'''2),'''  coupled with the '''lower minimum A.C. Voltage,''' and 

'''3),'''  at certain critical '''light/dark scenes being received/portrayed''' by the video information sent to it. This may be a fleeting, temporary occurrence, or a lengthy, [of several minute duration], event. See '''EXAMPLE''' next.

'''EXAMPLE'''  A  '''16&quot;/17&quot;  Television set,''' will have a requirement for an Anode Voltage of some '''14,000 Volts.''' At that voltage, the BULLSEYE will NEVER appear. But, when the Input A.C. voltage approaches 108 Volts, and the video does  NOT  require certain lightening/darkening of the picture, it may be of such minimum duration, that the persistence of the phosphor, negates that problem. But, when there is prolonged minimal input-voltage, (108 Volts), the Bullseye would appear more frequently, than NOT. In practice, when this would happen, and if under Warranty, the consumer would demand and receive, a FREE replacement CRT. Later on [years], as the T.V. set ages, there will be a normal degradation of voltage(s), from the chassis tube suppliers, and be of such infrequent notice, that the consumer will opt, [because of monetary consideration], to ignore same.

=='''GET RID OF ALL TRACES OF LACQUER IN THE TUBE INCLUDING THAT, DEPOSITED ON SCREEN:'''==
'''BAKING THE BULB AT HIGH TEMPERATURE'''  

# 9  Place the Aluminized tube in an High Temperature Heating Oven and bake at 410 Degrees C , {slightly  higher that of the regular processing Temperature (400 C)}, which will be done later. Essentially, this baking cycle, will thoroughly dry all material, put into the bulb, for processing,  and to initialize de-gasification. Most importantly, the High Temperature will vaporize, to the atmosphere, ALL Lacquer put in, (including that, which also covered the Phosphor Screen), via the previous operation. When the High Temperature Baking process is completed, there is an '''infinitely small space''' between the Aluminum and the Phosphor Screen. The aluminum will be '''held in place by electrostatic action,''' '''assisted''' by the '''solidified aluminum,''' (however thin), coating. Elapsed time about Forty-five (45) minutes.

==='''VISUAL INSPECTION OF ELECTRON GUN, ''BEFORE'' SEALING INTO THE TUBE NECK:'''===

First, prepare a tray ( 5 X 12 ), of “DRESSED” guns, to be sealed into the neck of the Bulb, so that a vacuum may be achieved only through the tubulation, which is part of the Gun structure. Give a quick check to see if the filament is in the correct position in the Cathode Cylinder, (Two turns of the “HEATER” {Filament} coil is optimum ). If there are more than Two ( 2 ) turns visible, use a Tweezers (on hand and needed for the sealing operation), and press them in gently, to the required Two (2) turns. If LESS than Two (2) turns, gently pull back the connecting links to expose Two(2) turns.

'''NOTE:''' '''''EXTREMELY IMPORTANT'''''  

When MORE THAN Two (2) turns are viewed, the Filament will be located too far away from the inner top of the Cathode Cylinder, which holds the Coating, (on the surface of that Cathode Cylinder. That will affect the conversion/processing, (converting the Coating Oxides into Carbonates). If the conversion process is not completed when under vacuum, then when the Tube is sealed off from the Vacuum system, that process, will release additional gas, which will shorten the life of the Cathode (Tube). Also, the Filament being located further away from the Cathode will create a longer WARM-UP time, [more that Ten (10) seconds], which is not desirable, when in the T.V. Set.  

If  LESS  than Two (2) turns are visible, then that means that the Filament has be squeezed into a much smaller configuration, which would make it compress/enlarge, thereby making it closer to the walls or even pushed against the walls of the Cathode Cylinder. This would cause Electrical leakage, between the Two (2) Elements {Filament in A. C. and Cathode  in D.C.}. It could also generate, visually and acoustically, a 60 Cycle hum. Eventually, it would cause a “Short Circuit” and burn out the Filament.

Next inspect the Grid connections and the Cathode connections. Make sure they are NOT touching other elements, or even, NOT connected, [broken or failed weld]. Adjust (DRESS) all wires to stay close to the tubulation of the gun, so that may easily fit into the pin of the un-movable portion  of the individual revolving heads, of the Sealing Machine. When visually O.K., fit the glass tubulation(s) into the glass tubulation-diameter holes, [Sixty (60), IN A(5) BY (12)-HOLED-TRAY], for use, as needed, in the Sealing Operation.

=='''PREPARING FOR THE ACTUAL SEALING OPERATION'''==

# 10  When the Bulb has cooled sufficiently, it is ready for the '''“SEALING”''' operation. Insert the Electron Gun into the Tube neck, making sure the '''SPIDERS''' are touching the Aquadag Coating. NOTE: The SPIDERS, because of their spring-like ability, hold the Gun in place before sealing.  Then place the selected to-be-sealed GUN into the selected Tube in a small pre-heating Oven-Box, which is placed near the sealing machine and placed, NECK ONLY, in that preheated, 250 Degrees F oven. This small oven contains temperature-controlled, Gas-air fired, burners. This preheats the neck only, where work will be done.  

The Sealing Machine joins the glass, '''WAFER-LIKE Glass-part,''' of the Electron gun,(which contains already encapsulated, sealed wires), to the glass neck of the Tube. It does this by melting a part of the glass neck, (at a predetermined distance  from where the neck joins the Bulb proper), merging/ joining the Bulb neck and the gun, into One piece. The Electron Gun Elements/Structure, is also attached to these wires. They will provide Electrical connections to those Elements, (which will be under vacuum), to the Voltage-providing circuits of the CHASSIS, which are located OUTSIDE of the vacuum. Time elapsed in oven pre-heat, approximately Five (5) Minutes..

=='''SEALING-MACHINE'''  DESCRIPTION  AND  PROCESS'''==

#11 A large Plate, (3 to 5 feet in diameter), on the SEALING MACHINE, revolves at One (1) complete Revolution every Six (6) minutes. The Plate is programmed, to go to Eight (8) fixed positions, per every 45 seconds. Of the 8 positions, the '''1st,''' is for loading the Tube, (NOT in a Fire-zone); the '''next 2''' positions are in pre-heat Fire-Zones, (Gas/air); then the '''following 2''' positions are in the WORKING-fires, Zones, (Gas/Oxygen); again, followed by '''2 more Zones,''' (Gas/Air), of Annealing Fires; '''finally One, ''' Fire-free Zone, for unloading the sealed-gun tube. 

On this large diameter revolving plate, there are a number of revolving '''“HEADS”''', (from Two to 4 Heads, (dependent on the  size of the machine), located on the outer circumference of the main plate. These revolving, (15 RPM) Heads, are constructed such as, to hold the Tube, in an upright position, (neck down). Located in the center of each, is  a fixed-height, hollow STANDPIPE. This standpipe arrangement, always remains fixed, at the same height, (for ALL heads), at all times, while the '''head may be moved up or down.''' At the very top of the Standpipe arrangement, there are removable parts called “PINS”. These pins, (about 1 1/4 inches in height), may be extracted and other types put in its place. (I do NOT know why they call them PINS, because they sure do NOT look like a PIN). 

These Pins may be exchanged, when they wear out, because the tops of them are exposed to GAS/OXYGEN fires, in the normal operation of the SEALING MACHINE, which eventually burns away the top of the pin. This is NOT desirable, because the glass-working fires are positioned relative to the height of the pin. When the pin is lowered, (because of degradation), the working fires, (Gas/Oxygen), are NOT then in the proper place. The cut-off positioning would then be ABOVE the glass wafer of the gun, NOT 
below, where it belongs. Otherwise, the principal reason for exchange  is to accommodate different glass diameters of the tubulations, [from Twenty Millimeters (20 MM), to 3/4 “ I.D., which of course also has varying wafer sizes], for the multiplicity of different tube sizes. While the heads, holding the gunned tubes may rotate about 15 times a minute, the main plate, is timed to rotate at only One (1) fixed POSITION per 45 seconds, {of Eight (8) positions}, or Six ( 6 ) minutes, to make One (1) complete revolution). As previously disclosed, One position is to load the Tube on the Head, while another position is used to unload the sealed-in Electron gun. 

Because of the many differences in Tube shapes/types, (Round, rectangular), and varying  Deflection Angles, the Tube neck-Lengths vary in length, (anywhere between Three (3) to Seven (7) inches). Measurements, at the time of sealing, are accomplished by a cardboard, (corrugated), Ruler, marked-off for various Neck lengths. Any metal ruler used, would crack the Hot Glass neck.

In positioning the length and sealing the Glass of the Electron Structure to the neck, a space is allocated for the molten, remnant, bottom part of the neck to be able to drop after sealing,[assisting the gravity drop],  (of at least One ( 1 ) inch, but not more the Two ( 2 ) inches). This dropping action, both thins the glass at the appropriate point, but also assists the molten Glass of the neck, to be '''forced into''' (by the thrust of the GAS/Oxygen fires), '''the neck.''' Thus it seals, AND severs the molten glass, from the CRT and the piece to be discarded. That is a reminder, that Pin height is very important.  Severing, is then accomplished, by using a Tweezers (about Four (4) to Five(5) inches in length), which when used in conjunction with air pumped into that area, plucks the glass away. The cutting/melting of the Glass wafer, completes the Electron Gun sealing-in process. 

At that point, air is introduced into the Tube itself, through the Tubulation, as to counter-act the force/pressure of the Gas/Oxygen Jets and to ROUND out the area which was molten, as it is now starting to cool and harden (set up). Glass, does NOT like/want, sharp edges, heavy corners nor  thick-and-thin, adjacent areas. (Annealing/cooling periods for each are so different, that they set up a strain in the glass at that point. '''Glass is always much stronger, when it is rounded out.''' IF it must be thick for any reason, then considerable time and care should be allocated to SLOWLY 
cool/(anneal) it, or it will surely crack at a later date.

==='''SEALING-MACHINE PARTS:'''===

There are at least Two (2) clusters of Gas-air positions of PRE-HEATING fires, (so the glass does not crack from being too rapidly heated). Next, there are Two (2) sets of clusters, of Gas-Oxygen fires. These fires do the actual work, ( melting the glass of the neck, into that of the glass of the Electron Gun ), which also contains the  Electrical wires for future connections), AND the tubulation, (straw-shaped, with a 3/8” inner diameter). The tubulation, will be used for attachment to the Vacuum Pumps, {the next step, when annealing is completed}. Then, there are Two positions of clusters of Gas-Air sets of fires (to allow the heated molten glass to slow down in the “cooling” process, of the sealing operation. In glass work, this cooling process is ALWAYS USED and called “ANNEALING”. 

==='''ANNEALING PROCESS AFTER SEALING:'''===

The tube is then placed in a '''“cooling”-oven''' (neck and gun only), which is set at approximately 150 Degrees F, so as to cool the fused glass slowly, for about Three (3) Minutes. Total elapsed time to seal One (1) tube with a single-headed machine is approximately Fourteen (14) minutes. NOTE: If a Two (2) headed machine is used, then that time may be reduced to Seven (7) Minutes. A Four Headed machine may reduce the time to Three (3) minutes. High-production machines usually have the ability, and the necessary resources, to seal One Tube, per Minute.

=='''&quot;PUMPING&quot;:  PUTTING THE TUBE UNDER HIGH VACUUM '''==

# 12  Now the “gunned” bulb is ready for the High Vacuum step and de-gasification, procedure, commonly called “PUMPING”. The  bulb, with the gun sealed in, contains the glass tubulation, as a part of the complete Gun structure. This tubulation is used to attach the Tube to the '''VACUUM-PRODUCING PUMPS.''' This is accomplished either of Two (2) ways:  #1.  When using Glass-Oil Diffusion Pumps, (see '''DESCRIPTION of GLASS and/or METAL DIFFUSION PUMPS),''' a Glass-to-Glass joining of the CRT, called '''SPLICING,''' [VIA THE TUBULATION], and the Vacuum system, is made with a gas/air torch, in the following manner: Cut the glass '''&quot;RISER,&quot;''' '''[tubulation], protruding UP from the Glass manifold,''' (by scoring it with a knife file), and snap it off with your fingers. Then measure the glass tubulation, emanating from the Glass wafer of the Electron Gun, (by eye, coupled with experience). Match it up with the '''Diffusion-pump riser,''' just prepared/cut, and score IT with the knife-file and snap that off also. Then, using a hand-held, '''2-headed gas/air torch,''' (held together by a U-shaped torch, with jets facing each other], pre-heat the glass [both ends], gradually increasing the heat, until both ends are molten. Then place one end on top of the other, until melted together.  To assist in the splicing maneuver, access to the inside of the Diffusion pump manifold/system, (including the Tube being sealed in), is provided by a small tubulation, thru which the operator may blow into. This is also part of the Glass manifold, as well as a part of the Diffusion-Pump system).
 
This is so that you may counter the force exerted, {while joining the 2 pieces of glass}, from the Gas/air flame (Torch) . A rubber tubing when  affixed to the small tubulation, is used by the Sealer, in the following manner: One end is attached to that manifold tubulation, while the other end of the rubber tubing, is fitted with a hand-made glass mouthpiece. This allows the Sealer, to blow air (from his mouth}, at the appropriate time, in the splicing operation. When the splicing is completed,AND annealed, then the Gas-air torch, is used to close off that small tubulation also, so the whole system is Vacuum-tight/ready.

A small CRT manufacturer, might use 2 '''STATIONARY OVENS,''' each capable of containing 2 movable units, (on rails), with each unit containing 6 Picture tubes, which were sealed in (as just discussed). The glass manifold connected 2 tubes, (on opposite sides of each other), on every movable unit. There were 4 movable units, (each unit, comprised of 3 pairs, for a total of 6 Tubes. Each 2-tube combination, joined by a Glass manifold, was attached to, and an integral part of the system, which was  powered by 1 Mechanical Vacuum Pump and 1,  3-stage Diffusion pump.  There were 2 operators, to treat these 4 units. The ovens, could each hold 2 movable units, at the same time. Each operator would work on 1 Unit at a time, in the following manner:  

Assume the Ovens were situated in an East/West alignment. One unit, situated on the South side, is pulled out of the Oven, by East Operator #1, (each leaving a unit still in their respective, [East/West], side(s) of the Oven.) West Operator #2 pulls a Unit out of the Oven on the North side. Each operator works concurrently, but independently, of the other. When each Operator is finished, (tipped off), his unit, of six Tubes, he then seals in another 6 tubes , to be processed, and shoves it back into the Oven, (where only 1 Unit remains). In the meantime the other operator does the same on his side of the oven. Then East Operator #1, pulls a Unit from the North side of the Oven, while West Operator #2, pulls a Unit out of the South side of the Oven. Each complete cycle (as hereinbefore explained), takes 2 Hours. Since this &quot;PUMPING&quot; operation, continues around-the-clock, on a 6-day basis, the maximum amount of tubes, expected to be Pumped, (manufactured), at this plant,  is 864 Tubes. Any tubes lost in the process will be deducted from the Total.  NOTE: Having 2 tubes on a manifold is less costly for initial start up and even for maintenance requirements, the weak point is, that when you lose 1 Tube, you also lose the other because they are both attached to the same Exhaust system. 

As this small manufacturer grew, he generally opted for a continuous in-line Tube-Exhaust system, using Metal Diffusion Pumps. This system, consists of a long Oven, 75 to 100 feet long, (depending on production requirements). The Oven is compartmented off, so that the Tube(s) going through the length of it, are:
  
1. '''Preheated''';
  
2. Incrementally brought up to '''temperature''' (in 3 or more Zones);  

3. Kept at '''400 Degrees C.,''' '''732 Degrees F.,''' for 1/2 hour;  

4. '''Cooled/annealed,''' (in 3 or more descending-heat-supplied Zones); and 2 or 3 Zones of '''no-heat-supplied Zones.''' 

Each unit, [DOLLY's], are attached like train cars, and contain a Mechanical Pump, (main vacuum-producing pump), AND a Metal Diffusion Pump, (gas-removal), pump. Each Tube is mounted, [neck-end through], an R.F.-producing coil, when the R.F. generator calls upon it, so that the Electron Gun may be heated, for de-gasification. Wires emanating from the Electron gun, are then attached to a power-supply, by spring loaded copper fingers, emanating from each dolly.  Each Dolly also has means to access the R.F. (automatically). The filament voltages, are fed, (incrementally), up, to a &quot;hot-shot,&quot; and down again. Each Dolly has a large piece of metal, that acts like a shield, (for protection from IMPLOSIONS from other Tubes, in the assembly-line Dollies).    

The metal diffusion pump receives the tubulation of the Glass wafer of the Electron gun, which is fitted into a '''“compression port”,''' (which is part of the Vacuum arrangement). That compression Port, is part of the 3-stage oil-diffusion pump, (sometimes referred to as a (FRACTIONATING PUMP). It is constantly water-cooled, as it IS in the heated oven. The primary, high-speed Mechanical Vacuum Pump, for both the Glass or Metal diffusion pumps, is the same, in both cases.

==='''TYPES, COMPOSITION, LOCATION and FUNCTION OF VACUUM PUMPS'''===

The '''Glass 3-stage Diffusion Pump''', is a  3 1/2&quot; diameter Glass manifold, ('''Main body'''), which has 3 round glass Pots, [two of which have 2&quot; diameter and one, at the end, of 1&quot; Diameter, [called a &quot;condensing pot). The Pots are  arranged below, and connected to, the Main body, and '''also inter-connected to each other.''' One part of the Glass pump is connected to the Glass manifold, through a Glass trap, (much like the one under your sink). That connection is made with a high temperature sealing wax, coating the '''&quot;GROUND-Glass&quot;,''' '''male end''', of the manifold, to the '''Ground-glass female part''' of the Glass Trap. 

BACK TO THE POTS: Each of these Pots, contain a heating element, {which looks like a thick element in a light bulb}. When the Vacuum system is in operation, the Three stages, each individually vaporize the oil in them. As the Oil-vapor rises, it goes through the Main body, until they each enter '''their own section of water-jacketed parts of the Main body.''' Then, the vapor, mixed with the molecules of gas being generated from the Tube, condense and full back toward the original source, the Pots. This is basically, a re-circulation of the oil, but it does have the effect that, it compresses the gas molecules, and passes them over to the Mechanical Pump, where the gasses  are then transferred to the atmosphere. 

There were several types of oil used, in both Glass and Metal Diffusion pumps. Two of the most Common were '''&quot;OCTOIL S&quot;''' AND '''&quot;SILICONE&quot;''' OIL. In the 1950's, the Octoil S, was priced at $10.00 Dollars a gallon, while the Silicone Oil, was priced at $125.00 a Gallon. Octoil S had to be replaced, every time the system was reduced to air, while the oil was at operating temperature. This was because the '''oil oxidized''' and was NO longer efficient, at de-gassing the system. 

1. The Glass Manifold above the trap, was first removed; 

2. the connection to the Mechanical pump was dis-connected; 

3. then the pump was loosened from the supports underneath the Oven, and removed. 

4.  The Diffusion pump was then emptied, cleaned out, dried, and new OIL,[Oct-Oil S,] introduced. This happened every time, there was an implosion, and/or, for whatever reason, the Vacuum system was exposed to air, while the oil was hot. 
  
NOTE: Silicone Oil, expensive as it was, had several distinct advantages over the Octoil S. 
It was '''stable to air, at operating temperatures&quot;.''' 

Very importantly, [with the Silicone oil,] lower, better gas pressures, were always reached. Some Glass manifolds had an '''&quot;Ionization&quot; gas Bulb''' attached also. When gas pressures reached the 5 times Ten to the Minus 5 range, or better [lower,] after processing, [immediately before &quot;TIPPING-off&quot;,] the CRT's could be removed. It was not unusual to find the tubes in the Minus 7 range. When working with small tubes, such as the 5&quot;, 7&quot;, 10&quot;, 12,&quot; 13&quot;, or 14' rectangular, pressures in the 1 times 10, to the minus 8 range, could be achieved. EXPLANATION: The speed of the pumps was the same, but smaller Tubes, had less volume to be evacuated. Of course then, there was less material contained therein, to generate additional gasses. Hence '''better/lower, Vacuum pressure(s),''' could/'''WOULD BE ACHIEVED.''' 

The '''METAL DIFFUSION PUMPS:'''

Basically, the Metal Pumps, were composed of an upright 3&quot; diameter piping, (metal sleeve), about 14 inches in height. To heat the oil, [which effected the gas-removing aspects of the pump], it contained, an ''' Insulated Metal Coil,''' [so it wouldn't short out], because everything was made out of metal. This coil was located in the pot, [at the bottom of the cylinder]. The top of the pump, had a Compression arrangement, which received the tubulation of the CRT. A copper 1/4&quot; tubing, was wound around the entire body of the pump. This copper tubing, was sealed 100% to the pump, so that it came with, and was part of the pump. This was connected, on installation in the oven, to a water line. If no water, is used, then the pump will not work.  Worse yet, if no water is used, then the oil vapors, rise into the Tube itself, and poison the Screen AND the Cathode coating. At that point, all materials AND work are lost, and the Tube(s) must be re-built. Inside the Metal pump, is an insert composed of a metal cylinder, shaped not unlike a Christmas tree, the bottom of which resides in the pool of Oil.  When the Oil is heated, there are 3 separate exits in the Insert, (in effect a 3-stage pump], for the Oil vapor to rise, mix with gas generated, condense and transfer the compacted gas molecules, to the Mechanical pump, for evacuation from the system.   

All pumps, are '''always located, BELOW''' the Glass manifold/compression port, (NOT in the gas-heated portion of the oven), BUT '''ARE''' part of the Vacuum System, which IS, in the 400 Degree C , (752 Degrees F ), High-Temperature Oven. There are '''TWO''' (2) '''Vacuum Pumps,''' for each tube to be processed, at the same time, as they are being baked. The reason for Two (2) Pumps is, because there is no single pump which may pull the high vacuum, necessary, for proper-functioning and long life,of the Tube, at an extremely high speed, as economics demand.

The Mechanical pump is  required, to pump out rapidly, the tremendous amounts of gasses involved in manufacture. These gasses are both inherent in all materials used for its construction, as well gasses being generated by the great amount of heat by the high temperatures used in processing. At the same time, they are required to produce an extremely low gas-containing condition. NOTE: Since water,(which is composed of Oxygen and Hydrogen), was used in copious amounts, it was found that to complete dis-association, (separating Oxygen from Hydrogen), in  water, temperatures under vacuum conditions, would require at least 385 Degrees C, (725 Degrees F), to so do.

==='''TYPES OF VACUUM SYSTEMS (PUMPS)'''===

1. The '''High-Speed mechanical vacuum pump,''' very rapidly, (Four (4) to Six (6) minutes, ( depending on the tube size, in conjunction with the speed of the pump ), evacuates the system, {which contains a secondary pump, called a Three (3) stage '''“Oil Diffusion''' Pump”.  That Diffusion Pump, is responsible for achieving very low gas conditions, while the Tube is being baked. Additionally, it is removing the Gas which is also being generated/liberated, by the 400 Degrees C., (752 F), heat of the Oven. It will continue to remove gas, generated from processing, (to come), of the Cathode Coating(s), AND the Electron Gun. 

In the past, '''Mercury-Diffusion Pumps''' were also used, but have long been discontinued due to Mercury’s extremely toxic  nature. The fact that '''Liquid Nitrogen''' was necessary/HAD to be used, for them to function properly, was dangerous to use, hard to store, [because it had to be kept cool], and costly, caused their abandonment. Liquid Nitrogen’s  normal temperature is about '''250 Degrees BELOW ZERO.'''  Even when you were NOT using it, the supply was always being diminished, because of it's extreme temperature difference, with the ambient room temperature. Despite the fact that it was stored in a large vacuum type container, (NOT unlike a THERMOS BOTTLE), it continually was evaporating, during Holidays, weekends, etc., whenever the Tube plant was not operating. 

2. The '''Diffusion Pumps,''' are very effective for pulling gas molecules out of the system, (regardless whether the Gasses are Oxygen, Hydrogen, or of any other type. There are many Gasses, whether residual, or, which are constantly being generated at the time of processing, which must be removed from the system. Myriads of OTHER gasses, which might have been '''ADSORBED,'''  (attached to the outside of the parts, materials, used in processing, construction), OR  during the Electron Gun’s Electrodes (parts), also had to be removed. The Gasses are continually, efficiently, gathered together and expelled to the atmosphere. Gas causes problems, aptly demonstrated, in use,  by '''“Fuzzy” pictures.''' You just can NOT get a clean, clear picture, with a high gaseous internal Tube  condition. In high Gaseous conditions, it always looks like the picture is out of focus. '''EXPLANATION''' to follow:

'''EXPLANATION:''' As the  '''Electron Beam''' tries to go to its assigned position(s), it encounters molecules of gas and collides with them, which causes the Electron Stream to be deflected (nudged), left or right, or up, or down, and/or, even in a combination of ALL directions. Therefore, the Beam impacts different portions of the Phosphor Screen. It does this, so many times, each second, so that an '''AVERAGE''', (sum of all the different '''ELECTRON-BEAM landings),''' video-picture, is actually displayed. This is also aided, '''exacerbated,''' by the DECAY-time factor, hence a '''“blurry&quot;''' picture, (even though the Electron Stream is perfectly focused).

'''Excessive gas''' guarantees a '''SHORT life''' for the finished CRT, because  the cathode which contains a Negative charge, attracts '''POSITIVELY-CHARGED GAS PARTICLES'''. These particles condense/are deposited, on the cathode-coating surface. The coating underneath that deposition of Gas Particles, does NOT contain enough energy to go through that '''deposited, non electron-releasing, coating.'''  Worse yet, it reverses, has a dampening effect/ability, for Electron-generation, in the good, Cathode coating. This smothering effect, encourages an ever-slowing, Electron-generation ability, which eventually leads to the purported death of the Cathode/Tube. '''(IF YOU DON'T USE IT... YOU LOSE IT)!'''  SEE NOTE next.

'''NOTE'''.  It was found, that even though it appeared that a CRT was '''“dead”''', an apparatus, operated by a Technician, could apply about a 1,000 volt '''(RE-ACTIVIZATION)''', '''momentary spike,'''  between the Cathode and G 1, the coating could be '''disintegrated,''' and the Cathode Coating would again be able to function properly, for many, many, more years.

=='''HEAT TREATMENT(S) OF BULB AND ELECTRON GUN'''== 

# 13 The oven is then heated to 400 Degrees C, (752 Degrees F.), in stages of incrementally-higher heating periods), in about 15 to 25 minutes depending on Tube size/mass. It remains at top temperature for Thirty (30) minutes. NOTE: Care must be taken to NOT exceed this temperature by too much, because at around 425 Degrees C, some thin glass Tubes will start to go plastic, (especially Tubes such as '''DUMONT''' round 12&quot;), and start to deform.   That is due to the fact, that the bulb interior being in a Vacuum, subjects the outside of the tube(s) to the Atmospheric  pressure of Sixteen pounds +, per square inch, exacerbated by the extremely high temperature, to start to soften the Glass Bulb AND actually begin to cave in. 

After the top temperature time of Thirty (30) minutes, has been met, the Oven is then directed to cool down (again, incrementally). NOTE: '''Glass NEVER wants to be heated hurriedly''' and  ALWAYS wants to be COOLED,  in a longer time, (ANNEALED), than that which would be natural, if ALL heat is suddenly removed. To ignore this rule may cause the glass to crack and NOT be able to maintain a vacuum, or even worse yet, “IMPLODE”.  '''Definition of Implode:''' opposite of “EXPLODE”, but with just as loud a  Bang/sound. Further, implosion can still hurl broken glass parts/shards, as far as Thirty (30) feet away because the pieces rush to, and, THROUGH  each other (much like the “crossing point” phenomena, but with dangerous effects.  Time elapsed in baking procedure, about One (1) hour or so..

=='''PROCESSING THE TUBE (CRT) AND THE CATHODE COATING'''==

#14.  When the Oven temperature is cooled to about 250 Degrees C , (482 F), the Oven doors may be cracked open enough, to connect wires from a  D.C. supply unit, to the filaments (only). Voltages starting at 6.3 Volts are raised, incrementally, to a Thirty (30) second '''“HOT-SHOT”''' (12 V to 13 Volts), and then incrementally back down again, but never less than Six (6) Volts. Simultaneously, [from time to time], the door(s), to the oven, are opened more and more, while the Voltages are being applied. Total cool-down time, and voltage application cycle, approximately 30 minutes. 

Simultaneously, with the voltage application and the cooling of the oven, another very important part of manufacture is also taking place, namely: Supplying  an additional source of heat, to the Electron Gun itself. It is accomplished by application of an R. F. source via a '''BOMBARDER,''' (DADDY of the Microwave Oven, in everyone’s kitchen). This device was designed and powered '''specifically,''' to '''HEAT-TREAT metal.''' 

'''NOTE: The KITCHEN MICROWAVE was NOT/SHOULD NOT, be allowed to heat any metal. '''DANGER,'''  '''IT COULD CAUSE AN EXPLOSION)''' 

'''First, the BOMBARDER heats the G 1, [along with the Cathode Cylinder], and G 2, to a '''bright-red''' degree, for One minute. Then separately, the Electron Gun Anode structure, is also heated at that Red Brightness, for One (1) Minute. This is done for '''Two (2) reasons''':

1 of 2  To expel any gases which were used in the manufacture of the Electron Gun, and/or to force any and all gasses, adsorbed/absorbed in ALL of the parts enclosed with/within, the G 1 structure, as well as the Anode itself.  NOTE: Care should be taken '''NOT to heat the SPIDERS.''' If the Spiders are heated to that Red Brightness, then in that case, the Spiders will lose their tension and probably will cause '''failure''' of the CRT at a later date. '''See next Two Paragraphs.'''

When the tube is finished and put into operation, at first, the Tube will function normally. Later, as early as several weeks, because of heat generated in the normal operation of the T.V. set, the Spiders will start to '''vibrate,  “SING”,''', making a high-pitched ringing sound. The video (PICTURE), WILL SHOW '''BLACK HORIZONTAL BARS''' ACROSS THE SCREEN and immediately be NOT viewable. Of course, the CRT will have to be replaced.  

But, if for any reason, the set remains on for longer than a few minutes, after the '''“singing”''' commences, the combination of High Voltage and vibrating Spiders '''“CHATTERING”,''' will actually cause the glass neck to be '''“HAMMERED”''' and crack. The CRT will lose its vacuum and of course , NOT be able to function. If the T.V. Set is still NOT turned off, '''IRREPARABLE damage''' will occur to the circuitry of the T.V. set, such that, the '''entire T.V. set must be discarded.''' 

==='''CONVERSION AND ACTIVATION OF THE CATHODE-COATING:'''===

2 of 2. To assist the Filament-generated heat, to aid in conversion of the Triple (3) coating oxides,into Carbonates, which are deposited onto the Cathode Cylinder, (encased within G 1), R. F., [low-range Radio Frequencies], (as earlier herein discussed), is applied.  This helps to start uniform conversion/activation of that Cathode coating. Then, that converted coating,  may readily produce Electrons/Ions, when called upon to do so. '''NOTE:''' In the primary manufacture of the Electron Gun, a mix of Three (3) Cathode coatings, (in liquid-powdery form), are sprayed on by a Paint-sprayer device. Then the deposited coating dries, and  is shaped to an EVEN surface, with few, if any irregular (high spots).Then the  series of electric voltages applied, rising up, in increments, from  6.3 Volts to a One (1) minute “'''Hot Shot,'''” (12 ½ to 13 Volts), and then incrementally being decreased back to the original 6.3 Volts, completes the conversion and activation of the Coatings.

#15 Now that, the conversion/conditioning, of the CRT (Cathode Coating), is completed, the wires attached to the filament are disconnected and the CRT is  separated from the Exhaust System. Care should be taken NOT to allow air to be introduced into the CRT). The separation procedure, may be effected, in any of the following  manner(s).

==='''SEPARATING A PROCESSED TUBE, FROM THE VACUUM PUMPS  ( TIPPING OFF )'''===

a. The old fashion way: With a gas-air torch, heat the area, in which you want the end of the CRT- glass-tubulation to be. Do NOT forget to preheat, or the glass may crack, at which point all that time is wasted AND the Electron gun is useless and the Cathode-Coating is destroyed). As the glass becomes soft and pliable, the process called ('''“TIPPING OFF” )''', commences. The Atmospheric- pressure, coupled with the force of the Gas-Air Torch, causes the Tubulation to start to collapse. As the Tubulation starts to lose diameter and the Glass becomes even softer, the CRT is slowly raised to making the diameter even smaller/less. Continuing the heating/lifting the CRT, until it comes to a thin thread of string, and ultimately, the flame actually severs the CRT glass, from the Vacuum System. 

Then, the ideal end-result is like a '''“hand-sharpened” pencil''' called a '''TIP''' . You must NOT just let the glass collapse into a thick “BLOB’. If for any reason, you have let it go into a '''BLOB''' condition, then in that case you must spend several minutes '''“Annealing”''' that Blob, or it will surely crack at a later time, basically, because when going from THICK to THIN, each should each have their own annealing minimums, and they are too dis-similar. This separating operation, requires some strength and certainly skill, in maneuvering the torch AND the lifting procedure, being done '''simultaneously.'''

b. In order to reduce the skill {and pay requirement(s)}, certain manufacturers used a ceramic coil, containing a  heating element, to be put around the tubulation, in the initial part of attaching the Tube to the Vacuum System. When separation time came, the coil provided the following: PRE-HEATING the glass tubulation took Two (2) to Three (3) minutes, to bring the tubulation up to softening/ melting, then another minute to effectuate the complete closing off (into a BLOB), of glass. Then the coil had the effect of retaining the enclosed heat, hence (ANNEALING)the BLOB. This cooling period took about two (2) of Three (3) minutes. When that was completed, the coil was lowered to the part of the tubulation, still attached to the Vacuum System. A metal file, (shaped like a knife),  made a  FIRM, QUICK scratch, '''“SCORE MARK”''' to the middle of the Blob. Then making a quick blow to the blob, causes the glass to be separated, at the Score mark. 

The &quot;'''GETTERS&quot;''', are then activated by the hand-held R.F. coils, by the operator, (as previously discussed). This absorbs any additional gasses, which might have been generated, by the heating/melting of the glass, in the separation/processing, ['''tipping-off]''', of the CRT.

The Tube could then be removed for the next step. The '''Oil-diffusion pump is shut off first,''' for at least One (1) minute, to allow the Oil to cool from operating temperature. [Most Hi-Vacuum Oils used in Diffusion pumps, did not like to be exposed to air at Operating temperatures]. The Oil degraded very rapidly, to the point, that the Diffusion Pump worked less and less efficiently. Then the '''Mechanical Pump was also turned off.''' Then air was introduced into the system, (the Vacuum system was broken).  The remaining piece of Tubulation, was then withdrawn from the system and discarded, (preparatory for the next pumping operation). Total elapsed time, in the oven, {turn-around time, Two (2) hours}.

=='''ATTACHING THE BASE TO THE CRT.'''==

# 16   Removing the CRT from the oven, it is put (face-down) on a soft surface, so as not to scratch the face. A Bakelite cement, composed of a special powder, mixed with de-natured Alcohol, which attains the constituency, {and looks like}, peanut-butter is applied inside a Bakelite base. This base, in turn has several functions. The first is that it protects the Glass tip from accidental breakage, in normal handling. Next, it contains a ring of hollow metal tubings, through which wires will feed though from the evacuated tube.  This provides electrical access to the Elements of the Electron gun and chassis-supplied voltages (instructions). Again, the filament wires are connected to a Power Supply and a series of electric voltages are applied. The Voltages range from 6.3 Volts to a Hot Shot of 13 Volts for One (1) minute and then back down, incrementally, and finally  to 6.3 Volts, which completes the activation of the Cathode Coating  and '''“AGES”''' it. That is to assure, it may produce enough Electrons in Ten (10) seconds, in the T.V. set, such as to provide a complete viewable picture, for many years. See &quot;Aging&quot; of Cathode Life-cycle below.

The solidifying process, (evaporating of the de-natured alcohol), concurrent with the AGING process, normally takes about Thirty (30) minutes. 

NOTE: '''“AGING” THE CATHODE'''  is necessary, so that a CRT may last many years. It should NOT be allowed to fail, at least for the  first Eighteen (18 ) months. Generally, there was a One-year guarantee given. If the CRT was returned  '''“under warranty”''', then, a new one has to be sent at  '''NO CHARGE''', (but at considerable cost ).

=='''LIFE-CYCLE OF THE CATHODE COATING/CRT'''==

A. Initially the coating is in a non-active state and will NOT readily release Electrons/Ions.

B. As the Coating is heated, (in a Vacuum condition), it completes a chemical re-action, (conversion of Oxides to Carbonates, which makes it start to become, increasingly active .

C. The reason for the increasing activity, is that the coating, (under a  microscope), reveals many high spots, mixed in with many low spots. The low spots, (thinner layer if coating), react quicker. Therefore,  some areas will convert/be activated, sooner than others, (the thicker parts).

D. '''Life-cycle explanation''': When the Cathode Coating is properly converted and easily producing electrons, it starts out, (on a curve), such that it gets better and better at producing Electrons. If for some reason, the Cathode is not fully activated, and at, or near the bottom of the curve, the Coating will NOT continue to improve, but in fact recede, to less favorable electron-generating conditions. At that point the tube might be sent back  to the production line for additional “Aging”. If again, it displays “unsatisfactory” readings, (on the Test Set), then the CRT, would have to be cut open and go through the manufacturing process once again, (with the Electron Gun wasted). 

NOTE: Later on, those “WASTED” Electron Guns were themselves rejuvenated by removing the G 1 Structure (containing the entire Cathode Assembly) and replaced it with a BRAND-NEW G1 Assembly, {with the new Cathode Assembly also}. This was done at 1/2 the cost of a new Gun.
     
'''NOTE'''  Failures in the manufacturing are known as '''“SHRINKAGE”'''. The optimum cathode activation, would be at a point on the curve which is a little before, (but  still  rising), to a “Plateau”, (the next level of activation).

E. When it is producing the maximum amount of electrons, it will stay on a plateau producing plentiful Electrons, for from, (5) years, to 15 years, or more. NOTE: Many tubes were found to still be producing a decent picture, 50 years later!
 
F. It will then start on the down-slope of the curve, which should be another (20) months or so. NOTE: When the Cathode Coating is OVER-PROCESSED, you may be well across the plateau or even on the down-slope, even BEFORE, the  CRT is installed in a consumer’s T.V. It might then fail, in less than the guaranteed minimum. This failed CRT, entitles the consumer, to a free replacement under Warranty. 

G. Ultimately, back to a state where sufficient  electrons may NOT be generated, (coating expended), Life-cycle ended! NOTE: By that time, consumers will have purchased newer T.V. sets.

=='''ACTUAL AFFIXING OF BASE AND “AGING” OF CATHODE COATING.'''== 

The Bakelite cement originally comes as a powder. When mixed with pure, [de-natured] alcohol, which is an (easy, non-contaminating, evaporation material), it is worked to the '''consistency of  “Peanut Butter”.'''  A '''3/8 &quot; thick  ring,''' of '''Bakelite cement,''' is applied inside the Bakelite base, which also has hollow metal pins fixed in place. The wires from the Electron Gun are threaded through those metal pins and pulled tight to mount and fix the Bakelite Base and cement, to the glass of the CRT neck. [That is  where the Glass–like Wafer of the Electron gun was melted into the neck of the Tube]. That also protects the Glass tip, from being broken, with the resultant loss of Vacuum. 

Those wires also held the base on straight, until the '''alcohol is evaporated''' and the '''Bakelite cement''' becomes as hard as plastic. It turned out when tubes were separated from the Vacuum PUMPS, in the Blob configuration, that a very high un-acceptable amount, suffered leaks. Then new tubes had to be supplied. ''' REASON FOR FAILURE:''' It was proven later, that the '''INSIDE''' of the tubulation was NOT as clean as it should have been, and therefore, an extremely fine line left in the center of the blob, was actually leaking air, into the finished tube. The leak was so minute, that it took several months of rising gas content, eventually air, to be discovered. But, it was able to be effectively closed off, with a '''High Vacuum, Red-Paint sealant,''' [was specifically formulated for just such a purpose(s)]. This Sealant was applied to the Blob-end of the CRT, at the beginning of the base-attachment process. The sealant was '''NOT needed,''' for '''hand-tipped tubulations.''' It also had '''electricity-insulating characteristics. 
'''
To provide the necessary heat, for the Bakelite Cement-hardening process, the '''Filament wires''' are again connected to an A C supply, to further age the cathode, (with the '''obligatory “Hot Shot”''' {12 1/2 V ... to...13 1/2 V for Thirty (30 ) seconds}. Depending on the ambient room temperature, sometimes '''“spot lights,”'''  shining on the base, might be necessary, to complete the evaporation of the alcohol and the hardening process, of the Bakelite cement. 

At 6.3 Volts A C, the filament generated approximately '''800 Degrees Centigrade''' of heat, or about '''1472 Degrees Fahrenheit,'''(and higher, as voltages were incrementally advanced), so that the Glass in the base area, gets hot to the touch and thereby hardens the Bakelite Cement. When the Bakelite cement is hardened and the socket called the  BASE, containing the wires are firmly affixed to the end of the CRT neck. Next, the wires are snipped off at the top of the pins  lead soldered, (so as to assure connections with the pins, are securely, permanently made).

Time lapsed about Thirty (30) minutes from the last tube connected (usually done in Oven loads or Twenty (20) to Thirty (30)tubes tied in parallel together, to the A C Power supply. Aging, base hardening elapsed time  approximately Thirty (30) minutes.

=='''GETTING RID OF PARTICLES WHICH MAY BE ON THE ELECTRON GUN PARTS'''==

#17  On a tube holder, the CRT is placed, (face up, neck down), and a socket is plugged in to the metal pins of the base, in which all pins are joined together by a heavy-duty wire. This other end of the wire is '''anchored to “GROUND”.''' Another heavy-duty wire is connected, (clipped in), to the anode button of the CRT.  The Anode is fed from a device, whose sole purpose is provide the High Voltage necessary, to clean unknown/unwanted particles, by using (Twenty-five (25) to Thirty-five (35) Thousand Volts.  When turned on, the H.V. '''disintegrates''' any material still present on the Electron Gun, with the (CRACKLE) sound, made by electricity. Larger tubes get the 35,000 volt treatment because the T.V. sets they are placed in, normally deliver more H. V., to work properly, than that of the smaller ones. If not done properly, the Electron Gun will start to snap, crackle and pop, in the customers home, which makes the customer apprehensive, (even though it will NOT do any damage). However, if the Tube develops air in it, in the T.V. Tube consumer's home, '''THAT, could do serious damage.''' That device, which was used to clean up the electrodes, was commonly called, a '''“SPARK-KNOCKER”.'''

=='''TESTING THE FINISHED PROCESS'''==

#18  Testing the finished product, was accomplished by connecting the finished product, in an T V set-simulating equipment procedure. All voltages, (and current drains, and then some), were available (inherent), and dial-monitored by controllable sources, (some automatic, with others on command of the Test-set operator.

For example: 

High Voltage was supplied from  Zero (&quot;0&quot;) volts, all the way up to Thirty-five (35) Thousand volts.
(NO T.V. set, operated at more than 30 Thousand Volts).
 
Other variable voltages available in the TEST-SET are:

Filament voltage from  (0 V) to  (15 V), w/ automatic current drain in Milliamps. (most CRT's operates at 6.3 volts). 

G 1 (&quot;0&quot;) V  to 40 V

Cathode  (-10 V) to (&quot;0&quot;) V  + '''current drain''' (called '''“EMISSION,”'''  the aggregate of electrons passing from the Cathode though the aperture of G 1 ), in '''MICROAMPS.'''

NOTE: There is a  relationship to the amount of Electrons passing from the Cathode, through G 1 and the amount of voltage necessary to completely halt that action, which allows the T.V. show, the color '''&quot;BLACK&quot;.''' That also means that, that varying the voltage, according to the signal received from the Transmitting source, may allow varying amounts of Electrons to be sent to impact the Phosphor Screen, thereby drawing the Picture and  making the picture darker or lighter. 

G 2  (&quot;0&quot; V) to  500 V

Focus  (&quot;0&quot; V ) to 450 V

Anode   (&quot;0&quot; V)  to 35,000 V

The TEST SET  has the ability to test for '''“LEAKAGE”''' between the Cathode (A.C.), &amp;  the  G 1
(D. C.). Too much leakage, would introduce a '''Sixty (60) Cycle “Hum”''' in the Picture, (un-desirable), getting progressively worse. It also '''guaranteed''' that eventually, the filament will short against the Cathode Cylinder, and '''burn out.''' (See  '''SEALING the ELECTRON GUN''' hereinbefore, to '''PREVENT leakage)'''.

=='''ASSESSING THE POSSIBLE LIFE OF THE CRT'''==

The Test-set also had the ability to disengage the “SWEEP” circuits. This is a valuable tool, in assessing the effectiveness of your manufacturing process, because it enables you to see a '''“PICTURE&quot;''' of the surface of the cathode coating, which was called the '''“CATHODE IMAGE”.''' The  actual coating was concealed from visible sight, because it is an integral part of the G 1 assembly electrode. 

To get a &quot;view&quot;, (a VIRTUAL look), at the Cathode coating, do the following, '''(VERY IMPORTANT)''', in this order as shown. '''FIRST,'''  reduce the Focus Voltage down to &quot;0&quot; Volts;  '''SECOND,'''  reduce the high Voltage to 5,000 Volts; '''THIRD''', dis-engage the Sweep Circuits. These actions, have NOW produced the following effect: '''BECAUSE,''' the Focus Voltage, was reduced to &quot;0&quot;  Volts, the Electron Beam could NOT be brought down, to an intense, very small, sharp point; Next, '''BECAUSE''' the Anode (High) Voltage was brought down to 5,000 Volts, that eliminated any possibility of the Electron Beam burning the Phosphor Screen; '''Because,''' the Sweeps were dis-connected, the Beam could not traverse up/down nor left/right, thereby presenting a stationary image.

The IMAGE, then cast upon the Screen, (about the size of a Silver Dollar), was able to be read like an M D READS AN X-RAY. To a skilled person, this '''CATHODE IMAGE''' (&quot;Scan&quot;), could present a remarkably accurate picture of the expected life of the CRT, or in the alternative, if further &quot;Aging&quot; was necessary. After re-aging, the CRT had to be tested again. An important function, relative to the percentage of  tubes requiring re-aging, was vital, (NEVER more than 10%, nor less than 5 %) in determining the efficacy of the Conversion and Activation of the Cathode Coating. NOTE: If you got  less than 5%, that meant, you were OVER-PROCESSING the cathodes, thereby using up useful life (hours), and where, on the plateau, or down-slope of the life of the Cathode coating, you were in, for the batches of Tubes processed that day. (Plateau interpretation, discussed earlier herein, in the '''Aging process)'''.

'''NOTE''': Sometimes, when attempting to test a CRT, upon trying to display/examine, the Cathode image, instead of the &quot;dollar-size&quot; image being displayed, a rather dim image, [smaller than a dime], was displayed. When that display was received, it indicated 2 things. 1). The Cathode tab, [the connection between the Glass wafer and the Cathode cylinder], was broken, and therefore the CRT could NOT function properly.  2). The CRT had to be cut open, a new neck had to be attached, the entire inside coating had to be washed out and the whole process had to be started out again, from the beginning. In looking for the &quot;open Cathode,&quot; a few were because the 2 welds made, [to attach the tab], were NOT done properly. This should have been detected in the preliminary  examination of the Electrodes, prior to the &quot;sealing-in&quot; process. 

However, after intensive investigation, the author determined that the vast majority, of &quot;open-cathodes,&quot; came about because of the following: Pre Korean War, the tab consisted of a &quot;Nickel&quot; composition. Since a lot of Nickel was needed for military purposes, the gun manufacturers selected a different metal to be used as a Tab. This metal, [because of the intense heat, generated in affixing it to the Cathode cylinder], became brittle, at that point of the weld. Since the filament of the CRT generates 1,472 degrees F, when the T.V. set was turned on, the Cathode cylinder expanded. When the T.V. set was turned off, the filament cooled off, and the Cathode cylinder contracted. Sometimes, the welder was not sure the he/she made a good weld, and therefore gave it another shot. Since those double welds, presented more heat than the single weld, they sometimes broke, even while the CRT was going through the process, (Cathode conversion, &quot;Aging,&quot; etc.)

This problem was addressed by the author, and was the subject of his first Patent, [circa 1952]. Even though the tab material was still of inferior grade, by lengthening the tab and then looping same, it was found that the entire loop, absorbed the stress of the expanding/contracting Cathode cylinder. This was instead of, only the part of the tab, where the weld was made, being made to bear the brunt of the on/off heat generation, (of the filament). This was found to be 100% effective, in all later CRT's, from then on.      

The finished CRT's, also are visually inspected for imperfections, which might appear in the Phosphor Coating. Each tube was tested/timed to the 10 Second (or better), criterion, [in which a raster must appear]. The Amount of Electrons, emanating from the Cathode, is displayed, (which shows up as Current drain, in Milliamps). It also measures the amount G 1 Voltage necessary, to extinguish the Electron Stream from view, (called '''Cut-off Voltage''').  There is also a '''necessary ratio, between emission''' and '''CUT-OFF''', [total extinguishing of the Electron Beam on Screen]. This is a necessary requirement, (so that black portions of any picture may be faithfully reproduced). The ability to '''focus/de-focus,''' the Electron stream, is tested. It is also tested for &quot;SHORTS&quot;/&quot;Open Circuits&quot;, and/or mis-alignment of the Gun Structure. Such may come about, because of a broken Glass-support rod, which holds all the Electrodes firmly in place, {&quot;ALIGNMENT&quot;}, or any other Electron-Gun, manufacturing defect.

NOTE: Testing for gas, normally present in the CRT, after manufacture, should be at a minimum. In the normal operation of the Television Set, (picture tube), the electron beam WILL generate small amounts of gas. In the field, T V repairmen, when unable to achieve a suitable focus, by manipulating the focus control, rightly judge the CRT as being &quot;gassy&quot;. That is correct... but what does gas have to do with it? The particular tube has many individual gas molecules evenly separated throughout the entire inner volume of the CRT. That is because like particles repel.

In the normal functioning of the CRT, The pinpoint electron-beam, which &quot;draws&quot; a picture on the screen, the (persistence) of the phosphor lighting up, when struck by the beam, and then dying out, &quot;decay-time&quot;), allows the screen to portray a complete picture. Let us take a single display of the impact of the Electron beam to strike the screen at point A. As the spot is struck 60 times a second, some times it will strike point A. Other times the electron beam will encounter gas molecules, thereby deflecting the pinpoint-spot point A+1, or A+2 or even A+3. At times the beam , encountering the always moving gas particles, may be defected to points A-1, A-2,or A-3.

Then some electron-point beams, may be deflected UP A+1, UP A+2, or even Up A+3. The beam may also be deflected DOWN+1, DOWN+2, or DOWN+3. Compounding that problem, the pinpoint beam may be deflected in many different combinations of the +, -, UP, or DOWN. The final result would then display/light up 90 or more particles of phosphor, INSTEAD of ONLY 1. This of course happens to point B, Point C, point D etc. The end result, is a very blurry picture, even though all parts of the T.V. are functioning perfectly

After the testing is completed, it is then scrutinized for scratches on the face of the CRT. If any are found, they are removed, using grinding disks, in conjunction with &quot;Jewelers Rouge,&quot;   [see '''&quot;BUFFING&quot;''', scratch-removal later, herein].    

==='''SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT'''===

Let us enlarge the conventional &quot;Straight Gun&quot;, as indicated, and place it in Earth Orbit. No envelope is needed, as the Universe will will be, the Vacuum Container:

'''AVERAGE ELECTRON GUN''' .......... ''' EXTRAPOLATED, LARGER AS NOTED''' 

'''LENGTH'''               5 INCHES ...  42 FEET (100 TIMES LARGER), [ROUNDED UP FROM 41.66 FEET]

'''FILAMENT VOLTAGE'''    6.3 VOLTS    ......   18.9 VOLTS ...(3 TIMES LARGER)

'''FILAMENT CURRENT'''     .600 MA     .....    1.8 AMPS ... (3 TIMES MORE)

'''CATHODE VOLTAGE'''     -5 V        .....     -15 VOLTS  ... (3 TIMES LARGER) 
 
'''G 1 APERTURE'''        0.040 INCHES .....    .12 INCHES ... (3 TIMES LARGER)
 
'''G 1 VOLTAGE'''          5 V TO 40 V  .....    15 V TO 120 VOLTS ...(3 TIMES LARGER)

'''G 2 VOLTAGE'''       100 V TO 450 V   .....   500 V TO 2,250 V ... (5 TIMES LARGER)
   
'''ANODE VOLTAGE'''  15,000 V TO 30,000 V..... 150,000 V TO 3,000,000 V ...( 100 TIMES LARGER )

Average &quot;Throw&quot; distance, [between the top aperture of the Gun-Cathode, to the Phosphor Screen], in a 25&quot; CRT, is about 2 feet. Extrapolating that 100 times yields 200 feet (to expected Focus point, [2nd cross-over point,]). From experience with normal CRT's, the 2ND '''&quot;CROSSOVER-POINT&quot;,''' may be another 6 inches, past the outside of the Glass face. 100 times extrapolation gives another 50 feet. Therefore the Electron Beam may be focused on any target, (for welding, blasting, etc.), up to '''approximately 250 feet.''' An extended focus coil arrangement, placed 200 feet further out, may create a 3rd &quot;CROSSOVER-POINT&quot;, AND giving that an extra 200 foot range.

NOTE: Since a Straight-Gun arrangement is envisioned here, the Electron Stream, will then contain all the Electrons' heavyweight, brother particles,(IONS), both Negative AND Positive.

=='''&quot;BUFFING&quot;, POLISHING THE FACE OF THE FINISHED CRT '''==

# 19  '''SCRATCH REMOVAL:''' 

The face of the finished CRT is carefully scanned for scratches or other blemishes in the Viewing areas. If found, a Grinding wheel removes the deep scratches, by creating a number of less-deep scratches. Then, a less-grainy grinding disc, removes those smaller scratches with the effect that now the face is left in a fine haze, '''[FEATHERED]'''. Then a Felt polishing wheel, assisted by '''JEWELERS ROUGE''', POLISHES the haze, so that it completely matches that of the rest of the Glass face.  NOTE: This operation, done properly, requires patience, hard work, and a high degree of skill! The work is characterized as hard, because when you finish one tube, then you go on to the next, and the next, and the next, etc. for 8 hours.

=='''MAKING THE CRT “IMPLOSION-PROOF”  (LAMINATING)'''==

# 20  Since there were many accidents because CRT’s '''“IMPLODED”''', THE public demanded safer CRT’s. The “QUICK-FIX was to provide a system called “LAMINATION”. There were several types tried. ALL required the use of EPOXY RESINS. Most resins became hard as a rock. The first approach was for Corning Glass and other Glass makers to make a “dish-like” cover to contour the bulb in question. 

The CRT, with the matching face-plate, is heated in a small Oven, to approximately 200 degrees F, for several minutes. Then the CRT and the matching Plate, are suspended in a Jig, so that there is approx '''1/4&quot; inch space difference,''' between them. An appropriate, clear-view (relatively pliable, when composed ), Epoxy Resin, consisting of two (2) separate fluid components, are mixed together. This initiates a chemical reaction, which starts to heat up rather quickly, (Two to Three minutes). The ever-heating '''Two-part, Epoxy Resin,''' is poured, gently, (so as to NOT make air bubbles), between the contoured plate and the CRT. The Resin takes about Three (3)minutes to harden (in the firm, binding, yet pliable state).

Yet another way, provides different types of metal banding , (including non-resin coating, '''Compression BANDING.''' This involves putting s Metal Strap around the edges of the Tube and tension stretching it, so that it is extremely tight. There will be absolutely no slack nor space, between the Band and the CRT. The other types of metal containment use another type of Two-part Epoxy Resins, to EPOXY (Glue), those metal pieces to the Glass. This is the '''“hard as a rock” variety.'''  Whatever system is used, they are all 100 % reliable, because ALL  the systems hold the Glass together, when a blow is delivered with force, to the Bulb, or when it is accidentally dropped… ALL types of implosion protection for the CRT's,  which were employed, were very effective.

=='''PREPARATION FOR SHIPPING:'''==

#21  The last step before boxing for shipping, was to have a black highly-conductive Electric coating, (AQUADAG), sprayed over the entire outer Bulb area { but NOT within a Four (4 ) inch circle of  the Anode and at least Five ( 5 ) inches from where the neck joins the bulb proper, because that is where the Yoke will reside}  This coating enables the '''Tube to acquire a Capacitive effect''', (stores electrons to give a smoother working action, to fluctuations in voltages {usually due to external sources}    

==='''DISCARDING/REPLACING THE CRT'''===

NOTE: Before doing anything, to the inside of the cabinet containing the CRT, make sure that the T V set is turned off. (Most sets have an automatic dis-connect, but sometimes, they may be inoperative). When removing the CRT, from the T V Set, you must also remove the High Voltage,  '''Anode connection RED wire, hooked into the anode button,''' in the side of the CRT. Make sure, you use an insulated Screw Driver, to pry under the obligatory, round rubber insulator, surrounding the button. Every precaution has been taken, by T V Set Manufacturers,to protect the person going into the Unit, from accidentally coming into contact with the button.  '''Do NOT touch the Anode Button, with bare hands.'''  '''It could give you a very bad Electrical jolt.''' '''It has actually killed people, under certain circumstances. 

'''''Before handling/removing the tube, '''ground the anode''' to an '''external source of GROUND,''' or even the metal chassis of the TV set. Whatever you use to ground the Anode with, make sure the wire/part/tool, you are using, is INSULATED. There is usually a pretty good amount of Electrical energy left in the CRT, because of the Capacitive effect. Even dis-connected from the T V Set, it can still  '''shock you. It would (NOT ) kill you,''' but it could  '''STARTLE you,''' so that '''you may drop the CRT'''.  ''''''''THAT ...COULD HURT YOU.''''''

=='''#22 DYING, (almost dead), TELEVISION TUBE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY (circa 1980's)'''==

There are only a few instances today, where Television Tube ability is left/needed today, which are not supplanted with &quot;Flat-Screen&quot; Technology,(circa 2000), whether they be of the '''LCD''' or the '''Plasma''' type variety. Even projection-type TV Sets, are being phased out, '''primarily, because they are too bulky. ''' Another very important reason for their demise, is that, ''''''you '''[[STILL]]''' need  3 CRT's, (approx. 5&quot; round),''' for EVERY 1 PROJECTION-TV SET:''' '''ONE''' '''ALL-RED Phosphor'''-screened CRT; '''ONE''' '''ALL BLUE, Phosphor'''-Screened CRT and '''ONE''' '''ALL GREEN Phosphor'''-screened CRT), '''['''PER SET'''].'''

=='''METAL PICTURE TUBES,.... ALREADY A DEAD INDUSTRY !'''==

TELEVISION set manufacturers are always concerned with &quot;Upgrading&quot;; &quot;looks&quot;; &quot;Weight&quot;; &quot;Competition&quot;: &quot;Costs&quot;; and last, but not least, &quot;PROFITS&quot;. A good part of the cost of producing, selling and delivery, involved two very important considerations. The '''1st''' is '''WEIGHT.''' The '''2nd''' is '''BULK.''' In attempting to solve the weight problem, they resorted to the use of metal, for the bulk of the TUBE, (where the glass was normally the heaviest). 

Even then, the next battle, was to cut the Bulk of the Metal Tube. As new Tube Types were formulated, they rec'd the appellation of letters of the Alphabet, which were applied, to indicate their own particular type.  NOTE: The DIFFERENCES, might be because of changes in filament voltages/currents, Grid/Focus voltages, Focus deflection arrangement, High voltages, Bulb Shape, Gun type, Deflection Angle, etc. At the time when Flat Screens began to dominate the market, there were literally THOUSANDS  of different Tube Types.

Metal tube types introduced over the years include: a 12&quot; round; 16&quot; round;  17&quot; rectangular; 19&quot; round; 21&quot; Rectangular (both GREEN GLASS (more in a minute), and regular lead Glass; and the 30&quot; round {monster). The 21&quot; Green Glass (lime glass, instead of lead glass), was tried for a short time, in order to cut down on &quot;SHRINKAGE,&quot; (TUBES LOST, IN PART OR WHOLE, to manufacturing problems - it created MORE problems, not less.  

New Tubes being manufactured for the first time, received the following designations: The tube size, an alphabetical letter in date order and finally the type of Phosphor used. For example: the '''1st 16&quot; metal''', was designated as a '''&quot;16A P4&quot;.''' The Metal cone was approximately '''20&quot; long.'''  The next Tube was called a '''&quot;16E P4&quot;.''' Its Metal cone was approximately '''15&quot; long.''' The '''3rd 16&quot; metal''' was labeled a '''16G P4,''' Its Metal cone was approximately '''10&quot; long.''' 

This reduced bulk, for the T.V. Tube, meant that the T.V. Set would '''also''' be less bulky. [Not only, would more T.V. boxes, (containing the CRT), be  able to be put in a Trailer, Boxcar or a Sea-Ship's cargo hold], but they could accommodate MORE T.V. Sets, also, {lowering the price per unit, for shipping costs}.  NOTE: Very often, there would be 2 separate modes, or more, of shipping, depending on origin and destination. Ex. T.V. Sets/Tubes from the U.S. to Europe, involved shipping by sea, [perhaps even shipping by train, and then finally by truck]. Reverse shipping, was also needed, to return/replace, free of charge, defective/ failed/damaged units, back to the U.S. So, weight and bulk, of CRT's AND T.V. Sets, were an important part of lowering manufacturing costs.
Glass Tube streamlining, was achieved by making the deflection angle (amount of degrees, the Electron Beam could be deflected/[bent]). CRT's started out with deflection angles about 60 Degrees and worked their way up thru 90 Degrees, and even 114 Degrees (making for an extremely close front-to-rear relationship for the T.V. Set). The objective, since the early 1950's, was always to make &quot;the picture on the wall,&quot; [which obviously could NOT be a CRT].  

'''END OF STORY!'''

=='''SPECIAL MANUFACTURING STEPS, REQUIRED TO PROCESS METAL TUBES, IN '''ADDITION''' TO THE NORMAL CRT PROCESSING'''== 

'''PREPARING THE METAL CONE FOR THE FIRST STEP'''

The Metal cones are shipped to the Tube Manufacturer, heavily greased up (to prevent any rust or deterioration to occur to the Cone). Therefore, the first step would be to get rid of the heavy coating. The preferred solvent for the type of grease involved, is &quot;Carbon Tetra-chloride&quot;. NOTE: Only as many cones should be cleaned, as would be needed for production, for that day. 

'''SANDBLASTING'''
 
A Glass-funnel-like arrangement will be attached to the smaller opening of the Metal cone, while a Glass face-plate will be sealed into the larger part of the metal cone. Therefore both edges are heavily sand-blasted, for 2 reasons. The '''1st''' is to make sure that all traces of any substance is removed from those areas. The '''2nd''' is, to make an other-wise smooth metal to be roughed-up/ etched, so as to provide thousands of &quot;Valleys&quot; and &quot;Pits&quot;, so that the glass has a better chance to adhere to the Metal cone. NOTE: Care should be taken, NOT to put your fingers on any of the Sand-blasted areas, as the oils in your skin may interfere with the adhesion/marriage, of the Glass and metal.

''' EXPLANATION,&quot; OF CO-EFFICIENTS OF EXPANSION PROBLEM AND SOLUTION,&quot;'''

'''Differences of &quot;Co-efficients of expansion&quot;,''' means that one material (in this case (Glass),  is slower, to heat/cool, than another material, (in this case metal). Glass does NOT expand as much, or as quickly, as metal. To '''effect a permanent marriage,''' of the two dis-similar substances, is '''NOT an easy task.''' Research by major glass companies (such as Corning Glass), have come up with a substance, which does '''NOT''' expand as quickly as metal, but it '''DOES''' expand, faster than glass. It comes in a powder-like form, and is known as '''&quot;FRIT&quot; GLASS.'''  Placed between the face-plate and the metal, FRIT helps bridge the gap, between the differences of the glass and metal. It is an enormous assistance, to the marriage of the metal to the glass. Otherwise it would be very difficult to effect the marriage. This marriage is exacerbated by the fact that, is if there is a
minute, [&quot;hairline&quot;] crack, such signifies the death of the tube.  Even if, the seal is done perfectly, any leak, no matter how minuscule, can NOT contain a Vacuum, and will cease to function in a matter of weeks. At that point, NOT only that the customer is allowed a &quot;NO-COST&quot; replacement, but the entire bulb must be discarded], even AFTER return shipping charges must also be paid by the manufacturer. Ill will, among the ultimate Customer, Distributor, and T.V. Technician (who must replace the CRT, on his time, without additional receipt of money, is a serious problem for the CRT  manufacturer.  

'''GLASS LATHE, FUSES GLASS CONE, TO METAL CONE.'''

The metal cone is attached to the head of a &quot;GLASS-LATHE,&quot; which also encloses the open part, of the Metal cone, (so that when air is pumped in, at the lathe-operator's command), the air, can counter-act the force, of the gas-oxygen fires, when the glass is in a pliable, molten state. First, FRIT glass is APPLIED TO THE GLASS FUNNEL, at the point where the glass is expected to be fused into the Metal Tube. When the fusing operation is completed, then at this point, we have the lower part of the Tube, [including the neck], ready for future use. Needless to say, pre-heating/annealing actions, take longer than the  preheating/annealing of Glass-to-Glass seals. Cool down could take as much as 30 minutes.

=='''FACEPLATE SEALED INTO METAL TUBE.'''==

The metal cone, mow fitted with the glass cone and neck portion of the tube, was made ready to have the face-plate sealed into the main portion of the Tube. On a specially-designed machine, {'''more in a minute},''' the neck of the tube had an access to air being provided, which could be introduced into the Tube, {on command from the operator), while the unit was in operation. This provided, that when the glass become molten, the face-plate  would not attempt to fall into the metal body, (round or rectangular). 

Whatever size or shape, FRIT glass was placed into the rim of the metal Tube and the faceplate put on top of the FRIT. The sealing unit had the usual spinning capability, as well as 20 to 40 Jet fires (depending on size of Tube). As usual, the Jets could be moved up or down and left or right. To seal in the round tubes, was pretty much straight forward: heat the metal Tube, which in turn heats the FRIT AND the faceplate. As the seal takes place, enough air is pumped into the tube, so as to counter-act the force of gravity, but not too much, so as to make the glass face-plate puff out. That would stretch the glass out  too much, so that it would be too thin.   

The rectangular Metal Tubes, presented a problem for positioning the Jets. There were extra gas/air heating burners (for pre-heating), while the Jets, (that did the work), were Gas/oxygen fed. You couldn't set the Jets up to the narrow part of the Metal Tube, because they would be hit by the large part of the Tube, when the metal Tube spun. This problem was solved, by setting the Jets according to the large part of the tube. Then, by indexing, jets were continually moved in and out, as the shape changed, (much like a machine gun firing out the front of a propeller-driven airplane, so it would NOT shoot its own propeller off). Large, thick asbestos gloves, allowed the Tube to be removed from the machine and placed in the obligatory, cooling/annealing oven. One single sealing procedure, could take as long as 8 minutes, (including pre-heating/annealing).

Hello Carmine4131928! I saw your book, and it's looking very good. However, as the page gets longer, we may want to break it up into smaller pages, much like a regular book is broken into chapters. This will make it easier to navigate, easier to maintain, and easier to load in a webbrowser. I can take care of this task for you, if you want. Just let me know what topics you want on what pages, and I can do the rest. If you have any other questions about your book, or wikibooks in general, you can leave me a message at [[User talk:Whiteknight|my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 15:16, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

Hi, I've taken a look at your book and have bookmarked it so I can help with any spellchecking or whatever.  One suggestion I have is to change the titles of the chapters from UPPER case to Lower case.  I think that many people find all capitals to be a bit scary and most other Wikibooks only use capitals at the beginning of the chapter titles.  Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello all,

I am currently a candidate for a Masters of science student studying Clinical Chemistry at Rochester Institute of technology. I have been working under Professor Paul Craig for a Graduate thesis project to provide a free, usable text book in [[Proteomics]] for undergraduate courses. The text book has been developed by two Proteomic undergraduate classes. The book has been managed and guided by myself. 

I hope that this book will provide other students and schools with another means of information into the proteomic world.

I myself hope to use this experience to better market myself in hope of finding a position in a laboratory setting or pharmaceutical business setting.

I have began helping contribute to a new book [[Metabolomics]] please help contribute if you can. I have already finished my thesis on this work, but would like to continue adding content to for students.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:55, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

==Pronunciation files==
It's great that you record audio files with Hungarian pronunciation. I only have one request: please upload your file to Commons, not here. Files on Commons can be use everywhere - for example, in Wiktionary in various languages.

It's important to name files properly on Commons and put them in categories - because Wiktionary has a bot that automatically adds pronunciation files to entries and it has to distinguish big and small letters. Proper naming looks like that: ''Image:Hu-szomjas.ogg'' (instead of ''Image:Szomjas.ogg''). If you want to see how proper files look, see [[commons:Image:Pl-fakt.ogg]] or [[commons:Image:Hu-tüdöödéma.ogg]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:55, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

: So if I put links as &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Audio|commons:Hu-alacsony.ogg|listen}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is it ok? --[[User:Sourcerror|Sourcerror]] 09:39, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

: No. You have to use another server - [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. When you upload files there, they appear here as they were uploaded here locally - so there is no problem. Please do not upload you files here; such useful files should be made public in Commons. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:51, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

You forgot the license here: [[:Image:Szó.ogg]]. Can you fix it please? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:44, 27 April 2007 (UTC)
: I reuploaded, because I didn't find any other way to fix it. --[[User:Sourcerror|Sourcerror]] 19:11, 27 April 2007 (UTC)
: There is no need! You just copy license template from your other pronunciation file. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:15, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

Again, don't upload the file. Click the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Sz%C3%B3.ogg&amp;action=edit edit button]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:45, 27 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

These books were donated to Wikibooks by the '''Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP)''' of the '''United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'''.

These books have been released under the GFDL, and it is hoped that the Wikibooks community will help to make them better. The books in this section are broken down into two sub-categories: FOSS books and ICT4D books.

FOSS books serve as an introduction to various aspects and dimensions of free/open source software (FOSS) issues, including FOSS in education, FOSS and government policy, localization, open standards and licensing.

ICT4D books detail the concepts, issues and trends surrounding different aspects of information and communications technology for development (ICT4D), including, e-government, e-commerce, ICT for education, ICT for poverty alleviation, Internet governance, biotechnology, etc.

The [[w:en:Mandolin|mandolin]] is a small, eight-stringed musical instrument.  Like the guitar, the mandolin has a fretted neck.  The eight strings are divided into four pairs of strings called courses, thus a typical mandolin is a 4 course instrument.  Each course is tuned one fifth apart, the lowest (in terms of sound) is most often tuned to G.  The next lowest (physically below the G strings when held in playing position) is tuned to D, then A, and then E for the smallest strings. It is used in various music such as bluegrass, classical, celtic, jazz, and even some rock/blues. The mandolin also has much smaller frets that allows those with smaller hands to enjoy a fretted instrument.

The mandolin is similar to other instruments including the Mandola, Octave Mandolin, Octave Mandola, Irish Bouzouki[http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3943694462_1127b42c21_m.jpg], as well as others.  

==Playing the Mandolin==
When playing the mandolin both strings in each course are typically fretted (pressed down) together.  The mandolin may be strummed or picked.  Strumming involves playing multiple courses of strings together in a rhythmic fashion, while picking usually means playing individual courses of strings to play out a melodic rhythm.  These playing methods are combined in many songs to take advantage of the versatility of the instrument.

=== Option 1 ===

Ada has built-in features that directly support [[w:Structured Programming|structured]], [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[w:Generic programming|generic]], [[w:Distributed computing|distributed]] and [[w:Concurrent computing|concurrent]] programming.

=== Option 2 ===

Ada puts unique emphasis on, and provides strong support for, good [[w:Software Engineering|software engineering]] practices that scale well to very large software
systems (millions of lines of code, and very large development teams).

=== Option 3 ===

Ada is a structured language with a [[Programming:Pascal|Pascal]]-like syntax which makes it suitable for teaching software engineering.  The Wikibook for Ada is the only Wikibook which has an entry for all the [[Computer_programming#Key_concepts|key concepts]] of computer programming. Apart from academic use&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adacore.com/academic_overview.php The GNAT Academic Program (GAP)]&lt;/ref&gt;, Ada is professionally used&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adacore.com/aa_lookwho.php Look Who\u2019s Using Ada]&lt;/ref&gt; in Air Traffic Control, Aviation &lt;small&gt;(Commercial and Defense)&lt;/small&gt;, Rail Transportation, Communications &lt;small&gt;(Satellites and Receivers)&lt;/small&gt; and Swiss banking. Companies in these sectors are constantly on the lookout for good Ada programmers.

=== Option 4 ===

Ada is a very well structured language with a [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]] like syntax which makes Ada a good teaching language. Learning Ada will teach you the following [[Computer_programming#Paradigms|Paradigms]]: [[Programming:Structured programming|Structured]], [[Programming:Imperative programming|Imperative]], [[Programming:Procedural programming|Procedural]], [[Programming:Object oriented programming|Object oriented]], [[Computer Programming/Concurrent programming|Concurrent]], [[Computer programming/System Programming|System]] and [[Computer programming/Embedded Programming|Embedded]] programming

=== Option 5 ===

The [[Ada Programming|Ada programming]] language is a versatile general purpose programming language that supports a number of programming paradigms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tablature is a quick and easy way to play songs on your mandolin.  Although it does not give some of the information of standard notation, its ease of use is impressive. This chapter will teach you how to read tablature.

&lt;pre&gt;
1(E)---3-5-7-3-5-7-3----|-----------------|| (string with highest pitch)
2(A)------------------3-|-3---------------||
3(D)--------------------|-----------------||
4(G)--------------------|-----------------|| (string with lowest pitch)
&lt;/pre&gt;

These notes are played by pushing down a finger on the frets shown above while picking the corresponding string couple. A zero represents an open string.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
1(E)---3-------------||
2(A)---2-------------||
3(D)---0-------------||
4(G)---0-------------||
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

When the notes are vertically aligned, play the strings simultaneously. When different notes are played together, it is called a chord.  Above is a G chord.  This chord can also be represented as (0023). When represented this way, an &quot;x&quot; in the chord refers to an unplayed string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:24, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

== Page naming ==

Could you check the section on page naming about.  Wikibooks has a naming structure that reflects that of a book with a title and then pages &quot;within&quot; the title.  As such I imagine that [[Value]] should actually be called [[Financial instrument/Value]] or possibly [[Financial Derivatives/Value]] in which case [[Financial instrument]] also needs renaming.  You can achieve this by using the &quot;move&quot; tab to rename the page.  Could you also look at other pages you have created in the same way - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:24, 26 April 2007 (UTC)
*[[WB:WIW|Wikibooks is not an encyclopaedia]].  Don't copy and paste Wikipedia articles here.  That violates the GFDL.  If you want to link book text to encyclopaedia articles, there is an encyclopaedia right next door that you can [[Help:Editing#Interwiki links|interwiki link]] to.

__NOTOC__The '''domestic goat''' ('''''Capra aegagrus hircus''''') is a domesticated subspecies of the [[w:wild goat|wild goat]] of southwest Asia and eastern Europe. It is a member of the bovine family, and is closely related to the [[Sheep]], both being in the goat antelope group.

Domestic goats are one of the oldest domesticated species. For thousands of years, they have been utilized for their milk, meat, hair, and skins all over the world. In the last century they have also gained some popularity as pets.

Female goats are referred to as '''''does''''' or '''''nannies''''', intact males as '''''bucks''''' or '''''billies'''''; their offspring are '''''kids'''''. Castrated males are '''''wethers'''''. Goat meat is sometimes called '''chevon'''. 

==Etymology==
 
The [[Modern English]] word &quot;''goat''&quot; comes from the [[Old English]] &quot;''gat''&quot; which meant &quot;''she-goat''&quot; which itself derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] &quot;''*gaitaz''&quot; (compare [[Old Norse]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] &quot;''geit''&quot;, [[German language|German]] &quot;''Geiß''&quot; and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] &quot;''gaits''&quot; all meaning &quot;''goat''&quot;) ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European]] &quot;''*ghaidos''&quot; meaning &quot;''young goat''&quot; but also &quot;''play''&quot; (compare Latin &quot;''hædus''&quot; meaning &quot;''kid''&quot;). The word for &quot;''male goat''&quot; in Old English was &quot;''bucca''&quot; (which now exists as the word ''buck'', meaning any male herbivore) until a shift to &quot;''he-goat/she-goat''&quot; occurred in the late 12th century.&quot;''Nanny goat''&quot; originated in the 18th century and &quot;billy goat&quot; in the 19th.

==History==
[[Image:Male goat.jpg|thumb|250px|Male goat, also called a billy or buck]]
Goats seem to have been first [[domesticated]] roughly 10,000 years ago in the [[Zagros]] Mountains of [[Iran]].[http://web.utk.edu/~persian/goat.htm] Ancient cultures and [[tribe]]s began to keep them for easy access to [[milk]], hair, [[meat]], and skins. Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by [[goatherd]]s who were frequently children or [[adolescent]]s, similar to the more widely known [[shepherd]]. These methods of [[herding]] are still utilized today.

Historically, goathide has been used for water and [[wine]] bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce [[parchment]], which was the most common material used for [[writing]] in Europe until the invention of the [[printing press]]. 

==Reproduction==
[[Image:Baby goats.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Baby goats, called ''kids'']]
In some climates goats, like humans, are able to [[mating|breed]] at any time of the year. In northern climates and among the Swiss breeds, the breeding season commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring. Does of any breed come into heat every 21 days for 2–48 hours. A doe in heat typically flags her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat. 

Bucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the doe's heat cycles. Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite, [[obsessive]] interest in the does, fighting between bucks, display behavior, and, most notably, a strong, [[musk|musky]] odor. This odor is singular to bucks in rut and is caused not only by the glands on their heads but by their habit of urinating on their beards and front legs — the doe does not have it unless a buck has rubbed his scent onto her or she is in actuality a [[hermaphrodite]] — and is instrumental in bringing the does into a strong heat.

[[Image:Mother eating placenta.jpg|thumb|left|Mother goat eating [[placenta]]]]
In addition to live breeding, [[artificial insemination]] has gained popularity among goat [[breeder]]s, as it allows for rapid improvement because of breeder access to a wide variety of [[bloodline]]s. 

[[Gestation]] length is approximately 150 days. [[Twins]] are the usual result, with single and [[triplet]] births also common. Less frequent are litters of [[quadruplet]], [[quintuplet]], and even [[sextuplet]] kids. Birthing, known as ''kidding'', generally occurs uneventfully with few complications. The mother often eats the [[placenta]], which, with its oxytocin, gives her much needed nutrients, helps staunch her bleeding, and is believed by some to reduce the lure of the birth scent to predators.

''Freshening'' (coming into [[milk]] production) occurs at kidding. Milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between 660 to 1,800 L (1,500 and 4,000 lb) of milk per 305 day [[lactation]]. On average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least 6 lb (2.7&amp;nbsp;L) of milk per day while she is in milk, although a first time milker may produce less, or as much as 16 lb (7.3&amp;nbsp;L) or more of milk in exceptional cases. Meat, fiber, and [[pet]] breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until [[weaning]].

==Feeding goats==
Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything. Many farmers use inexpensive (i.e. not purebred) goats for brush control, leading to the use of the term &quot;brush goats.&quot;  (Brush goats are not  a variety of goat, but rather a function they perform.)  Because they prefer weeds (e.g. multiflora rose, thorns, small trees) to clover and grass, they are often used to keep fields clear for other animals. The digestive systems of a goat allow nearly any organic substance to be broken down and used as nutrients.

Contrary to this reputation, they are quite fastidious in their habits, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad leaved plant. It can fairly be said that goats will eat almost anything in the botanical world. Their plant diet is extremely varied and includes some species which are toxic or detrimental to cattle and sheep. This makes them valuable for controlling [[weed|noxious weeds]] and clearing brush and undergrowth. They will seldom eat soiled food or water unless facing [[starvation]].

Goats do not actually consume [[waste|garbage]], [[tin can]]s, or [[clothing]], although they will occasionally eat items made primarily of plant material, which can include wood. Their reputation for doing so is most likely due to their intensely inquisitive and intelligent nature: they will explore anything new or unfamiliar in their surroundings. They do so primarily with their [[prehensile]] upper lip and tongue. This is why they investigate clothes and sometimes washing powder boxes by nibbling at them.

Goats will consume, on average, 4.5 pounds of dry matter per 100 lbs of body weight per day.{{fact}}

==Goat products==
A goat is said to be truly useful both when alive and dead, providing meat and milk while the skin provides hide. A [[charitable organization|charity]] is involved in providing goats to [[poverty|impoverished]] people in Africa. The main reason cited was that goats are easier to manage than [[cattle]] and have multiple uses. 

===Meat===

The taste of goat meat, called ''chevon'' (which, like most meat names, is from the [[French_language|French]] word for the animal, in this case ''chèvre''), is said to be similar to [[veal]] or [[venison]], depending on the age and condition of the goat. It can be prepared in a variety of ways including [[stewed]], [[baked]], [[grilled]], [[barbecue]]d, [[minced]], [[canning|canned]], or made into [[sausage]]. It is also healthier than [[mutton]] as it is lower in fat and [[cholesterol]] and comparable to [[chicken]]. It also has more minerals than chicken,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/agronomy/goats/handbook/health.html Use of Goat Milk and Goat Meat as Therapeutic Aids in Cardiovascular Diseases by John R. Addrizzo]&lt;/ref&gt; and is lower in total and saturated fats than other meats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/meatgoat/mgproduction.html Meat Goat Production in North Carolina by Jean-Marie Luginbuhl] - NC State University&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the leanness is that goats do not accumulate fat deposits or &quot;marbling&quot; in their muscles; chevon must ideally be cooked longer and at lower temperatures than other red meats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napa.ufl.edu/2001news/goatmeat.htm UF, FAMU WORK TO MAKE GOAT PART OF MAINSTREAM AMERICAN DIET Aug. 2, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular in the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]], Africa, northeastern [[Brazil]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]. Chevon, as yet, is not popular in most western nations.

Other parts of the goat including organs are also equally edible. Special delicacies include the [[brain]] and [[liver]]. For example, in Patagonia, Argentina, the head and legs of the Brodie goat are [[smoked]] and used to prepare unique spicy dishes.

===Milk and cheese===
Goats' [[milk]] is more easily digested than cows' milk and is recommended for infants and people who have difficulty with cows' milk. The curd is much smaller and more digestable. Moreover it is naturally homogenized since it lacks the [[protein]] [[agglutinin]]. Furthermore, goats' milk contains less [[lactose]] and is easier to digest, which means it will usually not trigger [[lactose intolerance]] in humans. 

Contrary to popular belief, goats' milk is not naturally bad tasting. When handled properly, from clean and healthy goats, in a sanitary manner, and cooled quickly, the flavor is unremarkable and inoffensive. Also, it is necessary to separate the strong smelling buck from the dairy does, as his scent will rub off on them and will taint the milk.

Goats' milk is also used to make popular [[cheese]]s such as [[Rocamadour (cheese)|Rocamadour]] and [[feta (cheese)|feta]], although it can be used to make any type of cheese. See [[Category:Goat's-milk cheeses]].

===Skin===
Goat skin is still used today to make [[glove]]s, [[boot]]s, and other products that require a soft hide. ''Kid gloves'', popular in [[Victorian times]], are still made today. The [[Black Bengal]] breed, native to [[Bangladesh]], provides high-quality skin. 

===Fiber===
Cashmere goats produce a fiber, [[Cashmere wool]], which is one of the best in the world. Cashmere fiber is very fine and soft, and grows beneath the guard hairs. Ideally there is a proportionally smaller amount of guard hair (which is undesirable and cannot be spun or dyed) to the cashmere fiber. Most goats produce cashmere fiber to some degree, however the Cashmere goat has been specially bred to produce a much higher amount of it with fewer guard hairs. 

The [[Angora goat|Angora]] breed produces long, curling, lustrous locks of [[mohair]]. The entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow and can be four inches or more in length. Goats do not have to be [[slaughter]]ed to harvest the wool, which is instead sheared (cut from the body) in the case of Angora goats, or combed, in the case of Cashmere goats. However the Angora goat usually gets shorn twice a year with an average yield of about 10 pounds while the Cashmere goat grows its fiber once a year and it takes about a week to comb out by hand, yielding only about 4 ounces.

The fiber is made into products such as [[sweater]]s and dolls hair with the mohair. Both cashmere and mohair are warmer per ounce than [[wool]] and are not scratchy or itchy or as allergenic as wool sometimes is. Both fibers command a higher price than wool, compensating for the fact that there is less fiber per goat than there would be wool per sheep.

In [[South Asia]], Cashmere is called ''pashmina'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] ''pashmina'' = fine wool) and these goats are called [[pashmina|''pashmina'' goats]] (often mistaken as sheep). Since these goats actually belong to the upper [[Kashmir]] and [[Laddakh]] region, their wool came to be known as cashmere in the West. The ''pashmina'' [[shawl]]s of Kashmir with their intricate embriodery are very famous.

==Goat breeds==
Goat breeds fall into four categories, though there is some overlap among them; meaning that some are dual purpose.

===Feral===
* [[Auckland Island Goat]] (extinct)

===Dairy===
* [[Alpine (goat)|Alpine]]:[[French Alpine]],[[British Alpine]],[[American Alpine]]

==Showing==
Goat [[breeder]]s' clubs frequently hold [[show (animal)|shows]], where goats are judged on traits relating to [[conformation]], [[udder]] quality, evidence of high production/ longevity, build/muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production/fiber (fiber goats). People who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award winning animals command a higher price. Registered goats, in general, are usually higher priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. A registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder.

Children's clubs such as [[4-H]] also allow goats to be shown. Children's shows often include a [[showmanship]] class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are scored. In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged.

Various''' Dairy Goat Scorecards''' (milking does) — are systems used for judging shows in the U.S. The American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA) scorecard is as follows:

General Appearance: 35 points
(This includes breed characteristics, head, shoulders, legs and feet, and topline- the back and rump)

Dairy Character: 20 points (the doe should be lean and angular, not meaty, and show evidence of high production).

Body Capacity: 10 points (the doe should be large and strong with a wide, deep barrel).

Mammary System: 35 points (udder should be productive and very well attached so as to be held up high away from possible injury, teats should be of a good size and shape for easy milking).

In all the perfect dairy goat would score all 100 points, and this is the standard by which the goats are judged. Young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character.

*[http://www.americangoatsociety.com/ The American Goat Society (AGS)] has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows. The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards.

The '''Angora Goat scorecard''' used by the Colored Angora Goat Breeder's Association or CAGBA (which covers the white and the colored goats) is as follows:

Fleece- 70 points

Completeness of cover and Uniformity: 8 points (Fineness, length, type of lock and covering, adequate covering of mohair over the entire body, neither too much nor too little on the face).

Luster and Handle of Fleece:  8 points (Good, bright type of mohair, silky feeling)

Density and Yield:  8 points (Number of fibers per unit area, determined by the amount of skin exposed when the fleece is parted).

Fineness:  14 points (Finer mohair generally is more desirable, uniformity over entire fleece).

Character and Style:  6 points (Equivalent to one inch per month or more, uniform over entire body).

Freedom from Kemp:  10 points (Kemp fibers are large, opaque, &quot;hairy&quot; fibers most commonly found at the withers, along the spine and around the tail and britch.

Body- 50 points

Size and weight for age: 8 points (Minimum weight for yearling  bucks-800 lbs, yearling does-60 lbs).

Constitution and Vigor: 8 points (Width and depth of chest, fullness of heartgirth and spring of ribs).

Conformation: 11 points (Width and depth of body, straightness of back, width of loin, straightness of legs).

Amount of bone:  8 points (Indicated by the size of the bone below the knees and hocks. Should be clean and in proportion to the size of the animal. Strength of feet and legs).

Angora Breed Type: 15 points (Indicated by head, horns, ears and topknot. Horns should be wide set and should spiral out and back. Wattles highly discouraged).

Physical Disqualifications- Disqualify the animal
Deformed mouth, broken down pasturns, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3 inch split in scrotum, close set distorted horns, or roached back.

The perfect Angora goat would score a 120 on the total points.  For more information visit the CAGBA site: *[http://www.cagba.org/ The Colored Angora Goat Breeder's Association].

==Anatomy==
Goats have horizontal slit shaped pupils. The narrower the pupil, the more accurate the depth perception of peripheral vision is, so narrowing it in one direction would increase depth perception in that plane [[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/mar98/889495842.Gb.r.html]][[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/dec96/840904233.Zo.r.html]].Animals with pupils like goats and sheep may have evolved horizontal pupils because better vision in the vertical plane may be beneficial in mountainous environments[[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/mar98/889495842.Gb.r.html]].

I am very much impressed by wikipedia and wikibooks and it has helped me in my daily life and in my profession.
I have taken big benefit of them and becouse of its free to edit and free to add pages service; So, now I am here to volunter my sincere little help.

Since I am a student from economically poor country and I am not a Book-Lover but a bread seeker; where Books plays vital role in my everyday's survival.
Big Books costs big money; I know this sharp pain; and each and every book lacks something which I seek becouse they are published and they are targetted litterally towards Us-America and United Kingdom.

So, I decided to start a free book for those economically and materially poor young science lovers where books costs more than 3 months pure salary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P.S&lt;/b&gt;: Book tastes Bad when it is chewed and seldom fullfills hunger.

== My Motto: ==

&quot;Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.&quot;
(Mahatma Gandhi)

=Connotations Of The Text=

Catullus knew Cicero and greatly admired him.

===Line 2===

*'''''Marce Tulli - Marcus Tullius (a.k.a. Cicero)

This is a very formal way of addressing Cicero, his patron. This is why the vocative case is used, which also indicates apostrophe, another poetic device that shows direct address. It serves to further contrast humble Catullus with the great Cicero.

===Lines 5-7===

*'''''pessimus omnium poeta - worst of all poets'''''

The anaphora in these two lines emphasises Catullus' point - it could also add an air of sarcasm and hyperbole within the poem.

*'''''omnium - all'''''

This is repeated three times, and creates a juxtapostition within the poem - i.e. Catullus is the worst of all the poets, and Cicero is the best of all the patrons.

      <comment>/* The Logo- Swoosh */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==

The Nike brand is considered a highly effective brand across many disciplines.  Business professionals and consumers alike, view the Nike brand as established and well respected.  According to Scott Bedbury in his book, &quot;A New Brand World&quot; (2002) &quot;The brand idea is no longer confined just to packaged consumer products.  Today the word &quot;brand&quot; has become part of the vernacular within every department of any progressive company (1).&quot;  While corporate branding is often at the forefront of brand identity, we choose to take a different approach.  We will be examining the visual rhetoric of the Nike brand and how the visual rhetoric components effectiveness and/or ineffectiveness. We will use rhetorical theories based on semiotics, gender, narrative representation and spatial experience. We will be paying specific attention to the Nike logo, slogan, print advertisements, Web site, and the NikeTown retail stores all as mediums for rhetorical branding.

== '''The Logo- Swoosh''' ==
Another name for a logo is a trademark or signature (Ryan 393).  For Nike, the swoosh has become just that- a signature.  With or without the word Nike underneath it, the general population will see the swoosh and associate it with Nike.  Regardless of the resemblance to ancient gods or to a check of excellence, the aerodynamic nature of the logo has contributed to the marketing and business success of the brand, as it has imbued a simple brand mnemonic with meaning. This makes the brand more memorable, and use of the brand symbol more effective. However, the success of the swoosh as a visually rhetorical element takes a different angle.

The rhetorical representation of the logo must communicate within one single image everything the organization wants the public to know about them.  The logo is the heart of an organization's identity.  It will show up on all products and publicity materials and must become synonymous with the organization's actual name.  Besides the above stated requirements of effective branding, a logo must go one step further in order to be persuasive visually.
 
The purpose of visual rhetoric is to persuade visually.  The swoosh simultaneously represents athleticism, competition and victory.  With one solid brush stroke, viewers of the swoosh know that this is what it means.  Yet Nike's audience does not notice this at first upon examination of the swoosh because &quot;visual communication is always coded [and] seems transparent only because we know the code already, at least implicitly&quot; (Kress 32).  It looks similar to the wings on the feet of the god Hermes and a wing of the goddess Nike.  The swoosh also resembles a check mark which, in American culture, has become representative of success and a job well-done.  In semiotics, these implicit, learned code systems are used to create messages.  Symbols are culturally bound and have a shared meaning within the culture (Trenholm 376).  Nike prides itself in creating state of the art athletic equipment from running shoes to soccer balls and using a logo that rhetorically represents success and visually ties into the ancient gods of sport explains its success as a successful, simple and recognizable trademark.  This clear logo is a perfect example of mixing rhetorical semiotics (recognizable links to wings of gods and the check of a job well-done) and simplicity (the logo is one swift brush stroke) to create a rhetorically strong brand basis.  As John Berger notes, &quot;publicity images belong to the moment in the sense that they must be continually renewed and made up-to-date.  Yet they never speak of the present.  Often they refer to the past and always they speak of the future&quot; (Berger 130).  For Nike, referring to the wings of Hermes and Nike as well as referring to the cultural symbol of a check communicate their visual argument successfully.

=== '''Slogan: &quot;Just Do It&quot;''' ===

“Just Do It” is the tag-line associated with the Nike logo.  This tag-line is habitually positioned alongside Nike’s logo, whether it is in a print or television advertisement.  Together, the logo and tag-line feature the significance of Nike’s brand goals and ideals-athleticism and victory.  The logo design symbol, along with the tag line, has evolved into a motto and the way of life for a whole generation.  According to John Heskett, “Objects and environments can be used by people to construct a sense of who they are, to express their sense of identity&quot;.  The Nike logo and tag-line serve to identify ordinary human beings as icons for action and excellence.    

In relating this concept to visual rhetoric, one can look to the readings of Arnheim, Barthes and McCloud and their impressive discussion on semiotic surfaces.  Arnheim stresses in his essay that the terms sign, symbol and picture do not stand for kinds of images, but rather, describe the function fulfilled by the images.  He discusses how an image serves as a sign to the extent to which it stands for a particular content, without reflecting its characteristics visually.  This description can serve written language as well. These concepts are fully present in the Nike brand.  The swoosh logo, as well as tag-line, portray a particular image and slogan that stands for a particular content, without reflecting its features visually.  

The logo is fundamentally a swoosh.  It looks like a check mark.  It's plain, simple and yet, unmistakable.  It's meaning is more intense, deeper and influential as described in the above section. 

The &quot;Just Do It&quot; tag line is similar in this manner.  When we read words, the words are describing a content, yet do not reflect it visually.  Words are most definitely serving as signs, and provide identification and distinction.  Although the tag line is too, fundamentally simple, it is distinct in its meaning.  &quot;Just Do It&quot; means don’t think, don’t ask, don’t talk about it, don't regret it, just do it.  The visual displays alongside this motto coincide with this notion.  Sports figures and general athletes are depicted as having supreme athletic prowess, at the top of their game.  &quot;It appeals to the desire to be free, independent, overcoming all obstacles and social and physical inhibitions and limitations– and one can see how this appeals to the athlete or athlete to be, if not to everyone.&quot; [http://people.bu.edu/rfarnold/Public.htm Just Do It: Nike Advertising as Public Art]

== '''Print Advertisements: Real Women''' ==
One of the most effective brand elements is the use of print advertisements.  These advertisements not only function as a sales tool, but at their core, they serve a rhetorical purpose, to persuade us.  Nike embodies this function in the use of their “real women” advertisements. [http://commercial-archive.com/node/123348 Real Women Ads] These advertisements showcase what seem to be real women and highlight a specific part of their body.  According to USAToday.com, the ads show “a mix of pro athlete models and real women appear in ads with shots of their legs, butt, hips or arms. The fit women are unapologetic about what they call their ‘big butt’ or ‘thunder thighs.’”  Spokesperson for Nike, Caren Bell, comments that, “The ads try to illustrate that 'not all body types are created equally.  To be a woman athlete, fit and strong doesn't mean you have to be sample size.&quot;

However, these images embody what Scott A. Lukas, Ph.D, refers to as “no object” advertisements. Here women are denied agency, the women are objectified and their identity is concealed.  The Nike “real women” ads show only isolated body parts, never revealing to the viewer the woman’s whole body.  John Berger explains in his book, &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot; (1972) that men are the spectators and the women are the objects – or the things that are made desirable.  Berger simplifies this by stating, &quot;men act and women appear&quot; (47).  In the Nike &quot;real women&quot; ads, the unidentified women expresses the perceptions that she has about herself.  These Nike ads play on women's insecurities, yet displays them in a way that empowers the female.  These ads go against the grain and are rhetorical in the sense that they act as persuasive liberation.  While the format of the ads are not new, the way that the text changes the meaning of the ads is a significant feature of the Nike &quot;Real Women&quot; ads.

In addition, Berger explains how words are able to change the meaning of a particular image.  &quot;It is hard to define exactly how the words have changed the image but undoubtedly they have.  The Image now illustrates the sentence&quot; (28).  The Nike ads would certainly be different if the words were absent from the ad.  Without the words we see only a disjointed body, that has no identity.  The words work to tell a story and explain the woman's highlighted body part.  The words in the ad are persuasive in that they attempt to get the audience to sympathize with the woman's feelings and provide a context, which is based on our culture, that is needed in understanding the advertisements in their entirety.

== '''Nike Web site''' ==

Creating a Web site is another form of branding. [http://www.nike.com Nike's Web site] creates a sense of cohesion where everything relates and everything flows together. This is a site that is also simplistic and subtle when presenting its argument. Nike has created an interactive Web site. Visitors can view the site and click on images of interest. By clicking on the image, it brings it to the middle of the screen and allows you to play a video that explains the image. So, what exactly is rhetorical?

The Nike Web site creators are effectively promoting its product which essentially is the main purpose, but that's just the surface. Digging deeper, it becomes apparent that Nike has attempted to create a narrative representation, as defined in Carolyn Handa's &quot;Visual Rhetoric in a Digital World.&quot; The site attempts to tell a story about the different aspects of this brand, essentially saying that there is something for everyone. There are horizontal vectors that show the time line for the videos that the website includes with its images. So, now let's take a look at the effective and ineffective ways that Nike presents its argument through its website.

Nike creates a website with effective forms of branding. This a Web site that is offered in several different languages allowing for Nike to promote its product all over the world. For this website to be effective it is important that it create a positive affect with everyone who visits or views the website. The site gives the Nike product a status of superiority. This Web site is simplistic but has a futuristic look to it, which demonstrates that not only does it intend to continue to be great for years to come, but that it is coinciding with change over time. It is important to note that Nike brand Web site effectively creates a sense of identification. It is a site that one can quickly identify as Nike. This brings up the question of conformity. Nike does an excellent job of being original. It creates images and organizes the site that is directly specific to the Nike brand which makes it easier for consumers to quickly identify that this is in fact the place to go on the internet for all things Nike.  The use of repetition is present throughout the Web site. The same format and color schemes are, for the most part, used throughout the entire website. This helps somewhat with navigating as well as attempts to eliminate some confusion. As for simply the way the website looks, Nike creates a Web site that is new, creative and different. It attempts to set itself apart from other competing brands. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, this website effectively promotes the Nike brand. It is encouraging exchange making it easy for consumers to purchase Nike products.

With all the elements of effective branding mentioned above, there are some areas that could be considered ineffective. When it comes to clarity the main problem becomes the inability to identify the message being presented. Visitors know that it is Nike's Web site, but it is uncertain as to what exactly the purpose of the site is. Also, not everyone is familiar with the Internet and how to navigate around websites, it may be difficult for viewers to effectively navigate around this site. Nike makes it easy to purchase items directly from the site, but any other information is a bit more difficult to find. After visiting the Nike's website, it becomes apparent that there is some jargon and concepts that are not easily understandable. The use of simple language is needed to help increase the Web site's effectiveness.

== '''NikeTown''' ==

The retail branch of the Nike brand, NikeTown, is truly a rhetorical retail experience. “Niketown is neither a sporting goods supermarket nor simply a building; it is a city animated by the spirit of Nike (von Bories, p. 75).” The stores are filled with multimedia simulations, dramatic lighting, high ceilings and themed media, all creating a museum-like perspective on the Nike brand. The clear connection between NikeTown and museums allows us to interpret the rhetoric of NikeTown in a similar fashion to that of a museum. In “Framing the Fine Arts Through Rhetoric,” Marguerite Helmers asserts that the placement of objects in museum exhibits as well as the emphasis placed on certain exhibits over others “create a cultural and visual memory that establishes the value and meaning of objects (p. 78).” In NikeTown stores the placement of certain products, i.e. the museum wall of shoes that every NikeTown features, emphasizes those sneakers as central to the Nike brand identity. 


In “Niketown Berlin: The city as a brand experience,” Friedrich von Bories describes the NikeTown stores as spaces of experience. He believes that in visiting a NikeTown store, consumers are able to experience brand identity. A visitor to a NikeTown store is no longer a consumer, but rather a citizen. Instead of having to purchase Nike products in a bid for brand identity, individuals must only visit the NikeTown store. “Niketown replaces Michael Jordan…The consumer’s attention is no longer directed toward a heroic figure, since he/she has become one him/herself (von Bories, p. 77).” Comparitive to interactive museum exhibitions, NikeTown, through the use of visual rhetorics such as ambient sound, interactive models and video displays,  places the visitor within the scene, within the brand. “The effect was like being in a film. Spectators were scenic ‘extras,’ placed on a set, given props, and asked to react to the fictions as if it were all real (Helmers, p. 80).”  

The NikeTown stores embody effective rhetorical branding in that the stores are capable of translating human thought and beliefs into a spatial experience for the consumer. All Nike collateral materials; ads, images, products, are encapsulated in the dynamic, technological space of NikeTown. “’The goal was to reflect the spirit of Nike and at the same time define the personality of the store.’(Lampert-Greaux, p. 37).”

== '''Conclusion''' ==

Traditionally, branding is not considered rhetorical, but after further investigation we have been able to reveal the rhetorical nature of the branding movement. With branding, corporations are creating a visual argument that represents a specific image, lifestyle and essence. The visual elements that Nike uses in its branding strategy include logo, slogan, print advertisements, Web site and retail stores. Each branding medium uses distinct visually rhetorical tactics to convey its brand message. The visual rhetorical tactics used by Nike include semiotics, gender, narrative representation and spatial experience. The fusion of these rhetorical tactics create an effective Nike brand. 

It is important to understand that there is a visual argument behind all brands. Using the elements of visual rhetoric to critically examine brands provides a different lens of understanding brand effectiveness. While we only analyzed the Nike brand, one should apply rhetorical theories to all brand identities so as to gain a broader understanding of corporate ideals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==


==='''Explaining Fashion Through Semiotics'''===

Semiotics assumes that visual images and their respective signs can be read similar to a text.  Fashion and body adornment not only have a language of their own, but can be read as an explanation and text of one’s personality and character.  Cultural semiotics is an important part of visual rhetoric because it allows us to take simple signs and codes and turn them into an actual conversation. Often studying visual rhetoric includes studying compositions, art, advertisement, film, and many other objects created.  Not only can the things created around us be analyzed in regards to their visual rhetoric, but the things in themselves, and the way they are presented can also present a coded and signified message.  Each person has a unique personality, set of beliefs, opinions, and in order to convey that identity we use our body as a canvas to project that identity.  

Elizabeth Wilson States: 
&quot;In all societies the body is 'dressed' and everywhere dress and adornment play symbolic, communicative and aesthetic roles.  Dress is always 'unspeakably meaningful.' The earliest forms of 'clothing' seem to have been adornments such as body painting, ornaments, scarifications (scarring), tattooing, masks and often constricting neck and waist bands.  Many of these deformed, reformed or otherwise modified the body&quot; (Rampley 68).  

The rhetoric of a person, and their appearance, can include many factors.  One can represent themselves with their clothes in many ways, with jewelry, adorning themselves with symbols, hairstyles as well as many other rhetorical items. Although many individuals may debate as to whether these past cultural trends can be included as clothing/dress, for the sake of our argument all of these things call into the visual rhetoric of the body and the way a culture or individuals choose to represent themselves.  This act of representing, and presenting ones rhetoric through clothes, or other body adornment, Rampley calls self-fashioning; which he believes can articulate subtle and important characteristics of individuals including personality, mood, and even emotions (71).

==='''Codes'''===

Not only can particular styles of clothes define a person as an individual, but also as a part of a group.  According to Pauline Thomas, “Fashion is a language of signs, symbols and iconography that non-verbally communicate meanings about individuals and groups.”   Depending on the context clothes and other defining objects can mean very different things, but we plan on showing examples within our culture that effectively communicate a specific notion of identity through specific rhetorical cues.  Fred Davis discusses the way that clothes and fashion can represent identity through the semiotic notion of code.  

&quot;The chief difficulty of understanding fashion in its apparent vagaries is the lack of exact knowledge of the unconscious symbolisms attaching to forms, colors, textures, postures, and other expressive elements of a given cultures.  The difficulty is appreciably increased by the fact that some of the expressive elements tend to have quite different symbolic references in different areas.  Gothic type, for instance, is a nationalistic token in Germany while in Anglo-Saxon culture, the practically identical type known as Old English...signifies a wistful look backward at madrigals and pewter&quot; (Davis 50). Although you can give meaning to semiotics signs can change and this applies to trends as well.  Fashion design and symbolic adornments can have very definitive symbols, but depending on the time and place those symbols can be constantly shifting and changing.  Even though they may change they are still held to their symbolic meaning by the collective culture.  

In our chapter we include many different genres in which this rhetoric can be displayed, but we also put a large emphasis on the particular clothes people wear and what they can mean.  We do put a large focus on the rhetoric of clothing intentionally because as a largely consumer-based culture, we as a society in general put a lot of value on our appearance and represent our identities largely in our consumption of goods, especially clothing.

== '''Why We Wear Clothes''' ==


What is the function of dress in society? Overall, human beings in most cultures wear clothes for one or more of the following reasons, comfort and protection, modesty and cultural and personal display.

==='''Clothing for Protection'''===

Considering early human beings, we know that clothing was used as a way to keep warm, to protect the skin and as a mean to comfort the body. As people roamed from region to region, the body continued to prove inadequate for certain environments, thus the need for protective clothing. Even today, we understand that when the weather turns cooler adding layers will keep the body warm. Removing layers keep the body cooler in the summer time, and wearing various other garments protect our body from almost all the natural elements. However, clothing has become much more than a way to protect the body, the fact that we do indulge in clothing beyond mere comfort suggests yet function-- modesty.

==='''Modesty'''===

According to the American Heritage Dictionary, modesty is a “Reserve or propriety in speech, dress, or behavior.” Many cultures have deemed it necessary to practice a certain amount of modesty in dress by covering up certain body parts. A familiar story in the Christian bible talks about the characters of Adam and Eve wandering through the Garden of Eden completely naked and oblivious prior to gaining knowledge and knowing shame. In most cultures, individuals are expected to keep certain aspects of their body covered up. In certain Eastern cultures, women are supposed to remain in purdha (seclusion) to avoid being seen by men and or even other women outside of the family. To be exposed would constitute a lack of propriety and cause a certain degree of dishonor to the family. While western practices vary in their interpretation of modesty, the same idea goes as why mothers and fathers may feel uncomfortable with their thirteen-year-old daughter leaving the house in a tube top and a mini skirt.

==='''Personal and Cultural Display'''===

Lastly, and arguably, most importantly, clothing is a way of presenting one’s personal and cultural values; alternatively demonstrating one’s style, or lack thereof. Clothing has become a symbol of an individual’s identity. Society acknowledges and accepts certain forms of dress and attributes them to the characteristics of the individual. For instance, a doctor may wear a clean white lab coat in order to appear sterile and present a professional image to his or her patients. While wearing a white coat makes signs of insanitation obvious, the white coat has come to be more of a cultural badge than anything else is. However, these markers, or familiar icons in dress are not limited to this single white coat. In western society, police officers wear variations of blue uniforms, Basketball players wear sleeveless jerseys and nuns wear black and white dresses that cover their heads. These stereotypes have become useful in our everyday lives as they help simplify things and people into categories. These distinctions are what enable the individuals in the cases listed above to choose their own way of communicating nonverbally to the world.

== Clothing as a Form of Non-Verbal Communication ==


''Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.'' -Oscar Wilde

==='''Making a Statement...(whether you realize it or not)'''===

At this point one should understand that non-verbal communication is unavoidable. Regardless of whether or not the message is intentional, we continue to communicate with each other long after our mouths close. “It is impossible to wear clothes without transmitting social signals,” claims human behaviorist Desmond Morris (213). Even choosing not to wear clothes sends a message. The decision each individual makes about his or her appearance sends the viewer a message. This includes people who claim they pay no attention to their clothing with regard to its communicative value. 


A guy with long hair and a full beard who insists that he will not shave for anyone may be quick to change his decision if her were to be brought to trial for possession of marijuana. When going into a job interview a candidate may opt for a suit and tie instead of sweatpants and flip-flops. As the weather warms shops fill with pastels and brightly colored clothes. In order to avoid trends, a young woman chooses not to conform by donning jeans and a t-shirt. These situations are examples of how we use clothing to communicate. On a cultural level, the man with the beard understands that maintaining certain hairstyles sends out a certain message through non-verbal communication. Not wanting to be misunderstood or perhaps to send out a different nonverbal message, the importance of nonverbal communication is something acknowledged by all.  Not only are these examples of trends, or avoiding trends, they convey a message depending on the culturally accepted codes that they apply to among within our culture.

== '''The Language of Jeans''' ==

In the past decade, the price of jeans has skyrocketed, especially among the designer labels such as Seven for All Mankind, Citizens for Humanity, and Diesel, among others. These designer brands have become a mark of status that indicates a sort of identity of the person wearing them. Designer jeans carry an insignia on the back pockets that identify the designer brand and how much money the wearer spent, which communicate information about the person wearing the jeans through understood symbols of our culture.
Throughout their history, jeans have represented a casual lifestyle. They have humble origins from the beginning when Levi Strauss designed denim pants that were immediately associated with manual labor. Jeans were and are often still worn by manual laborers, which give them a sense of informality and a laid back attitude. But in fact, recent years have proven that celebrities and even college students are willing to pay lots of money for these “casual” jeans that are a sign of high-fashion and class. Wearers of designer jeans are, in fact, paying for the laid-back vibe that jeans give off. While the wearer attempts to appear laid-back and casual, the stitching on the back pocket communicates symbolic information about the person, and the message is clear: &quot;The wearer is someone with disposable capital, who cares about her image, and who knows that other women will be surreptitiously checking out her butt&quot; (Thomas).

== '''Elaborating on the Fashion 'Conversation'''' ==

==='''Symbolic Grammar of Fashion'''===

There exists a “grammar of fashion.” The larger the “vocabulary,” or someone’s closet, the more creative and expressive those wearers can be, which enables them to create more “sentences.&quot; As a result, wearers are able to portray information about themselves effectively, more effectively, perhaps, than someone who doesn’t have those same means.
			
The traditional definition of rhetoric holds that it operates to influence behavior and change attitudes. Fashion, as a form of rhetoric, has the same capacity. Style is included as one of Cicero’s five canons of rhetoric. While the traditional meaning of “style” as a canon of rhetoric includes the way a person speaks or presents their language, the meaning of style in the rhetoric of fashion includes the way a person presents him or her self to the world through the clothing they wear (designer brands or not). Cicero had the idea that “the word choice of the speaker has a direct correlation between the audience’s perception of the speaker and his character.” In the rhetoric of fashion, however, “word choice” is shifted to mean clothing choice, designer choice, style choice, etc. While it is an undeniable fact that a person’s style and fashion choices portray a world of meaning about their personality and character, it is an unfortunate fact that many individuals in our society do not have the fiscal means necessary to “argue for themselves” in the same way that the elite do.

Not only do clothes represent, and express the style of a person, but so does body art in many different modes. Tattooing and body piercing has been practiced in almost every culture for thousands of years (Greif, Hewitt, Armstrong). The body modification movement did not begin in the Western culture. In fact, it can be argued that the kinds of changes one makes to her or his physical body plays a large part in the rhetoric an individual is trying to portray.

==='''Body Piercing'''===

Culturally, there are different reasons why a person would choose to pierce his body. Consistently throughout history, ear lobe piercing has been seen as a mark of feminine beauty(10). It was not until the 1970s, however, that men began to pierce their bodies as well, as a mark of their occupation or their sexual orientation. Today, Western cultures have seen the art of body piercing explode into the mainstream.

According to Joan Jacobs Brumberg in her book The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls, “body piercing, once regarded as characteristic of “primitive” people, has emerged in the 1990’s as the latest form of self-expression among American adolescents” (Brumberg 130).  Instead of having only the option of piercing one’s ears, women (and men) today now can spend hours deciding which body part they would like pierced (eyebrow, lip, nipple, navel, etc) and which piece of jewelry they would like to wear (hoop or post). Brumberg argues that both the homosexual subculture as well as cultural icons like Madonna introduced piercing into the mainstream culture. [[Image:Caribicbauch02.jpg|thumb| An Example of the Navel Piercing]]In her book ''Sex'', written in the 1980s, Madonna features photographs of both men and women pierced in multiple places on their bodies. She also showed off her navel ring in public, and stated that she adopted the look after she saw some members of her homosexual entourage wearing the same piercing. MTV showed teens wide varieties of piercing: they made popular bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana, as well as their piercings. The 1994 Paris runways showed supermodels like Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington with pierced navels. Because of the overwhelming popularity of such stars in the 1980's and early 1990's, body piercing became the newest fad. But is it rhetorical?

Brumberg argues that “piercing proves, in a public way, that your body is your own” (134). She argues that piercing in the 1990s represented “provocative symbols of a powerful revolution in sexual mores and behavior” (132). Piercing one’s body signals one’s “personal politics” and it becomes a symbol of both “sexual liberation (because piercing symbolizes opposition to conventional sexual norms) and cultural relativism (because it evokes the primitive and the exotic)” (134). Piercing provides easy ways for young people to differentiate themselves from the mainstream adolescent culture, while still being a part of a mainstream subculture.

==='''Tattoos'''===

A Tattoo, like ear piercing, was only acceptable in the Western Culture among subculture groups like sailors, prisoners, bikers, and mobsters. Again, like piercing, the homosexual subculture began the tattoo movement to the mainstream. 

According to &quot;The Progression of the Tattoo,&quot; tattoos are now considered a &quot;unique decoration&quot; in the world of body art because they stay with the person forever. Many people find this idea appealing, and seek to tattoo on themselves an idea or message that will never leave them. [[Image:Man_with_tattoo_on_his_back_-_at_the_beach_-_cropped.jpg|thumb|left| Some young adults view tattoos as a form of self expression]]This idea also follows the idea that because body art is more popular in the mainstream culture of Generation X, it can be seen as a divergence from the culture of the previous generation. In this sense, tattooing, like body piercing, can be seen as liberation from the mainstream culture.

Tattoos can also be considered a sign of conformity. At the beginning of the recent tattooing revolution (about twenty years ago) getting a tattoo was a clear sign of deviation. Today, however, tattoos have made their way into the popular culture of the nation: advertisements even have begun to use tattoos in their marketing to appeal to a younger buying demographic. So while before, tattooing was really a sign of the &quot;other,&quot; today, it can be argued that wearing a tattoo is only a more permanent way to conform (Kennedy).


Today, between 7 and 20 million American adults are reported to be tattooed (G,H,L). Out of 766 tattooed college students who participated in the survey conducted by Grief, Hewitt, and Armstrong, 53% of the students said that they got a tattoo for self-expression. 35% &quot;just wanted one,&quot; 21% got tattooed to remember an event, 17% wanted to feel independent, and 11% wanted independence. The results of the study suggest that &quot;as with all art forms, the purpose of tattoos seems to be to be means of communicating thoughts, ideas, and feelings&quot; (G,H,L).

Associate Professor of Psychology Christina Frederick-Recascino whose research specializes in why college-aged people get tattoos argues that while the body art movement may seem like a fad or a craze, &quot;the majority said they were not getting tattoos and pierces from peer pressure.&quot; She states that &quot;they were choosing it as a way to reflect their identity.&quot; For many young adults who decide to permanently change their bodies, tattoos &quot;reflects an aspect of who [they are], represents [their] inner personality, [their] interests, life goals, life philosophy&quot; (&quot;Tattoo. Pierce. How Come?&quot;). In that sense, tattoos should be considered vastly rhetorical, because the person is making the decision to permanently inscribe their body with a personal message.

Tattoos and body piercing works alongside the brands and styles of clothes one chooses to wear to create a rhetorical statement about the kind of person one is. In that sense, if clothing makes up the &quot;sentences&quot; in the grammar of fashion, than surely it can be argued that tattoos and body piercing are the &quot;punctuation&quot; in those sentences.

== Cultural Applications of Fashion Semiotics ==
 
“The whole world loves American movies, blue jeans, jazz and rock and roll. It is probably a better way to get to know our country than by what politicians or airline commercials represent.”
—Billy Joel

“Busted flat in Baton Rouge, Waitin' for a train, When I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans”  
—Janis Joplin


One common definition of culture is described as the “values, norms, institutions and artifacts” that are “passed on from one generation to another by learning alone” (Hoult 93).  Often the interrogation of cultural meaning leads to categorizing and dividing into subsystems such as “sociological” and “technological”. These subsystems address “people and their interactions with each other”, and “material objects and their uses”, respectively (Forsberg). But are there some cases where the social interactions are defined by the objects we use? What about the clothing we wear? When speaking of culture and our clothes—blue jeans in particular—no amount of dividing and categorizing can mitigate the deep and rich cultural milieu surrounding the ‘all American blue jean’. The sentiment often seen or heard in movies and books is the ‘favorite pair’ or ‘perfect pair’ of blue jeans. The symbolic significance of jeans is seen in the intense marketing efforts to. There are plenty of images associating a certain brand with the 'ideal'. But this is true for almost any consumer product in our society. So what makes blue jeans so different? Is it their long history? Or is it the constant accessibility to diverse tools of expression that jeans offer? Jeans can be powerful symbols bearing significant meaning; the cut, the brand and also the 'way' jeans are worn. Are they unkempt and worn out? Are they stained and soiled, bearing the oily signs of a gear-head or motorcycle fanatic? Or perhaps you own a bedazzler... enough said. The meaning-rich subtexts from advertising and pop culture offer a variety of identity 'markers' and identity 'tellers'. It's because the identity markers and tellers are widely accepted and understood that makes the symbolic meaning so effective.

How far can we go in discussing the symbolic power of blue jeans in our society? Can a pair of pants really define our values, or norms, play a role in our institutions or be labeled as artifacts?  It is very clear that in America (and nearly everywhere else), denim jeans represent behemoths of symbolic culture. From the earliest account of canvas overalls in the mid-nineteenth century California Gold Rush to James Dean and Marlon Brando to the legendary '501 Blues' campaign in the '80's, jeans have been omnipresent in American cultural landscapes. The “501 Blues” campaign was arguably the one move that launched Levi’s to cultural icon status. Those images today are touted as blackmailing material for such 501-era actors as Bruce Willis who may guest-star on late night television; but in their day, those images really made an impression. There were few things I wanted more than button-fly 501 Levi's (zippers weren’t cool). My Mom tried to pass off ‘Lee’ jeans or ‘Wranglers’ as suitable substitutes but I wouldn’t have it. I had seen the commercials, I knew what was cool and what wasn’t. Plus, I had already endured years of persecution as a kid from having to wear a bullet-proof variety of pants known (appropriately) as ‘Tough Skins’. And to make matters worse, they were hand-me-downs (and olive-green). 




==='''Jackie Kennedy - A Symbol of Fashion'''===

[[Image:Whitehouseportraitjackie.jpg|right|200px|]]
Jackie Kennedy is an important figure in discussing the rhetoric of fashion. As first lady, she was part of the elite, ruling class. As is normally the case with fashion trends, the ruling class establishes the fashion trends, and lower classes then attempt to emulate those styles. Those who imitated Jackie Kennedy's style did so not only because they liked her sense of style, but they also wanted to identify with those aspects of her life that her style brought with it: wealth, power, and social status. Celebrity figures such as Jackie Kennedy provide us with the most accessible vision of what it means to be wealthy. Their style and their fashion choices become culturally understood symbols that represent wealth and power.

Once the “refined taste” of the elite is adopted by lower classes, (for example: imitation Louis Vuitton handbags, fake Chanel sunglasses) the elite then shift gears and establish a new high-fashion trend that places them back at the top of the fashion pyramid. Many times, the trend among the elite is to wear clothing that appears “casual” and “low-maintenance,” (all while costing hundreds or even thousands of dollars) – but as soon as the ''actual'' casual and low maintenance wearers adopt those trends, the style changes (Remirez). 

This cycle happens for two reasons. First, there is the need for union. Consumers, high and low classes alike, feel the need to belong to a larger society; they want to be seen as fashionable in the eyes of their audience who may be their peers, their coworkers, or family members. In order to appear fashionable, consumers wear those pieces of clothing that are socially constructed symbols of fashion. Second, there is the need for isolation. While style-setters and style-emulators both wish to belong to the larger society, there is also the need to be considered apart from the larger whole, to establish themselves as unique individuals with a distinctive taste (Remirez). 

Not only do fashion choices and brand names act as symbols that communicate information about the social or economic status of a person, but they also have the capability to communicate an ideology about our society and the power that fashion has within it. An ideology is an accepted pattern or set of ideas, such as what is or is not considered fashionable in a particular culture. For our culture, the acceptable fashion trends are typically adopted from celebrities and the elite. An ideology is constructed and consumed through fashion, and this ideology about what is fashionable becomes hegemonic or dominant when it is viewed as the norm.

Although norms are established, there still exists the need for isolation and distinction. This need for individuality from the larger whole of society represents a certain characteristic within our society: we praise uniqueness and individuality; we look highly upon those individuals who have the independence to dress uniquely and who also have the fiscal means to do so.

The traditional definition of rhetoric holds that it operates to influence behavior and change attitudes. Fashion, as a form of rhetoric, has the same capacity.

== Conclusion ==

The fashion of individuals, of a group, of a nation, reads much like a conversation; highlighting certain codes and symbols to represent sentences that are able to explain identity.  A person can use their clothes and their overall fashion to represent power, status, differentiation, character, mood, apathy, or rebellion all in many different manifestations.  Although a person can change the conversation of their clothes on a daily basis, the origin of what is said comes from the semiotics of the culture that person comes from.  Just as semiotics can change with time, fashion and its meaning changes, at times it seems daily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Controversial Images and Emotional Responses==

	Little research has been done thus far concerning the emotional effects surrounding abrasive images.  How are you supposed to feel when you see a picture of child soldiers in Africa, or a composite image making a mockery of the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald?   Images have the potential to elicit emotion from a viewer just as much, if not more than text alone, so why hasn't the ethics of visual communication been studied more comprehensively?  As images become more and more a part of professional communication, we will see more research and ethical guidelines pertaining to the use of ethically questionable images.  But for the time being, what is currently out there in the real world? 
	Research shows that visuals play just as an important role as text, if not more important, in having an emotional impact on its audience (Kienzler, 1997).  However, the code of ethics that loosely governs images is highly under-developed compared to that of its counterpart- written text.  According to Stephen Casner, Ph.D., of the NASA Ames Research Center, visuals can sometimes have more impact than text when coupled together, for three reasons.  First, images have a direct and quick emotional impact that linear text alone lacks.  Also, when viewing a document, an audience is drawn to the images accompanying the text before the view the text itself.  Last, viewers remember images much longer than they remember accompanying text.  For these reasons it is important to study images and the effects that they may have on viewers just as intensely as humans have scrutinized the ethics of the written word.   Visuals have an increasing impact on today's high-speed society, especially in professional communication (Keinzler, 1997).   This chapter will closely examine what abrasive images are readily available to society today in advertisement, editorial cartoons, as well as manipulated composite images.  We will also discuss the emotion responses that are tied with images that cause irritation
	Emotionally stirring images can conjure up a lot of feelings among their viewers, whether that is joy or anger.  Although text has the ability to do so, there is a much more comprehensive set of ethical codes that go along with them.  Currently there are no real standards set thus far for visuals beyond what is considered pornographic, and with a lack of these needed standards the envelope will only be pushed farther and farther.  As the ethical boundary is pushed, and line for what is considered ethical will follow closely behind.  If the current trend of abrasive and irritating images continues to move, the ethical standard will continue to drop.  It is the responsibility of the viewer to act as a critical thinker and determine if an image is unjustly abrasive.  
	The following sections will discuss the different aspects of controversial images listed above.  Please use the information below as an informational start to see how current issues and other controversial debates can be manipulated.  Although the ethical code of images may change soon to mirror the standards of text in public domains, for now it is the responsibility of the reader to determine what they should consider ethical and stand against.

==Composite Images, Photoshop &amp; Irritation==

Our life is filled with emotionally-charged images that may contradict our traditional ways of interpreting and thinking. One way that we are challenged in our views is through images that shock, or surprise, an audience. Traditionally, these images are found in advertisements, but more recently we find ourselves being challenged by the popular art of composite images. Photoshop is growing trend in our culture, mostly among the younger generation, that allows our everyday images to be turned into something extraordinary whether it’s a politically-charged message or just something that we like to parody. This fairly new program opens up a world of possibilities when it comes to images and visual rhetoric given that these images can be manipulated to portray a biased opinion or view. Oftentimes in a composite image the more shocking the material, the better; and the more blatant or disturbing an image is, the more we question the ethics of the author and their intentions. Given an uproar in composite images after the advent of Photoshop, we are often brought to ask ourselves whether it is the fault of the program or audience for potentially abusing the power of the program. 

Mostly, our questioning of these images leads us to a different way of thinking and a way of reflecting in upon ourselves; on what it is that disturbs us about certain images and why. For example, in a recent class presentation, my partner and I used a composite image of JonBenet Ramsey as a demonstration on how composite images strike a sort of “irritation” between our social standards or ideals and our emotions. The composite is of a bartender’s body with JonBenet’s head “photoshopped” onto the figure. The child appears to be mixing a cocktail in this up-scale environment with a martini shaker made of a judicial figure. The author of the image wrote on his website [http://www.doctorcosmo.com Doctor Cosmo] that the he made the image because he thought the trial of the case “was a mockery of the judicial system, and how money can’t buy you love…but it can certainly keep your ass out of jail.” This image stirs our beliefs and makes us question if it’s morally correct to use an image of a child who died so young and horribly in an image that mocks our system. When presenting material with my partner, we questioned if the image of JonBenet would offend our audience, but we quickly realized that sometimes it is good to shock people with emotionally-charged images because we get more of a reaction and we begin to question why it is that we get so offended. 
 
Perhaps the reason why composite images are so controversial is because they often use subjects that are displaced from their original contexts and transform them into a completely new perspective. As a result, we feel transplanted along with the subject. This change in contexts is what initially draws our attention to the image, and it may be why we initially become shocked when looking at a divisive image. Alternately, one of the reasons composite images can be rhetorical is that they sometimes shed new light on a subject, almost as if to give us a fresh new outlook on what it is that we’re seeing. When we see things as if we see them for the first time, we tend to think of them in an alternate way and may be easier persuaded given we gain a different perspective. Often images that grab our attention the most are shocking and controversial, so much so that we experience a sort of &quot;irritation&quot; between our cultural, social, and moral discourses. Craig Stroupe describes his theory of the rhetoric of irritation as &quot;inappropriate juxtapositions&quot; that work together to create a sort of dialog &quot;among normally unrelated voices and contexts, produc[ing] both an irritation whether expressed visually, verbally, or in some hybrid form like a Web page- as well as a social irritation in the audience who registers this friction as a kind of disruption of &quot;normal&quot; discourse&quot; (245). The &quot;irritation&quot; that we experience can offend or enhance our character simply because it's a different outlook on an image that we are normally not accustomed to. 

Unfortunately, with composite images, ethics is always in question. Is it appropriate to remove context from a subject or image and transfer it to another? Is ethics still a problem if the image is overall rhetorical and better for the good of society? Does a composite image have to go along with societal ideals? The answer to all these questions is subjective and ultimately depends on who you ask, but in interpreting composite images, it is always crucial to get “the big picture” and understand both sides of the argument being portrayed. Only then can you make an informed decision about the rhetorical nature and purpose. Essentially, in the search for an even clearer answer to the ethical question, composite image creators should be more aware and sensitive that audiences often view manipulated images with a naive eye and audiences need to educate themselves and question what is being portrayed in a composite image in reference to what is being said, what should be said, and what they believe is right.

==Shocking Advertisements==

[[Image:Racist.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|Image:http://www.cad-comic.com/news.php?i=1153]]Juxtaposition and irritation can be used in order to advertise products.  This idea is called “shock advertising”.  You maybe be wondering, “Why would anybody use a controversial image in an advertisement?”  The answer is simple- “Any publicity is good publicity.”
	Two companies’ that are well known for their shock advertisement strategies are United Colors of Benetton and Calvin Klein.  Calvin Klein received a great deal of attention when they used an underage Brooke Shields in their advertisements very provocatively.  This controversy led to a great deal of free press covering the story.
	However, it is not only the free press that encourages companies to use shock advertisements.  This also markets their goods and services to a younger more “socially conscious” age group.  This type of shock advertisement makes the company seem edgy or youthful.  Peter Fressola, communications director for United Colors of Benetton, defended a Diesel Jeans advertisement, which depicted a gun pointed at the audience, by saying “Jeans are about sex and danger.  And the people who are offended by these ads are probably not Diesel customers anyway.”
	However, it is not just clothing companies that have been known to use shock advertisement.  Barnardo’s, a London based charity, helps many different poverty stricken families all across Great Britain, is also known for having very controversial ads.  In the year 2000, they had an ad that depicted and infant baby about to inject heroin.  They also ran and ad campaign, which staged five death and suicide scenes.  One of the passages read, “From age three, Jane was neglected and a large part of her died.  Her future died.  19 years later, after being lured into prostitution, she was beaten so badly by her Pimp she died for real.  What a waste.”  Barnardo’s was asked to remove the campaign due to criticism.  However, donations increased by 5 percent to the charity.  As much as these images may illicit a negative emotional response, they will not be forgotten.

==Editorial Cartoons: Pictures With a Point==

An editorial cartoon, commonly referred to as a political cartoon, is an illustration or comic strip containing a political or social message that usually relates to current events or personalities [http://www.wikipedia.com Wikipedia]. Cartoonists most often rely on symbolism, exaggeration, labeling, analogy, and irony to demonstrate the point they are trying to make. More often than not there is controversy surrounding an editorial cartoon because of the subject matter. The purpose of an editorial cartoon is to make a point and to make people think. Although editorial cartoons are often funny if you understand the underlying issue, their main purpose is to persuade the audience. Editorial cartoons thrive off of controversy and offensive material because it creates debate and discussion of the issue presented. It is important to keep in mind that a cartoon does not always portray the actual opinion of the publication, but is a reflection of the cartoonists’ interpretation of the surrounding world.

Editorial cartoons are communicative because the cartoonist uses visual symbols for the purpose of communicating to an audience. Foss defines three characteristics that define artifacts or products conceptualized as visual rhetoric. An artifact must be symbolic, involve human intervention, and be presented to an audience for the purpose of communicating (Foss, p. 304). Editorial cartoons meet the stated criteria because of the symbolism the cartoonists use to portray particular events, people, places, governments, religions, ideas, etc. The cartoons are created in response to recent events and are made with the purpose of making a point to an audience. The cartoonist consciously decides to communicate about a certain topic and conveys a message through the conscious decisions to utilize certain color, forms, and symbols. Editorial cartoons use images and drawings to express a complex message in a simplified form.

A more recent editorial cartoon that has caused a lot of controversy is the series of images representing the Prophet Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September 2005. An editor, Flemming Rose, asked newspaper cartoonists to draw the prophet Mohammed as they saw him. A few days later, twelve different cartoonists submitted their depictions and were published in the paper. The images initiated controversy immediately because of the sensitive and sacred subject being presented in an insensitive and offensive manner. Soon to follow the publication of the cartoons were the burnings of the Danish flag, protests and boycotts of Danish products, and violence. The cartoons became famous around the world because of the amount of controversy they had stirred up. Some newspapers reprinted the images while others chose to describe the cartoons through words. The New York Times and many other U.S. newspapers chose not to reprint the images, “saying they were motivated either by respect for or fear of those who might be offended” (Cannon).

There is a fine line between the freedom of expression and respecting the people, events, or issues depicted in the cartoons. Although the purpose of editorial cartoons is to make a point, strike up conversation and make the readers think, cartoonists should choose the messages they want to convey with care. It is ok for cartoonists to express a sensitive message but it should be executed in a fashion that won’t lead to violence. It is impossible to draw something that is completely void of controversy because somebody will always find something offensive. Editorial cartoons are not the news and do not have to be fair and unbiased, however, the cartoonists have a responsibility to create their cartoons with care. Cartoonists should not aim to generate tensions which could lead to violence, but should present their cartoon in a tasteful manner.

On the other side of the paper, the readers of the cartoon need to be responsible in viewing and analyzing the image. It is important for readers to keep in mind that the point of the editorial cartoon is to make people think. Sometimes the images or content may be offensive, but the cartoonist is not drawing an image to target anyone or group in particular, rather to express a message that is relevant to events and situations. Readers must remain critical viewers of these images.

==Emotional Response==

People are constantly being tested by outside stimuli such as the media and are faced with images and advertisements that can sometimes be shockingly controversial. In some cases, such controversial ads do not feature the product, but rather an idea.  United Colors of Benetton, a clothing company discussed earlier in the chapter, is known for their emotionally stirring advertisements.  During the peak years of their controversial campaigns, many of their advertisements have been a topic of discussion.  A popular technique for the United Colors of Benetton is to take a unique but daring approach in their advertisements by featuring sensitive issues rather than people wearing their product. One year, an advertisement ran with a picture of a dying AIDS patient branded with the company’s logo.  [[Image:Aids.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|United Colors of Benetton AIDS Campaign|Image:http://press.benettongroup.com/ben_en/about/campaigns/list/]] Companies taking the shock approach in their advertisements do so in order to ultimately drive up product sales. Companies know that controversy receives much publicity and thus creates attention. How does the shock approach in advertising and images correlate to a customer making a purchase? These images and advertisements are created by companies to spark debate and discussion among buyers in the hopes that the emotional response the advertisement provoked was strong enough for people to make a purchase.
People are naturally inclined to pass judgment but are often psychologically influenced by the complexities of emotions. Each individual has differing sets of emotions which stem from his or her life events and experiences. Because such a range of emotions can exist, it allows room for differing interpretation.  With this in mind, it is difficult to create any broad assumptions when it comes to how one should view a shocking, irritating or controversial image.  But there are certain factors, both internal and external, that should be taken into account when understanding ones emotions towards these visuals.
People are also influenced by their environment. It might be easy to say that consumers are able to perceive an object or person without interference from the perception of the physical and social surroundings of that object or person; however this is not always the case. People bring their personality to the things they do in their daily lives which involve other people whether it be through work, school, nightlife, or church.  Past experiences shape an individual’s personality which can further influence and be influenced by one’s environment.
Lastly, people are influenced by their social centers. Social groups have a huge impact on how images and advertisements are perceived. A common interest is usually the core of what brings a social group together. However, differing opinions may arise which can change people’s opinions and beliefs. It isn’t just the image or advertisement that is being interpreted, it is the brand. The opinions that come from social circles can impact how one is influenced into purchasing behavior.

We have discussed many mediums where controversial images may appear.  However, this list is far from comprehensive.  Controversial Images can appear in a wide variety of public and private spheres.  As an informed consumer of the above mentioned mediums, you are responsible for the ethical standards you hold for the visuals you view.  As said before, the amount and severity of controversial images in the public sphere has continued to increase, and in turn the ethical standards of said images has been slowly decreasing, and the proverbial ethical bar is following.  For the time being, no public policy change will occur regarding this issue.   Informed consumers must act as the vigilante.

      <comment>/* Defining an entry point */ Fixed class name typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Creating a Notepad application =
You wouldn't be able to learn Java wholly if you don't practice working on sample programs. Throughout these tutorials we will help you grasp the true workability with Java projects. The first tutorial in the series is that of creating a simple Windows based application that resembles a notepad.

__TOC__

== Coding the basics ==
=== Setting the class structure ===
To start programming on our example, we need to write down a &lt;CODE&gt;class&lt;/CODE&gt; that
will encapsulate our Notepad application. We begin with a simple class structure that
is empty in the beginning and will be filled appropriately afterward.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Notepad
{
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Defining an entry point ===
: ''For an in-depth study into the structure of entry points, read the section on [[Java Programming/Understanding a Java Program#The_main.28.29_method|The Entry Point]].''
Because we need our class to be executed, we need an entry point to help it execute
while it is stand-alone. To do so, we define a &lt;CODE&gt;main(...)&lt;/CODE&gt; method that
would take care of the execution code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Notepad
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Laying the base for a main frame ===
The next step is to lay the foundation for a frame on which the Notepad application
needs to be executed. For this, we import three generic packages namely
&lt;CODE&gt;java.awt.*&lt;/CODE&gt;, &lt;CODE&gt;java.awt.event.*&lt;/CODE&gt; and
&lt;CODE&gt;javax.swing.*&lt;/CODE&gt;. Now, because we have &lt;CODE&gt;javax.swing.*&lt;/CODE&gt; package
imported in our code, we can safely extend our &lt;CODE&gt;Notepad&lt;/CODE&gt; class with
the &lt;CODE&gt;JFrame&lt;/CODE&gt; class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.awt.*;                     // AWT Components
import java.awt.event.*;               // AWT Events
import javax.swing.*;                  // Swing Components
public class Notepad extends JFrame
{
    public Notepad()
    {
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Using the properties of the frame ===
Using the &lt;CODE&gt;super()&lt;/CODE&gt; method, we try calling the super-class' constructor
to access other properties and methods declared in the super-class. The constructor
call that we made is an explicit call, that is, we specifically called for it. But,
even if we hadn't called the &lt;CODE&gt;super()&lt;/CODE&gt; method, it would implicitly (or
automatically) be called.

In the code below, we try to access the methods inherited into the Notepad class in
two different ways. Notice the &lt;CODE&gt;this&lt;/CODE&gt; variable. The &lt;CODE&gt;this&lt;/CODE&gt;
variable, as you might have had studied, helps to call the variables that are a
part of the class the variable is called within. The &lt;CODE&gt;this&lt;/CODE&gt; variable
used in this example is used to access the &lt;CODE&gt;setSize(...)&lt;/CODE&gt; and the
&lt;CODE&gt;setDefaultCloseOperation(...)&lt;/CODE&gt; methods whilst within the class.

These two methods help in setting the size of the form and then introducing a 
&lt;CODE&gt;DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE&lt;/CODE&gt; event that would dispose or destroy the frame object
once the particular form is closed either by clicking the ''Close'' button or by
pressing ''Alt+F4''.

Whilst in the &lt;CODE&gt;main(...)&lt;/CODE&gt; method, we initialize and instantiate the
Notepad object. Now because we have a Notepad object named &lt;CODE&gt;notepad&lt;/CODE&gt;
with us, we can access public methods from its reference. We use the same
object to call the &lt;CODE&gt;setVisible(...)&lt;/CODE&gt; method. This would be the second
way that we can use to access an object's methods and properties.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.awt.*;                        // AWT Components
import java.awt.event.*;                  // AWT Events
import javax.swing.*;                     // Swing Components
public class Notepad extends JFrame
{
    public Notepad()
    {
        super();
        this.setSize(300, 300);           // Set the frame size
        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(    // Automatically disposes the
          JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);       // frame when it closes
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Notepad notepad = new Notepad();  // Initialize and instantiate
                                          // a Notepad object
        notepad.setVisible(true);         // Displaying the form
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The code above is enough to display a blank frame that is of 300 pixel width and
300 pixel height aligned at the top-left corner of the desktop screen. Try closing
the frame to check if the &lt;CODE&gt;DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE&lt;/CODE&gt; code works. It should work!
Then for a test, try taking out the &lt;CODE&gt;setDefaultCloseOperation(...)&lt;/CODE&gt;
method or just comment it to see what happens otherwise.

I am currently a sophmore at [[Central Catholic High School]], and I plan to get an art or English major in college. I am mainly interested in history (specifically [[WWI]], and Church history), art, literature, and ecology (specifically of the United State's Southwest and [[Texas]]). I hope I can contirbute to Wikibooks in a positive way.

Favorite Books: [[Bleak House]] - [[Charles Dickens]], and The [[Old Kingdom Series]] - [[Garth Nix]]

Currently Reading: [[Mother of Kings]] - [[Poul Anderson]]

If you want to debate on various topics I hope you will post on my talk page.

“Some people fear that technology will become more engaging than live human interactions. That's silly; technology is already way more interesting than other people.” –Scott Adams</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Fluorita green.jpeg|thumb|right|Green fluorite with prominent cleavage.]]

'''Cleavage''' is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite planes, creating smooth surfaces, of which there are several named types:

*Basal cleavage: cleavage parallel to the base of a crystal, or to the plane of the lateral axes.  This occurs quite easily in graphite, making the material feel slippery.

*Cubic cleavage: cleavage parallel to the faces of a cube.  This is the source of the cubic shape seen in crystals of ground table salt.

*Diagonal cleavage: cleavage parallel to a diagonal plane.

*Lateral cleavage: cleavage parallel to the lateral planes.

*Octahedral, Dodecahedral, or Rhombohedral cleavage: cleavage parallel to the faces of an octahedron, dodecahedron, or rhombohedron (respectively).  Octahedral cleavage is seen in common semiconductors used in electronics.

*Prismatic cleavage, cleavage parallel to a vertical prism.

Cleavage is of technical importance in the electronics industry and in the cutting of gemstones.  While precious stones are generally cleaved by impact, man-made single crystals of semiconductor materials are generally sold as thin wafers which are much easier to cleave.  Simply pressing a silicon wafer against a soft surface and scratching its edge with a diamond scribe is usually enough to cause cleavage.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page, and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:52, 27 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Onion rings''' are a type of fast food commonly found in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], and other places.

The rings are made from slices of onion, coated with [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]], breadcrumbs, flour, or other cooking substance and deep-fried until golden-brown and served as an [[Cookbook:Appetizers|appetizer]].  Here is one recipe:

==Ingredients==
*5 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|white onions]], sliced
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], beaten
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
*2 cups powdered [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] mix
*[[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] sprigs, for [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]

==Procedure==
#Separate the sliced onions into rings.
#Combine milk, eggs and salt to taste in mixing bowl.
#Soak onion rings in mixture 30 minutes.
#Place pancake mix in shallow bowl.
#Remove onion rings from milk mixture then dip in pancake mix.
#[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep-fry]] rings in 375°F (190°C) oil until golden brown.
#Drain fried onion rings on paper towels.
*To create an onion loaf, continue with the following steps:
#Pack fried onion rings loosely, without pressing, into 8&quot; X 4&quot; [[Cookbook:Loaf Pan|loaf pan]].
#Bake in a 400°F (200°C) oven for 10-15 minutes.
#Turn onto serving plate and garnish with parsley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Luster''' is a description of the way light interacts with the surface of a crystal, rock, or mineral. For example, a diamond is said to have an ''adamantine'' luster and pyrite is said to have a ''metallic'' luster.

Other descriptive terms used for gems include ''vitreous'', like glass; ''resinous'', like amber; ''waxy'', like jade; ''greasy'', like soapstone; ''pearly''; and ''silky''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''streak''' (also called '''powder color''') of a mineral is the color of the powder produced when it is dragged across an unweathered surface. Unlike the apparent color of a mineral, which for most minerals can vary considerably, the trail of finely ground powder generally has a more consistent characteristic color, and is thus an important diagnostic tool in mineral identification. If no streak seems to be made, the mineral's streak is said to be white or colorless. Streak is particularly important as a diagnostic for opaque and colored materials. It is less useful for silicates, most of which have a white streak and are too hard to powder easily.

The apparent color can vary widely because of trace impurities or a disturbed macroscopic crystal structure. Small amounts of an impurity that strongly absorbs a particular wavelength can radically change the wavelengths of light that are reflected by the specimen, and thus change the apparent color. However, when the specimen is dragged to produce a streak, it is broken into randomly oriented microscopic crystals, and small impurities do not greatly affect the absorption of light. 

The surface across which the mineral is dragged is called a &quot;streak plate,&quot; and is generally made of unglazed porcelain tile. In the absence of a streak plate, the underside of a porcelain bowl or vase, the surface of an electrical fuse, or the back of a glazed tile will work. Sometimes a streak is more easily or accurately described by comparing it with the &quot;streak&quot; made by another streak plate.

Because the trail left behind results from the mineral being crushed into powder, a streak can only be made of minerals softer than the streak plate, around 7 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. In this case, the color of the powder can be determined by filing or crushing with a hammer a small sample, which is then usually rubbed on a streak plate. Most minerals that are harder have an unhelpful white streak.

Some minerals leave a streak similar to their natural color, such as cinnabar and azurite. Other minerals leave surprising colors, such as fluorite, which always has a white streak, although it can appear in purple, blue, yellow, or green crystals. Hematite, which is black in appearance, leaves a red streak which accounts for its name, which comes from the Greek word &quot;haima,&quot; meaning &quot;blood.&quot; Galena, which can be similar in appearance to hematite, is easily distinguished by its gray streak.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an overview of the complex topic of video standards, with emphasis on the topics needed to understand the video editing, transcoding, and authoring process. [http://Wikipedia.org Wikipedia] has much more reference material, as do other online and printed works.

==Analog Broadcast==

===NTSC===

The [[w:NTSC|NTSC]] [[w:Analog_signal|analog]] [[w:Broadcasting|broadcast]] standard is used in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and some other countries. NTSC stands for &quot;National Television Standards Committee.&quot; It is sometimes also humorously referred to as &quot;Never Twice the Same Color,&quot; due to the difficulties that the system sometimes presents in reproducing color accurately.

NTSC content consists of [[w:Video_frame|frames]] broadcast at 29.97 (actually 30/1.001) per second. The rate at which an NTSC [[w:Television|television]] is scanned from top to bottom, however, is double that, 59.94 [[w:Field_(video)|fields]] per second. Each field consists of half of the lines from a frame — the first field carrying the even numbered lines, and the second carrying the odd numbered lines. This alternation of even and odd lines is called [[w:Interlace|interlacing]]. The refresh rate of roughly 60 frames per second was chosen so that the human eye would not perceive [[w:Flicker_(screen)|flicker]] while watching a broadcast. The decision to use interlaced rather than [[w:Progressive_scan|progressive]] (non-interlaced) scan was based on practical concerns, the most important of which is that interlacing allows broadcasts using about half the [[w:Bandwidth|bandwidth]] of progressive scan, with an apparent [[w:Display_resolution|resolution]] that is often similar to that of a progressive scan broadcast. This allowed more efficient use of the television [[w:Broadcast_spectrum|broadcast spectrum]], and to some extent simplified the construction of televisions themselves.

Interlacing is still present in many broadcasts. For all practical purposes, all NTSC content is interlaced and broadcast at 29.97 frames per second. Some digital broadcast formats are also interlaced. In video processing, interlacing is at best a nuisance, and at worst a source of difficult problems.

NTSC has a nominal content of 486 vertical lines. There is no standard for horizontal resolution. Most televisions [[w:Overscan|overscan]] and will not display the entire broadcast frame. In the days when most recording equipment and televisions were analog, the horizontal resolution of a television signal could vary greatly depending on the source. An analog [[w:VHS|VHS]] cassette is capable of only 240 lines of horizontal resolution, which is similar to broadcast NTSC. [[w:S-VHS|S-VHS]] and [[w:LaserDisc|LaserDisc]] are capable of 400 lines, although all things considered equal, LaserDisc generally produces a better picture than S-VHS. [[w:DVD|DVDs]] support a number of resolutions, but the most common (and highest) is 720 horizontal pixels by 480 vertical pixels. Many older televisions are incapable of displaying images that sharp; newer ones fare better.

Today, NTSC content is typically digitally captured and played back at a resolution of 720 horizontal pixels by 480 vertical pixels, at a rate of 59.94 fields per second. As mentioned above, there are other resolutions that are supported by various digital standards.

===PAL===

[[w:PAL|PAL]] (&quot;Phase Alternating Line&quot;) is an analog television broadcast standard used in most of Europe and much of the rest of the world. France and large portions of the former Soviet Union (and other countries here and there) are exceptions; they use a system called [[w:SECAM|SECAM]]. We will consider PAL and SECAM to be identical for the purposes of this discussion, because even though the underlying principles of the two systems are different, they have attained interoperability in Europe due to the predominance of multi-format equipment. PAL and SECAM have similar resolutions; if the analog differences are ignored, they can be treated almost the same.

For purposes of digital video, PAL is similar to NTSC. It is an interlaced standard just like NTSC, although the odd field is transmitted first (the opposite of NTSC). The main differences between the two are in resolution and frame rate. PAL has a greater vertical resolution of 576 lines (of a total of 625 actual broadcast lines, the difference carrying no picture). PAL has a frame rate of 25 frames per second, and consequently 50 fields per second. It is typically digitized at a resolution of 720 x 576 pixels.

The difference between NTSC and PAL frame rates makes the conversion of NTSC to PAL material and vice versa tricky. This is discussed elsewhere in this book.

==Digital Transport (Digital Broadcast)==

Most digital broadcasts — over-the-air (OTA), cable, satellite, and so on — use some variant of the [[w:MPEG-2|MPEG-2]] standard. When MPEG-2 content is broadcast, it is called a [[w:MPEG transport stream|transport stream]]. In theory, this stream can be captured and used directly as source material, although some form of [[w:Transcode|transcoding]] or [[w:Muxing#Digital_broadcasting|remuxing]] may be required. However, some broadcast streams are [[w:Encryption|encrypted]] and can't be played back until they are decrypted.

Content recorded on a semi-permanent medium like videotape could informally be considered a transport stream, although the term technically applies only to MPEG. The most common format for tape-recorded video is [[w:DV|DV]] (and variants thereof), a format popularized by Sony (because of its association with the [[w:Firewire|Firewire]] standard), but now used by most digital camcorders. DV is a primary source of material for editing and transcoding. DV is lossy, but only slightly so, and is readily encoded and decoded. DV can also be sent directly from a camera rather than being recorded.

Because newer encoding schemes like MPEG-4 provide much better compression than MPEG-2, some satellite broadcasters ([[w:DirecTV|DirecTV]] for example) are delivering new high-definition channels as MPEG-4 streams. This trend will continue, because the demand for high-definition content is great, while satellite bandwidth is limited.

==Program (DVD, et cetera)==

Much of the available digitally recorded material exists on DVDs, which are encoded using MPEG-2. When MPEG video is recorded on a permanent medium, it is called a [[w:Program_stream|Program stream]]. Program streams have the same overall structure as transport streams, but are designed with random access, among other things, in mind. Program streams may be encoded more efficiently than transport streams. Live video, when transmitted in a compressed digital stream, has to be encoded &quot;on the fly&quot; using specialized hardware. Program streams, on the other hand, can be encoded offline at whatever speed suits the application.

Other MPEG-related formats, including [[w:MPEG-4|MPEG-4]], can also be considered program streams. Newer formats like MPEG-4 provide better compression than MPEG-2, although encoding is more computationally expensive. Successor formats to the DVD all use MPEG-4 or a similar codec.

In general, the object of editing, transcoding, and authoring — the topic of this book — is to produce a program stream suitable for writing to a permanent medium like a DVD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a glossary covering terms commonly encountered when dealing with the subject of this book. More detail can be found in the book, Wikipedia, and in other sources.

==Glossary==

*'''Deinterlacing''' — the process of converting interlaced video into a progressive equivalent. Deinterlacing takes two forms: the conversion of video that was created in interlaced form from interlaced to progressive (e.g., true interlaced video as created by a video camera), and inverse telecine, which is the recovery of the original progressive film frames from interlaced telecine video. Inverse telecine is a relatively simple process. Deinterlacing true interlaced video is inexact and difficult.

*'''(Video) Field''' — a division of a frame obtained by sampling only a portion of the scan lines in that frame. Where fields are used in modern video, they are obtained by sampling every other line from a frame; thus two fields, one containing the even scan lines and the other the odd, make up a frame of video. The fields are said to be &quot;interlaced&quot; and are transmitted consecutively.

*'''(Video) Frame''' — the basic unit of video transmission, a single complete image. A frame may be composed of multiple interlaced fields, or may be a single progressive unit. A frame is made up of a stack of horizontal scan lines; this is a product of the scan line-oriented nature of analog video. In digital video, there is less of a distinction between horizontal and vertical rows of pixels.

*'''Frame Rate''', '''frames per second''', '''fps''' — the rate at which frames occur in a video stream. Some common frame rates are 29.97 fps (NTSC),  24 fps (film), 23.976 fps (film playback rate for NTSC), and 25 fps (PAL).

*'''Hard Telecine''' — recorded interlaced material derived from film so that the telecine interlacing is built into the signal. An NTSC hard telecine recording has interlaced frames at 29.97 fps. This is different than what normally occurs with film sources on DVDs, where the content is stored as a 23.976 fps progressive stream that is then converted (by a 3:2 pulldown converter in the DVD player) to an interlaced stream at 29.97 fps for viewing.

*'''Interlacing''', '''interlaced scan''' — made up of a sequence of fields that in turn make up a sequence of frames. NTSC is interlaced; an NTSC frame consists of an even field (the even numbered scan lines from the frame) followed by an odd field (the odd numbered scan lines).

*'''Inverse telecine''', '''IVTC''' — the process of converting telecined video back into its film equivalent. Generally, this involves deinterlacing as well as a change in frame rate. It is a (somewhat) straightforward process.

*'''Progressive''', '''progressive scan''' — made up of a sequence of progressively-scanned (i.e., non-interlaced) frames. A progressive scan frame is an entire frame; it is called progressive because the frame appears in the video stream in its entirety one line at a time from top to bottom.

*'''3:2 Pulldown''' — a process used to convert 24 fps film source into 29.97 fps interlaced NTSC video. Because four 24 fps film frames will fit evenly (practically speaking) in the space of five 29.97 fps NTSC frames, four film frames are fit into five video frames by interlacing two of the four film frames so that three of the video frames are a mixture of two of the film frames; the other two film frames appear intact. This produces a relatively smooth conversion.

*'''Pullup''' - synonym for '''inverse telecine'''.

*'''Scan line''' — a horizontal line in a video frame or field. Analog television physically draws video images from the top to the bottom of the television screen, one horizontal line at a time. Digital monitors work, at least conceptually, the same way. NTSC video has approximately 480 visible scan lines; PAL has 576.

*'''Telecine''' — the process of converting film shot at 24 frames per second into video at either 29.97 fps (NTSC) or 25 fps (PAL).

[[Image:Zonescale.png|thumb|Temperature scale of hardiness zones, showing the average annual minimum temperature boundaries for the zones]]
A '''hardiness zone''' is a geographically-defined zone in which a specific category of plant life is capable of growing, as defined by temperature hardiness, or ability to withstand the minimum temperatures of the zone. The zones were first developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and have subsequently been adopted elsewhere. They are categorized according to the mean of the lowest temperature recorded each winter, termed the &quot;average annual minimum temperature&quot;. Thus if five successive winters reach respective minima of −14 °C, −12 °C, −8 °C, −16 °C, and −13 °C, the mean coldest temperature is −12.6 °C, placing the site in zone 7.

==Benefits and criticisms==
The hardiness zones are effective in that, for many situations, extremes of winter cold are a major determining factor in whether a plant species can be cultivated outdoors at a particular location. However, it does have a number of drawbacks, most significantly in not incorporating summer heat levels into the zone determination. Thus sites which may have the same mean winter minima, but markedly different summer temperatures, will still be accorded the same hardiness zone. An extreme example is the Shetland Islands and southern Alabama, which are both on the boundary of zones 8 and 9 and share the same winter minima, but very little else in their climates; in summer, the continental climate of Alabama is about 20 degrees Celsius hotter than the oceanic climate of Shetland, and there are very few plants that can be grown at both locations. Due to its maritime climate, the UK is in AHS Heat Zone 2 (having 1 to 8 days hotter than 30 degrees Celsius), whereas Alabama is in Zones 7 to 9 (61 to 150 days hotter than 30 degrees Celsius).

Another problem is that the hardiness zones do not take into account the reliability of the snow cover. Snow acts like an insulator against extreme cold temperatures, protecting the root system of hibernating plants. If the snow cover is reliable (then present during the coldest days), the actual temperature to which the roots are exposed is not as low as the hardiness zone number would indicate. As an example, Quebec City in Canada is located in zone 4 but can rely on an important snow cover every year, making it possible to cultivate plants normally rated for zones 5 or 6, whereas in Montreal, located in zone 5, it is sometimes difficult to cultivate plants adapted to the zone because of the unreliable snow cover.

Low temperature is not the only determinant of plant survival - other factors such as high summer temperature, humidity, soil temperature, etc. may be equally important. Also, many plants will survive in a locality but won't flower if the day length is inappropriate or if they require vernalisation (a particular duration of low temperature). The low temperature statistic is only appropriate for woody perennial species, and even then its use is limited. With annuals the time of planting can often be adjusted to allow growth beyond their normal geographical range.

The main factors determining average minimum temperature are altitude, latitude and proximity to the coast.

* Zone 1 covers the alpine areas of south eastern Australia. 
* Zone 2 the tablelands of south east Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and the uplands of central Tasmania. 
* Zone 3 includes much of the southern half of the continent, except for near the coast. 
* Zone 4, because of the warmer seaboard, covers a broad area from coastal Queensland across to Shark Bay and Geraldton in the west, and includes the Mornington Peninsula, areas adjacent to Spencer Gulf and Adelaide, the south western coastal zone, Sydney and the north coast of NSW, along with a number of localities dotted all around the southern coast of the continent. 
* Zone 5 covers, some of the Queensland coast, Western Australia north of Shark Bay and across the top end. 
* Zone 6 includes the Queensland coast north of Cairns, Cape York Peninsula and the coast of the Northern Territory. 
* Zone 7 is mainly restricted to islands off the north coast.

There are problems with maps of this type: the spread of weather stations is insufficient to give clear zones and too many places with different climates are lumped together. Only 738 Australian stations have records of more than ten years (one station per 98,491 hectares!), though more populated areas have relatively fewer hectares per station. Local factors such as aspect, altitude, proximity to the sea also complicate the matter. For example, Mt Isa has three climatic stations with more than a ten year record. One is in Zone 4a, one in Zone 4b and the other is in Zone 5a. Likewise Sydney residents can choose between Zones 3a to 4b. Most other cities have similar problems. Different locations in the same city are suitable for different plants making it hard to draw a meaningful map. There may even be a case for publishing a list of weather stations and their zone Classification to allow best use of local conditions.

The map is thus only useful as a broad guide. It needs interpretation that takes into account factors other than low temperature, as well as local knowledge. 

An alternative system for describing plant hardiness is to use indicator plants (the USDA also publishes a list of these to go with their map). Common plants with known limits to their range are used. For example, many people will know whether lemons will grow in their locality. If you then say Geraldton Wax will grow more or less where lemons will grow you have defined the range of Geraldton Wax with some accuracy (whether or not it will flower is another problem). Unfortunately no two plant species have exactly the same requirements and there are even within-species differences. 'Meyer' lemons, for example, are more cold tolerant than 'Eureka'. You can really only define core areas and they are often fairly arbitrary.

==North American hardiness zones==
[[Image:USDA Hardiness zone map.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of the North American hardiness zones.  An interactive version of this map is available at http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html]] 
In North America hardiness zones map was revised and published by the USDA in 1990 and can be used as a guideline for categorizing locations suitable for growing a particular annual plant variety.

The temperatures are based on the lowest temperatures recorded for each of the years 1974 to 1986 in the United States and Canada and 1971 to 1984 in Mexico. The map shows 10 different zones, each of which represents an area of winter hardiness for the plants of agriculture and our natural landscape. A draft of the latest version also introduces zone 11 to represent areas that have average annual minimum temperatures above 40°F (4.4°C) and that are therefore essentially frost free.

==United Kingdom and Ireland Hardiness Zones==
[[Image:UK zonemap.png|thumb|UK hardiness zones]]
Due to the moderating effect of the Gulf Stream on the Irish and UK's temperate maritime climate, the UK, and Ireland even more so, have rather milder winters than their northerly position suggests.
This means that the hardiness zones relevant to the UK are quite high, from 7 to 10, as shown below.
*7. In Scotland the Grampians, Highlands and locally in the Southern Uplands and in England the Pennines.
*8. Most of England, Wales and Scotland, and parts of central Ireland.
*9. Most of western and southern England and Wales, western Scotland, also a very narrow coastal fringe on the east coast of Scotland and northeast England (within 5 km of the North Sea), London, and most of Ireland.
*10. Very low lying coastal areas of the southwest of Ireland, and the Isles of Scilly.

==Asia-Pacific Hardiness Zones==
The Australia Continent, though surrounded by ocean, is drier than Europe or North America.  Australia numbers its climate zones differently, but this system can be translated into the North American systems with minimal effort. 
Plant hardiness refers to survivability of the conditions of a particular location, including heat tolerance, soil moisture, humidity and so on. This map is based only on how well they survive low winter temperatures; a gross oversimplification. For example, are plants affected more by a single extremely low temperature night, or is the number of days of frost (the duration of winter) more important? In fact both are important, but the statistic for the map only relates directly to the former. Moreover, plants will survive in an area for some time, but a rare catastrophic cold snap will kill them. Some risk evaluation - the probability of getting a particularly severe low temperature - often would be more useful rather than just the average conditions.

==Updates==
In 2003, a preliminary draft of a new map was produced by the American Horticultural Society (AHS), compiled by Meteorological Evaluation Services Co., Inc. of Amityville, NY, using temperature data collected from July 1986 to March 2002. This was a period of unusually warm winters, especially in the eastern U.S.A., and thus the 2003 map places many areas a zone higher (warmer) than the 1990 map. The draft map also shows finer detail, for example reflecting urban heat islands by showing the downtown areas of several cities (e.g., Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, DC) as a full zone warmer than outlying areas. The 2003 draft map has been widely criticized and its current status is uncertain; as of April 2006 the AHS website still presents the 1990 map as the current one.

In addition, the National Arbor Day Foundation has recently completed an extensive updating of U.S. Hardiness Zones in 2004.  The new 2004 Arborday.org Hardiness Zones map is based on the most recent 15 year’s data available from more than 5,000 National Climatic Data Center cooperative stations across the United States. 

Once the Foundation analyzed the new data, hardiness zones were revised, generally reflecting warmer recent temperatures in many parts of the country. The Arbor Day Foundation used the updated versions of the same sources of data as had been utilized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the creation of its hardiness zone maps.  The 2004 map appears to validate the data used in the 2003 draft completed by the AHS. http://www.arborday.org/media/zones.cfm

'''''Alchemilla mollis''''', '''Lady's Mantle''', is an herbaceous perennial plant native to Southern Europe, but grown throughout the world as an ornamental garden plant. The plant is primarily grown as a [[../Ground Covers|ground cover]], and is especially valued for the leaves in wet weather, as the water beads up and sparkles on the leaves.

==Description==
The leaves are palmately veined, with a scalloped and serrated margin. The flowers are held in dense clusters above the foliage and are greenish yellow.

==Growing conditions==
Rich, well-drained soils in ful sun to very light shade. 

==Varieties==
Some cultivars have been selected.

==Uses==
The plant has been used for centuries as a herbal remedy.  Since it contains tannin, Lady's Mantle has properties of an astringent.  It is also used by some as a gynecological treatment to suppress menstruation and reduce vagina irritation.  No scientific studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of Alchemilla mollis as an herbal treatment.

==Maintenance==
Prune off browned foliage in early spring. Deadhead to prevent seeding and encourage rebloom.

==Propagation==
Division or seed, self-seeds readily.

==Pests and diseases==
See ''[[../Alchemilla/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases.

I think we badly need a section about verb conjugation.  Later we could have one about imperative, then one about tenses, one about making nouns from verbs and vica versa and then one about conditional. Has anyone a different priority/vision? 

P.S.: Of course not all of these should come into this lesson :)
--[[User:Sourcerror|Sourcerror]] 13:33, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

There's a mistake at the conjugation of the verb &quot;enni&quot;. Because it's &quot;-ikes&quot; verb, it's indefinite version is the same to the definite in 1st person singular (instead of ''eszek'' it should be ''eszem''). Drkazmer
:As as native Hungarian I beg to differ. The correct ways is this: [[http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikes_ragoz%C3%A1s]] --[[User:Zslevi|Zslevi]] ([[User talk:Zslevi|talk]]) 15:32, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

== Conjugation ==
''Eszik'' is probably not the best example if you want to show basic conjugation, because ''eszik'' is an &quot;ikes ige&quot;. Maybe ''olvas'' would be a better option, for example, since it has definite and indefinite forms as well, and I think that is a classic example. ''Eszik'' should be treated as an &quot;ikes ige&quot;, maybe in a different section. Also, some may consider ''eszek egy joghurtot'' very, or at least a bit uneducated, depending on the person. - [[User:Vargamate|Vargamate]] ([[User talk:Vargamate|talk]]) 18:47, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

== Conjugation order ==

As pointed out above, the ''eszek'' form is actually incorrect. I also agree that conjugation should be introduced systematically. A good idea would be to first introduce the regular verbs (''énekelni'', ''élni'', ''tudni'', ''ülni'') followed by the special cases of verbs that end in '''-ít''' or double consonants (''tanítani'', ''érteni'', ''tartani''), and then the '''-ik''' verbs. I would do this all in the indefinite forms first. One of the reasons is that intransitive verbs can't take a direct object, and they use the indefinite conjugation. This way simple sentences can be introduced without having to understand the accusative case. In order to use transitive verbs (in either definite or indefinite mode) the accusative case must be introduced first(in Hungarian the '''-t''' ending). This is especially tricky for English speakers as they do not normally have to indicate direct objects in a sentence so they are not familiar with the accusative case. 

I would recommend after describing the indefinite conjugation of all types of verbs, to introduce the accusative case, followed by the definite conjugation forms. In doing so, the other important consideration is to show pragmatically when a direct object is definite or when it's indefinite. There are specific rules for this that the students can easily learn (applying it is another matter and takes lots of practice...)</text>

==Thanks==
Hi, I just wanted to thank you for contributing to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Division/Cetaceans|Cetaceans]] honor.  You added a lot of useful content!  I did take out the size comparison text though because I think it would be better to add a graphic for that rather than trying to represent the differences with text (is that what you were trying to do?)  If you have any questions about the answer book project or Wikibooks in general, don't hesitate to ask!  You can drop me a note on [[User_talk:Jomegat|my talk page]] or just respond on this page.  Thanks again! -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 14:00, 27 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''''Euphorbia lathyris''''' (Caper Spurge, Gopher Spurge, Gopher Plant or Mole Plant) is a weedy plant native to Southern Europe (France, Italy, Greece) and as far east as China, but has naturalized in many other regions. that is often used as an ornamental plant and also to protect a garden from gophers.

All parts of the plant, including the seeds and roots are poisonous. Handling may may cause skin irritation as the plant produces latex. While poisonous to humans and most livestock, goats seem to enjoy eating it and are immune to the toxin. However, the toxin can be passed through the goat's milk.

==Description==
Caper spurge can grow up to 48 inches (1.2 m) tall. The seeds of this plant grow in green clusters of three seeds. When they ripen, they dry out and turn brown.

==Growing Conditions==
It lives in partial shade to full sun in USDA zones 5–9.

==Uses==
Some people have had great success planting caper spurges as repellants for gophers and voles, while others found that gophers will eat other plants only a few feet away while completely ignoring the spurges. 

==Maintenance==
Self-seeds freely, but easily pulled. 

==Pests and Diseases==
See ''[[../Euphorbia/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is sometimes difficult to understand where your Xslt logic has gone wrong when you can't actually get a big picture view of the Xml structure that is being sent to your XSLT file. This Xslt macro will provide a tabular printout of the entire XML tree as seen by $currentPage. This macro will output the entire Xml tree of your website so be careful when you use this. I found this macro to be of great help trying to get started with XSLT processing in Umbraco.

==Your edits==
Please do not change font like in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Knowledge_Management_Cases_in_Asia&amp;curid=117802&amp;diff=845934&amp;oldid=845914 this edit]. We should not use HTML on Wikibooks because it makes texts harder to read and correct for people who don't know HTML. Furthermore, you are removing headings (headings are marked with == signs). That's bad because they disappear from page table of contents. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:20, 27 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Page naming==
Please not that Wikibooks is not Wikipedia and there cannot be single, separate articles like [[Embed FlashPlayer with Swf file specified by Media Id]]. Every page has to belong to a book. See [[Umbraco/Samples and Articles/XSLT]]: links before your edits have slash / at the beginning, which results in creating a subpage, not standalone page.

If you have any doubts, read [[WB:NP]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:24, 27 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Analog Standard Definition Capture==
This section describes ways to capture standard definition video from an analog source. This includes [[w:Component_video|component]] and [[w:S-Video|S-Video]] connections, and also television tuners.

===Using a DVD or DVD-RAM Recorder===
One straightforward and reliable way to capture video is via a consumer DVD or DVD-RAM recorder. 
DVD recorders are inexpensive (US$200 or less) and easy to use. Connect the recorder to your signal (composite video, S-Video, or TV input), and record onto blank media. When you are done, you have DVD media with your content on it in MPEG-2 format.

Perhaps the most significant advantage of using a DVD recorder is that the files you obtain will likely have perfect A/V sync. Also, in some cases, if your desired output is an MPEG-2 stream, you can obtain satisfactory results by editing the output of the recorder and authoring with that, without ever transcoding.

Another advantage is that the MPEG-2 video from the recorder does not take a large amount of space. High-quality MPEG-2 encoded video is 1/5 or 1/10 the size of [[w:HuffYUV|HuffYUV]] encoded video. A couple of hours of source material will fit in 5-10GB rather than 50GB.

The MPEG-2 stream on the recorded media will be interlaced. If the source material was a telecined film, the recording will be a hard telecine; it will not be inverse telecined into a progressive source by the recorder. This may be perfectly acceptable to a viewer; after all, it is exactly what a viewer sees when a film is played over a standard television.

In cases where you want to do filtering or extensive editing, or change the format of the video (including inverse telecine), transcoding will be required. There is a potential loss in quality as a result, because the video will pass through a lossy MPEG-2 encoding/decoding phase.

: ''Signal'' → &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;''MPEG-2 encoding (DVD-R)'' → ''MPEG-2 decoding (computer)''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;→ ''Editing (computer)'' → ''MPEG-2 encoding (computer)'' → ''Result''

Depending on the signal and the eventual use of the result, the loss in quality due to an additional transcoding step may or may not be significant. Clean analog signals tend to look best (e.g. a LaserDisc). Signals that have already been through one transcoding phase (e.g. the composite output from a digital satellite tuner) generally look worse. DVD recorders allow a variety of quality settings, up to an 8000+ kilobit/s high quality mode that records one hour of video on a single 4.7 GB DVD. However, because DVD recorders encode MPEG in real time, the encoding is not as good as a careful 2-pass encoding at the same bit rate done off-line on a computer.

Certain types of filters, applied judiciously during transcoding, can improve the results slightly. Some video noise removal (both static and temporal), deblocking, and/or &quot;smart&quot; sharpening can be particularly helpful.

If you have a DVD recorder, it is worthwhile to give it a try. The ease of use and the reliable A/V sync may outweigh the disadvantages of the MPEG-2 encoding of the output.

===Using a Format Converter===

A format converter is a device that converts video signals of one type to another in real time. Typically this includes analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) conversion. These are generally professional-level devices that are moderately priced. An example is the Datavideo DAC-15, which at a 2007 price of US$750 can convert between the following standard definition signals:

*Composite video
*Component video (Y, R-Y, B-Y)
*Y/C (S-Video)
*Unbalanced stereo audio
*DV (IEEE-1394 aka FireWire)

This can allow transcoding of an analog signal to DV for direct capture by a computer. This is generally superior to direct capture of an analog signal by computer, because less CPU power is required, and A/V sync is likely to be good.

Some digital camcorders that accept analog inputs can effectively function as real time format converters. However, consumer-level camcorders do not accept component video input.

High definition format converters are also available, but are expensive. See below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}


==Epidemiology==
*10-15% of all soft tissue sarcomas
*Median age at diagnosis is 6th decade (but wide range)
*Most patients present with vague abdominal complaints
*Tumors typically reach large size, with median diameter ~15 cm

==Anatomy==
*70% occur in abdomen, 30% occur in pelvis
*5% likelihood of regional nodal involvement


'''''Retroperitoneal space'''''
*Potential space posterior to the abdomino-pelvic cavity
**Superior border: diaphragm
**Lateral borders: historically at lateral edge of quadratus lumborum, but lateral edge of 12th rib may be considered, since it corresponds to the origin of the transversus abdominus aponeurosis
**Anterior border: parietal peritoneum
**Posterior border: psoas, quadratus lumborum muscles in abdomen, iliacus and obturator internus and pyriformis in pelvis
**Inferior border: pelvic diaphragm
*Composed predominately of lymphatics and loose connective tissue
*Retroperitoneal organs: pancreas, kidney, adrenal glands, ureters

==Histology==
*Most common pathologies for retroperitoneal sarcoma are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.
*Most common pathology in children is rhabdomyosarcoma.
*Tumor grade prognostic for development of distant mets, local recurrence, and decreased time to recurrence.

==Staging==
*T1 - less than or equal to 5cm (T1a superficial, T1b deep);
*T2 - greater than 5 cm (T2a superficial, T2b deep);
Retroperitoneal location is always deep
*N1 - regional lymph node metastasis;
*M1 - distant metastasis

''AJCC 2002 Staging System''
*Stage I - All low grade, N0, M0
*Stage II - T1a/b-T2a, N0, high grade
*Stage III - T2b, N0, high grade
*Stage IV - N1 or M1, any grade

''Dutch/Memorial Sloan Kettering Classification System''
*Stage I - low grade, complete resection, no mets
*Stage II - high grade, complete resection, no mets
*Stage III - any grade, incomplete resection, no mets
*Stage IV - distant mets

==Treatment==
*Tumor grade is associated with recurrent and metastatic disease; most series using RT are in intermediate and high grade sarcoma
*Complete resection is considered the standard treatment (typically ''en bloc'' resection of tumor + involved organs)
*Radical lymphadenectomy generally indicated only if gross nodal involvement
*However, &lt;70% amenable to complete surgical resection. Positive surgical margins are associated with high local recurrence
*Furthermore, ~50% of patients with GTR (R0 or R1) experience a recurrence, and overall local recurrence rates may be as high as 95% with sufficient follow-up
*Locally recurrent disease is associated with lower likelihood of complete resection, and worse survival
*Since most recurrences are local, there is an increasing interest in the role of RT, partly based on randomized data from extremity and trunk sarcoma and partly based on retrospective institutional series. Surgery alone probably results in 5-year LC &lt;50% while addition of RT &gt;50%
*Pre-op RT has been proposed as superior to post-op RT due to good tumor volume definition, displacement of normal viscera by tumor, smaller treatment fields, and potential radiobiologic advantage of having normal vasculature/oxygenation in place
*ACOSOG has an ongoing randomized trial exploring the benefit of pre-op RT
*Several institutional reports shows improved outcomes for pre-op RT compared with historical controls. Typical dose has been 45-50 Gy, and &gt;50% of patients required intraop or post-op RT boost. But despite aggressive multimodality therapy, local recurrences continue to be a problem, and overall survival is poor compared with extremity/trunk STS
*For postop RT, evidence is weaker. Based on MD Anderson data (2007), dose should be &lt;60 Gy
*However, a multi-disciplinary discussion is warranted for most cases as surgical considerations and availability of intra-op RT etc. play a large role in determining whether pre-op or post-op RT is preferred. Pre-op RT has the benefits of potentially reducing bowel toxicity or improving surgical margin status. On the other hand, post-op fields may be preferred for wound healing concerns, confirmation of pathology, acute symptoms, and normal structures can at times be moved/shielded during surgery in anticipation of RT. 


===Preoperative Radiation===
*'''ACOSOG Z9031''' &quot;A randomized trial of preoperative radiation plus surgery versus surgery alone for localized primary retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;
**Goal: accrue 370 pts in 4.5 yrs, primary outcome PFS at 5 yrs, closed in 2006. Awaiting results (as of 4/2010)


*'''MD Anderson; 2007''' PMID 17084545 -- &quot;Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma: an analysis of radiation and surgical treatment.&quot; (Ballo MT, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Jan 1;67(1):158-63. Epub 2006 Nov 2.)
**Retrospective. 83 patients (60 primary, 23 recurrent). Resection R0 in 47%. RT given in 98% (EBRT alone 76%, EBRT + IORT 22%; preop EBRT 60% median dose 50 Gy, postop EBRT median dose 55 Gy; median IORT dose 15 Gy). Median F/U 3.9 years
**Outcome: Local recurrence 60%; DSS 44%
**Subgroup: 5-year DSS: Low grade 92% vs intermediate grade 51% vs. high grade 41%. 5-year LC: SM- 62% vs SM+ 33%; primary 58% vs. recurrent 27%. No RT variables (higher dose or IORT) associated with outcome
**Toxicity: 10% (moderate/severe 8%). Post-op RT 23% vs pre-op RT 0%. Median EBRT dose with complications 60 Gy

*'''Toronto Sarcoma Group/MD Anderson; 2006''' (1996-2002) PMID 16491338 -- &quot;Long-term results of two prospective trials of preoperative external beam radiotherapy for localized intermediate- or high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma.&quot; (Pawlik TM, Ann Surg Oncol. 2006 Apr;13(4):508-17. Epub 2006 Feb 24.)
**Two prosepctive trials. 72 patients, intermediate or high grade retroperitoneal sarcoma. 75% primary, 25% recurrent.  Median tumor size 15 cm. Preop RT (median dose 45 Gy). All patients at MD Anderson received concurrent low dose doxorubicin. 89% underwent laparotomy with curative intent 4-8 weeks after RT. Intraop or postop RT boost 60%. Median F/U 3.4 years
**Outcome: GTR 95% (R0 or R1). If GTR, 52% recurrence rate. 5-year LRFS 60%, DFS 46%, OS 61%
**Conclusion: Outcomes compare favorably with historical data for patients treated 

*'''MD Anderson; 2003''' PMID 12915599 -- &quot;Phase I trial of preoperative concurrent doxorubicin and radiation therapy, surgical resection, and intraoperative electron-beam radiation therapy for patients with localized retroperitoneal sarcoma.&quot; (Pisters PW, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Aug 15;21(16):3092-7.)
**Phase I. 35 patients, potentially resectable, intermediate or high grade retroperitoneal sarcoma. Doxorubicin QW with concurrent RT. Dose escalation 18/10, 30.6/17, 36/20, 41.4/23, 46.8/26, 50.4/28. Then intra-op RT 15 Gy if R0 or R1 resection
**Outcome: Total laparotomy in 83%. GTR (R0 or R1) in 90%
**Toxicity: Chemo-RT completed as outpatient in 89%, at 50.4 dose level 18% Grade 3-4 nausea.
**Outcome: Preop EBRT can be administered to 50.4 Gy with C.I. doxorubicin

**Local control improved w/ IORT (83% vs 61%).

*'''NCI''' -- Intraop RT + postop RT vs. Postop RT alone
**Randomized. 35 patients, surgically resected retroperitoneal sarcoma. Arm 1) IORT 20 Gy + Post op EBRT 35-40 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post op EBRT 50-55 Gy. Chemotherapy doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, MTX. 
**'''1993''' PMID 8457152 -- &quot;Intraoperative radiotherapy in retroperitoneal sarcomas. Final results of a prospective, randomized, clinical trial.&quot; (Sindelar WF, Arch Surg. 1993 Apr;128(4):402-10.) Minimum F/U 5 years
***Outcome: Median OS IORT 3.7 years vs PORT 4.3 years (NS). Local failure IORT 40% vs. PORT 80%
***Complications: radiation enteritis IORT 13% vs. PORT 50%, peripheral neuropathy 60% vs. 5%
***Conclusion: No survival benefit, improved local control with IORT

===Adjuvant Radiation===
*'''University of Florida; 2005''' (1974-2003) PMID 15923806 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for resectable retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma: the University of Florida experience.&quot; (Zlotecki RA, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;28(3):310-6.)
**Retrospective. 50 patients treated with surgery + RT (pre-op 38%, post-op 62%). Pre-op 50.4/42 BID @ 1.2 Gy/fx; post-op RT &lt;50 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fx
**Outcome: 5-year OS SM- 69% vs. SM+ 12% (SS); low grade 77% vs. high grade 34% (SS). Local recurrent pre-op 16% vs. post-op 47% (NS)
**Toxicity: Post-op RT more frequent complications, though none severe
**Conclusion: RT appears to improve probability of local control. Pre-op Rt may be preferred 

*'''French Federation Cancer Sarcoma Group; 2001''' (1980-1994) PMID 11466691 &quot;Prognostic factors in retroperitoneal sarcoma: a multivariate analysis of a series of 165 patients of the French Cancer Center Federation Sarcoma Group.&quot; (Stoeckle E, Cancer, 2001; 92(2): 359-68.)
**Retrospective. 145 patients, localized non-metastatic retroperitoneal sarcoma. Median size 15 cm. Liposarcoma/LMS/MFS in 66%. Intermediate/high grade 84%. GTR 65%, post-op RT 41% (50 Gy median dose). Median F/U 3.9 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS 46%. LRC RT 55% vs surgery alone 23% 
**Conclusion: Randomized trial needed to evaluate place of RT for local control

**60 pts, non-metastatic retroperitoneal sarcoma; all tx'd w/ combined surgery + xrt.  Xrt was either given w/ EBRT alone (median 52.2 Gy) or EBRT + brachy boost (42 Gy EB + 16 Gy brachy).
**5yr DFS 53%, 10yr DFS 44%.  5yr local control 71%, 10yr 54%.  Margin status significantly correlated w/ local control.
**Conclusion:  margin status and local control very important for RP sarcoma long term outcome.

**Retrospective. 198 patients with RPSTS
**Outcome: Recurrence rate 5% per year. Of patients disease-free at 5 years, 40% recurred by 10 years. RT only predictor for low risk of local recurrence. Age &lt;=50 and high grade predictors for distant mets
**Conclusion: Complete surgical resection necessary; 5-year DFS is not a cure

**Prospective. 18 patients with RPLS. Pre-op IMRT 50/25. CTV limited to posterior abdominal wall only; planning comparison to standard CTV
**Outcome: All successfully completed RT and surgery. 2 local recurrences, 1 within high dose region and one marginal which would not have been well covered by standard CTV either
**Conclusion: Limited CTV to posterior abdominal wall is feasible

**Retrospective. 10 patients with RPS and 1 inguinal sarcoma. Prescription 50.4 Gy. Comparison of 3D-CRT and IMRT
**Outcome: Significantly better dosimetry with IMRT
**Conclusion: IMRT allowed enhanced tumor coverage and better sparing of organs at risk</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before the coming of Spanish colonizers, the people of the Philippine archipelago had already attained a semicommunal and semislave social system in many parts and also a feudal system in certain parts, especially in Mindanao and Sulu, where such a feudal faith as Islam had already taken roots. The Aetas had the lowest form of social organization, which was primitive communal.

==The Society==
The ''barangay'' was the typical community in the whole archipelago. It was the basic political and economic unit independent of similar others. Each embraced a few hundreds of people and a small territory. Each was headed by a chieftain called the ''rajah'' or ''datu''.

===Social Structure===
The social structure comprised a petty nobility, the ruling class which had started to accumulate land that it owned privately or administered in the name of the clan or community.
*'''Maharlika''': an intermediate class of freemen called the ''Maharlika'' who had enough land for their livelihood or who rendered special service to the rulers and who did not have to work in the fields.
*'''Timawa''': the ruled classes that included the ''timawa'', the serfs who shared the crops with the petty nobility.
*'''Alipin''': and also the slaves and semislaves who worked without having any definite share in the harvest. There were two kinds of slaves then: those who had their own quarters, the ''aliping namamahay'', and those who lived in their master's house, the ''aliping sagigilid''. One acquired the status of a serf or a slave by inheritance, failure to pay debts and tribute, commission of crimes and captivity in wars between barangays.

==Islamic Monarchy==
The Islamic sultanates of Sulu and mainland Mindanao represented a higher stage of political and economic development than the barangay. These had a feudal form of social organization. Each of them encompassed more people and wider territory than the barangay. The sultan reigned supreme over several datus and was conscious of his privilege to rule as a matter of hereditary &quot;divine right.&quot;

Though they presented themselves mainly as administrators of communal lands, apart from being direct owners of certain lands, the sultans, datus and the nobility exacted land rent in the form of religious tribute and lived off the toiling masses. They constituted a landlord class attended by a retinue of religious teachers, scribes and leading warriors.

The sultanates emerged in the two centuries precedent to the coming of Spanish colonialists. They were built up among the so-called third wave of Malay migrants whose rulers either tried to convert to Islam, bought out, enslaved or drove away the original non-Muslim inhabitants of the areas that they chose to settle in. Serfs and slaves alike were used to till the fields and to make more clearings from the forest.

Throughout the archipelago, the scope of barangays could be enlarged either through the expansion of agriculture by the toil of the slaves or serfs, through conquests in war and through interbarangay marriages of the nobility. The confederations of barangays was usually the result of a peace pact, a barter agreement or an alliance to fight common internal and external enemies.

As evident from the forms of social organization already attained, the precolonial inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had an internal basis for further social development. In either barangay or sultanate, there was a certain mode of production which was bound to develop further until it would wear out and be replaced with a new one. There were definite classes whose struggle was bound to bring about social development. As a matter of fact, the class struggle within the barangay was already getting extended into interbarangay wars. The barangay was akin to the Greek city-state in many respects and the sultanate to the feudal commonwealth of other countries.

The people had developed extensive agricultural fields. In the plains or in the mountains, the people had developed irrigation systems. The Ifugao rice terraces were the product of the engineering genius of the people; a marvel of 12,000 miles if strung end-to-end. There were livestock-raising, fishing and brewing of beverages. Also there were mining, the manufacture of metal implements, weapons and ornaments, lumbering, shipbuilding and weaving. The handicrafts were developing fast. Gunpowder had also come into use in warfare. As far north as Manila, when the Spaniards came, there was already a Muslim community which had cannons in its weaponry.

The ruling classes made use of arms to maintain the social system, to assert their independence from other barangays or to repel foreign invaders. Their jurisprudence would still be borne out today by the so-called Code of Kalantiyaw and the Muslim laws. These were touchstones of their culture. There was a written literature which included epics, ballads, riddles and verse-sayings; various forms and instruments of music and dances; and art works that included well-designed bells, drums, gongs, shields, weapons, tools, utensils, boats, combs, smoking pipes, lime tubes and baskets. The people sculpted images from wood, bone, ivory, horn or metals. In areas where anito worship and polytheism prevailed, the images of flora and fauna were imitated, and in the areas where the Muslim faith prevailed, geometric and arabesque designs were made. Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, a record of what the Spanish conquistadores came upon, would later be used by Dr. Jose Rizal as testimony to the achievement of the indios in precolonial times.

There was interisland commerce ranging from Luzon to Mindanao and vice-versa. There were extensive trade relations with neighboring countries like China, Indochina, North Borneo, Indonesia, Malaya, Japan and Thailand. Traders from as far as India and the Middle East vied for commerce with the precolonial inhabitants of the archipelago. As early as the 9th century, Sulu was an important trading emporium where trading ships from Cambodia, China and Indonesia converged. Arab traders brought goods from Sulu to the Chinese mainland through the port of Canton. In the 14th century, a large fleet of 60 vessels from China anchored at Manila Bay, Mindoro and Sulu. Previous to this, Chinese trading junks had been intermittently sailing into various points of the Philippine shoreline. The barter system was employed or gold and metal gongs were used as medium of exchange.

== Introduction ==

; Data : raw facts and figures
; Data Processing : performing operations on the input data to generate output.
; Database : collection of related information about a particular enterprise. 
; Database Management System : collection of interrelated data, set of programs to access the data conveniently and efficiently.

=== File System ===
Typically data is stored in files.

1.) flat files contains one table at a time generally

2.) flat files contains values at each row and separated with a special symbol so to reach the data you have to parse each row and obtaining an array of values and then you can query the data.

3.) to control the data in a file , you have to read it line by line and parse it and  because of it they are slow

4.) there is no control mechanism in files

5.) dbms systems commonly has a special language called sql to modify and reach the data easily

6.) dbms systems has indexes to reach the data, not read it line by line

7.) there are much more control mechanisms that approves the correctness of data

8.) you can reach the data across networks by using a dbms system easily and safely

=== Need for Database Management Systems ===

Data access through file systems suffers from the following problems.
* minimal data redundancy 
* difficulty in accessing data
* inconsistency 
* concurrent access
* data isolation 
* integrity
* atomicity
* security
A good database management system solves all the above mentioned problems which a user generally faces in a file system.

=== Database Users ===
Following are the types of database users:
* Database Administrator(DBA) - a database administrator performs the following activity
** Granting user authority to access the database
** Enforcing security and integrity rules
** Strategizing backup &amp; recovery
** enforcing security and integrity rules
* Application programmers
* Data analysts
* Naive users

=== Enterprise Application Architecture ===
; three tier architecture : Modern enterprise application architecture consists of the following layers
# application client
# application server
# database system

''Present trend in the enterprise architecture is moving towards '''n-tier architecture''' in which each of the above three layers is further distributed among multiple systems or layers''

=== Database Tools ===

* query tools
* administration tools

=== Database Architecture ===

Following are the different database architecture types:
* Centralized
* Client-server
* Parallel (multi-processor)
* Distributed

=== Database abstraction ===
* physical abstraction
* logical abstraction
* view abstraction
To the design of complex data structure for the representation of data in the database. However since database system are often used by non computer professionals, this complexcity must be hidden from database system users. This is done by defining level of abstract as which the database may be viewed, There are logical view or external, conceptual view and internal view or physical view.
&lt;h4&gt; External view &lt;/h4&gt;
This is the highest level of abstraction as seen by a user. This level of abstraction as seen by user. This level of abstraction describe only part of entire database. 
&lt;h4&gt; Conceptual view : &lt;/h4&gt; 
This is the next lower level of abstraction which is the sum total of user's views. This level describe what data are actually stored in the database. This level contain information about entire database in term of small number of relatively simple structure. 
&lt;h4&gt; Internal Level : &lt;/h4&gt;
This is the lowest level of abstraction at which one describe how the data are physically sorted.

=== Database Schema ===
Definition : Overall logical design of data base.
Schema contains 'No of records + Type of data + No of attributes'
* External level or Sub schema

* logical schema
* physical schema

=== Database Instance ===
Definition: The term instance is typically used to describe a complete database environment, including the RDBMS software, table structure, stored procedures and other functionality. It is most commonly used when administrators describe multiple instances of the same database.

Definition: The information stored in database at the particular  movement is called instance.

Also Known As: environment
is the place where the data can be stored in manageable  manner.  
Examples: An organization with an employees database might have three different instances: production (used to contain live data), pre-production (used to test new functionality prior to release into production) and development (used by database developers to create new functionality).

=== Data Model ===
What is data model:it consists of some concepts to describe the structure of database i.e., data type, relations, and constraints that should hold on the data. E.g. ER model
* XML data Model - semi structured
* relational data model
* object oriented 
* object relational
* network
* hierarchy

⋅ Database Languages ===
* procedural - what data is required and how to get this data
* declarative - what data is required without describing how to get this data
* data control language (DCL)
* data manipulation language (DML)
* data definition language (DDL)
* data storage language

== Relational Database ==
A database based on relational algebra or relation model is called relation database

=== Relational data model ===
; relation : a table in a relational database is called relation in the mathematical language of relational algebra. relations are unordered.
; attribute : column of a table in database table is called attributes. columns or attributes have names.
; domain : set of permissible values for an attribute ( or column) is called domain.
; tuple : a row in the database table is called tuple in the mathematical language of relational algebra. order of tuples in a relation has no significance. 
; database : a database is a collection of multiple relations.
; schema : a database design is called schema, alternatively, a schema can refer to [[w:namespace|namespace]] within a database.
; cardinality of a relation : number of tuples in a relation is called cardinality of the relation.

Normalization theory deals with design of relational database schema.

=== Keys ===
; ''key'' : any subset of a relation is called key.
; ''super key'' : a key is called super key if it is sufficient to identify a unique tuple of a relation.
; ''candidate key'' : a minimal super key is called candidate key i.e. no proper subset of a candidate key is super key.
; ''primary key'' : a candidate key chosen as a principal to identify a unique tuple of a relation.It Restrict User Inputs like &quot;Null Values&quot; , &quot;Duplicate Values&quot; etc.
; ''foreign key'' : a key of a relation which is a primary key of some other relation in the relational schema.

== Database Design ==
; entity : nothing but it represents field of the database e.g., 
employee
; entity set : collection of different fields
; relationship : 
; relationship set :
; domain :The set of possible values for an attribute is called the 
domain of the attribute
e.g.:  
The domain of attribute marital status is having four values: single, 
married, divorced or widowed.

The domain of the attribute month is having twelve values ranging from 
January to December.
; Key attribute: The attribute (or combination of attributes) that is 
unique for every entity instance
e.g.: the account number of an account, the employee id of an employee 
etc.
; attribute : e.g., gender
; composite attribute :
; degree of relationship :the number of entity types involved in a 
database
; cardinality of relationship : The minimum and maximum values of this 
connectivity is called the cardinality of the relationship e.g., one to 
one, one to many, many to many
; weak entity :Entity that depends on other entity for its existence and
 doesn’t have key attribute (s) of its own e.g. : spouse of employee

; identifying relationship :
; non-identifying relationship :
; discriminator :

=== ER Diagram ===

'''Modelling concepts'''
* Specialisation
* Generalisation
* Categorisation
* Aggregation

=== Normalization ===
Normalization is the formal process for deciding which attributes should
 be grouped together in a relation.The process of normalization was 
first developed by E.F.CODD.
Normalization is the process of evaluating and correcting the relation 
schemes to minimize data redundancies and thereby reducing anomalies.
==== First Normal Form ====
A relational schema is in first normal form if the domains of all the  
attributes are atomic. First Normal form is characterized by the 
property of '''atomicity'''.
Means &lt;u&gt;'''only one  value for each tuple'''&lt;/u&gt;.

==== Second Normal Form ====  
Second Normal form is characterized by the property of '''functional 
dependency'''.
a relation is in second normal form if it is in 1st normal form and 
every non key attribute is fully and functionally dependent on the 
primary key.

==== Third Normal Form ==== 
transitive dependency :
A relation is in third normal form , if it is  in second normal form and
 no transitive dependencies exist.
Suppose A,B and C are the three attributes of a relation(R) then if
A-&gt;B(B depends on A)
B-&gt;C(C depends on B)
then we can say that &quot;C&quot; depends transitively on &quot;A&quot;.

==== Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF) ====
BCNF is based on functional dependencies that take into account all 
candidate keys in a relation.  For a relation with only one candidate 
key, 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; normal form and BCNF are equivalent.
'''A relation is in BCNF if and only if every determinant is a candidate
 key.
'''''''''
now what is a determinant?
consider the following functional dependency:
A→B
where A and B are attributes in relation R.
it says that B is functionally dependent on A.
here A is referred to as determinant and B is the dependent.

BCNF is slightly stronger than 3nF.

==== Fourth Normal Form ====
; multivalued dependencies are removed :

==== Fifth Normal Form ====
Any remaining anomalies are removed.in this normal form we isolate 
semantically related multiple relationships.

'''Anomalies''' can be :
''Insertion Anomaly'',''Deletion Anomaly'' or ''Modification/update 
Anomaly''.
Any remaining anomalies are removed.in this normal form we isolate 
semantically related multiple relationships.

== Query Languages ==

; query : the retrieval of tuples from the relations of a relational schema
; query language : a language used to retrieve information (tuples) from the relations of a relational schema.

types of query language
* procedural language 
* non-procedural language

'''Mathematical query languages'''
* Relational algebra
* Tuple relational calculus
* Domain relational calculus

=== Relational algebra ===
relational algebra is a procedural query language
** operations
**# selection (r σ s) - 
**# projection (r ∏ s) - 
**# union: (r ∪ s)
**# set difference: (r – s)
**# Cartesian product: (r X s)
**# rename: ( ρr )
**# intersection: 
**# natural join:
**# division:
**# union:
**# intersection:
**# outer join
BY:NA

=== Tuple relational calculus ===
A tuple variable is variable that takes on tuples of a particular relation schema as values. That is, every value assigned to a given tuple variable has the same number and type of fields. A tuple relation calculus query has the form {T I p(t)} where T is a tuple variable and p(T) denotes a formula that describes T; The result of this query is the set of all tuples t for which the formula p(T)evaluates to true with T=t.

=== Domain relational calculus ===

== SQL ==
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a non procedural language.

relational algebra

== XML ==
Extensible Mark-up Language.

XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language
XML is a markup language much like HTML
XML was designed to carry data, not to display data
XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags
XML is designed to be self-descriptive
XML is a W3C Recommendation

[http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp XML]

== Application Design ==
=== JDBC ===
JDBC means Java Database Connectivity.

== Storage Manager ==

Storage manager module of the database provides the interface between the following component: 
* data stored in the database 
* the application programs 
* queries submitted to the system

=== Components of a Storage Manager ===
==== file manager ====
function of the file manager is to manage disk space for storage and manage data structure used for storing information.

==== buffer manager ====
The buffer manager reads disk pages into a main memory page as needed. The collection of main memory pages (called frames) used by the buffer manager for this purpose is called the buffer pool. This is just an array of Page objects. The buffer manager is used by (the code for) access methods, heap files, and relational operators to read / write /allocate / de-allocate pages. The Buffer Manager makes calls to the underlying DB class object, which actually performs these functions on disk pages.

Replacement policies for the buffer manager can be changed easily at compile time.

==== data integrity manager ====
==== transaction manager ====

=== Storage access ===

=== Indexing and hashing ===
Many queries reference only a small proportion of records in a file. For example, finding all records at Perryridge branch only returns records where bname = ``Perryridge''.
We should be able to locate these records directly, rather than having to read every record and check its branch-name. We then need extra file structuring.

=== Parsing and translation === 
=== Optimization ===
=== Evaluation === 
As we know that, computer has two storage memories 
1.primary storage
2.secondary storage

== Query Processing ==

* Query Processor
** Query parsing
** Query optimizer
** Query evaluation engine : It executes low level instructions given by the DML and retrieves the information from the storage manager.

=== Query Optimization ===

== Transaction ==

; transaction : collection logically related operations in a database application. 
; Transaction-management: ensures that the database remains in a consistent (correct) state despite system failures (e.g., power failures and operating system crashes) and transaction failures.
 
* authorization engine

== Concurrency control ==
; Concurrency-control: ensuring the consistency of the database in spite of interaction among the concurrent transactions


== Recovery ==
To restore a physical backup of a data file or control file is to reconstruct it and make it available to the Oracle database server. To recover a restored data file is to update it by applying archived redo logs and online redo logs, that is, records of changes made to the database after the backup was taken. If you use RMAN, then you can also recover data files with incremental backups, which are backups of a data file that contain only blocks that changed after a previous incremental backup.

== Object Relational Database Management System ==

== Distributed Database Management System ==

== Data Mining and Analysis ==
Data mining is searching information which is already stored in such a database.

== Parallel Databases ==

1 Do bhrígh gur ghabhadar mórán do láimh sdair do sgríobhadh air na neithibh agá bhfuil a sáirfhios aguinne,
2 Do réir mar thugadar na dáoine do chonnairc lé na súilibh rein ó thús, agus do bhí ag miniosdrálachd na bréithre, dhúinne íad;
3 Do chonncas damhsa mar an gceudna, a Theophilus ro oirdheirc, ar bhfagháil feasa iomlan gach uile neithe ó na bhfíorthosach dhamh, a sgríobhadh chugadsa a nórdughadh,
4 Do chum go mbía deimhin na mbriathar, do múineadh dhuit agad
5 Re linn Iorúaith, rí thire Iúdaighe, do bhí sagart airighe dár bhainm Sacharías, do sheal Abía: agus a bhean dingheanuibh Aaróin, agus, Elísabet do baimn dhi.
6 Agus do bhádar a ráon nit ndáoinibh fíreanta a bhfíadhnuisi Dé,ag siobhal go neimhchiontach ann uile aitheantuibh agus órduighthibh an Tighearna.
7 Agus ní raíbh, shiochd orrtha, do bhrígh go raibh Elisábet aimrid agus go raibh áois mhór aca ar áon.
8 Agus tárla, an tan do bhí sé ag déanamh oifige an tsagairt a bhfiadhnuisi Déann a sheal fein,
9 Do réir ghnáthuighthe oifige an tsagairt, go ráinic dhó an túis do losgadh tar éis dul a sdeach go teampoll an Tighearna dhó.
10 Agus do bhí coimhthionól an phubail uile ag déanamh úrnuighe a muigh a naimsir na túise.
11 Agus do taidhbhreadh dhó aingeal an Tighearna na sheasamh ar an dtáoibh ndeas daltóir na túise.
12 Agus ar na fhaicsin do Shacharías, do bhí sé ar na bhúaidhreadh, agus do ghlac eagla é.
13 Achd a dubhairt an taingeal ris, Ná bíodh eagla ort, a Shacharías: óir do héisdeadh húrnuighe; agus béaruidh do bhean Elisábet mac dhuit, agus do bhéara tú Eóin mar ainm air.
14 Agus budh gáirdeachus agus lúathgháire dhuit é; agus biaidh lúathghaire ar mhóran fa na bhreith.
15 Oir bíaidh sé na dhuine mhór a bhfíadhnuisi an Tighearna, agus ni íobha sé fíon na deoch láidir; agus fós bíaidh sé lan don Spiorad Náomh, ó bhroinn a mháthar.
16 Agus fillfidh sé mórán do chlannuibh Israél chum an Tighearna a Ndia féin.
17 Oir géubhaidh seisean roimhesan a spioraid agus a shubháilce Elias, dfilleadh chroidheadh na naithreach chum na cloinne, agus na neasmhal chum gliocuis na dáoine gcomhthrom; agus dullmhughadh phobuil dhiongmhálta don Tighearna.
18 ¶ Agus a dubhairt Sacharías ris an aingeal, Cionnas bhías a fhios so agamsa? óir a táim um dhuine arsuidh, agus a tá áois mhór ag am mhnáoi.
19 Agus ar bhfreagra don aingeal a dubhairt sé ris, Is misi Gabríel, sheasas a bhfíadhnuisi Dé; agus do cuireadh mé do labhairt riotsa, agus dinnsin na núaidheachd maith so dhuit.
20 Agus, féuch, bíaidh tú gan úrlabhra, agus ní bá héidir leachd labhairt, go soithe an lá an a dtiocfaid na neithe so chum críche, do bhrígh nar chréid tu dom bhríathraibhsi, noch coimhlíonfuighear na nam féin.
21 Agus do bhí an pobal ag fuireach ré Sacharías, agus do biongnadh léo an fad do fhan sé sa teampoll.
22 Agus ar ndul a mach dhó, nír bhéidir leis labhairt ríu: agus do aithnigheadar go bhfacaidh sé taidhbhsi sa teampoll: óir do sméid sé orrtha, agus do fhan sé balbh.
23 Agus tárla dhó, an tan do coimhlionadh laéthe a mhiniosdrálachda, go ndeachaidh sé dhá thigh féin.
24 ¶ Agus tar éis na laethesi, do toirrcheadh Elisabet a bheansân, agus do fholaigh si í féin ar feadh chuig mios, ag rádh,
25 Oír is mar so do rinne an Tighearna rium ann sna laethibh an ar fhéuch sé oram, do thógbháil mo neimhcheana dhiom a measg na ndáoine.
26 ¶ Agus an sa seisiodh mi, do cuireadh an taingeall Gabríel ó Dhía go cathruigh don Ghalilé, dár bainm Násaret,
27 Dionnsuighe óighe ar a raibh ceart ag fear do thigh Dháibhí, dár aínm Ióseph; agus do bé do bainm do nóigh, Muire.
28 Agus ar ndul a sdeach dit hionnsuighe do naingeal, a dubhairt se, Dia do bheatha a ógh roghrásamhuil: a tá an Tighearna maille riot: is beannuighe thú eidir na mnáibh.
29 Agus an tan do chonnairc sí é, do bhí sí ar na búaidhreadh fá na bhriathraibh, agus do bhí sí ag smúaineadh créd an ghné bheannughtheaso.
30 Agus a dubhairt an taineal ria, Ná bíodh eagla ort, a Mhuire: óir fúair tú grása ó Dhía.
31 Agus, féuch, bíaidh tú torrach ad bhruinn, agus béaraidh tú mac, agus do bhéara tú IOSA dainm air.
32 Bíaidh se mór, agus goirfidhear Mac an té is Airde dhe: agus do bhéura an Tighearna Día caithír Dháibhí, athar féin dhó.
33 Agus bíaidh sé na righ ar thigh Iácob go bráth; agus ní bhía deireadh ar a ríoghachd.
34 Agus a dubhairt Muire ris a naingeal, Cionnas bhías so, óir ní bhfuil fios fir agamsa?
35 Agus ar bhfreagra do naingeal a dubhairt se ría, Tuirléonguidh an Spiorad Náomh ort, agus foiléochaidh cumhachda an té as Airde thú: uime sin an ní náomhtha bhéaras tú goirfighear Mac Dé dhe.
36 Agus, féuch, Elisabet do shiur, a tá sisi leis torrach air mhac ann a hárrsuigheachd: agus is sé so an seisiodh mí don mhnáoi úd, dá ngoirthear bean aimrid.
37 Oír ní bhía ní ar bith doidhéunta do Dhia.
38 Agus a dubhairt Muire, Féuch, banóglach an Tighearna; teagmhadh dhamhsa do réir do bhréithrisi. Agus do imthigh an taingeal úaithe.
39 ¶ Agus an tan do éirigh Muire ann sna laéthibh sin, do chúaidh sí go dheíthneasach chois sléibhe, go cathraigh Iúda;
40 Agus do chúaidh sí a steach go tigh Shacharías, agus do bheannaigh si Délisabet.
41 Agus tarla, mar do chúalaidh Elisabet beannughadh Mhuire, gur bhíog an náoidheanán ann a broinn; agus do bhí Elisábet air na líonadh don Spiorad Naomh.
42 Agus do éigh sí do ghuth mhór, agus a dubhairt si, Is beannaighthe thú eidir na mnáibh, agus is beannaighthe toradh do bhronn,
43 Agus cionnus do éirigh so dhamsa, go dtiocfadh matháir mo Thighearna féin chugam?
44 Oir, féueh, comhlúath is tháinic fúaim do bheannaighthe am chlúasaibh, do bhíog an náoidheanán lé gáirdeachus ann mo bhroinn.
45 Agus is beannaighthe au bhean do chreid: óir coimhlionfuidhear na neithe do gheall an Tighearna dhi.
46 ¶ Agus a dubhairt Muire, Adhmolaidh manam an Tighearna,
47 Agus do ní mo spiorad gáirdeachus a Ndía mó Shlánuightheóir.
48 Do bhrígh gur fhéuch sé ar úmhla a bhanóglaighe féin: oír, féuch, ó so súas goirfid na huile chine beannuighthe dhíom.
49 Oir do rinne an té a tá cumhachdach neithe móra dhamhsa, agos is náomhtha a ainm.
50 Agus a tá a thrócaire ó dhíne go díne don dréim ar a bhfuil a eagla.
51 Do rinne sé gníomh láidir lé na láimh; do spréigh sé na dáoine úraibhreacha a smúaintighe a gcroidheadh féin.
52 Do tharruing sé na dáoine cumhachdacha as a gcaithiribh, agus do árduigh sé na dáoine umhla.
53 Do líon sé na dáoine ocracha lé, neithibh maithe; agus do chuir sé úadh na dáoine saidhbhre folumh.
54 Do thóg sé súas Israél a shearbhfhoghantuidhe féin, do chuimhniughadh ar a thrócaire;
55 (Mar do labhair sé ré ar naith-reachuibh, Abraham, agus ré na shíol go bráth.)
56 Agus do fhan Muire na fochair timcheall thrí míos, agus do fhill sí dhá tigh féin.
57 ¶ Agus táinic ionbhuidh Elisabet ion ar mhídhid dhigh breath; agus rug sí mac.
58 Agus do chúaladar a comharsain agus a dáoine gáoil, gur fhoillsigh an Tigh earna a thrócaire mhór féin di; agus do rinneadar gáirdeachus má ráon ria.
59 Agus tárrla, go dtangadar air a nochdmhadh lá do chum go ndéanaídís an náoidhe do thimcheallghearrádh; agus do ghoireadar Sacharias de, do reir anma a athair.
60 Achd ar bhfreagra dhá mháthair a dubhairt sí, Ni hámhluidh bhías; achd Eóin goirfidhear dhe.
61 Agus a dubhradar ría, Ní bhfuil éannduine dod chineadh dá ngoirthear an tainmsi.
62 Agus do rinneadar comhartha dhá athair, créd an tainm bá mían leis do thabhairt air.
63 Agus ar níarruidh cláir sgriobhtha dhosan, do sgríobh sé, ag rádh, Is Eóin is ainm dhó. Agus do ghabh iongantus íad uile.
64 Agus ar an mball do hosgladh a bhéulsan, agus a theanga, agus do labhair sé, ag moladb Dé.
65 Agus do ghabh eagla a gcomharsuin uile: agus do haithriseadh na neithe so uile chois tsléibhe thíre Iúdaighe uile.
66 Agus gach uile dhuine dhá gcúalaidh sin, do chuireadar a dtaisgidh an a gcroidh thibh féin iad, ag rádh, Créd é an sórt leinibh bhias so! Agus do bhí lámh an Tighearna maille ris.
67 Agus do bhí Sacharías athair, lán don Spíorad Náomh, agus do rinne sé faidheadóireachd ag rádh,
68 Go madh beannaighe au Tighearna Día Israel; ar son gur fhiosruigh sé agus gur fhúasgail sé a phobal féin,
69 Augs do thóg sé súas adharc na sláinte dhúinne a dtigh Dháibhi a shearbh fhoghantuidhe féin;
70 Do réir mar do labhair sé tré bhéul a fháidheadh náomhtha féin, do bhí ann ó thús an domáin:
71 Ga gcuimhdéochadh sé sinn ó ar naimhdibh, agus ó láimh gach uile dhuine agá bhfuil fúath dhuinn;
72 Go ndéanadh sé trócaire air ar naith reachuibh, agus go gcuimbnéochadh sé a thiomna náomhtha féin;­
73 Agus ar an mionna lé a dtug sé móid Dábrahám ar nathairne, go dtiubhradh sé dhúinn,
74 Go mbémís gan eagla air ar sáoradh ó láimh ar námhad do chum seirbhisi do déanamh dhó féin,
75 A náomhthachd agus a bhfíréantacld na fhíadhnuisiséan, a laéthibh ar mbeatha uile.
76 Agus tusa, a leinibh, goirfithear diot faídh an té as Airde: óir rachuidh tú roimh aghaidh an Thighearna dullmhughadh a shligheadh;

1 Agus tárla ann sna láethibh sin, go ndeachuidh áithne ó Shéasar Augustus, an domhan uile do mheas,

3 Agus do chúadar eile dhá meas, gach áon fá leith dhá chathruigh féin,
4 Agus do chúaidh Ióseph mar an gcéudna súas ón Ghalilé, as an gcathraigh Nasarét, go tír Iúdaighe, go cathruigh Dhaibhi, dá ngoirthear Bétleem; do bhrígh go raibh sé do thigh agus do shliochd Dháibhí:
5 Ionnus go measfuigh é maille ré Muire do bhi ar na ceangal ris mar mhnáoi, ar mbeith dhi torrach.
6 ¶ Agns tárla, ar mbeith dhóibh ann sin, go dtangadar laéthe a hionbhuidhsean.
7 Agus rug sí mac a céudduine cloinne, agus do chuir sí giobuil cheangail na thimcheall, agus do chuir sí na luighe a mainséur é; do bhrígh nach raibh ait aca sa tigh ósda.

15 ¶ Agus tárla, mar do imthigheadar na haingil úatha ar neamh, go ndubhradar na háodhairidhe ré chéile, Imthigheam anois don Bhetléem, agus féucham an ní so do rinneadh, noch do fhoillsigh an Tighearna dhúinn.
16 Agus tangadar go deithneasach, agus fuaradar Muire agus Ióseph, agus an náoidhe na luighe a mainnséur.
17 Agus an tráth do chonncadar sin, do aithriseadar an ní a dubhradh riú a dtimcheall an leinibhsin.
18 Agus na huile dháoine da gcúalidh so do ghabh iongantus íad fá na neitheibh a dubhradar na háodhairidhe ríu.
19 Achd do thaisgidh Muire na bríath rasa uile, dá mbreathnughadh ann a croidhe.
20 Agus do fhilleadar na háodhairidhe, ag tabhairt glóire agus ag moladh Dé tré gach ní da gcúaladar agus da bhfacadar, mar a dubhradh riú.
21 ¶ Agus an tan do coimhlíonadh ochd lá chum an leinibh do thimcheallgherradh, tugadh' IOSA mar ainm air, éadhon an tainm do ghoir an taingeal de suil do gheineadh a mbroinn é.
22 ¶ Agus an tan do coimhlíonadh laéthe glanta Mhuire do réir reachda Mháoisi, rugadar léo go Hiarusaléim é, da thaisbéanadh don Tighearna;
23 (Mar a tá scriobhtha a reachd an Tighearna, Gach céudghein mhic thuismeas brú bíaidh sé náomhtha don Tighearna;)
24 Agus do thabhairt ofrála, do réir mar a dearthar a reachd an Tighearna, Cúpla turtair, nó dha gheirrceach coluim.
25 ¶ Agus, féuch, do bhí duine a Níarusaléim, dár bhainm Símeon; agus do bhí an fearso comhthrom diadha, agus a shúil ré comhfhurtachd Israel: agus do bhí an Spíorad Náomh ann,

27 Agus táinic sé maille ré tréoir na Spioraide don teampoll: agus an tan thug a athair agus a mháthair an leanabh Iósa, do chum go ndéanaídis ar a shon do réir gnáthuighthe an dlighe,
28 Ann sin do ghabh seision chuige ann a uchd é, agus do mhol sé Día, agus a dubhairt sé,

31 Noch do ullmhuigh tú a bhfíadhnuisi na nuile phobal.
32 Solus do dhéunadh soillsi do na Cineadhachuibh, agus glóir do phobail féin Israél.
33 Agus do ghabh iongantus Ióseph agus a mháthairsion fá na neithibh a dubhhradh na thimcheall.
34 Agus do bheannuigh Símeon íad, agus a dubhairt sé ré Muire a mhathairsion, Féuch, a tá sé so ar na órdughadh do chum tuitme agus eiséirghe mhóráin a Nisraél; agus na chomhartha agá gcuirfithear na aghaidh;
35 (Agus fós, rachaidh cloidh éamh tré thanamsa mar an gcéudna,) do chum go nochdfuidhe smúaintighthe as mórán do chroidhibh.
36 ¶ Agus fós do bhí Anna, banfháidh, inghean Phánuel, do threibh Aser: do bhi aois mhór aiceso, tár éis seachd mblíadhna do chaitheamh dhi ag fear a ndiáigh a maighdeannis;

38 Agus táinic so do láthair ar an úair gcéudna agus dadmhuigh sí na thimcheall ré gach áon agá raibh súil ré fúasgladh an Iarusaléim.
39 ¶ Agus mar do chríochnuigheadar gach uile ni do réir reachda an Thighearna, do fhilleadar don Ghalilé, da gcathruigh féin Násarét.
40 Agus do fhás an macaomh, agus do neartuigheadh é a spioraid, agus do bhí sé lán deagna: agus do bhí grása Dé maille ris.
41 ¶ Agus do ghnáthuigheagh a athair agus a mháthair dul gach a blíadhna go Híarusaléim a sollamuin na cásg.
42 Agus ar mbeith dhá bhliadhan déug dho, do chuadar suas go Híarusaléim, do réir ghnáthuighthe na sollamna.
43 Agus are geríochnughadh na, láetheadh sin, an tan do fhilleadarsan, dfan anleanabh Iósa a Níarusaléim; gan fhios do Ióseph ná dhá mháthair.
44 Agus, an tan do shaóileadar go raibh sé na gcuideachda, do shiobhladar asdar laoi; agus diarradar é a measg a ndaoine gaoil agus aitheanta.
45 Agus an tan nach bhfúaradar é, do fhilleadar arís go Híarusaléim, dhá iarruigh.
46 Agus tárla, trí lá dá éis sin, go bhfúaradar é ann sa teampoll, na shuidhe a measg na ndoctúireadh, ag éisdeachd ríú, agus ag cur cheasd ortha.
47 Agus do ghabh iongnadh gach uile dhuine dá gcúalaidh é fá na thuigsin agus fá na fhreagarthaibh.
48 Agus ar na fhaicsin dóibh, do ghabh úathbhás iad: agus a dubhairt a mháthair ris, A mhic, créd fá ndearna tú mar so rinn? Féuch, do bhí misi agus dathair lán do dhobhron dod lordaireachd.

50 Achd níor thuigeadarsan na briathra do labhair se ríu.
51 ¶ Agus do chuáidh sé léo síos, agus táinic sé go Násaret, agus do bhí sé umhal dóibh: agus do thaisgidh a mháthair na briathra so uile an a croidhe.
52 Agus dó bhí Iósa ag fás an eagna, agus a naóis, agus a ngean ag Día agus ag daóinibh.

3 Uime sin tháinic sé ar feadh na dúithche a dtimcheall Iórdan, ag seanmóir bhaisdigh na haithrighe chuin maithmbeachuis na bpeacadh;
4 Mar a tá sgríobhtha a leabhar comhráidhteagh Esaías fáidh, a deir, Guth an té éighmheas ar an bhfásadh, Ullmhuighidh slighe an Tighearna, déanuidh a chasáin díreach.
5 Líonfuidhear gach uile ghleann, agus ísleochthar gach uile sliabh agus chnoc; agus béid na neithe cama díreach, agus na slighthe garba mín;
6 Agus do chífi gach uile fheoil slanughadh Dé.
7 Uime sin a dubhairt sé rís a tslúagh tháinic a mach do chum go mbaisdfeadh seisean íad: A shliochd na naithreach neimhe, cía thug rabhadh dhaóibh teitheadh ón fheirg a tá ag teachd?
8 Ar a nadhbharsin tabhraidh tórrtha bhus iomchubhaidh don naithrighe úaibh, agus ná tionsgnaidh a rádh ionnaibh féin, A tá Abraham na athair aguinn: oír a deirimsi ribh, Gur ab éidir lé Dia clann do dhúsachd as na clochmibhse féin D’abraham.
9 Agus a tá an tuáigh a nois fós ar na cur chum fréimhe na gcrann: ar a nadhbharsin gach uile chrann nach dtabhair toradh maith gearrthar é, agus teilgthear sa teinidh é.
10 Agus do fhíafruigh an slúagh nile dhe, ag rádh, Ar a nadhbharsin créud do dheunam?
11 Agus ar bhfreagra dhósan a dubhairt sé ríu, An té agá bhfuil dá chóta, roinneadh ris an té ag nach bhfuil; agus gidh bé agá bhfuil bíadh, déanadh sé mar an gcéudna.
12 Agus tangadar na puibliocáin mar an gcéudna ionnus go mbaisdfidhe íad, agus a dubhradar ris, A mhaighisdir, créud do dhéunáimné?
13 Agus a dubhairt seision ríu, Na déunuidh ní sa mhó ná do horduigheadh dhaóibh.
14 Agus do chuireadar na saighdiúirígh fós ceisd air, ag rádh, Agus créad do dhéunuimne? agus a dubhairt seisean ríu, Ná déunaidh foiréigean ar dhuine ar bith, agus ná hagraidh duine ar bith go heugcórach agus go madh lór libh bhur dtúarasdal féin.
15¶ Agus ar mbeith ag feitheamh don phobal, agus ag smúainiughadh dhóibh uile an a gcroidhthibh a dtimcheall Eóin, nar bheisean Chríosd,
16 Do fheagair Eóin, ag rádh ríu uile, Baisdeamsa sibh go deimhin lé huisge; achd a tá neach is nearthmhuire ná misi ag teachd, ag nach fiú mé íallach a bhróg do sgáoileadh: baisdfidh seision sibh leis an Spiorad Náomh agus lé teinidh:

Troiscthe Chríosd, 13 bhúadhaigh sé ar an deamhan lámh ar láimh. 14 A sheanmóir, 41 agus admhil na ndeamhan féin nime.
 
1 ¶ Agus ar mbeith Diosa lán don Spiorad Náomh, do fhill sé tar a ais ó Iórdan, agus do tréornigheadh leis an Spioruid ar an bhfásach é,
2 Feadh dhá fhichead lá an díabhal ag cur chathuighthi air. Agus níor ith sé uí ar bith ann sna laéthibh sin: achd ar na gcríochnnghadh, ann sin do ghabh ocras é.
3 Agus a dubhairt an Díabhal ris, Más tú Mac Dé, abair ris an gcloichsi bheith na harán.
4 Agus do fhreagair Iósa é, ag rádh, A tá sgríobhtba, Nach lé harán a mháin mhairfios an duine, achd lé gach uile bhréithir Dé.
5 Agus an tan do thréoruigh an díabhal é, ar shlíabh árd, do thaisbén sé ríoghachda na talmbum uile dhó moimeint daimsir.
6 Agus a dubhairt an diabhal ris, Do bhéara misi na cumhachda so uile dhuit, agus a nglóir: óir do tugadh dhamshsa í; agus do bheirim í don tí as toil leam.
7 Ar a nadhbharsin má adhrán tusa dhamhsa, budh leachd íad uile.
8 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé ris, Imthigh úaim, a Shátain: óir a tá sgríobhtha, Do dhéana tú do Thighearna Día féin dadhradh, agus is dó na áonar do dhénna tú seirbhís.
9 Agus do thréoruigh sé é go Híarusalím agus do shuighidh sé é ar bheinn an teampoill, agus a dubhairt sé ris, Mas tú Mac Dé teilg thú féin síos as so:
10 O’ir a tá sgriobhtha, Do bhéura sé áithne dhá áinglibh ad thimcheall, thusa do choimhéud:
11 Agus toigéubhuid eidir a lámhuibh thú, deagla go mbuailfea do chos fá chloich úair ar bith.
12 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé ris, A dubhradh, Ni chuirfe tú cathughadh ar an Dtighearna do Dhía féin.
13 Agus ar ccur críche ar a chathuighthibh uile don díabhal, dtág sé eisean ar feadh tamuill.
14 ¶ Agus dó chas Iósa maille ré cumhachdaibh na Spíoruide don Ghalilé: agus do chúaidh a chlú ar feadh na tire na thimcheall.
15 Agus do theaguisg sé ann a síonagógaibh súd, ag fagháil glóire ó gach uile dhuine.
16 ¶ Agus táinic sé go Násaret, mar ar hoilleagh é: agus, do chúaidh sé a steach mar budh gnath leis, lá na sábboide don tsinagóig, agus do éirigh sé na sheasamh do leughthóireachd.
17 Agus tugadh leabhar Esáias fáidh dhó, agus an tan do osgail sé an leabhar, fuair se an tionad an a raibh sgríobhtha,
18 Ta Spíorad an Tíghearna oramsa, tré gur ong sé mé do chuir sé úadh mé do sheanmóir an tsoisgél do na bochdoibh, do shlánughadh na ndáoine agá bhfuilid croidhthe brúidhte, do sheanmóir fúasgalta do na braighdibh agus do da dalluibh aisioc a radhairc, agus do tabhairt sáoirsi don mhuinntir a tá ar na gcombrúghagh,
19 Do sheanm; óir bhadhna fhorbháiltigh an Tighearna.
20 Agus ar ndúnagh an leabhair dhó, agus ar na tabhairt arís don ghiolla, do shuidh sé. Agus do bháda suile a raibh ann sa tsínagoig uile ag féachain air go géur.
21 Agus do thionnsgain sé a rádh ríu, niugh a tá an sgiobtúirso ar na choimhlíonadh an bhur gclúasuibhsi.
22 Agus do rinneadar uile fiadhnuisi leis, agus do bhí iongantus aca ann sna combráitibh grásamhla do thigeadh as a bhéul. Agus a deirdís, An né nach é so mac Ióseph?
23 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Déara sibh rium gan ambarus an seanfhocalsa, A líagh, leighis thú féin: leitheid na neitheadh do chúalamar do rinne tú a Gcapernáum, déana mar an gcéudna ann so ad dhúithche féin íad
24 Agus a dubhairt seision, A deirim ribh go deimhin, Nách bhfuil cion ar fháidh ann a thír féin.
25 Achd go fírinneach deirimsi ribh, Go rabhadar morán baintreachach a láethibh Elias a Nísraél, an tráth do bhí an fhiormámeint druite trí blíadhna agus sé mhí, ionnas go raibh gorta mhór ar feadh na talmhan uile;
26 Achd níor cuireadh Blías dionnsoighe áon aca, achd go Sarepta na Sidonia, chuan mná do bhí na baintreabhaigh.
27 Agus do bhádar morán lobhar a Níseaél ré linn Eliséus an faidh; agus níor glanagh éin neach aca, achd Náaman an Sirianach.
28 Agus do líonadh a raibh ann sa tsíonagóig dfeirg, an tan do chúaladar na neithesi,
29 Agus ar néirghe na seasamh dhóibh, do theilgeadar as an gcathruigh a mach é, agus rugadar léo é ar mhaluidh an tsléibhe ar a raibh a gcathaire ar na togbháil, do chum go dteilgfidis síos a ndiaigh a chine é.
30 Achd ar ngabháil dosan tré na lár, do imthigh sé,
31 Agus do chúaigh sé síos go Capernáum, cathair don Ghalilé, agus do bhiodh sé dhá dteangasg ann sna sabboidibh.
32 Agus do bhí úathbhás acasan an a theagasg: óir do bhí a comhrádh maille ré hughdarrás.
33 ¶ Agus do bhí neach ann sa tsionagóig, ann a raibh spiorad deamhuaighe neamhghlan, agus do éigh sé do ghúth mhór,
34 Ag rádh, Uch; créud í an bhúain atá aguinne riot, a Iósa Nasardha? an dár sgrisne tháinic tú? a tá a fhios agumsa cia thú, Neach Náomhtha Dé.
35 Agus do imdhearg Iósa é, ag rádh, Bí ad thochd, agus tárr a mach as. Agus do imthigh an deamhan as, ar na thrasgairt go lár, gan díoghbháil ar bith do dhéanamh dhó.
36 Agus do ghabh crith cách uile, agus do labhradar ré chéile, ag rádh, Créud é an níse! go náithingheann sé do na spiorádaibh go neamhghlana lé cumhachdaibh agus lé neart, agus go dtigid siad a mach.
37 Agus do chúaidh a thúarasghbháil an gach uile ionard don tirsin tancheall.
38 ¶ Agus an tan do éirigh Iósa as an tsínagóig, do chúaidh sé a steach go tigh Shímóin. Agus do bhí fiabhrus romhór ar mháthair mhná Shimóin; agus do chuireadar impidhe airsean air a son.
39 Agus ar seasamh dhosan ós a cionn, do imdhearg sé an fiabhrus; agus dfag an fíabhrus í: agus ar néirghe dhisi do lathair do rinne sí friotholamh dhóibh.
40 ¶ Agus ar ndul don ghrein faoi, gach áon ága rabhadar dáoine eagcrúaidh ó thinneasaibh éugsamhla tugadar chuigesean íad; agus ar gcur a láimh dhósan ar gach áon díobh, do shlánuigh sé íad.
41 ¶ Agus fós do imthighid ís na deamhain as mórán, ag éighmhe, agus ag rádh, Is tusa Críod Mac Dé. Achd dá nimdheargadh dhósan ní léigheadh sé dhóibh a rádh: go raibh a fhios aca gur bhé féin Críosd.
42 ¶ Agus ar néirghe don lá, do imthigh sé a mach, agus do chúaidh sé a nionad fasamháil: agus do bhí an slúagh agá lorgaireachd, agus tangadar chuige, agus do bhádar dá chonghbhail, do chum nách achradh sé úatha.
43 Achd a dubhairt seision ríu, Go firinneach is éigin damhsa flaitheas Dé do sheanmóir do chaithreachaibh eile leis: óir is chuige so do cuireadh mé.
44 Agus do bhíodh sé ag deanamh seanmóra a síonagogaibh na Galilé.

1 ¶ Agus tárla, an tau do ling an pobal air déisfeach ré bréithir Dé, gur sheas seision láimh ré loch Ghenesaret,
2 Agus do chonnairc sé dhá luing do bhí ar an loch achd do imthigheadar na híasgaireadha asda, agus do bhíadar ag nighe a líontadh.
3 Agus ar ndul dósan a loing dhíobh, do budh lé Símón, do íarr sé air dul beagán ón tír. Agus ar suidhe dhó do theagaisg sé an pobal as an luing.
4 ¶ Agus mar do sguir sé do labhairt, a dubhairt sé ré Símón, Déunuigh romhaibh ar an ndubhaigéun, agus leigidh sios bhir líontagh chum gabhála.
5 Agus ar bhfreagra do Shímon a dubhairt sé ris, A Mhaighisdir, do thuirrsigheamar sinn féin feadh na hoidhche uile, agus níor ghabhamair éin ní: achd cheana ar do bhreithir se cuirfe mé síos an líon.
6 Agus an tan do rinneadar so, do íadhadar ar iomarchuigh éisg: ionnus gur briseadh a líon.
7 Agus do sméideadar ar a gcompánachuibh, do bhí ann sa luing eile, do chum go dtiocfaidis chuca do thabhairt chunghnamh, dhóibh. Agus thangadarsan, agus do líonadar an dá luing, ionnus go rabhadar a niunmhe a mbáidhte.
8 Agus an tan do chonnairc Símon Peadar so, do shléuchd sé ag giúinibh Iósa, ag rádh, Imthigh úaim a Thighearna; óir is duine peacthach mé.
9 Óir do ghabh eagla é féin, agus a raibh na fhochair uile, ar son na gabhála éisg do ghabhadar:
10 Agus mar an gcéadna Séumas, agus Eóin, clan Shebedei, do bhí na gcompánachuibh ag Simon. Agus a dubhairt Iósa ré Símon, Na bíodh eagla ort; as so a mach bíaidh tú iasgaire ar dháoinibh.
11 Agus an tan tugadarsan a ienga chum tire, ar bhfagbháil an uile neither dhóibh, do leanadar eisean.
12 ¶ Agus tárla, an tan do bhí sé a ccathruigh áirighe, fénch óglach lán do lubhra: agus ar bhfaicsin Iósa dhó do leig sé é féin síos ar aghaidh, agus do ghuidh sé é, a rádh, A Thighearna, más toil leachd é, is éidir leachd misi do ghlanadh
13 Agus ar sineadh a láimhe, do bhean sé ris, ag radh, As toil: bí glan. Agus dfag an lubhra é ar an mball.
14 Agus do aithin sé dhe gan a innisin do dhuine ar bith: achd imthigh, taisbéin thú féin don tsagart, agus íodhbair ar son do ghlanta, mar do aithin Máoisi, mar fhíaghnaisi dhóibh.
15 Achd is móide do leathnuighe a thúarasghbháil sin: agus do chruinnigh slúagh mór déisdeachd ris, agus dfagháil fóiríghne a dteinneas úadh.
16 ¶ Achd do chúaidh seisean fá leith ar an bhfasach, agus do rinne sé urnuighe.
17 ¶ Agus tárla go raibh sé lá áirighe, ag teagasg, agus go rabhadar na Phairisínigh agus doctúirí an dlighe na suidhe a láthair, noch tháinic as gach uile bhaile don Ghalilé, agus do thir Iúdaighe, agus ó Jerusaléim: agus do bhí cumhachda an Tighearna chum a slánuighthe.
18 Agus, féuch, do íomchradar dáoine a leabuidh oglach do bhí a bpairilis: agus do íarradar a thabhairt a sdeach, agus a chur na fhíadhnuisisean.
19 Agus an tráth nach bhfuaradar cáoi ar a thabhairt a sdeach tré mhéud ná cuideachda, do chúadar súas ar a tigh, agus do léigeadar é féin, agus a leabuidh sios tríd an slinnteach ar lár, a bhfíaghnuisi Iósa.
20 Agus ar bhfaicsin a gcreidimh dhósan, a dubhairt sé ris, A dhuine, a táid do pheacuidh ar na maithleamh dhuit.
21 Agus thionnsgnadar na sgríobuidhe agus na Phairisinigh diosbóireachd do dhéanamh, ag rádh, Créd é an fearsa labhras blaisphéimighe? Cía fheúdus peacuigh do mhaitheamh, achd Día ná áonar?
22 Achd ar naithne a smúaintighe Díosa, do fhreagair sé, agus a dubhairt sé ríu; Créd é an ní so smuaintighthísi an bhur gcroidhthibh?
23 Cia is usa, a rádh, A táid do pheacuidh ar na maitheamh dhuit; ná a rádh, Eirigh agus siobhail?
24 Achd do chum go mbeith a fhíios agaibh go bhfuil cumhachda ag Mac an duine, peacuidh do mhaitheamh ar an dtalamh, (a dubhairt sé ré fear na pairilisi,) A deirimsi riot, Eirigh, tóg do leabuidh, agus imthigh dod thigh.
25 Agus ar néirghe dhósan ar an mball an a bhfiadhnuisi, do thóg an leabuidh an raibh sé na luighe, agus do chuaidh sé dhá thigh fein, ag moládh Dé.
26 Agus do ghabh úathbhás cách uile, agus do mholadar Día, agus do líonadh deagla íad, ag rádh, Do choncamair neithe doichreidte a niugh.
27 ¶ Agus tar éisi so do chúaidh Iósa a mach, agus do chonnairc sé puibliocán, dár bháinm Lébhi, na shuidhe ag bord an chusduim: agus a dubharit séris, Lean misi.
28 Agus ar bhfágbháil gach éin neithe dhósan, déirigh sé, agus do lean sé eisean.
29 ¶ Agus do rinne Lébhi féusda mór dhó an a thigh féin: agus do bhí cuideachda mhór phuibliocán agus dáoine eile do shuidh na bhfochair.
30 Agus do rinne cuid díobh do bhi na sgríobuidhibh agus na Bhphairisíneachuibh monabhar a naghaidh a dheisciobalsan, ag rádh, Creud fá niththísi agus fá nibhthí a bhfochair na bpuibliocán agus na bpeacthach?
31 Agus ag freagra a dubhairt Iósa ríu, Ní bhfuil ríachdanus leágha ar na dáoinibh slána; achd ar na dáoinibh tinne.
32 Ní tháinic misi do ghairm na bhfiréunach, achd na bpeacthach chum aithrighe.
33 ¶ Achd a dubhradarsan ris, Créud fá dtroisgid deisciobail Eóin go minic, agus créd fá ndéunuid síad urrnaighe, agus mar an gcéudna deisciobail na Bhphairisíneach; achd ithid agus ibhid do dheisciobailsi?
34 Agus a dubhairt seision ríu, An bhféadtáoisi a thabhairt air chloinn tséomra an fhir núa phósda trosgadh do dhéunamh, an feadh bhías sé féin na bhfochair?
35 Achd tiocfaid na láethe an tan bhéurthar an fear núa phósda úatha, ann sna láethibh sin do dhéunuid síad trosgadh.
36 ¶ Agus a dubhairt sé fós tré chosamhlachd ríu; Ní chuireann neach ar bith preabán éuduigh núa air sheanchulaidh, nó, brisidh an téudach núa é, agus ní thig an preabán núaéuduigh leis a tseinéudach?
37 Agus ní chuireann duine ar bith fíon núa a seanbhuidéuluibh; nó brisfidh an fíon núa na buidéil, agus dóirtfidhear an fíon agus rachuid na buidéil a múgba.
38 Achd fíon núa is cóir do chur a mbuidéuluibh núadha; agus béid síad aráon slán.
39 Agus ní bhfuil duine ar bith ibheas seinfhíon lér ab áill fíon núa ar ball: óir a deir sé, Is é seinfhíon is folláine.

2 Achd a dubhradar cuid do na Pharisineachuibh ríu, Créd fa ndéuntáoi ní nach indéanta ann sa tsáoire?
3 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé ríu, An né nár leughabhuirsi an ní so, do rinne Dáibhi, an tan do bhí ocrus air féin, agus ar an mhuinntir do bhí na fharradh;
4 Cionnus do chúaidh sé a sdeach go tigh Dé, agus do ghlac sé arán na fiaghnuisi agus a dúaigh sé é, agus tug sé fós don mhuinntir do bhí na fhochair é: noch nár choir ithe achd do na sagurtuibh amháin?

10 Agus an tan do fhéuch sé orrtha uile na thimcheall, a dubhairt sé ris a nóglach, Sín amach do lámh. Agus do rinne seisean mar sin: agus do haiseagadh a lámh slán mar an lámh eile.
11 Agus do líonadh íadsan do chuthach; agus do lúaidheadar ré a chéile créd do dheunaidis ré Híosa.
12 ¶ Agus tárla ann sna láethibh sin, go ndeachuidh seisean amach ar shlíabh do dhéunamh úrnaighe, agus do chaith sé an oidhche ag guidhe Dé.
13 Agus ar néirghe don lá, do ghoir sé a dhesiciobail chuige: agus do thogh sé dhá fhéar dhéug asda, dár ghoir se absdail;

20 ¶ Agus are dtógbháil a shúl súas dósan air a dheisciobluibh, a duiubhairt sé, As beannaighthe sibhsi a dháoine bochda: óir as libh flaitheas Dé.
21 As beannaighthe sibh a dháoine atá ocrach a nois: óir sáiséochthar sibh. As beannaighthe sibhsi cháoidheas a nois: óir do dhéuntáoi gáire.

35 Ar a nadhbharsin grádhuighidh bhur námhuid, agus déunuidh maith, agus tabhruidh áirleaghadh úaibh, gan súil ré héinní arís; agus budh mór bhur lúaideachd, agus beithí bhur gcloinn ag an té as Airde: óir bí seisean cinealta les na dáoinibh dombuídheacha agus saithe.
36 Ar a nadhbharsin bíthísi trócaireach, mar atá bhur Nathuir trocuireach.
37 Agus ná beiridh breath, agus ní bhéurthar breath oruibh: ná damnuighe, agus ní daiméontar sibh: maithidh, agus maithfithear dháoibh:

39 Agus do labhuir se cosamhlachd ríu, An bhféudann an dall dhall eile dothreorigheadh? an ne neach duitdfid aráon sa díg?
40 Ní bhfuil an deisciobal ós cionn a mhaighisdir: achd gidh bé neach bhus diongmhála, bíaidh sé mar a mhaighisdir.
41 Agus créud fa a bhfaiceann tú an broth beag a súil do dhearbhráthar, agus nach dtugair dod aire an tsail atá ad shúil féin?
42 Nó cionnus as éidir leachd a rádh réd dhearbhrathair, A dhearbhrathair, léig dhamh an broth atá ad shúil do bháin aisde, agus nách bhfaiceann tú an tsail atá ad shuil féin? A fhir an dhúarchrábhuidh, ar tus teílg amach an tsail as do shuil féin, agus an sin bhus léir dhuit, an broth atá a súil de dhearbhráthar do bhúain aisde.
43 Oír ni maith an crann iomchras drochthoradh; agus ní holc an crann iomchras toradh maith.
44 Oír is ó a thoradh aitheantar gach uile chrann. Oír ní chruinnighid dáoine fígidhe do dheilgneach, na cáora fineamhna do dhriseach.
45 Do bheir an duine maith ní maith as cisde maith a chroidhe féin; agus do bheir an droch dhuine droch ní as droch chisde a chróidhe fein: oír is as iomarcuidh an chróidhe, labhrus an béal.
46 ¶ Achd créud fá ngoirthísi, A Thighearna, a Thighearna dhíomsa, agus nach déuntáoi na neithe a deirim?
47 Gach uile neach thig chugamsa, agus éisdeas rém bhríaththruibh, agus do ní dhá reir, foillséochuidh mé dháoibhsi cía ré ar cosmhuil é:

2 Agus do bhí óglach caiptin áirighe, go bréoite, a riochd bháis, air a raibh cion mór aige.
3 Agus an tan do chúaluidh sé tuarasgbháil Iósa, do chuir sé sinnsir na Níuduighe chuge, ag íarruidh air teachd agus a shearbhfhoghantuidhe shlánughadh
4 Agus an tan thangadar so chum Iósa, díarradar air go díthcheallach, ag rádh, Gur bhfíu é so do thabhuirt dó:
5 Oír atá grádh áige dar gcineadhne, agus do thóg sé sionagóg dhúinne.
6 Agus do chuaidh Iósa léo. Agus an tan do bhí sé a ngar don tigh, do chuir an caiptín a cháirde chuige, ag rádh ris, A Thighearna, Ná cuir búaidhreadh ort féin: óir ní fíu misi go rachfá a sdeach fá chléith mo thighe:
7 Ar a nadhbharsin níor mheas mé gur bhfíu mé féin dul ad ionnsuighe: achd abhuir a bhfocal, agus bíaidh móglach slán.

9 Agus ar ná gcloisdin so Díosa, do bhí iongnadh aige ann, agus ar bhfilleadh dhó, a dubhairt sé ris a tslúagh do lean é, A deirim ribh, Nach bhfuair mé a Nisrael féin, a chomhmór se do chreideamh.
10 Agus ar bhfilleadh a steach, do na teachduiribh do cuireadh chuige, fúaradar an searchfhoghantaidh do bhí tinn slán.
11 ¶ Agus tárla an lá na dhiáigh sin, go ndeachaidh sé don chathruigh dá ngoirthear Náin; agus do chúadar mórán dá dheisciobluibh leis, agus buidhean mhór.
12 Agus an tan tháinig sé a ngar do dhoras na caithreach, fénch, do bhí duine marbh agá bhreith amach, do bhí na áon mhac agá mháthair, agus í na baintreabhaigh; agus do bhí coimhthionól mór ón chathruigh na fochair.
13 Agus ar na faicsin don Tighearna, do ghabh trúaighe mhór dhi é, agus a dubhairt sé ría, Na guil.
14 Agus táinic sé agus do bhean sé ris an gcomhraidh: (agus do sheasadar an luchd do bhí agá iomchar) agus a dubhairt sé; A ógánaigh, a deirim riot, éirigh.
15 Agus déirigh an duine marbh na shuidhe, agus do thionnsgain sé labhairt. Agus tug sé dhá mháthair féin é.
16 Agus do ghabh eagla íad uile: agus tugadar glóir do Dhía, ag rádh, Déirghe fáidh mór an ar measg; agus, Dféuch Día ar a phobal féin.
17 Agus do chúaidh an túarasgbháil so amach air féadh thíre Iúdaighe uile, agus air feadh gach éintíre timcheall.
18 ¶ Agus dinnseadar a dheisciobail na neithe so uile Déoin.
19 Agus are ngairm Deóin deisi áirighe dá dheisciobluibh chuige do chuir sé dionsuighe Iósa íad, ag rádh, An tusa an té do bhí chum teachda? nó an bhfuilmid ag feathamh ré neach eile?
20 Agus an tan thangadar na firsi shuigesean, a dubhradar, Do chuir Eóin Baisde sinne chugad, ag rádh, An tusa an té do bhí chum teachda? nó an bhfuilmid ag feathamh ré neach eile?
21 Agus ar an uár sin fein do chlánuigh seisean mórán dáoine ó easláintibh agus ó phláighibh, agus ó dhroch spioraduibh; agus thug sé á radharc do mhórán dall.
22 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé ríu, Ar nimtheachd díbh, innisidh Deóin na neithe do chonncabhair agus do chúalabhair; go bhfaicid na daill, go siubhlaíd na bacuidh, go nglantar na lobhair, go gchimid na bodhair, go néirghid na mairbh, go bhfuil an soisgéul dá sheanmóir do na bochdaibh.
23 Agus as beannaighthe an té, nach bhfuighe oilbhéim ionnumsa.

26 Achd créd é an ní agá ndeachubhair amach dhá fhéuchuin? Fáidh? A deirim ribh go firinneach, agus ní as mó ná faidh.
27 Ag so an te, ar a bhfuil sgríobhtha, Féuch, cuirim mo theachdaire romhad, oillmhéochus do shlighe romhad.
28 Oir a deirim ribh, Nach bhfuil éidir chlannuibh na mban faidh as mó ná Eóin Baisde: Achd cheana an té as lugha a rioghachd Dé as mó é na eisean.
29 Agus ar na gcloisdin so, do mholadar an pobal uile, agus na puibliocáin, Día, do bhí ar na mhaisdeadh ré baisdeadh Eóin.
30 Achd tugadar na Phairsínigh agus an luchd dlighe tarcuisne ar choinhairle Dé na naghuídh féin, gan a bheith ar na mhaisdeagh úadhsan.
31 ¶ Agus a dubhairt an Tighearna, Cía ré saimhéola mé daóine an chinidh so? agus cía ré ar comshuil íad?
32 As cosmhul íad re leanbuibh na suidhe ar áit an mharguidh, agus éighmheas ar á chéile, agus a deir: Dó rinneamair píobaireachd dhaóibh, agus ní dhearnabhair damhsa; do rinneamair caoí dhaóibh, agus ní dhearnabhair gul.
33 Oír tháinig Eóin Baisde ní ag ithe aráin ná ag ol fíona; agus a deirthísi, Atá deamhan ann.
34 Tháinic Mac an duine ag ithe agus ag ól; agus a deirthí, Feuch an duine cráosach, fioníobhaighe cara na bpuibliocán agus na bpeachthach!
35 Achd atá an eagna ar na sáoradh ó na cloinn féin uile.
36 ¶ Agus do íarr duine áirighe do na phairisíneachaibh air, bíadh ithe na fhochair. Agus ar ndul a sdeach go tigh an phairisínigh dhó, do shuidh sé sios chum bídh.
37 Agus, féuch, an tráth fúair bean don chatbraigh, do bhí na peachthach, a fhios go raibh sé na shuidhe ag bíadh a dtígh an phairisinigh, tug si bocsa ola lé,
38 Agus ar seasamh agá chosuibh don táobh shiar dhe ag gul, do thionnsgain sí a chosa dionnladh lé na déuruibh, agus a dtiurmughadh lé gruáig a cinn, agus do phóg sí a chosa, agus do ong sí leis an ola íad.
39 Agus an tan do chonnaire an phairisineach tug an cuirteadh dhósan sin, smuáin sé na inntinn, ag rádh, Dá madh fáidh an fearso, daithnéochadh sé cía agus gá bionnus an bheanso bheanus ris, óir as peacthach í.
40 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé rís, A Shiomóin, atá ní agam ré rádh riot. Agus a dubhairt seision, A Mhaighisdir, abuir romhad.
41 Do bhádar días dfeitheamhnuibh ag fear áirligthe: do dhligh sé cúig chéad pighinn dfior aca, agus cáogad don dara fear.
42 Agus an tráth nach raibh díolaigheachd ag ceachdar díobh ré na thabhairt dó, do mhaith sé dhóibh aráon. Uime sin ínnis damhsa, cia aca léir ab annsa é?
43 Agus ar bhfreagra do Shímón a dubhairt sé, Measuim gur leis an té, dár mhaith sé an tsuim as mó Agus a dubhairt seision is, As maith an bhreath rug tú.
44 Agus ar bhfilleadh dhó chum na mná, a dubhairt sé ré Síomón, An bhfaicean tú an bhean so? tháinic misi a sdeach dod thighsi agus ní thug tú uisgi chum mo chos díonladh: achd do nigh an bhean so mo chosa le na déuruibh, agus dé thiormuigh sí íad le grúaig a cinn.
45 Ní thug tusa póg dhamh: achd ó tháinig mé a sdeach níor choisg sisi do phógadh mo chos.
46 Níor ong tú mo cheann lé hola: achd do ong an bhean so mo chosa ré huinnement.

7 Agus do thuit cuid eile a measg deilguigh; agus ar bhfas don deilgneach a náoinfheachd ris, do thachdadar é.
8 Agus do thuit cuid eile a dtalamh mhaith, agus an tan do fhás sé, tug sé toradh céadach úadh. Agus ar na rádh so dhó, do éigh sé, Gidh be agá bhfuilid clúasa chum éisdeachda, éisdeadh sé.
9 ¶ Agus do fhiáfruigheadar a dheisciobuil de, ag rádh, Créd é an chosamhachdsin?
10 Agus a dubhairt seisean, Is dáoibhsi tugadh rúndiamhra rioghachda Dé daithniughadh: achd do chách eile a ccosamhlachduibh; ionnus ag faicsin dóibh nach bhfaicdís, agus ag cluinsin dóibh nach dtuigfidís.
11 ¶ Ag so an chosamhlachd: a sé an síol bríathar Dé.
12 Agus an dream úd chois na sligheadh a siad éisdeas; na dhiáigh sin tig an díabhal, agus tógbhuidh sé an bhriáthar as a gcróidhe, deagla go gcreidfidís agus go slánéochtháoi iád.
13 Agus an dream úd air an gcarruic, noch an tan do chluinid, gabhuid chuca an briathar maille lé gáirdeachus; achd ní bhfuil fréamh aca so, noch chreideas feadh tamuill, agus fhilleas ar a nais a naimsir an chathaigthe.
14 Achd an ní úd do thuit a measg na ndeilbneach, a siad so do éisd, achd ar nimtheachd dóibh, muchtar íad lé cúram agus lé saidhbhreas agus lé saímhe na beatha, agus ní thabhruid toradh úatha.
15 Achd an ní do thuit ann sa talamh mhaith, a said súd éisdeas ris an mbreithir, agus chungmhas é a gcroidhe shocraidh mhaith, agus do bheirid toradh úatha a bhfoighid.
16 ¶ Achd ní bhfuil neach ar bith, Iasas coinneall, fholchas fáoi shouightheach í, ná chuireas fáoi leabuidh í; achd cuiridh sé a gcoinnleóir í, do chum go bhfaicfheadh an luchd théid a sdeach an solas.
17 Oír ní bhfuil éin ní foluightheach, nach déuntar follas; na secréideach, nach bhfuighthear a fhios agus nach dtiocfaidh chum soillsi.
18 Ar a nadhbharsin tabhruidh bhur naire ribh cionnas éisdeas sibh: óir gidh be neach agá bhfuil, is dó do bhéarthar; agus gidh bé neach ag nach bhfuil, béarthar úadh an ní fós sháoiltear do bheith aige.
19 ¶ Agus tangadar a mhathair agus a dhearbhraithreacha chuige, agus níor bhéidir leó dul a ngar dhósan ón tslúagh.
20 Agus so hinniseadh dhó, ag rádh, Atá do mhathair agus do dhearbhraithreacha na seasamh a muigh, ag iarruidh tfáicsin.
21 Agus are bhfreagra dhósan a dubhairt sé riu, a siad so mo mhathairse agus mo dhearbhráithreacha noch éisdeas bríathar Dé, agus do ní dá réir.
22 ¶ Agus tárla lá áirighe, go ndeachaidh seisean agus a dheisciobuil a luing: agus a dubbhart sé riú, Déanam ar an táobh úd a nunn don loch. Agus do sdiúradar rompa.
23 Agus ag luingseórachd dóibh do thuit a chodladh airsean: agus do éirigh sdoirmgháoithe ar an loch; agus do líonadh súas íad, agus do bhádar a ngábhadh.
24 Agus ar ndol cuigesean dóibh, do dhúisgeadar é, ag rádh, A Mhaighisdir, a mhaighisdir, a támaoid ar fágbháil. Agus ar neirghe dhósan do bhagair sé ar an gaoith agus ar thonnghail a nuisge: agus do choisgeadar, agus tainic ciuinas ann.
 25 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Cáit an a bhfuil bhar gcreideamh? agus ar mbeith le heagla dhóibhsion do ghabh iongnadh íad, ag rádh ré chéile, Cia be so! a deir ris na gáothaibh agus ris a nuisge fós bheith na dtochd, agus úmhluighid said dó.
26 ¶ Agus do rinneader loingscórachd go crich na Ngadarénach, atá as comhair na Galilé a nunn.
27 Agus ar ndol a dtír dhósan, tárla óglach áirighe as an gcathruigh air, ann a rabhadar deamhuin re haimsir fhada, agus ag nach bíodh éadach uime, agus ní comhnuigheadh sé a dtigh, achd an sna tuámaidhibh.
28 Agus ag faicsin Iósa dhó, agus ag éighmhe, do theilg sé é féin siós aga chosaibh, agus a dubhairt sé do ghuth ard, Créd é mo chuidsi dhiót, a Iósa, a Mhic Dé ro áird? Iarruim ort, gan mo phiánadh.
29 Oir do aithin sé don spiorad neamhghlan dol as an duine. Oír is iomdha uáir do bheireadh sé siothadh air: agus do cheangluidh le slabhraidhibh agus dp cpimhéaduibh le géimhleachuibh é; agus ar mbriseadh na gcuibhreach dhósan, do thiománadh an deamhan fá na fasaighibh e.
30 Agus dfiafruidh Iósa dhé, ag rádh, Créd is ainm dhuit? Agus a dubhairt seision, Leighión: do brígh go ndeachádar mórán deamhan a sdeach ann.
31 Agus diárradar air gan a chur dfiachaibh ortha dul ann sa dubhaigen.
32 Agus so bhí tréd mór muc ann sin ag inghilt ar a tslíabh: agus diárradar air a léigean doibh dul ionnta. Agus dfulaing seísion sin dóibh.
33 Agus ar ndul do na deamhnuibh as an duine, do chúadar ann sna mucaibh: agus do rith an tréd muc ris a nail ann sa loch, agus do múchadh iád.
34 Agus an trath do chunncadar a háodhairidhe an ní do rinneadh an, do theitheadar, agus ar nimtheachd dóibh dinnseador sin ann sa chatruigh agus ar na machairibh.
35 Agus do chúadarsan amach dféachain an neith do rinneadh; agus tangadar dionnsuighe Iósa, agus fúaradar an duine, as a ndeachadar na deamhuin, a na éadughadh, agus é ar deaghcheill, na shuidhe ag cosaibh Iósa: agus go ghabh eagla íad.
36 Agus an dream do bhí dhá fhéachain dinnsigheadar dhóibsion cionnas do slánaigheadh an tí iona rabhadar na deamhuin.
37 Agus diárradar luchd chríche na Ngadarenach uile airsion imtheachd úatha; oír do bhí eagla ro mhór orrtha: agus ar ndol dósan ann sa luing, dfill sé tar ais.
38 Agus díarr an fear as a ndeachadar na deamhuin air, é fein do bheith na fhochair: achd léig Iósa úadh é, ag rádh,
39 Fill dod thigh féin, agus innis meúd na neitheann do rinne Día dhuit. Agus do imthigh seision, ar feadh na caithreach uile ag innisin créd íad na neithe do rinne Iósa dhó.
40 Agus tárla, an tan do fhill Iósa tar ais gur ghabh an sluagh chuca é: óir do bhádar uile ag feitheamh ris.
41 ¶ Agus, féuch, táinic neach áirighe dar bhainm Iáirus, do bhí na úachdarán ar a tsinagóig: agus an tan do shléuchd sé ag cosaibh Iósa, diárr sé dathchuinghidh air dul leis dá thigh féin:
42 Do bhrígh go raibh éinghein inghine aige, timcheall a dá bhliadhan dég, agus í fagháil bhais. Achd ar mbeith ag imtheachd dhó do bhí an sluagh dha bhrughadh.
43 ¶ Agus bean do bhí a bhflucsa fola dá bhliadhuin dég, agus do chaith a raibh aice le leaghaibh, agus nar béidir le héinneach a leigheas,
44 Do chúaidh sí táobh shíar dheision, agus do chumail sí ré himeal a bhruit: agus do sguir a dórtadh fola ar an mball.
45 Agus a dubhairt Iósa, Cía so do bhean rium? Agus ar na shéana do chách uile, a dubhairt Peadar agus an dream do bhí na fharraidh, A Mhaighisdir, atá an slúagh ad bhrughadh agus ad phluchadh, agus a nabair tú, Cía bhean rium?
46 Agus a dubhairt Iósa, Do bhean duine éigin riom: oír do mhothuigh mé subhailce dul asam.
47 Agus an tráth do chonnairc an bhean gur hairigheadh í, táinic si ar crith, agus ag sléuchdain dósan, dfoillsigh sí dhó a bhriadhnaisi an phobuil uíle créd é an tádhbhar far chumail sí ris, agus cionnus do leigheasadh í ar an mball.
48 Agus a dubhairt seisean ría, Bíodh mainighin mhaith agad, a inghean: do shlánuigh do chreideamh thú; imthigh romhad a sióthcháin.
49 ¶ An feadh do bhí seision ag labhairt, táinic neach áirige ó úachdarán na sinagóige, da rádh ris, Fúair binghean bás; ná cuir buaidhreadh ar an Mhaghisdir.
50 Agus ar na chluinsin so Díosa, do fhreagair sé é, ag rádh, Na bíodh eagla ort: créid amhain, agus sláineóchthar í.
51 Agus ar ndul a sdeach don tigh dhó, níor fhuiling sé neach ar bith do dhul a sdeach, achd Peadar, agus Séumus, agus Eóin, agus athair agus mathair an chailín.
52 Agus do bhádar cách uile a gul, agus dá cáoineadhsa: achd a dubhairt seision, Ná guilidh; ní bhfuil sí marbh, achd na codladh.
53 Agus do rinneadarsan fonomhad faoi, tré go raibh a fhios aca go raibh sí marbh.
54 Agus ag cur cháich uile amach dhósan, agus ad breith ar a láimh, do éigh sé, ag rádh, A chalín, éirigh.
55 Agus táinic a spiorad a rís innte, agus déirigh sí ar an mball: agus do aithin sé bíadh do thabhairt dí.
56 Agus do ghabh úathbhás a hathair agus a mathair: gidheadh do áithin seision díobh gan an ní do rinneadh dinnísin do dhuine ar bith.

Uír na nccos do chrathadh anaghaidh dhaoine do theagaisc. 51 Gan bhéith dioghaltach. 57 Agus gan Chríosd do leanmhuin ar scáth sceimhe, nó arson éadala agus onoir.
 
1 Agus ag gairm a dhá dheisciobal deg dhó, tug sé neart agus cumhachda dhóibh art na huile dheamhnuibh, agus ar easláintibh do leigheas.

9 Agus a dabhairt Iorúaith, Do bhean misi a cheann Deóin: agus cia hé so, ar a gcluinim a leithéde so? Agus diarr sé eision dfaicsin.
10 ¶ Achd ar bhfilleadh do na habsdalnibh, dinnseadar dhósan gach ní dhá ndearnadar. Agus ar na mbreith leis do, do chuáidh sé fá Leith ar fhásach na ciathreacha dá ngoirthear Betsáida.
11 Agus an tan, do aithin an pubal sin, do leanadar é: agus ar na ngabháil chuige dhó, do labhair sé ria a dtimcheall rioghachda Dé, agus do shlánaigh sé an chuid díobh ar a raibh úireasbhuide leigbis.
12 ¶ Agus do bhí an lá ag dol thárrsa, agus trangadar an dá fhear dhég chuigesion, agus a dubhradar ris, Léigh uáit an slúagh, ionnus go numéochaidis fa na bailtibh agus fan tír do leathnughadh, agus go ccomhnuidhid, agus dfaigháil bídh: óir a tamáoid ann so a náit fhásamhuil.
13 Achd a dubhairt seision riú, Tabhruidhsi ní lé na ithe dhóibh. Agus a dubhradarsan, Ní bhfuil ní is mó aguinn ná cúig aráin agus dá iásglachsd mona dteímis do cheannach bidh don phobal so nile.
14 Oír do bhádar a dtimcheall chuig míle fear. Achd a dubhairt seisión ré na dheisciobluibh, Cuiridh na suidhe iád na gcaogadaibh.
15 Agus do rinneadarsan amhlaidh, agus do chuireadar na suidhe iád nile.
16 Agus ar ngabháil na gcúig narán agus an dá iásgdhósan, agus ar bhféachain sias ar neamh, do bheannuigh sé iád, agus do bhris sé, agus tug sé dhá dheisciobluibh iád do chum go gcuirfidís a bhfiadhnuisi an phubail iád.
17 Agus a dithadar, agus do sasaigheadh iad uile: agus do tógbhadh dhá chlíabh dhég do bhíadh bhrisde do bhí dfhuighioll aca.
18 ¶ Agus tárla, an tan do bhí sé na áonar ag déanamh urnuighe, go rabbadar a dheisciobuil na fhochair: agus gur fhíafruidh sé dhíobh, ag rádh, Créd a deir an slúagh cía misi?
19 Agus do fhreagradarsan agus a dubhradar, Eóin Baisde; agus cuid eile, Elías; agus cuid eile, gur éighe fáigh éigin do na seanfháighibh a rís.
20 Agus a dubhairt seision riú, Achd cred a deárthaoisi cía mé? agus ar bhfreagra do Pheadar a dubharit sé, Criosd Dé.
21 Agus ar ndeanamh bagiar orrtha dhó, do aithin sé íad gan so dinnisin do dhuine ar bith;
22 Ag rádh, Gur ab éigin do Mhac an duine mórán dfulang, agus a dhinltadh ó na sinnsearnibh agus ó úachdaránnibh na sagart agus ó na sgriobuidgibh, agus bás dfulang, agus éirghe an tres lá.
23 ¶ Agus a dubhairt sé riá uile, Madh áill ré héinneach misi do leanmhuin, díultadh sé dho féin, agus toghbadh sé a chros gach láoi agus leamadh sé misi.
24 Oír gidh bé lér ab aill an anam do shlánaghadh caillfidh sé é: agus gidh be chaillfeas a anam ar mo shousa, a sé so shláineochas é.

27 Agus a déirim ribh go firianeach, Go bhfuilid cuid don mhuintir ata á láthair ann so, nach blaisfidh bás, nó go bhfaicfid rioghachd Dé.
28 ¶ Agus tárla a dtimcheall ochd lá tar éis na mbriatharsa, ar mbeith Pheadair agus Eóin agus Shéamuis leis, go ndeachaidh sé súas ar shlíabh do dhéanadh urnuighe.
29 Agus tárla ag deanamh urnuighe dhó, gur hathruigheadh fioghair a aighthe, agus go ndearnadh a éadach geal dealruigheach.
30 Agus, féuch, do bhádar días fear ag comhrádh ris, mar atá Máoisi agus Elías:
31 Noch do chomcas a nglóir, agus dfoillsigh an bás, do fhuilcongadh sé a Niarusalem.
32 Agus do bhí codladh trom ar Pheadar agus ar a ndroing do bhí na fharradh, agus an tan do dhuisgeadar, do channcadar a ghloírsion, agus an dias fear do bhí na seasamh na fhochair.
33 Agus tárlá, agá fhagbháil doibh, go ndubhairt Peadar réllíosa, A Mhaighisdir, is maith sinne do bheith ann so: agus déanam trí botha; both dhuitsi, agus both do Mháoisi, agus both Dhelías:gan fios aige créd a dubhairt sé.
34 Agus an tan a dubhairt sé só, táinic néull, agus do theilg sé agáile orrtha: agus do ghabh eagla iásdsan an tan do chuádar ann sa néull.
35 Agus táinic gith as a néull, ag rádh, Ag so mo Mhac gradhachsa: éisdigh ris.
36 Agus ar teachd don ghuthsin, do fríoth Iósa na áonar. Agus do bhadarsan na dtochd, agus nior innisiodar dáonduine ann sna laéthibhsin ní ar bith dhá bhfacadar.
37 ¶ Agus tárla, an lá na dhiáighsin, ar ndul síos don tslíabh dhóibh, do dtárla slúagh mór airsion.
38 Agus, féuch, do éigh neach don tslúagh, ag rádh, A Mhaighisdir, iárruim ort, feuch ar mo mhac: oír a sé méinghein é.
39 Agus, féuch, beirídh an spiorad air, agus éimhigh sé go hobann; agus tairrngidh sé as a cheile é ag cur cubhair amach, agus is ar éigin fhágfas sé é tar éis a chomhmbrúghadh.
40 Agus diárr mé ar do dheiscioblaibhsi a chur as; achd níor fhéadadar.
41 Agus ar bhfreaga Díosa a dubhairt sé, A chineadh míchreidmheach cláon, ga fad fós bhiás mé eadruibh, agus fhuileongas mé sibh? Tabhair do mhác leachd an so.
42 Agus ad teachd chuige dhó, do bhúail an deamhan síos é, agus do tharruing sé as a cheile é. Achd do imdhearg Iósa an spiorad neamhglan, agus do leighis sé an leanabh, agus thug sé dhá athair fein é.
43 ¶ Achd do ghabh úathbhás cách uile trí mhórchumhachd Dé. Agus ar mbeith ag déanamh iongantus doibh uile ann gach uile ní da ndearnuidh Iósa, a dubhairt sé ré na dheiscioblaibh,
44 Taisgidh na bríathrasa ann bhur gcluasaibh: óir tiofuidh chum chríche go dtiobharthar Mac an duine a lámhuibh na ndaóine.
45 Achd níor thuigeadarsan an comhrádhsa, agus do bhí sé ar na fholach úatha, ionnas nar airigheadar é: agus do bhí eagla orrtha ceisd do chur airsion a dtimcheall an chomhráidh sin.
46 ¶ Agus déirigh diospóireachd eatarra, cía dhíobh féin budh mhó.
47 Agus ar bhfaicsin smuaintighe a gcroidhe, Díosa, do ghabh se leanabh chuige, agus chuir sé na aice féin é.
48 Agus a dubhairt sé riú, Gidh bé ghéubhas chuige an leanabh so a mainmsi is misi ghabhas se chuige: agus gidh bé ghéubhas misi chuige, gabhuidh sé chuige an té do chuir uádh mé: óir gidh bé is lugha eadruibhsi uile, bíaidh se mór.
49 ¶ Agus ar bhfreagra Déoin a dubhairt sé, A Mhaighisdir, do chunncamairne duine áirighe ag teilgean deamhan a mach ad ainuisi; agus do thoirmeasgamar é, ar son nach leananu sé dhínne.
50 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ríu, Ná toirmeasuidh é: oir gidh bé nach bhfuil ar naghuidh atá sé linn.
51 ¶ Agus tárla, an tan do coímhliónadh laéthe a nglacfaidh súas é, gur chuir sé roimhe go daingion dul go Hiárusaléim.
52 Agus do chuir sé teachdairighe róimhe: agus ar nimtheachd dóibh, do chúadara sdeach a mbaile na Samáritánach, do chum go ndéanaidís ullmhaghadh roimhesion.
53 Achd niór ghabhadársan chuca é, ar son go raibh a agháidh mar bhiagh sé dul go Hiarusalém.
54 Agus an tráth do chuncadar a dheisciobuilsion Séumas agus Eóin so, a dubhradar, A Thighearna, a naill leachd go nabramáois teine do theachd a núas ó neamh, dá losadh síad, mar do rinne Elías leis?
55 Agus ar gcasadh dhó, do imdhearg sé iad, agus a duibhairt sé, Ní bhfuíl a fhios aguibh créd é an spiorad dár dhe sibh.
56 Oír ní thaínic Mac an duine do sgríos anmann na ndáoine, achd dá slánughadh. Agus do chúadar as sin go bhaile eile.
57 ¶ Agus tárla, ar nimtheachd dóibh san tslíghe, go ndúbhairt neach áirighe rision, Leanfuidh misi thú gidh bé háit ann a racha tú, a Thighearna.
58 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris, Ataíd fúachaisighe ag na sionnchaibh, agus neíd ag éanlaith a naiéir; achd ní bhfuil áit ag Mac an duine ann a gcurfeadh sé a cheann.
59 Agus a dubhairt sé ré neach eile, Leansa misi, Achd a dubhairt seision, A Thighearna, leigh dhamh imtheachd ar túís agus mathair daghlacadh.
60 Achd a dubhairt Iósa ris, Leíg do na marbhuibh a mairbh féin daghlacadh: achd imthighsi, agus déana rioghachd Dé do sheanmóir.
61 Agus mar an gcéadna a dubhairt neach eile, Leanfuidh misi thú, a Thighearna; Achd leigh dhamh ar tús mo chead do ghabháil, ag am mhuinntir.
62 Achd a dubhairt Iósa ris, Gidh bé neach chureas a lámh ar an gcéuchd, agus fhéachas na dhíaigh, ní bhfuil se iomchubhaidh do ríoghachd Dé.

1 Agus na dhiaigh so dórduigh an Tighearna mar an gcéadna deithneabhar agus trí fichid eile, agus do chuir sé na ndís agus na ndís roimhe féin iád dá gach uile chathruigh agus ionnad, ann a raíbh a theachd féin.
2 Ar a nadhbharsin a dabhairt sé ríu, Is mór an foghmhar, achd is beag an luchd oibre: uime sin guidhidh Tighearna an fhoghmhuir, luchd oibre do chur amach chum a fhóghmhair.
3 Imthighidh: féuch, ataimse dá bhur gcur úaim mar úana a measg mhadradh allta.
4 Ná hiomchruidh sbarán, na tiach loín ná bróga: agus ná beannaighidh do neach ar bith sa tslighe.
5 Agus gidh bé tigh iona rachtáoi a sdeach, abruidh ar tús, Go raibh sióthcháin don tighse.
6 Agus má bhionn Mac na sióthchána annsin, do dhéannidh bhur sióthcháinsi comhnnighe air: achd muna raibh, fillfidh sí chugaibh féin a rís.
7 Agus fanaidh an sa tighsin, ag ithe agus ag ól na neitheann atá aca: óir is fiú an toibrigh a thuárasdal. Ná himighidh ó thigh go tigh.
8 Agus gidh bé cathair ann a rachtáoi a sdeach, agus go ngéubhaid siád sibh, ithidh na neithe chuirid siád ann bhur bhfiadhuisi:
9 Agus slánaghaidh na heaslaín bhias innte, agus abruidh riú, Do dhruid rioghachd Dé ribh.
10 Agus gibh bé cathair ann a rachtáoi a sdeach, agus nach génbhuid siád sibh, ar nimtheachd dáoibh amach ar na sraídibh, abruidh,
11 Craithmíd dhínn bhur naghaidh, go fiú an luaithridh do lean dínn, as bhur gcathruigh: achd cheana bíodh a fhios so aguibh, gur dhruid rioghachd Dé ribh.
12 Agus a deirím bhur ribh, Go madh socamhluighe do na Sodomachaibh an lá úd, ná don chathraighsin.
13 ¶ Is anáoibhinn duit, a Chorásin! as anáoibhinn duit, a Bhetsáida! oir dá madh a Dtírus agus a Sídon, do dhéantáoi na miorbhuile do rinneadh ionnaibhsi, is fada ó da dhéanaidís aithrighe, na suidhe a néadach roín agus a luaithreagh.
14 Ar a nadhbharsin budh socamhluighe do Thírus agus do Shídon ann sa bhreitheamhnus, na dháoibhsi.
15 Agus tusa, a Chapernáum, atá ar do thógbháil súas go neamh, teilgfidhthear siós go hifearnn thú.
16 Gibh bé éisdeas ribhsi is riomso éisdeas sé; agus gibh bé bheir neimhchion oruibhsi, is oramsa do bheir sé neimhchion; agus gibh bé bheir neimhchion oramsa is ar an té do chuir úadh mé do bheir sé neimhchion.
17 ¶ Agus do fhilleadar an deithneabhar agus trí fichid maille lé gáirdeachas, ag rádh, A Thighearna, ataíd na deamhuin féin fá smachd aguinne tréd ainmsi.
18 Agus a dubhairt sesion riu, Do chonnairc mé Sátan marr theinnteach ag tuitim ó neamh.
19 Fénch do bheirim dhíbh cumhachda saltairt air na haithreachaibh nimhe agus ar na scorpiónuibh, agus ar uile neart namhad: agus ní ghoirteochaid éin ní sibh.
20 Achd cheana na bíodh gáirdeachas oraibh, ar son go bhfuilid na spioraididhe fá bhur smachd; achd go madh mó bhiás gairdeachas oruibh fá go bhfuilid bhur nanmanna sgríobhtha ar neamh.
21 ¶ Ar a núairsion do ghabh gáirdeachas iona spioraid Iósa, agus a dubhairt sé, Do bheirim buidheachas duit a Athair, a Thighearna neimhe agus talmhan, trí gur fholuigh tú na neithesi ó dháonibh eagnuidhe agus glioca, agus gur nochd tú iad do naoidheanánuibh: a seadh, a Athair; tré gur ab mar sin do budh toil leachd féin é.
22 Atáid na huile neithe ar na dtabhairt dhanhsa óm Athair: agus ní bhfuil a fhios ag éinneach ciá hé an Mac, achd ag a Nathair; agus ciá hé an Tathair, achd ag an Mac, agus an té dá dtiúbhradh an Mac a nochdughadh.
23 ¶ Agus ar bhfilleadh chum a dheiscíobal, a dubhairt sé fá leith riú, is beannaighthe na súile do chí na neithe do chithísi:
24 Oír a deirim ribh, Gur ab iomdha fáighe agus righthe lér mhián na neithe do chithisi dfaicsin, agus ní fhacadar: agus na neithe do chluintí do chluinsin, agus ní chúaladar.
25 ¶ Agus féuch, déirigh fear dlighe áirighe na sheasamh, ag cur chathaighthe airsion, agus ag rádh, A Mhaighhisdir, créd do dhéana mé ionnus go bhfuighinn an bheatha mharthannach doighreachd ?
26 Achd a dubhairt seision ris, Créd a tá sgríobhtha ann sa dligheadh? Cionnas léaghas tú?
27 Agus ar bhfreagra dhósan a dubhairt sé, Gráidheochuidh tú do Thighearna Dia as do chroidhe uile, agus as tanam uile, agus as do bhríoghuibh uile, agus as da smúaintighthibh uile; agus do comharsa mar thu féin.
28 Agus a dubhairt seision ris, As díreach do fhreagair tú: déanasa so, agus mairfidh tú.
29 Achd ar mbeith dhósan, funnmhar ó a fhiréantachd féin da thaisbéanadh, a dubhairt sé re Híosa, Maseadh ciá hé mo chomharsa?
30 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé, Do chúaidh duine áirighe siós ó lérusalem go Iérico, agus tárla a measg bhiothamhnach é, do shlad e, agus do loit é, agus do imthigh rompa, ar na fhagbháil leathmharbh.
31 Agus tárla tré chinneamhain gur ghabh sagart áirighe síos sa tslighe sin: agus ar na fhaicsinsion dó, do ghabh sé thairis don táobh eile don tslighe.
32 Agus mar an gcéadna Lebhita, a teachd chum a nionaid sin, ar na fhaicsin dó, do ghábh sé tháiris don táobh eile.
33 Agus ar mbeith ag gabháil na sligheadh, do Shamaritánach áirighe, tháinic sé mar a raibh seision: agus ar na fhaicsin, do ghabh truáighe ghér dhó é
34 Agus ar ndrud ris, do cheangail sé a chneadha, ag dortadh ola agus fióna ionnta, agus ar na chuir air a ainmhidhe féin dó, rug sé leis go tigh ósda é, agus do ghabh sé cúram na thimcheall.
35 Agus ag imtheachd dó lá ar na mhárach, do bhean sé dhá phighinn amach agus tug sé don ósdóir iád, agus a dubhairt sé ris, Bíodh cúram agad fan fhearso; agus gibh bé chaithfeas tú as a chionn so, an tráth fhillfeadsa, do bhéara me dhuit é.
36 A nois cía don triúrsa, bhreathnaigheas tusa, do bheith na chomharsain ag an tí úd thárla a measg na mbiothamhnach?
37 Agus a dubhairt seísion, An tí ud do rinne trocaire air, Ar a nadhbhasin a dubhairt Iósa ris, Imthighsi agus déana mar an gcéadna.
38 ¶ Agus tárla, ag imtheachd dóibh, go ndeachaidh seision go baile áirighe: agus go rug bean áirighe dar bhaimn Martá dá tigh fein é.
39 Agus do bhí deirbhshiúr aicesi dá ngoirthí Muire, agus ar suidhe dhi ag cosaibh Iosa, do bhí si ag éisdeachd lé na bhríathraibh.
40 Agus do bhí Martá lán do chúram lé hiomad friotholuimh, agus a dubhairt sí, A Thighearna, an é nach meisde leachd mar dfág mo dheirbhshiúr misi am áonar ag friotholamb ar a nadhbharsin abair riá cungnamh riom.
41 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé ría, A Mhartá, a Mhartá, atá tú ro chúramach agus buaidhridh tú thú féin fá mhóran do neithibh:
42 Achd cheana ein ní a mhaín atá riachdanach: rug Muire an chuid mhaith do roghain, nach béarthar uáithe.

Shéol Crísd do bheith gnathach, seasmhach a nguidhe. 28 Agus gur coimhead bhriathar De, do ni deannuighthe, agus nach scáil chrábhoidh.
 
1 Agus tárla, an tan do bhí sé ag déanamh urnuighe a náit áirighe, mar do sguir sé, go ndubhairt fear áirighe dá dheisciobluibh ris, A Thighearna múin dúinne urnuighe do dhéanamh, amhail agus mar do mhúin Eóin dá dheisciobluibh féin.
2 Agus a dubhairt seision ríu, A núair do dhéantáoi urnuighe, abraidh, Ar nathair atá ar neamh, naomhthar hainin. Tigeadh do rioghachd. Déantar do thoil, ar an talamh, mar atá ar neamh.
3 Ar narán laétheamhuil tabhair dhúinn gach láoi.
4 Agus maith dhuinn ar bpeacaigh; óir maithmídne da gach áon air a bhfuil fiacha aguinn. Agus na leíg sinn a ccathughadh; achd soar inn ó olc.
5 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu cía agaibhsi agá mbíadh cara, agus go rachadh sé chuige a meadhon oidhche, agus go naibeóradh sé ris, A chara, tabhair trí haráin dhamh air iásachd;
6 Oír tháinic cara dhamh as a tslighe am ionnsuighe, agus ní bhfuil éinni again do chuirfinn na fhiadhnuisi?
7 Agus go bhfreigeóradh seision a sdigh, agus go naibeóradh sé, Na cuir búaidhreadh oram: atá an doras dúntí a nois, agus ataíd mo chlann am fhochair sa tseómra; ní fhéaduim éirghe agus a dtabhairt dhuit.
8 A deirim ribh, ar néirghe dhó, dá mbeith nach dtiobhradh sé sin úadh, ar son gur chara dhó é, gidheadh go fírinneach ar son a liosdachda do éiréochadh sé, agus do bhéaradh sé dhó an mhéid do bhiadh do riachdanus air.
9 Agus a deirimsi ribh, Iarraidh, agus do bhéarthar dháoibh; lorgairigh, agus do gheabhtháoi; buailidh an doras, agus oisgéoltar dháoibh.
10 Oír gidh bé iárras glacaidh sé; agus gidh bé do ní lorgaireachd do gheibh sé; agus oísgéoltar don té bhúaileas an doras.
11 Agus cía againbhsi athair ar a níarrfadh a mhac arán, do bhéaradh cloch dhó? Nó dhá niárradh sé iásg, do bhéaradh nathair nimhe a nionad éisg dhó?
12 Nó dá niárradh sé úgh, an dtiobhradh se scorpion do?
13 Ar a nadhbharsin, más eól dáoibhsi air mbeith go holc, tiodhluice maithe do thbhairt da bhur gcloinn, an é nach mó ná sin bhéaras bhur nathairse ó neamh an Spiorad Náomh don during íarrfas air é?
14 ¶ Agus do bhí sé ag teilgean deamhain amach, do bhí balbh. Agus tárla, ar ndul don deamhan amach, gur labhair an balbhán; agus do ghabh iongnadh an slúagh.
15 Agus a dubhairt dream acasan, Is trí Bheelsébub prionnsa na ndeamhan theilgeas sé amach na deamhuin.
16 Agus dream eile, ag cur chathaighthe air, do iárradar comhartha ó neamh air.
17 Agus ar bhfaicsin a smúaintighthe, dhósan, a dubhairt sé riú, Gach rioghachd bhios roinnte na haghaidh féin do nithear fasach dhi; agus an tigh bhíos roinnte naghaidh tíghe, tuitidh sé.
18 Agus mar an gcéada dá raibh Sátan roinnte na aghaidh féin, cionnas fhanfas a rioghachd na seasamh? oír a deirthísi gur ab trí Bheelsébúb theilgimsi amach na deamhain.
19 Agus más trí Bheelsebuh sgriosaimsi na deamhuin, cía tré sgriosaid bhur gelannsa iád? Ar a nadbhharsin héid siádsan na mbhreitheamhnaibh oraibhsi.
20 Ach cheanna más le méur Dé theilgimsi amach na deamhain, gan chunntabhairt tháinic ríoghachd De chuguibhsi.
21 An tan choimhéadas duine láidir armálta a chúirt féin, atá a bhfuil aige a siothchaín:
22 Achd an tráth thig duine is neartmhaire ná é, beiridh sé búaidh air, agus tóguidh sé leis a uile armaíl ann ar chuir sé a mhuinighinn, agus roinnidh sé a eadáil.
23 An té nach bhfuil leamsa atá sé am aghaidh: agus gidh bé nach ccruinnigheann leamsa scabuighidh sé.
24 An tráth imthigheas an spiorad neamhglann as duine ar bith, imthigh sé trí íonaduibh tiorma, ag iárruidh suáimhnis; agus an tráth nach bhfaghann sé sin, a deir sé, Fillfidh mé doin thigh féin ó dtáinic mé.
25 Agus ar dtachd dó, do gheibh sé ar na sgúabadh agus ar na dheaghmhaisioghadh é.
26 Imthighidh sé an sin, agus beiridh sé leis seachd spioraide eile is measa ná é fein; agus ar ndol a sdeach dhóibh, do níd comhnaidhe ann sin: agus is measa deireadh an duine sin ná a thosach.
27 ¶ Agus tárla, agá rádh so dhó, gur árduigh bean áirighe don tsluágh a gúth, agus go nduibhairt sí, As beannaighe an bhrionn do iomchuir thú, agus na cíocha do dhiughail tú.
28 Agus a dubhairt seision, Achd as beannaighe an dream eisdeas briáthar Dé, agus choimhéudus é.
29 ¶ Agus an tan do chruinnidh an sluágh go tiúgh chuige, do thionsgain sé a tádh. As olc an cineadh so: iárraidh sé comhartha; agus ní tiubharthar comhartha dhó, achd comhartha Iónas fáidh.
30 Oir ambail dó bhí Iónas na chomhartha do mhuinntir Niníve, as mar sin bhiás Mac an duine mar an gcéudna don chineadhso.
31 Eiréochuidh bainrióghan an aoibhe ó dheas a mbreitheamhnus maille ré dáoinibh an chinidhsí, agus daimneóchaidh si iád: oír tháinic sisí ó leithimlibh na talmhan déisdeachd ré heagna Sholaimh: agus, féuch, atá duine as mó ná Solamh ann so.
32 Eireóchaid luchd Niníve a mbreitheamhnus maille ris an gcineadhso, agus dainmeóchaid é: oír do rinneadarsan aithrighe ag seanmóir Iónas; agus, féuch, atá duine as mó ná Iónas ann so.
33 Ní lasann duine ar bith coinneall, chum a cur a bhfolach, nó faoi bhaiseúl, achd a gcoinnleóir, ionnus go bhfaichfidis an dream thig a sdeach an solus.
34 A sí an tsúil solus an chuirp: ar a nadhbharsin a núair bhias do shúil glan, biáidh do chorp uile soillseach; achd dá raibh do shúil go holc, biáidh do chorp mar an gcéadna dorcha.
35 Dá brígh sin tabhair haire riot nach biáidh an solus atá ionnad na dhorchadus.
36 Ar a nadhbharsin dá raibh, do chorp uile soillseach, gan éanchuid dhe dorcha, biáidh an tiomlán soillseach, amhail mar dheallruigheas coinneal thú ré na soillse.
37 ¶ Agus ar labhairt do, do chuir Phairisíneach airighe impédhe air a dhínnér do chaitheamh na fhochair: agus ár ndul a sdeach dhósan, do shuigh sé chum bídh.
38 Agus an tan do chonnairc an Phairísineach sin, dob iongnadh leis nár ionnail sé ar tús roimh dhínnér.
39 Agus a dubhairt an Tighearna rís, Go deimhin do ní sibhse a phairisineacha an táobh amuigh don chupan agus don mhéis glan; achd atá an táobh a sdigh dhíbh lán do shracaireachd agus dolc.
40 A dháoine gan chéill, a né nach é an tí do rinne an táobh a muigh do rinne an táobh a sdigh mar an gcéadna?
41 Ar a nadhbharsin tábhruidh deíre uáibh do na neithibh atá a láthair aguibh; agus, féuch, bíaidh na huile neitheghan díbh.
42 Achd is anáoibhinn dáoibh, a phairisíneach! do brígh go ngabhtháoi deachmhaidh an mhiontius agus na ruibhe agus na uile luibheann, achd gabhtháoithar bhreitheamhnus agus ghrádh Dé: do búdh cúir iád so do dhéamnamh, agus gan iád súd do leígeann gan déanamh.
43 As anáoibhinn dáoibh, a phoirisneacha! Oír as ionmhuin libh an céud ionad suidhe ann sna sionagogaibh, agus fáilteadha ar na máruidhibh.
44 As anáoibhinn dáoibh, a sgriobuidhe agus a phairisíneacha, a lachd a nfúarchrábhaidh! oír atátháoi marthuámuidhibh nách bhfaicthear, agus nách aithne do na dáoimbh shiubhlus orrtha.
45 Agus ar bhfreagra do dhuine áirighe don luched dlighe, a deir sé rís, A Mhaighisdir, agá rádh so dhuit do bhéir tú masa dhuinne fós.
46 Achd a dubhairt seision, As anáoibhinn dáoibhsi leis, a luchd dlighe! oír curtháoi úaluidhe dóiomchur ar na dáoinibh, agus ní bheantháoi féin ris na húaladhaibh lé háon da bhur méuraibh.
47 As anáoibhinn daiobh! oír tógtháoi túamuidhe na bhfáidheadh, agus a siád bhur naithreacha do mharbh iád.
48 Go deimhin do níthi fiádhnuisi go moltáoi gniómhartha bhur naithreach: oír do mharbhadarsan iád, agus do níthíse tuamuidhe dhóibh.
49 Ar a nadhbharso a dubhairt eagna Dé, Cuirfe mé fáidhe agus absdail chuca, agus muirfid siád agus géarleanfuid cuid diobh:
50 Do chum go leanfuidhe ar an gcinneadhsa, fuil na bhfáidheadh uile, do dóirteadh ó thús an domhain;
51 O fhuil Abéil go fuil Shacharías, do marbhadh éidir a naltóir agus an teampoll: go firinneach a deirim ribh, go leanfuighear é ar an gcineadhso.
52 As anáoibhinn dáoibh, a luchd dlighe! oír rugabhair libh eochair a néolais, ní dheachabhair féin a sdeach, agus do thoirmisgeabhair an dream do bhí ag dul a sdeach.
53 Agus a nnáir dubhairt sé na neithese riú, do thionnsgnadar na sgriobuidhe agus na Phairisínigh consbóid ghéar do dhéanamh ris, agus a thabhairt air labhairt ar mhórán do neithibih:
54 Ag luigheachan air, agus ag iárraidh neither éigin do ghreamughadh as a bhéul, ann a naigeóraidis é.

4 Agus a deirim ribhse a chairde, Ná biodh eagla muinntire oraibh mhárbhus an corp, agus na dhiáigh sin leis nach éidir ní sa mhó do dhéanamh.
5 Achd foillséochaidh mé dháoibh cía ré a mbia bhur neagla: Bíodh eagla an ti úd oraibh, agá bhfuil cumhachda tair éis duine a mharbhadh a theilgean go hifrionn; a seadh, a deirim ribh, Biodh eagla so oraibh.
6 A né nach cceannaghthear cúig gnealbhain ar dhá fheórling, agus ni bhfuil áon aca ar dearmad a bhfiádhnuise Dé?
7 Achd fós atá gruág bhar gcinnse uile ar na comhaíreamh. Ar a nadhbharsin na bíodh eagla oráibh: as fearr sibhse ná morán gealbhan.
8 Agus fós a deirim ribh, Gidh bé ar bith aidmheóchus misi a bhfiádhnuise na ndáoine, aidmheóchaidh Mac an duine mar an gcéadna eisean a bhfiadhnari aingeal Dé:

13 ¶ Agus a dubhairt óglach áirighe don tslúagh ris, A Mhaighisdír, abair rem dhearbhrathair, a noighreachd do rionn rium.
14 Agus a dubhairt séision ris, A dhuine, cia chur misi ós bhur gcionn am bhreitheamh nó am rannadóir?
15 Agus a dubhairt sé riú, Feachaidh, agus seachnuidh sibh ar a tsaint: oír ní a níomarcuigh an tsaídhbhris atá ag duine air bith atá a bheatha.
16 Agus a dubhairt sé cosamblachd riú, ag rádh, Tug fearann dhuine sháidhbhir áirighe toradh mór:
17 Agus do smuáin sé ann féin, ag radh, Créd do dhéana mé, oir ní bhfuil áit agam ann a gcruinneocha me mo thórthuighe?
18 Agus a dubhairt sé, Do dhéana mé so: leaghfaidh mé mo sgiobóil, agus toigeabhuidh mé sgionóil bhus mó ná íad; agus cruimnéochaidh mé mo thórtha nile agus mo mháoin ionnta.
19 Agus a deara mé réim anam fein, A anaim, ata mórán máoine agad ar na gcur a dtaisge fa chomchair mhórán bliadhan; fan ad chomhnuidhe, ith, ibh, bí go súgach.
20 Agus a dubhairt Diá ris, A amadáin, a nochd féin iárfaid said hanam ort: agus cia bhus leis na neithe so, do sholáthair tú?
21 Is mar sin atá an té chrunnigheas ionnmhas dó féin, agus nach bhfuil sáidhbhir a Niliá.
22 ¶ Agus a dubhairt sé ré na dheisciobhluibh, Uime so a deirim ribhsi, Ná bidhidh, ro chúramach tá bhur gcorp, créd é an ní íosdáoi umuibh.
23 As mó an tanam ná an biádh, agus an corp ná an téadach.

27 Tabhraidh dá bhur naire na lilidhe ciondus fhásaid said: ní dhéanuid said sáothar, agus ní shníomhuid said; achd a deirim ribh, nach raibh Solamh féin ann a ghlóir uile ar na éadughadh mar áon díobh so.
28 Agus má éaduigheann Diá már sin an fér, atá a niu ar an machaire, agus chuithear a márach ann sa núamhaifh; a né nach mó ná sin do dhéana sé dhibhse, a luchd an chreidimh bhig?

30 Oír a said na neithesi uile iárraid cinidheacha an domhain: achd atá a fhios ag bhur Nathairse go bhfuil a ríachdanas so oraibh.
31 Achd cheanna Iárruidhsi rioghachd Dé; agus teilgfidhthear na neithesi uile chuguibh.
32 Ná bíodh eagla ort, a thréd bheag; oir a si toil bhur Nathar an rioghachd do thabhairt dáoibh.
33 ¶ Réacaidh a bhfuil aguibh, agus tabhruidh déire úaibh; déannidh sparáin dhibh féin nach rachta a narsaidheachd, cisde ar nach racha caitheamh ar neamh, a náith nach dtig gaduidhe a ngar dhó, agus nach dtruáilligheann an míol críon.

37 Is beannaighe na searbhfhoghantaidhe úd, do gheibh an tighearna ag déanamh faire an tan do thig sé: a deirim ribh go fírinneach, go gccangalfuigh sé é féin timchioll, agus go gcuirfidh sé iádsan na suidhe chum bidh, agus ar dteachd amach dhó go ndéanuidh sé fríothólamh dhóibh.
38 Agus má thig sé sa dara faire, agus má thig sé sa treas faire, agus go bhfuighe só mar sin iád, is beannaighe na scarbhfhoghantuighe sin.
39 Achd biodh a dheimhin só aguibh, dá mbeith a fhios ag fear an tighe cía a núair a dtiocfadh an gaduighe, go ndéanadh sé faire, agus nach bhfuilcóngadh sé a thigh féin do thollodh thríd.
40 Agus ar a nadhbharsin fós bithisi ullamh: oír is a núair nach saoiltí thiocfus Mac an duine.
41 ¶ Agus a dubhairt Peadar ris, A Thighearna, an linne a deir tú an chosamhlachd so, nó fós ré cach uíle?
42 Agus a dubhairt an Tighearna, Cía atá na fheadhmannach fhírinneach ghlic, chuirfeas a thighearna ós cionn a mhuinntie féin, ionnus go dtiobhradh sé a miosúr bidh dhóibh na am fein?
43 Is beannaighe an searbhfhoghantuidhe úd, agá bhfuighe a thighearna an tan thiocfus sé dhá dhéanamh mar sin.
44 Go fírinneach a deirim ribh, Go gcuirfe sé ós cionn a bhfuill aige é.
45 Achd má deir an seanbhfhoghantuighe úd ann a chroidhe féin, Cuirfidh mo thighearna a theachd a ríghneas; agus go dtionnsgónuidh sé gabháil ar na buáchailidh agus ná cailinidh, agus bheith ag ithe agus ag ól, agus ar meisge;
46 Tiocfa tighearna an tsearbhfhoghantuighe úd sa lá nach saoileann sé é, agus ann sa núair nach bhfuil a fhios aige, agus dealóchaidh sé úaidh é, agus do bhéara sé a chuid dhó a bhfochair na ndaoine gan chreideamh.
47 Achd an searbhfhoghantnidhe úd, agá raibh fios tola a thighearna féin, agus nar ullmhuidh é féin, agus nach dearna do réir a thola, géubhthar mórán air.
48 Achd an tí úd ag nach raibh a fhios, agus fós do rinne na neithe do thuill buillidhe, buáilfabhear beagán air. Oír gidh bé dár tugadh morán, iárrfuidhthear morán a dtaisge, iarrfuidhthear ni sa mhó air.

20 Agus a dubhairt fear eile,Do phós mé bean, ar a nadhbhairsin ní fhéaduim theachd.

8 Achd a né nach aibéora sé ris, Ullmhuigh an ní íosas mé ar mo shuiper, agus cuir do chrios thort, agus fritheóil damhsa, no go nithe mé agus go nibhe mé; agus tar éisi sin ithsi agus ibh?
9 An mbía buidheachas aige ar a tsearbhfhoghantuidhe úd do bhrigh go ndearna sé na neithe do haithneadh dhe? Ní shaóilim gormbía.
10 Augs is mar sin dáoibhsi, an tan do dhéantaói gach uile ní dár haithniughadh dhíbh, abruidh, Is searbhfhoghantuidhe neamhtharbhacha sinn: óir do rinneamar an ni do bhi dfíachaibh oruinn do dhéanamh.
11 ¶ Agus tárla, ag dul súas dó go Hierúsalém, gur ghabh sé sé tré lár na Samária agus na Galilé.
12 Agus an tráth do chuáidh sé a sdeach go baile áirighe, tárladar deithneabhar fir lóbhar air, do sheas a bhfad úadh:
13 Agus do árduigheadar a nguth, ag rádh, A Iósa, a Mhaighisdir, déana trócaire oruinn.
14 Agus an tan do chunnairc sé íad, a dubhairt sé riu, Imthighidh foillsighidh sibh féin do na sagartuibh. Agus tárla, ag imtheachd doibhsion, gur glanadh íad.
15 Achd fear aca, mar do chuinnairc sé é féin ar na shlánughadh, dfill sé air, ag moladh Dé do ghuth mhór,
16 Agus do thuit sé ar a aghuidh agá chosaibhsean, ag breith bhuidheachais ris: agus budh Samaritánach an fearso.
17 Agus ar bhfreagra Diósa a dubhairt sé, A né nach bhfuilid deithneabhar ar na nglanadh? agus a náonbhar cáit a bhfuilid?
18 Níor frith ag filleadh do thabhairt gloíre do Dhía, achd an coigcrigheachso.
19 Agus a dubhairt sé ris, Eirigh, imthigh romhad: do shlánuigh do chreideamh thú.
20 ¶ Agus an tan dfiafruigh na Phairisinigh dhe, Cía an tráth thiocfadh riogháchd Dé, do fhreagair sé iád agus a dubhairt sé, Ní thiocfa rioghachd Dé récoimhéd.
21 Agus ní aibheóruid said, Féuch ann so! nó, féuch ann súd! oír, féuch, atá ríoghachd Dé aguibh an bhus measg.
22 ¶ Agus a dubhairt sé ré na dheisciobluibh, Tiocfuidh a naimsir, an a mbia míangus oruibh áon do laéthibh Mhic an duine dfaicsin, agus ní fhaicfithí.
23 Agus a déarúid said ribh, Féuch ann so; nó, féuch ann so: achd ná himthigh, agus na leanuidh iád.
24 Oír amhuil agus mar dheallruigheas an tinnteach, shoillsigheas ó náird go chéile fáoi neamh, is mar sín bhiás Mac an duine mart an gcéndna ann a lá féin.
25 Achd is éigin dó ar tús mórán dfulang, agus a dhiultadh ón chineadhsa.
26 Agus mar do tharla a laéthibh Náoi, is mar sin fós bhiás a laéthibh Mhic an duine.
27 Do bhádar ag ithe, ag ibhe, ag posadh, agus ag tabhairt chum posda, gus an lá ann a ndeachaidh Náoi do náirc, agus táinic an dile, agus do sgris sí iád uile.
28 Agus ar a nós gcéadna mar tharla a laéthibh Lot; do bhádar ag ithe, ag ibhe, ag ceannach, ag reic, ag plantugheadh, ag tógbhail tighthe;
29 Achd an lá ann a ndeachaidh Lot amach as Sodom do fearadh teine agus ruibh ó neamh, agus do sgrios sé iúd uile.
30 Is da réir so bhias ar an lá ann a bhfoillseochthar Mac an duine.
31 Ann sa lá sin, an té bhiás a tigh, agus a mháoin ann sa tighsin, ná tuirlingeadh sé chum a dtógbhála: agus an tí atá ar an machaire, na casadh sé tar a ais mar an gcéadna.
32 Cuimhnighe ar mhnáoi Lot.
33 Gidh bé neach iárrfas a anam féin do shabháil caillfidh sé é; agus gidh bé chaillfeasa anam beodhfuidh sé é.
34 A deirim ribh, béid diás a náoinleabaigh ann sa noidhche úd; geubhthar lé háon aca, agus fúighfighthear an fear eile.
35 Beid diás ban ag bróinteórachd a náoinfheachd; géubhthar lé mnáoi aca, agus fuigfighthear an dara bhean.
36 Beid diás fear ar an machaire; géubhthar lé háon aca, agus fuigfighthear an fear eile.
37 Agus ar bhfreaga dhóibhsion a deirid ris, Gá háit, a Thighearna? Agus a dubhairt seision riú, Gidh bé ball a mbíu an corp, is ann sin fós chruinneochthar na hiolair.
 
Caibidil 18
 
Fúair an bhaintreabhach a gnodhuighe le iarratus dhúthruchtach, 9 agus an Puibliocanach le urnuighe uirisiol.
 
Agus a dubhairt sé fós cosamhlachd riú, gur ab éigin urnuighthe dhéanamh do ghnáth, agus gan a bheith leisgeamhuil.
2 Ag rádh, Do bhí breitheamh áirighe a gcathraigh áirghe, air nach raibh eagla Dé, agus ag nach raibh onoír do dhuine:
3 Agus do bhí baintreabhach áirighe ann sa chathruighsin noch tháinic chuige, ag rádh, Cóirigh mé air measgcaruid.
4 Agus niór bháill leision ar feadh tamuill: achd tar éis sin a dubhairt sé ris féin, Ce nach bhfuil eagla Dé oram, agus nach bhfuil onóir agam do dhuine;
5 Gidheadh do bhrígh go mbuaidhreann an bhaintreabhachsa mé dioghóla mé í, do chum nach dtiocfadh sé fá dheireadh dom bhuaidhreadh.
6 Agus a dubhairt an Tighearna, Eisdidh créd a deir breitheamh na héagcora.
7 A né nach déana Diá dioghaltas ar son a dháoine toghtha féin, éimhgheas air do lá agus doidhche, ge atá foighid aige na ttimcheall?
8 A deirim ribh go ndéana sé dioghaltas ar a son go lúath. Achd cheanna an tan thiocfas Mac an duine, an bhfuighe sé creideamh ar an dtalamh?
9 ¶ Agus fós ré dreim do sháoil iád féin bheith na bhfiréain, agus do tharcasinigh cách eile, a dubhairt sé an chosamhlachdsa:
10 Do chúadár días do dháoinibh súas don teampall do dhéanamh urnuighe; áon aca na Phairisíneach, agus araile na phúibliocánach.
11 Ar seasamh don Phairisíneach do bhí sé guidhe mar so leis féin, A Dhiá, beirim buidheachas riot, nach bhfuilim mar atáid dáoine eile, a luchd fuáduigh, éugcórach, adhaltrannach, nó fós mar an bpuibliocánachsa.
12 Troisgim fá dhó ann sa tseachdmhuin, do bheirim deachmhuidh as gach ní dhá sealbhuighim.
13 Agus ar seasamh don phuíbliocán, a bhfád úadh, nior bháill leis fiú a shúl do thogháil suás chum neimhe, achd do bhuaileadh sé a uchd, ag rádh, A Dhía déana trócaire oramsa an peachthacht.
14 A deirim ribh, go dtáinic an tési a núas dá thigh féin na fhiréanach ni is mó na fear úd: óir gidh bé ísligheas é féin áirdeochthar é.
15 ¶ Agus fós tugadar chuige náoidheanain, ionnus go mbeanfadh sé ríu; agus an tan do chuncadar na deísciobuil so, do imdheargadar íad.
16 Achd ar ngairm na leanabh Díosa chuige, a dubhairt sé, Fuilngidh na leinbh do theachd chugamsa, agus ná toirmeasguidh íad: óir is lé na leitheid so rioghachd Dé.
17 A deirim ribh go fírinneach, Gidh bé nach géubha chuige rioghachd Dé mar náoidheanán nach racha sé go bráth a sdeach innte.
18 ¶ Agus a dfafruigh úachdarán áirighe dhe, ag rádh, A Mhaighisdir mhaith, créd do dhéana mé lé a sealbhócha mé an bheatha mharthanach?
19 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris, Créd fá ngoireann tú máith dhiomsa? ní bhfuil éinnrach maith, achd Día, amaháin.
20 Atá éolos na naitheantadh agad, Ná déana adhaltranas, Ná déana dunmharbhadh, Na déana goid, Ná déana fiadhnuisi bhréige, Onóiruigh hathair agus do mhathair.
21 Agus a dubhairt seision, Do choimhéid mé na neithesi uile óm óige.
22 Agus ar na cclos so Díosa, a dubhairt sé ris, Atá éinni fós duireasbhuidh ort: reac a bhfuil agad, agus roinn ar na bochduibh, agus bíaidh cisde ar neamh agad: agus tárr, lean misi.
23 Agus ar na chloinnsin so dhósan, do ghlac tuirse mhór é: óir do bhí sé roshaidhbhir.
24 ¶ Agus an tan do chunnairc Iósa go ráibh sé lán do dhobrón, a dubhairt sé, Créd é a dheacrachd do na dáoinibh sáidhbhre dul a sdeach a rioghachd Dé!
25 Oír is usa camhall do dhul tri chró snáthuide ná do dhuine shaidhbhir dul a sdeach a rioghachd Dé.
26 Agus a dubhrádar an dream do chúalaidh so, Máseadh cía as éidir do shlánughadh?
27 Achd a dubhairt seision, Na neithe ata dó dhéanta ag na dáoinibh atáid so dhéanta ag Dia.
28 ¶Agus a dubhairt Peadar, Féuch, do fhágamairne na huile neithe, agus do leanamair thusa.
29 Agus a dubhairt seision riú. A deirimsi ribh go firinneach, Nach bhfuil éinneach do fhág a thigh, ná á athair ná a mhathtair, ná a dhearbhraithreacha, ná a bhean phósda, ná a chlann, ar son rioghachda Dé.
30 Nach nglacfa sé mórán ní sa mhó ann sa naimsirso, agus an bheatha mharthanach an sa tsáoghal atá ag teachd.
31 ¶ Agus ar mbreith an dá fhear déag leis Diósa, a dubhairt sé riu, Féuch, téaghmáoid súas go Hiárusalem, agus críochnóchthar a dtimcheall Mhic an duine na huile neithe atá sgriobhtha ag na fáighibh.
32 Oír do bhéarthar do na Cineadhachaibh é, agus do dhéuntar fonnomhad faoi, agus maisleóchthar é, agus géubhthar do shelighibh air:
33 Agus ar na sgiúrsadh dhóibh muifid achd éireóchaidh sé a ris an treas lá.
34 Agus niór thuigeadarsan éin ní dhíobh so: agus do bhádar na briáthrasa foluighthe uátha, agus níor aithnigheadar na neithe a dubhradh ann.
35 ¶ Agus tárla, an tan do dhrnid sé ré Ierico, gur shuidh dall áirighe chois na sligheadh ag iarruidh déirce:
36 Agus an tan do chúaluidh sé an slúagh ag gabháil thairis, dfiafruidh sé créd é so.
37 Agus dinniseadar dhó, gur ab é Iósa Nasardha do bhí gabháil thairis.
38 Agus do éigh seision ag rádh, A Iósa, a mhic Daibhi dénna trócaire oram.
39 Agus an dream do bhí roimhe do imdheargadar é, ionnus go mbíadh se na thochd: achd is moide do éighmheadh seision sin, A mhic Dáibhi, déana trócaire oram.
40 Agus ar seasamh Díosa, do aithim sé a thabhairt chuige: agus an tan do dhruid sé ris, dfiafruidh sé dhe,
41 Ag rádh, Créd is mián leachd misi do dhéana dhuit? Agus a dubhairt seision, A Thighearna, mo radharc aiseag dhamh.
42 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris, Bíodh do radharc agad: do shlánuigh do chreideamh thú.
43 Agus do fúair sé a radharc ar an mball, agus do lean sé eisean, ag tabhairt glóire do Dhiá: agus an tan do chunnaire an pobal uile so, tugadar moladh do Dhía.

Díthchoill Shachéus ar Criosd dfhaicsin, 45 agus Críosd ag iomáin luchd an mhio-mhodh as an teampaill.
 
1 Agus ar ndol a sdeach go Iérico Diosa do ghabh sé thríthe.
2 Agus, féuch, do bhí duine áirighe ann dár bhainm Sachéus, do bhi na úachdarán air na publiocáin, agus do bhí sé saidhbhir.
3 Agus do bhí fonn air fhaicsin cia hé Iósa; agus níor bhéidir ris ón tslúagh, tré go raibh sér ísiol do phearsainn.
4 Agus ag rith roimhe dhó, do chuáidh sé súas a gcrann sicamor ionnus go bhfaicfeadh sé é: óir do bhi fáoi an tslighsin do ghabháil.
5 Agus an tan tháinic Iósa chum na háitesin, ar bhféachain súas dó, chúnnairc sé eision, agus a dubhairt sé ris, A Shachéus, tuirrling go deifreach; óir is ad thigh is éigin damhsa comhnuidhe dhéanamh a niu.
6 Agus ag deifriúghadh dhósan, do thuirrling sé, agus do ghabh sé chuige é go luáthgháireach.
7 Agus an tan do chunncadar cách uile so, do rinniodar munbhar, ag rádh, Go ndeáchaigh sé a sdeach air áoidheachd dionnsuighe peacthaich.
8 Agus ag seasamh do Shachéus, a dubhairt sé ris an Tighearna; Féuch, a Thighearna, do bheirim leath mo mháoine do na bochdaibh; agus má mbeall mé duine air bith a néinní, do bheirim dhó a cheithre oirid.
9 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris, A niugh thárla sláinte don tighsi, do bhrígh do bhfuil seisean fós na mhac ag Abraham.
10 Oír tháinic Mac an duine diárruidh agus do shlánughadh an ní do chúaidh a mugha.

12 Ar a nadhbharsin a dubhairt se, Do chúaidh duine uasal áirighe a régión imchían do ghabháil rioghachda dhó féin, agus dfilleadh air a ais.
13 Agus ar ngairm a dhéichneabhar searbhfhoghantuighe dhó, tug sé deich bpunta dhóibh, agus a dubahirt sé riú, Déunuidh gnothuigh nó go dtig mé.
14 Achd do bhí fúath ag luchd a chaithreach dhó, agus do chuireadar teachdaireachd na dhiáigh, ag rádh, Ní hail linn é so do ríoghadh oruinn.
15 Agus tárla, an tan do fhill sé, ar ngabháil na rioghachda chuige, gur nithin sé na searbhfhoghantaighe úd da dtug sé an tairgead, do ghairm chuige, ionnus go mbiadh a fhios aige créud do ghnodhuigh gách áon aca.
16 Agus táinic án céadduine, ag rádh A thighearna, do ghnodhuigh do phiosa deich bpiosa.
17 Agus a dubhaiort seision ris, Is maith sin, a shearbhfhoghantuighe mhait: óir do bhí tú firinneach ar bheagán, bíodh cumhachda agad ar dheich gcaithreachaibh.
18 Agus táinic an dara fear, ag rádh, A thighearna, do rinne do phíosa cúig piosa.
19 Agus a dubhairt ris an tesi, Bisi mar an gcéadna ós cionn cuig gcaithreach.
20 Agus táinic fear eile chuige, ag rádh, A thighearna, féuch, do phiosa do bhí agamsa a ttaisgidh a naipcin:
21 Oír do bhi heaglasa oram, tré gnr duine foghruáma thú: tógbhuidh tú súas an ui nár chuir tú siós, agus beanuidh tí an ní nar shiólchuir tú.

23 Ar a nadhbharsin créd fá nar chuir tusa mo chuid airgid ann sa mbane, agus ar dteachd damhsa do thóigeubhuinn é maille lé biseach?
24 Agus a dubhairt sé ris an muinntir do bhi na seasamh, Tóguidh úadh an piósa, agus tabhruidh don té úd agá bhfuilid na deich bpiósa é.
25 (Agus a dubhradarsan ris, A thighearna, atáid deich bpiosa aige.)
26 Oír a deirin ribh, Gur ab do gach áon agá bhfuil do bhéarthar; agus an té ag nach bhfuil, beanfuighear dhe fós an ní atá aige.
27 Tabhruidh libh ann so, na naimhde úd agamsa, le nar bháill misi do rioghagh ós a gceann, agus marbhaidh am fiadhnuisi iad.
28 ¶ Agus ar na rádh so, do chúaidh sé rompa, ag dul súas go Hiarasaleim.
29 Agus tárla, an tan do dhruid sé lé Betpháge agus ré Betánia, láimh ris a tsliabh da ngoirthear slíabh na Noluidhe, gur chuir sé dias da dheisciobluibh úadh,
30 Ag rádh, Imthighidh don bhaile atá as bhur gcomhair; ar ndul a sdeach ann dáoibh do gheabhtháoi searrach ceangailte, ar na shuidh áon nduine riamh: sgáoilidh, agus tabhruidh libh é.
31 Agus dá bhfiafruidhe éin neach dhibh, Créd fa sgáoiltí é? is mar so a déartháoi ris, Ar son go bhfuil féidhm ag an Tighearna air.

38 Ag rádh, Is beannaighe an Rí thig a nainm an Tighearna: sióthcháin ar neamh, agus glóir an sna bárduibh.
39 Agus a dubhradar Phairisinigh áirighe do tslúagh ris, A Maighisdir, tabhuir achmhusán dod dhéiscioblaibh.
40 Agus ar bhfreagra dhósan a dubhairt sé riu, A deirim ribh, má thochduid so, go néighfid na clocha féin.
41 ¶ Agus mar do dhruid sé a radharc na caithreach, do ghuil se air a son,
42 Ag rádh, O dá naitheantá, ann sa lá agad féin fós, na neithe bheanas réd shiothcháin! achd atáid síad a nois foluighthe ód shúilibh.
43 Oír tiocfuid láethe ort, ann a dteilgfid do naimhde diog ad thimcheall, agus iona dtimchiollfaid, agus iona gcuibhreochaid thú gach éantáobh.
44 Agus do dhéanuid comhchothrom ris an dtalamh thú, agus do chlann ionnad a stigh; agus ní fhúigfid cloch ar miuin cloiche ionnad; tré nar aithin tú aimsear thfiosruighthe.
45 ¶ Agus ar ndol a sdeach don teampall dhó, do thionnsgain sé an dream do bhi ag reic, do thionnsgain cé an dream do bhi ag reic agus ag ceannach ann, do chur amach;
46 Ag rádh ríu, Atá sgriobhtha, Mo thighse is tigh urnuighe é; achd cheana do rinneabhairsi tuimighthe bhiothamhnach dhe.

2 Agus do labhradar ris, ag rádh, Innis dúinne, cia an tughdarrás as a ndéanann tú na neithesi? Nó cia thug an tughdarrás so dhuit?
3 Agus ar bhfreagra Díosa a dubhairt sé ríu, Fiafrochaidh misi fós aonfhocal amháin dibhse; agus tabhruidh freagra oram:
4 Baisdeadh Eóin, ann ó neamh do bhi se, nó ó dháoinibh?
5 Agus do bhádarsan ag tagra eatarra féin, ag rádh, Má dermíd, O neamh; déara seisean, Créd fá nar chreideabhairsi dhó?
6 Achd má deirmid, O dháoinibh; géubhuidh an pobal uile do chlochaibh orainn: oír is deimhin léo gur fáigh Eóin.

8 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ríu, Ní mó innéosas misi dhíbhsi cía an túghdarrás as a ndéunuim na neithesi.
9 Agus do thionnsgain sé an chosamhlachdsa do rádh ris an bpobal; Do chuir duine áirighe fíneamhuin, agus tug sé amach do sgológuibh í, agus do bhi sé féin a gcoigcrích air feadh aimsire faide.
10 Agus na am féin do chuir sé a shearbhfhoghantuighe chum na sgológ, ionnus go dtiobhraidis ní do thoradh na fíneamhna dhó: achd do ghabhadar na sgológa air, agus do chuireadar folamh uátha é.

12 Agus na cheann sin do chuir sé an treas úadh: achd do chuireadarsan amach an tésin leis, ar na lot.
13 Achd a dubhairt tighearna na fíneamhna, Cred do dhéana mé? cuirfidh mé mó mhac grádhach féin chuca: do béidir an tan do chifid é go dtiobhraidís onóir dhó.
14 Agus ar na fhaicsin do na sgológuibh, do labhradar eatarra féin, ag rádh, A sé so an toighre, tigidh, marbham é, ionnus go mbíadh a noighreachd aguinn féin.
15 Agus ar na theilgean don táobh amach don fhíneamhain, do mharbhadar é. Ar a nadhbharsin créd do dhéanas tlghearna na fíneamhna riú súd?
16 Tiocfuidh sé agus sgriosfuidh sé na sgológa úd, agus do bhéura sé an fhíneamhuin do dháoinibh eile. Agus an tan do chúaladarsan so, a dubhradar, Nár liege Día sin.
17 Achd ar bhféachain dósan órrtha, a dubhairt sé: Máseadh créd é an ní so atá sgriobhtha, An chloch do dhiultadar na sáoir is di so do rinneadh ceann an chuáinne?
18 Gidh bé duine thuitfeas ar an gcloich úd, do dhéantar greamanna dhe; agus gidh bé duine ar a dtuitfidh sí, do dhéana sí luaithreadh dhe.
19 Agus díarradar úachdaráin na sagart agus na sgriobuidhe láinha do chur annsan air a núair sin féin; achd do bhi eagla an phobuil orrtha: óir do aithneadar gur ab na naghuidh fein a dubhairt sé an chosamblachdso.
20 Agus ag tabhairt aire ris, do chuireadar luchd bratha, do léigfeadh orrtha féin a bheith na bhfiréin, ionnus go ngreameóchaidis air a chomhrádh, do chum a thabhartha do chumhachd agus dughdarrás a nuáchdaráin.
21 Agus dfíafraigheadar dhe, ag rádh, á Mhaighisdir, atá a fhios againne gur ceart labhras tú agus theagaisgeas tú, agus nach bhfuil cion agad ar phearsain áonduine, achd go dteagasgann tú slighe Dé do réir na fírinne:
22 An ceaduightheach dhúinne cíos do thábhairt do Shéasar, nó gan a thabhairt?
23 Achd tug seisean a meabhail dá aire, agus a dubhairt sé riú, Créd fá gcurtháoi cathughadh oram?
24 Taisbéanaigh dhamh pighinn. Cia ar leis a níomháigh agus an sgríbhinn atá uirthe? Agus ar bhfreagra dhoibhsion a dubhradar, Lé Séasar,

27 Agus ar dteachd do dhruing do na Saduceachiabh chuige, (noch shéanas a neiséirghe do bheith ann;) dfíafruigheadar dhe,
28 Ag rádh, A Mhaighisdir, do sgríobh Máoisi dhúinn, Dá bhfaghadh dearbhráthar dhúine ar bith bás, agá mbía bean phósda, agus go bhfuigheadh sé bás gan chloinn, go ngéubhadh a dhearbhráthair chuige a bhean, agus go tóigéubhadh se sliochd dá dhearbhrathair.
29 Ar a nadhbharsin do bhádar móirsheisior dearbhrathar ann: agus ar ngabháil mná chuige don chédghear, fúair sé bás gan chloinn.
30 Agus do ghabh an dara dearbhrathair chuige an bhean, agus fuair seision leis bás gan chloinn.
31 Agus do ghabh an treas dearbhráthair chuige í; agas mar an gcéadna an móirsheisior: agus nier fhágbhadar clann, agus fúaradar bás.
32 Agus a ndiaigh cháich aile fúair an bhean bás mar an gcéadna.
33 Ar a nadhbharsin an sa neiséirghe cía aca súd dá madh bean í? óir do bhi si ag an mhóirsheisior na mnaoi.
34 Agus ag freagra a dubhairt Iósa ríu, Pósaid clann an tsáoghailsi mná, agus do bheirthear dfearuibh íad:
35 Achd cheana an dream mheasfuidhthear gur fiú íad an sáoghal úd, agus eiséirghe ó na marbhuibh dfagháil, ni phósaid mná, agus ní thugthar dfearuibh íad:
36 Oír ní héidir léo bás dtagháil ní sa mhó: Oír atáid síad mar na haingle; agus na gcloinn ag Día, ar mbeith na gcloinn ag a neiséirghe.
37 Achd go néiréochadh na mairbh, dfoillsigh Máoise lcis ag an dos, an tan do ghoireas sé don Tighearna Día Abraham, agus Día Isaac, agus Día Iácob.
38 Oír ní hé Día na marbh é, achd na mbéo: óir atáid síad uile na mbeathaigh dhósan.
39 Agus ar bhfreagra do dhruing do na sgríobuidhibh a dubhradar, A Mhaighisdir, is maith a dubhairt tú sin.
40 Agus níor lamhadar ó sin súas ní ar bith fhíafruighe dhe.
41 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Cionnas a déirid síad gur mac do Dháibhi Criosd?
42 Agus a deir Dáibhi féin a leabhar na Salm, A dubhairt an TIGHEARNA rém Thighearnasa, Suidh ar mo láimh dheis,
43 No go gcuire mé do námhuid na sdól fád chosaibh?
44 Ar a nadhbharsin goiridh Dáibhi Tighearna dhe, agus cíonnas is mac dhó é?
45 Agus a néisdeachd an phobuil nile a dubhairt sé ré na dheisciobluibh féin,
46 Tabhruidh aire dháoibh féin ó na sgríobuidhibh, le nab aill siobhal a róhuidhibh fada, agus lé nab ionmhuin failtighe ar na marguidhibh, agus na cédionuid suighthe ann sna coimhthionóluibh, agus na céadchuibhrinn ann sna féasduidhibh;
47 Noch shluigeas tighthe na mbaintreabhach, agus sin fós ar sgáth bheith go fada ag urnuighe: do gheabhuid so an dainnadh is truime.

21…luchd bhías ann a lar, imthigheadh said aisde; agus an dream bhías ar na machairidhibh ná héirgheadh síad a sdeach innte.
22 Oír a said so láeithe an dioghaltuis, ionnus go gcoimhlionfuidhthe na huile neithe atá sgríobhtha.
23 Agus budh trúagh do ná mnáibh bhías torrach, agus ag oileamhuinn ann sna láethibh úd! oír bíaidh riachdanas romhór ann sa dúithche, agus fearg ris an bpobalsa.
24 Agus tuitfid lé faobhar an chloidhimh, agus béarthar a mbraighdeanas íad chum na nuile chinidheach: agus bhíadh Iarúsalém ar na saltairt fáoi a Cineadhachaibh, nó go gcoimhlíontar aimsearacha na Geinidheach.
25 ¶ Agus béid comharthuighe ann sa ngréin, agus ann sa ngealuigh, agus ann sna réultannuibh: agus combrúghadh na gcinidheach ar an dtalamh, tré úathbhás; ag buirfigh don fhairge agus do na tonnuibh;
26 Agus racha a nanam as na dáoinibh tré eagla, agus tré bheith ag feitheamh ris na neithibh thiocfas ar an domhan: oír croithathear cumhachda neimhe.
27 Agus ann sin do chifid Mac an duine ag teachd a néull maille lé cumhachda agus lé glóir mhóir.
28 Agus an tan thionnsgóntar na neithesi do dhéanamh, féachuidh súas, agus togbhaidh bhár gcinn; óir is fogus dáoibh bhar bhfúasgladh.
29 Agus a dubhairt sé an chosamhlachdsa ríu; Féachaigh an crann fige, agus na huile chrann;
30 An tan sgeithid a nduilleabhar, air na fhaicsin dáoibhsi aitheantáoi úaibh féin gur fogus an samhradh ann sin.
31 Is mar sin dáoibhsi, an tan do chífí na neithesi déanta, bíodh a fhíos aguibh gur ab fogus atá rioghachd Dé.
32 A deirim ribh go fírinneach, Nach racha an dínisi thort, nó go ndéantar na neithesi uile.
33 Rachaidh neamh agus talamh thort: achd ní rachaid mó bhriathrasa thort go bráth.
34 ¶ Achd tabhruidh bhur naire dhíbh féin, deagla go mbíadh sibh tromchroidh theach úair ar bith í chráos, agus ó mheisge, agus ó rochúramuibh na beathasa, agus go dtiochfadh an lá úd go hobann oraibh.
35 Oir tiocfa sé mar dhul ar na huile dháoine dá náitrigheann ar úachdar na talmhan uile.
36 Ar a nadhbharsin déanuidh faire, ag guidho gach uile uair, ionnus go rucasfuigh gur fiú sibh dul as ó na neithibhsi uile atá chum teachda, agus go seasmhóchadh sibh a bhfiadhnuisi Mhic an duine.
37 Agus do bhíodh sé teagasg sa ló ann sa teampeall; achd ann san noidhche ar nimtheachd dó amach, do chomhnuigheadh sé ar a tslíabh dá ngoirthear slíabh na Noluidheadh.
38 Agus do thigeadh an pobal uile chuige go moch air maidin, déisdeachd ris ann sa teampall.

Chaith an deamhan ar Iudas chum failliughadh ar Chriosd. 54 Do shéan Peadar é. 66 Achd dadaimh sé féin gur ab Mac Dé é.
 
1 Agus do dhruid féasda a naráin gan laibhín riu, dá ngoirthear an Cháisg:
2 Agus do bhí úachdarain na sagart agus na sgríobuidhe ag íarruidh cionnus do mhuirfidís eision; oir do bhí eagla an phobuil orrtha.
3 ¶ Achd do chúaidh Satan a Níudas dar chomhainm Iscáiriot, do bhí no nuibhir an dá fhear dhéag.
4 Agus ar nimtheachd amach dhé, do labhair sé ris na hárdsagartaibh agus ris na húachdaranuibh, cionnas do bhraithfeadh sé eision dhóibh.
5 Agus do gabh lúathgháire íadsan, agus do rinneadar cunnradh ris airgead do thabhairt dó.
6 Agus do gheall seision sin, agus díarr sé faill ar eision do bhrath dhóibh ab tan nach mbíadh an pobal a láthair.
7 ¶ Achd táinic lá a naráin gan laíbhín, ann ar bhéigin an tuan cásg do mharbhadh.
8 Agus do chuir Iósa Peadar and Eóin úadh, ag radh, Imthigh, agus ullmhuighidh dhuinn an túan cásg, do chum go níosamáois é.
9 Achd a dubhradarsin ris, Cía a náit ann ar toil leachd sinn dá ullmhughadh?
10 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Féuch, tar éis dul a sdeach sa chathraigh dháoibh, teigeamhuidh duine áirghe oruibh, ag iomchar shoighthigh uisge; leanaidh é don tigh iona racha sé a sdeach.
11 Agus abruidh ré fear an tighe, A deir an Maighisdir riot, Cáit a bhfuil an Ióisdín, iona níosa mé an cháisg maille rem dheisciobhluibh?
12 Agus taisbéanuigh seision dáoibh séomra mór uachtrach deaghmhaisioch: ullmhuighidh ann sin é.
13 Agus ar nimtheachd dóibhsion, fuaradar mar a dubhairt seision riu: agus dullmhuigheadar an cháisg.
14 Agus an tráth tháinic an tam, do shuidh sé síos, agus a dhá dheisciobal deg maille ris.
15 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Do bhí fonn romhór oram an cháisgse do chaitheamh maille ribhsi suil fhuileongas mé:
16 Oír a deirim ribh, Nach íosa mé dhe ní as mó, nó go gcoimhlíontar é a ríoghachd Dé.
17 Agus ar ngabháil an chupáin chuige, ar mbreith buidheachais dó, a dubhairt sé, Glacaidh so, agus roinnidh eadruibh féin é.
18 Oír a deirim ribh, Nach iobhta mé do thoradh na fineamhna, no go dtíg rioghachd Dé.
19 ¶ Agus ar ngabháil a nárain chuíge, ar mbreith huidheachais dó, do bhris, agus tug sé dhóibhsean é, ag rádh, A sé so mo chorpsa do bhearthar áir bhur sonsa: déanuidh so mar chuimhne oramsa.
20 Agus mar an gcéadna an cupán fós tar éis suipéir, ag rádh, A sé an cupánsa an tiomna núa ann mfhuilsi, dhóirtear ar bhar sonsa.
21 ¶ Achd, féuch, lámh an té bhraitheas misi am fhochair ar an mbórd.
22 Agus imthigidh Mac an duine go deimhin, do réir mar do hórduigheadh: gidheadh is mairg don duine úd lé mbraithtear é!
23 Agus do thionnsgnadarsan a fhíafruigh eatarra féin, cía aca bhíadh ar tí so dheanamh.
24 Agus fós déirghidh imreasain eatarra, cía aca measfuighthe bheith ní as mó.
25 Achd a dubhairt seision ríu, Atá tíghearnas ag righthibh seision ríu, Atá tíghearnas ag righthibh na Geinidheach orrtha; agus an dream agá bhfuil cumhachda orrtha goirthear dáoine flaitheamhla dhíobh.
26 Achd ní mar sin dáoibhse: achd an té as mó eadruibh, bhíodh sé mar an té is lugha; agus an té is áired eadruibh, mar an té do ní miniosdralachd.
27 Oír cía aca is mó, an té shuigheas ar an mbórd, nó an tí friothólamh? a né nach é an té shuigheas ag bidh? achd atáimsi eadruibhse mar an té do ní friotholamh.
28 Agus is sibhsi dfan am fhochairsi ann mo chathuighthibh.
29 Ar a nadhbharsín órduighim dháoibhsi rioghachd, mar do órduigh Máthair féin damhsa;
30 Ionnus go níosdáoi agus go níobhtháoi ar mó bhórdsa ann mo rioghachd féin, agus go suighfí ar chaithíreachaibh ag breith bhreithe ar dhá threibh dhéug Isráel.
31 ¶ Agus a dubhairt an Tighearna, A Shímóin, a Síomóin, féuch, díarr Sátan sibhsi, le bhar gcáthadh mar chruithneachd:
32 ¶ Agus do ghuidh misi air do shonsa, ionnus nach dtráoithfeadh do chreideamh: agus air bhfilleadh duitse, neartuigh do dhearbhraithreacha.
33 Agus a dubhairt seision ris; A Thighearna atáim ullamh air bhul leachdsa, chum príosúin, agus chum báis leis.
34 Achd a dubhairt séision, A deirim riot, a Pheadair, nach goirfe an coileach a níu, nó go séanna tú trí húaire go bhfuil aithne agad oramsa.
35 ¶ Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, An tan do chuir mé úaim sibh fan sparán, ná mála, ná bróga, an raibh uireasbhuigh éin neithe oruibh? Agus a dubhrádarsan, Ní raibh.
36 Ar a nadhbharsin a dubhairt sé ríu, Achd a nois, gidh bé agá bhfuil sparán tógbhadh sé é, agus a mhála mar an gcéadna: agus gidh bé ag nach bhfuil, reacadh sé a bhrat, agus ceannchadh sé cloidheamh.
37 Oir a deirim ribh, Gur ab éigin fós an ní atá sgriobhtha do choimhlíonadh ionnamsa, Agus atá sé ar na chomháireamh a measg na ndáoine coirthéach: óir na neithe úd atá am thaoibhse atá deireadh aca:
38 Achd a dubhradarsan, A Thighearna, féuch, dhá chloidheamh ann so. Achd a dubhaier seision ríu, Is lór sin.
39 Agus ar nimtheachd amach dhó, do chúaidh sé, do réir a ghnáthuighthe, go slíabh na Noluidheadh; agus fós do leanadar a dheisciobuil é.
40 Agus an tán tháinic sé chum na háite, a dubhairt sé ríu, Déanunidh urnuighe ionnus nach dteigeamhadh sibh a ccáthughadh.
41 Agus do tairrngeadh eision úatha a dtimcheall urchair cloiche, agus agá léigean air a ghlúinibh, do rinne sé urnuighe,
42 Ag rádh, A Athair, mas toil leachd, cuir an cupánsa thoram: ach cheana nar ab í mo thoilsi, achd do thoilsi, do dhéantar.
43 Achd do taisbéanadh dhó aingeal ó neamh dá chomhfhurtachd.
44 Agus ar mbeith a nanbhuain mhóir dhósan do rinne sé urnuighe ní as díthchiolluighe: agus do bhí a allas mar bhráona mora fola ag tuitim ar talamh.
45 Agus an tan déirigh sé ó umuighe, tháinic sé chum a dheisciobal, agus fuair sé na gcodladh íad tré thuirsi,
46 Agus a dubhairt sé rú, Créd fá gcodaltáoi? éirghidh agus déanuidh urnuighe, do chum nach dtuitfeadh sibh a gcathughadh.
47 ¶ Agus ag labhairt dó fós, féuch an slúagh, agus an té dá ngoirthí Iúdas, áon don dá fhear déag, ag gabháil rompa, agus do dhruid sé ré Hiosa do thabhairt póige dhó.
48 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris, A Iúdais, an lé poig bhraithbeas tú Mac an duine?
49 Agus an tan do chunncadar an dream do bhí ná thimcheallsan an ní do bhí ag teach, a dubhradar ris, A Thighcarna, an mbuáilfeam lé cloidheamh?
50 ¶ Agus do bhuáil fear dhíobh searbhfhoghantuidhe a nárdshagairt, agus do bhean sé a chlúas dheas de.
51 Achd do fhreagair Iósa agus a dubhairt, Fuilngidh go soithe so. Agus ar mbuáin ré na chluáis súd, do shlánuigh sé é.
52 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris na hardsagartaibh, agus úachdaráuibh an teampuill, agus na seinnsearaibh, tháinic chuige, An dtangabhair amach, le cloidhimhthibh agus le batuidhibh, amhuil chum bhiothainhnuigh?
53 An tan do bhí me gach lá agaibh sa teampall, níor shineabhair lámha dhamh: achd a sí so bhar nuáirsi, agus cumhachda an dorchaduis.
54 ¶ Achd ar mbreith airsion, rugadar léo é, go tigh an ardshagairt. Agus do lean Peadar a bhfad úadh é.
55 Agus an tráth do lasadar teine ar lár na halla, agus so shuigheadar na timchioll a bhfochair a chéile, do shuidh Peadar catarra.
56 Agus an tan do chunnairc cailín áirighe é na shuidhe ag an teinidh, ar bhfeachain go gér dhí air, a duabhaiet sí, Do bhi an fearso fós na fhochair súd.
57 Agus do shéan seision é, ag rádh, A bhean, níor bhaithnidh damh é.
58 Agus beagán na dhiáigh sin ar na fhaicsin do neach eile, a dubhairt sé, Agus is díobh súd thusa fós. Achd a dubhairt Peadar, A dhuine, ní díobh misi.
59 Agus a dtimcheall áonuáire amháin na dhiáigh sin, do dhearbhuigh neach áirighe ele, ag rádh, Go firinneach do bhí an tési leis na fhochair súd: óir is Galiléeach é.
60 Achd a dubhairt Peadar, A dhaine, ní bhfuil a fhios agam créd a deir tú. Agus ar an mball, an feadh do bhí sé ag labhairt, do ghoir an coileach.
61 Agus ar gcasadh don Tighearna, dféuch sé ar Pheadar. Agus do chumhnigh Peadar ar chomrádh an Tighearna, cionnas a dubhairt sé ris, Suil ghoirfeas an coileach, séanfuidh tú mé trí huáire.
62 Agus ar ndol amach do Pheadar, do ghuil sé go gér.
63 ¶ Agus na dáoine do chuinnigh Iósa do rinneadar fonómhad fáoi, dá bhúaladh;
64 Agus an tan do fholuigheadar é, do bhuáileadar a aghuidh, agus dfiafruidheadar dhe, ag rádh, Déana fáigheadóireachd, cía bhúail thú?
65 Agus a dubhradar mórán do neithibh eile na aghaidh dhá mhaslughadh.
66 ¶ Agus mar déirigh an lá, do chrinnigheadar sinnsir an phobuil, agus na hárdsagairt, agus na sgríobuidhe a bhfochair a chéile, agus tugadar eision chum a gcomhairle féin,
67 Ag rádh, An tusa Críosd? innis dúinne. Agus a dubhairt seision riu, Má innisim dháoibh, ní chreidfidhe mé:
68 Agus fós ma fhiafruighim í dhíbh, ní thiobhartháoi freagra oram, agus ní léighfi uáibh mé.
69 Sam aimsir aig teachd biáidh Mac an duine na shuighe ar deis chumhachd Dé.
70 Agus a dubhradar uile ris, mar sin an túsa Mac Dé? Agus a dubhairt seision riú, A deirthisi gur ab mé.
71 Achd a dubhradarsan, Créd é an riachdanus fiadhnuisi atá oruinn feasda? óir do chúalamar féin as a bhéul féin é.

Criosd, 11 ar na thaircaisniughadh re Iorúaidh, 24 agus ar na chéasadh lé Piolit, 34 do ghuidh sé arson maitheamhnas dá naimhdibh.
 
1 Agus ar néirghe dá ccoimhthional uile, rugadar chum Pioláid é.
2 Agus do thionnsgnadar cúis do chuir air, ag radh, Fúramar an fearsa ag iompódh ar gcinidh, agus ag toirmeasg cíosa do thabhairt do Shéasar, ag rádh gur ab é féin Críosd an Rí.
3 Agus a dfíafruidh Pioláid dhe, ag rádh, An tusa Rí na Níudaighe? Agus ar bhfreagra dhósan a dubhairt sé ris, A deir tusa sin.
4 Agus a dubhairt Píoláid ris na hárdsagartuibh agus ris an tslúagh, Ní fhaghaimsi cúis ar bith air a bhfearso.
5 Achd do theannadarsan orrtham ag rádh, Buáidhridh sé an pobal, ag teagasg ar feadh thíre Iúdaighe uile, ag teasgasg ar feadh thíre Iúdaighe uile, ag tosughadh ón Ghalilé go soithe so.
6 Agus mar do chúaluidh Píoláit teachd thar an Ngalilé, dfiarfruidh sé dhe nar Ghaliléeach é.
7 Agus an tan daithin sé gur ab fá thumhachduibh Iornáth do bhí sé, do chuir sé ar ais é chum Iorúaidh, do bhí Níarusalém ann sna láethibh sin.
8 ¶ Agus ar bhfaicsin Iósa Díoruáidh, do ghabh lúathgháire mhór é: óir do bhí fonn air ré fada eision dfaicsin, do bhrigh go gcúaluidh sé mórán air; agus do bhí dóchas aige go bhfaicfeadh sé comhtharra éigin ar na dhéanamh leis.
9 Agus dfíafruidh sé mórán do cheasdannuibh dhe; achd ní thug seision freagra ar bith air.
10 Agus do sheasadar na hárdsagairt agus na sgrióbuidhe ag déanamh casáoide air go dithchiollach.
11 Achd tug Ioruáidh maille ré na luchd coguidh tarcuisne air, agus do rinneadar fonómhad fáoi chúireadar chum Píoláid a rís é.
12 ¶ Agus an lásin féin, do rinneadh Ioruaith agus Píoláid na gcáirdibh dhá cheile: óir do bhádar na naimhdibh agá chéile roimhe sin.
13 ¶ Agus ar ngairm na nárdsagart agus núachdarán, agus an phobuil do Phioláid,
14 A dubhairt sé riu, Tugabhair chugamsa an duinesi, mar neach iompóidheas an pobal: agus, féuch, ar gceasdughadh ris damsha ann bhar bhfiadhnuisi féin, ní fhúair me coir ar bith ar an duine do na neithibh agá ndéantáoisi casáoid air:
15 Agus fós, ní fhúair, Ioruáidh: óir do chuir mé chuige sibh; agus, féuch, ní dhearnuidh níar bith leis do thuillfeadh bás.
16 Ar a nadhbharsin ar na smachdughadh, léighfidh mé uáim é.
17 Oír dob éigean dí neach éigin do léigean amach dhóibh ann sa bhféasda.
18 Achd do éigh an choimthionol uile, ag rádh, Beir uáinn an fearsa, agus sgáoil dúinne Barabbas:
19 Do bhí ar na chur a bpriosún tré cheannairc áirighe, agus trí mharbhadh, do rinneadh ann sa chathraigh.
20 Ar a nadhbharsin, do labhair Píoláid rín a rís, ar mbeith fonnmhar dhó ar Iósa léigean úadh.
21 Achd do éimhgheadarsan, ag rádh, Croch é, croch é.
22 Agus a dubhairt sé rín an treas uáir, Achd, créud é an tolc do rinne sé? ní fhuair mísi cúis bhais ar bith air: ar a nadhbharsin ar na smachdughadh, leigfidh mé amach é.
23 Achd do sheasadarsan go cruáidh ná aghuidh lé gothannuibh móra, ag íarruidh eisiondo chrochadh. Agus do bhuaidheadar a ngóthasan agus gótha úachdarán na sagart.
24 Agus rug Píoláid do bhreith an ní díarradarsan do dhéanamh.
25 Agus do léig sé amach chuca an té do teilgeadh a bpriosún ar son cheannairce agus marbhtha, noch do íarradar; agus tug sé Iósa dhá dtoilsion.
26 ¶ Agus an tan do rugadar léo é, ar mbreith ar Shiréanach áirighe, dar bhainm Simon, do bhí ag teachd ón túaith, do chuireadar an chroch air, dá hiomchara ndíaigh Iósa.
27 Agus do lean cuideachda mhór don phobal, agus do na mnáibh é, do bhí fós ag gul agus dá cháoineadhsan.
28 Agus ar bhfilleadh chuca a dubhairt Iósa, A ingheana Ierusaléim, ná guilidh ar mo shonsa, achd guilidh ar bhar son féin, agus ar son bhar gcloinne.
29 Oír, féuch, tiochfuid na láethe, iona naibéoruid said, Is beannuighthe na mná seasga, agus na bronna nach ar thuismidh, agus na cíocha nach dtug bainne úatha.
30 Ann sin thionnsganaid a rádh ris na sléibhtibh, Tuitigh oruinn; agus ris na cnocaibh, Folnighe sinn.
31 Oír má níd síad na neithesi ris an crann úr, créd do dhéantar ris an ccríon?
32 Agus fós tugadh días eile meirleach da ccur chum báis na fhochairsion.
33 Agus an tan tanagadar do nionad dá ngoirthear Ait na cloigne, do chrochadar ann sin é féin, agus na meirligh, fear air a dheis, agus fear eile air a láimh chlé.
34 ¶ Agus a dubhairt Iósa, A Athair, maith dhóibh; óir ní bhfuil a fhios aca créd do nid said. Agus an roinn a éaduighsion, do theilgeadar crannchar orthu.
35 ¶ Agus do sheas an pobal ag fhéachain air. Agus do rinneadar na húachdaráin leis fonómhad fáoi maille ríusán, ag rádh, Dfóir sé ar dháoinibh eile; foireadh sé air féin, mas é so Criosd, do thogh Día.
36 Agus fós do rinneadar na saighdiuirigh fonómhad fáoi, ag drud ris, agus ag tairgsin bhinéigre dhó,
37 Agus ag rádh, Mas tusa rí na Níuduigheadh, fóir ort féin.
38 Agus fós do bhí sgríbhneóireachd sgríobhtha ós a chionn do litreachabh Gréigis, agus Laidní, agus Eabhrias, A SE SO RI NA NIUDUIGHEADH.
39 ¶ Achd do bhí áon do na meirleachaibh do crochadh dá mhaslughadh, ag rádh, Mas tú Críosd, fóir ort féin agus oruinne.
40 Agus ar bhfreagra don fhear eile, do spreag sé é, ag rádh, A né nach bhfuil eagla Dé ort, agus tú fa áondhamnadh ris?
41 Achd sinne go deimhin go ceart; (óir fúaramar na neithe do thuilleadar ar ngníomhartha): achd ní dhearna an tési olc ar bith.
42 Agus a dubhairt sé ré Híosa, A Thighearna, cuimhnigh oransa an tan thiochas tú ad rioghachd féin.
43 Agus a dubhairt Iósa ris, A deirim riot go firinneach, Go mbia tú am fhochair a niu a bpárrthas.
44 ¶ Agus do bhí sé a dtimcheall an seiseadh húair, agus do rinneadh dorchadas ar an dtalamh uile gus a náomheadh húair.
45 Agus do dhorchuigheadh an ghrían agus do briseadh brat roinnte an teampuill ann a lár.
46 ¶ Agus ar néigheamh Díosa do ghúth mhór, a dubhairt sé, A Athair, táobham mo spiorad ann do lamhaibhsi: agus an tan a dubharit sé na neithesi, do chúaidh a spiorad ás.
47 ¶ Agus an tráth do chunnaire an caiptíu an ni do rinneadh, tug sé glóir do Dhía, ag rádh, Go firinneach budh firéan an duinesi.
48 Agus an pobal uile tháinic a náoinfheachd dá fhéachainsion, a núair do chunncadar na neithe do rinneadh ann, ag búaladh a nochda, do fhilleadar air a nais.

52 Ar ndul dó so chum Pioláid, díarr sé corp Iósa.
53 Agus ar na bhúain a núas dó, do chuir sé linéadach na thimcheall, agus do chuir sé a dtúama do bhí ar na thochailt a gcarraic é, ann nach ar cuireadh áonduine roimhesion a ríamh.

Soisgeul subhach na naingeal do na mnáibh, um eiseirghe Chriosd, 36 Noch do thaisbein é féin dá Absduluibh, 51 agus chúaidh súas ar neamh.
 
Agus an céadlá don tseachdmhuin, tangadar go romhoch ar maidin, chum an túama, ag tabhairt léo na neitheadh deaghbhaluidh dullmhuigheadar, agus mná áirighe eile maille ríu.
2 Agus fúaradar an chloch ar na hiomlat ón túama.
3 Agus ar ndul a sdeach dhóibh, ní fhúaradar corp an Tighearna Iósa.
4 Agus tárla, gur ghabh úathbhás íad fán ní sin, agus féuch, do sheasadar días fear na naice a néaduighibh dealruightheacha:
5 Agus ar na ngabháil eagla dóibsion, agus ar gcromadh a naighthe chum na talmhan, a dubhradarsan ríu, Créud fa níartháoi eidir na marbhuibh an lé atá beo?
6 Ní bhfuil sé ann so, achd déirigh sé: cuimhnighidh mar a dubhairt sé féin ribh an feadh do bhí sé fós ann sa Ghalilé
7 Ag rádh, Is éigin Mac an duine do thabhairt a lámhuibh dháoine peacthach, agus a chrochadh, agus a eiséirghe an treas lá.
8 Agus do chuimhnigheadarsan ar a bhriathraibhsion,

10 Achd a si Muire Mhaghalén, agus Iónna, afus Muire mathair Shéumais, agus na mná eile do bhí maille ríu, dinnis na neithesi do na heasbuil.
11 Agus do cheasadarsan a mbríathra mar éadruime cheille, agus nior chreideadar dhóibh.
12 ¶ Agus ar néirghe do Pheadar, do rioth sé chum an túama; agus an tan a dféuch sé a sdeach, do chunnairc sé an linéadach na luighe leis féin, agus dimthigh sé, ag déanamh iongantais leis féin fán ngíomhsa.
13 ¶ Agus, féuch, do chúadar días diobhsan an lásin féin go baile atá trí fithchid sdáide ó Iérusalém, dar ab ainm Emmáus.

16 Achd do cungmhadh a súilesion, ionnus nach aitheonchaidís é.
17 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Créd íad na comhraitesi air a bhfuiltí ag teachd cadruibh féin, ag siobhal dibh, agus sibh go bronach?
18 Agus ar bhfeagra do neach díobh, dar bhainm Cléophas, a dubhairt sé ris, An bhfuil tusa ad áonar ad choigcrigheach a Niarusalém, agus gan fios na neitheann do rinneadh innte ann sna láethibhsi agad?
19 Agus a dubhairt seision ríu, Créd iad na neithe? Agus a dubhradarsan ris, Na neither tháobh Iósa Nasardha, do bhí na fhaigh chumhachdach a ngniómh agus a mbreithir a bfiadhnuisi Dé, agus an phobuil uile:
20 Cionnas tugadar na hárdsagairt, agus ar núachdarainne é chum breithe bháis do bhreith air, agus do chrochadar é.
21 Achd do bhí ar súilne gur bheision an té dfuaisgéoladh Isráel: agus leith amuich dhíobh so uile, a sé níu an treas lá ó rinneadh na neithesi.
22 Agus mar an gcéadna, mná áirighe dhínn féin tháinic go moch chum a túama, do chuireadar úathbhás oruinn;
23 Agus mar nach bhfuaradar a chorpsan, tangadar, ag rádh, go bhfacadar féin fós taidhbhsi aingeal, a deir go bhfuil sé na bheathaigh.
24 Agus do chuadar dream áirighe dhá rabh maille rinne chum an túama, agus fuaradar mar a dubhradar na mná: achd ní fhacadar eision.
25 Agus a dubhairt seision riu, O a dhaoine amadánach agus mallchroidhtheach chum creidmhe dá gach éinni dar labhradar na fáighe!
26 A né nar bhéigin do Chríosd na neithesi dfulang, agus dul a sdeach ann a ghlóir féin?
27 Agus ar dtionnsgnadh ó Mháoisi agus ó na faighibh uile, do eidirmhínigh sé dhoibh ann sna huile sgriopturaibh na neither bhi dhá tháobh féin.
28 Agus do dhruideadar ris an mbaile, ann a rabhadar ag dul: agus do léig seision air go rachadh sé ní is faide.

30 Agus tárla, an tan do chuidh sé chum bí na bhfochair, ar mbreith ar a narán; go rug sé buidheachas, agus ar na bhriseadh, tug sé dhóibhsion é.
31 Agus so hosgladh a súilesion, agus daithnidheadar eision; agus do tóghbadh as a namharc é.
32 Agus a dubhradarsan eatarra féin, A né nach rabhadar ar gcroidhthe ar lasadh ionnuinn, an feadh do bhí sé ag labhairt rinn ar a tslighe, agus an tan do osguil sé dhuinn na sgrioptúiridh?
33 Agus ar néirghe dhoibh ar a núairsin féin, dfilleadar go Híarusalém, agus fúaradar an téinfhear deúg cruinn a bhfochair a chéile, agus an dream do bhí maille ríu,
34 Ag rádh, Déirigh an Tighearna go firinneach, agus taisbéanadh do Shíomón é.
35 Agus dinnisiodarsan na neither do rinneadh ar a tslighe, agus mar do aithnidheadar é a mbriseadh a naráin.
36 ¶ Agus agá labhairt so dhóibhsion, do sheas Iósa féin ann a lár, agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Siocháin maille ribh.
37 Achd ar mbeith dhóibhsion ar crith agus lán deagla, do sháoileadar gur spiorad do chunncadar.
38 Agus a dubhairt seision ríu; Créd fá bhduilti ar bhar mbúaidhreadh, agus créd fá a néirghid smúaintighe ann bhar gcroidhthibh?
39 Feuchaidh mó lámha agus mó chosa, óir is misi féin atá ann: glacaidh, agus féuchaidh mé; oír ní bhfuil féoil na cnámha ag spioruid, mar do chithi agamsa.
40 Agus an tan a dubhairt sé na neithesi do thaisbéin sé dhóibh a lámha agus a chosa.
41 Achd ar mbeith míchreidmheach dhóibhsion fós tré gháirdeachas, agus ag déanamh iongantais, a dubhairt seision ríu, An bhfuil bíadh ar bith agaibh ann so?
42 Agus tugadarsan do cuid díasg rósduighe, agus cuid do chír mheala.
43 Agus ar na nglacadh dhósan, dúaidh sé na bhfiafhnuisision íad.
44 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Ag so na briathar do labhair mé ribh, a núair do bhí mé fós bhar bhfochair, gur ab éigin na huile neithe atá sgríobhtha a reachd Mháoisi, agus ann sna fáighibh, agus ann sna salmuibh, am thimcheallsa do choimhlíonadh.
45 Ann sin dosguil sé a ttuisge, ionnus go dtuigfidís na sgrioptúir,
46 Agus a dubhairt sé ríu, Gur mar so do bhi sé sgríobhtha, agus gur mar so dob éigin do Chríosd fulang, agus éiseirghe ó mharbhuibh an treas lá:
47 Agus aithrighe agus maitheamhnas na bpeacadh do dheanmóir an ainm do na huile chinidheachuibh, ag tionnsguadh ó Iérusalém.
48 ¶ Agus is sibhsi fiadhnuiseadha na neitheannsa.

== The Pollination Process ==

Could you put like an animated picture(s)of the pollination process? I have to do this for my science class and none of this helps me... I'm supposed to right a paragraph on the pollination process and I couldn't get anything out of this except what pollinators pollinate this flower.



Thanks,

'''''Stachys''''' is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants and shrubs in the family Lamiaceae. The distribution of the genus covers Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia and North America. Common names include Heal-all, self-heal, woundwort, betony, lamb's ears, and hedgenettle.

Originating in Europe, stachys can be found growing in wastelands, grasslands and woodland edges.   All-heal thrives in any damp soil in full sun or in light shade. Plants are apt to become troublesome weeds in turf that is at all damp. Sow seed in very early spring in a flat outdoors, or give a short cold and moist conditioning treatment before sowing in a warm place.  Mostly from June to August. Gather whole plant when flowers bloom, dry for later herb use. Leaves and small flowers are edible.

==Description==
The stems vary from 50-300 cm tall, with simple, opposite triangular leaves 1-14 cm long with serrated margins; in most species the leaves are softly hairy. The stems are creeping, self-rooting, tough, square, reddish, and branching at leaf axis. The leaves are lance shaped, serrated and reddish at tip, about an inch long and 1/2 inch broad, grow on short stalks in opposite pairs down the square stem. The flowers grow from a clublike, somewhat square, whirled cluster, immediately below this club are a pair of stalkless leaves standing out on either side like a collar. The flowers are 1.2 cm long, two lipped and tubular, clustered in the axils of the leaves on the upper part of the stem, the corolla 5-lobed with the top lobe forming a 'hood', varying from white to pink, purple, red or pale yellow; the bottom lip is often white, three lobed, with the middle lobe being larger and fringed upwardly. Flowers bloom at different times depending on climate and other conditions.

==Growing conditions==
Well drained soils are required, soils of low fertility are often better than rich soils. Full sun to light shade.

==Species==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Used as a medicine for centuries on just about every continent in the world, and for just about every ailment known to man, Heal-All is something of a panacea, it does have some medicinal uses that are constant. The plants most useful constituents are Betulinic-acid, D-Camphor, Delphinidin, Hyperoside, Manganese, Oleanolic-acid, Rosmarinic-acid, Rutin, Ursolic-acid, and Tannins. The whole plant is medicinal as alterative, antibacterial, antipyretic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, carminative, diuretic, febrifuge, hypotensive, stomachic, styptic, tonic, vermifuge and vulnerary. A cold water infusion of the freshly chopped or dried and powdered leaves is a very tasty and refreshing beverage, weak infusion of the plant is an excellent medicinal eye wash for sties and pinkeye. It is taken internally as a medicinal tea in the treatment of fevers, diarrhoea, sore mouth and throat, internal bleeding, and weaknesses of the liver and heart. The name &quot;woundwort&quot; derives from its past use in herbalism for the treatment of wounds.

The Chinese artichoke (''[[../Stachys affinis/]]''), is grown for its edible tuber.

Woolly Betony (''[[../Stachys byzantina/]]'') is a popular decorative garden plant.

==Maintenance==
Cut back in early spring. 

==Propagation==
Division or cuttings.

==Harvesting==
For herbal use, gather whole plant when flowers bloom, and dry for later use. Leaves and small flowers are edible.

A '''pear''' is a tree of the genus ''Pyrus'' and the juicy fruit of that tree, edible in some species. The English word ''pear'' is probably from Common West Germanic ''*pera'', probably a  loanword of Vulgar Latin ''pira'', the plural of ''pirum'', which is itself of unknown origin. See also Peorð. The place name ''Perry'' can indicate the historical presence of pear trees.

==Description==
Pears are native to temperate regions of the Old World, from western Europe and north Africa east right across Asia. They are medium sized trees, reaching 10-17 m tall, often with a tall, narrow crown; a few species are shrubby. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, 2-12 cm long, glossy green on some species, densely silvery-hairy in some others; leaf shape varies from broad oval to narrow lanceolate. Most pears are deciduous, but one or two species in southeast Asia are evergreen. Most are cold-hardy, withstanding temperatures between &amp;minus;25 °C and &amp;minus;40 °C in winter, except for the evergreen species, which only tolerate temperatures down to about &amp;minus;15 °C.

The flowers are white, rarely tinted yellow or pink, 2-4 cm diameter, and have five petals. Like that of the related apple, the pear fruit is a pome, in most wild species 1-4 cm diameter, but in some cultivated forms up to 18 cm long and 8 cm broad; the shape varies from globose in most species, to the classic 'pear-shape' of the European Pear with an elongated basal portion and a bulbous end.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

*''[[../Pyrus ×serrulata/]]''
*''[[../Pyrus syriaca/]]''
*''[[../Pyrus ussuriensis/]]'' – Siberian Pear

==Uses==
Pear trees are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of [[../Lepidoptera/]] species - see [[w:List of Lepidoptera which feed on Pear trees]].

Only three species are important for edible fruit production, the European Pear ''[[../Pyrus communis/]]'' cultivated mainly in Europe and [[North America]], the Chinese white pear (bai li) ''[[../Pyrus xbretschneideri/]]'', and the Nashi Pear ''[[../Pyrus pyrifolia/]]'' (also known as Asian Pear or Apple Pear), both grown mainly in eastern Asia. There are thousands of cultivars of these three species.

Other species are used as rootstocks for European and Asian pears and as ornamental trees. The Siberian Pear, ''[[../Pyrus ussuriensis/]]'' (which produces unpalatable fruit) has been crossed with ''[[../Pyrus communis/]]'' to breed hardier pear cultivars. The Bradford Pear (''[[../Pyrus calleryana/]]'' 'Bradford') in particular has become widespread in North America and is used only for decoration. The Willow-leafed Pear (''[[../Pyrus salicifolia/]]'') is grown for its attractive slender, densely silvery-hairy leaves.

Pears are consumed fresh, canned, as juice, and occasionally dried. The juice can also be used in jellies and jams, usually in combination with other fruits or berries. Fermented pear juice is called perry.

Pears are the least allergenic of all fruits. Along with lamb and soya formula, pears form part of the strictest exclusion diet for allergy sufferers.

Pear wood is one of the preferred materials in the manufacture of high-quality woodwind instruments and furniture. It is also used for wood carving, and as a firewood to produce aromatic smoke for smoking meat or tobacco.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
The pear is very similar to the apple in cultivation, propagation and pollination.  

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==

The immune system is not a single object like many of the other organs discussed in this book but a lot of cells spread all through the body to protect us from many kinds of illnesses. 

=== What does the immune system look like? ===
The immune system isn't something you can see without a microscope, because it is made of a lot of solitary cells which wander and patrol the body and cooperate to eliminate bacteria viruses and cells of the body that have become sick. This is why the immune system is called '''system''' instead of an '''organ'''. The only structures that can sometimes be seen and felt are lymph nodes and the thymus. Lymph nodes are little round organs where immune cells gather to exchange information and reproduce if there is an infection in the body. The gathering of immune cells in the lymph node can make it swollen.

=== What are the parts of the immune system? ===
The immune system is composed of white blood cells, lymph nodes, the bone marrow and the thymus.

=== What is the function of the immune system? ===
The immune system is the police force of the body. Almost every cell and space in the body is patrolled to find sickness. There are a few different kinds of cells that make up the immune system.

* Macrophages eat bacteria, viruses, abnormal cells and debris. They warn T-cells about viruses and bacteria.
* T-cells patrol cells of the body and make sure they are o.k. They get signals from macrophages. T-cells coordinate a lot of the immune response. They tell B-cell to produce antibodies and they can kill abnormal cells that are then absorbed by macrophages.
* B-cells produce antibodies. Antibodies are small molecules that attach to certain structures at other cells like bacteria. By clotting the surface of bacteria they become inactive and can be devoured by macrophages. Each B-cell produces a specialized antibody that targets a specific bacteria or virus. Once a B-cell became active it stays on alert. This is why you suffer from a children's disease only once and why you are immune to a common cold in winter after you went through it.

There three types of organs that are part of the immune system:

* The bone marrow is where all blood cells of the immune system are produced.
* The thymus is the training station of the T-cells. Here, T-cells learn to distinguish between structures that belong to the body and foreign cell structures of bacteria and viruses.
* Lymph nodes are communication centers of the immune cells. Here macrophages inform T-cells which in turn trigger B-cells to produce antibodies. There multiple lymph nodes in the human body such that close to every part of the body there is such a communication center.

=== What organ systems is the immune system connected with? ===

Immune cells have the privilege to be able to visit almost any part of the body. Like the police they have special rights. Immune cells can travel in blood vessels but if they come close to a place where an infection occurs they can leave a capillary to travel right to the place of action and take part in the scuffle.

=== How does the immune system interact with other parts of the body? ===

T-cells patrol normal human cells. They do so by snuggling a cell and telling it to show part of what is inside. You can think of this as a passport control. The T-cell has to decide whether the passport is correct or not, thereby deciding whether the cell is normal or not. Apart from this, the immune system mostly deals with intruders from the outside. They have to be identified and after this the immune system is quite rigorous in eliminating those intruders. Records are kept by some T-cells to make sure next time the same intruder is expelled even more rapidly, sometimes without us noticing.

=== How can you keep your immune system healthy? ===

The immune system is very delicate. If you are sad or unhappy, the immune system may become weaker. Get a lot of sleep every night and don't do things that make you scared or unhappy. Spend time with friends and in friendly, safe places.

'''''Vaccinium''''' is a [[genus]] of [[shrub]]s in the plant Family [[Ericaceae]] including the [[cranberry]], [[blueberry]], [[bilberry]] or whortleberry, [[cowberry]] or lingonberry, and [[huckleberry]]. The genus contains about 450 species, which are found mostly in the cooler areas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], although there are tropical species from as widely separated areas as Madagascar and Hawai'i. The plants prefer [[heath (habitat)|heath]] landscapes, as well as open forests. The name ''Vaccinium'' was used for a type of berry (probably the [[bilberry]] ''V. myrtillus'') in classical Latin, but its ultimate derivation is obscure; it has nothing to do with ''vaccinum'' &quot;of or pertaining to [[cow]]s&quot;, but may be a corruption of Latin ''bacca'', [[berry]] ([[OED]]).

The [[fruit]] develops from an inferior ovary, and is a [[berry]].

''Vaccinium'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of a number of [[Lepidoptera]] species - see [[list of Lepidoptera which feed on Vaccinium]].

The taxonomy is complex, and still under investigation; there are two subgenera, and several sections:
;Subgenus '''''Oxycoccus''''': The [[cranberry|cranberries]], with slender, trailing, wiry non-woody shoots and strongly reflexed flower petals. Some botanists treat ''Oxycoccus'' as a distinct genus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a marked deck?==
A marked deck is a deck of cards with multiple, secretive marks on each card. They are used in card and mentalism tricks by magicians. The marks are used to identify the card from the backside. There are different types of marks, and some are used for different tricks.

==Types of marks==
The types of marks can vary with size, shape, and ways to read them. Some can only be used with special glasses, and others simply utilize a system of special symbols to specify the card. Most marked decks are provided with instructions for the performer.

==Names and online seller links==
Juiced cards are marked with special markers or paste, and can be found at online magic stores. They can be found at [http://www.markcards.com]. They are commonly used because of their invisibility to laymen. A commonly used marked deck is The ''Boris Wild Marked Deck''.

:Sorry about that.  I keep changing my mind.  The dust will settle eventually, I'm sure.  &lt;strike&gt;For now, I'm putting things in [[Wikibooks:Featured books/French]] (example). But maybe the original location {{tl|Goodbook/French}} was better&lt;/strike&gt; -- 04:03, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

::Correction.  Please see {{tl|Goodbook/French}} for an example -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:43, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:Hi again, Xania, hope the following recipe for creating a Goodbook template will be useful to you -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:55, 1 May 2007 (UTC)
::(See the template page for instructions) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:43, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
:::: I have tried to make [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python]] into a featured book.  The instructions on the template page didn't help whatsoever but your link to an example above was quite helpful.  Why can't this be simplified? I followed most of the steps in the instructions but then editing pages like the 'main page featured book' thingie is just so bloody complicated.  Can someone check to see that this book has properly been added to the featureds?

== float:right? ==

Hi Whiteknight,

Why do reckon we should put the float:right; commands as parameters to the template?  Doing it that way leads to great awkwardness when you have more than one book per section of the bookshelf -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 04:35, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:The only reason I did that is because the templates are self-contained, and don't require div's. Requiring a separate HTML container around templates with multiple arguments just seems to me like an extra, unnecessary step. However, we can certainly show examples of both methods. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 13:29, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

::Well, I think the point is that you can have one div with N templates inside.  Otherwise it becomes tricky getting the templates to line up vertically.  They either form a horizontal row of right-aligned templates, or you have to do ugly hacks like interspersing them with the main text so that spacing comes out right.  I think it really is necessary, as a means of grouping templates together.  See [[Wikibooks:Languages_bookshelf#Romance]] to what I'm referring to.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:12, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

== Books in Use ==

Would there be any interest in listing where the Wikibooks are being used currently?  I am using Intro Sociology in my 100+ class on Introduction to Sociology at West Chester University of Pennsylvania in West CHester, PA (12,000 uncergraduates and part of the PA System of Higher Education)

Feel Free to edit any pages in this module.  If there is a section that you feel is missing or need to be added then either mention it in the main [[Talk:Raising Chickens|Talk Page]] for this module, a link to it in the table of contents, or '''be bold''' and create it yourself.

==New Page Instructions==
{{main|Help:How to contribute}}
After you have created a new page please add {{tl|Raising Chickens}} to the top of the page.  This adds a navigation template designed to make navigating the Raising Chickens module easier on the right side of the page (as seen on the right of this page).

After a page is started and has the navigation template added please add that page to the navigation template by clicking on the &quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Raising_Chickens&amp;action=edit Edit]&quot; link in the template.

===New Discussion Page===
When you create a new discussion page please add {{tl|Raising Chickens Discussion}} to the top of the page.  It is a navigation template designed to make navigating through the Raising Chickens Discussion easier, and looks like:

{{Raising Chickens Discussion}}

After a page is started and has the navigation template added please add that page to the navigation template by clicking on the &quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Raising_Chickens_Discussion&amp;action=edit Edit]&quot; link in the template.

==Disputes==
If there is a fact that is oviously false then feel free to '''be bold''' and correct it.  However, if you arn't sure then you can dispute a fact in that pages discussion.  If there is a disupte section add your dispute with a title under it using three '=' e.g.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;==Disputes==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===chickens are not really birds===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If there isn't a Disputes section then feel free to add one.

After mentioning you disupte mark where your dispute is in the article by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Raising Chickens/*Talk Page*#*dispute*|Disputed]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

replace *Talk Page* with the talk page name and *dispute* with the name of your dispute used in the page in the '=' signs
e.g. say that you feel that chicks (in the chicks page) need dogfood.  Your marker would look like
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Raising Chickens/Chicks#dogfood|Disputed]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This would look something like this
 Chicks should NEVER get dogfood&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Raising Chickens/Chicks#dogfood|Disputed]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <comment>/* Positive Buffer */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Op-Amps Intro==
Op-Amps stands for Operational Amplifier, a device usually manufactured as an Integrated Circuit (IC) . User don't need to know about the Itegrated Circuit inside in order to work with Op-Amps . All you need to know is that Op-Amps acts as an amplifier, it amplifies the difference of the 2 different voltages at input by a gain or amplification factor A

Output of an operational amplifier:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{O} = A(V^{+}-V^{-})&lt;/math&gt;

Ideally &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be equal to infinity. However, in practical op-amps, it has a high value. Furthermore, the gain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a function of frequency.

Below is the most commonly used configuration of Op-Amps 


==Negative Amplifier==

[[Image:Opampinverting.svg|Inverting amplifier|thumb|200]]
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out} = - V_\mathrm{in} \frac{R_f}{R_\mathrm{in}}&lt;/math&gt;


*The output voltage is a negative voltage equal to the input voltage amplified by a factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_f}{R_\mathrm{in}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Positive Amplifier==
[[Image:Opampnoninverting.svg|thumbnail|200px]]
:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = V_\mathrm{in} \left( 1 + {R_2 \over R_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

*The output voltage is a positive voltage equal to the input voltage amplified by a factor  &lt;math&gt; \left( 1 + {R_2 \over R_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 

==Positive Buffer==

:[[Image:Opampfollowing.png]] &lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = V_\mathrm{in} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

*From the circuit of Positive Amplifier, If R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 thì V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

==Negative Buffer==
[[Image:Opampinverting.svg|thumb|Inverting amplifier|200]]
*From the circuit of Negative Amplifier, If R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 then V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = - V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

I have removed the recipe because it did not list the quantity of condensed milk, which would seem to be the dish's main ingredient. In place of a quantity, the recipe's author asked if anyone knew how much milk to use, and of what type. That's just not a recipe. I have left all the other info. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 03:23, 29 April 2007 (UTC)


Why? the remaining info is useless. How is the milk cooked? hot temp?low?  oven? pan? bbq?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:44, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

== Possible copyright violation ==

G'day Jessica, you use the {{tl|copyvio}} template by giving it a parameter, being the URL of the likely source: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{copyvio|1=http://www.example.invalid/recipe.html}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Nice work on the Cookbook, good to have another set of eyes working on it! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:23, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:Oh, thanks so much! I thought it must have been something like that, and actually got close by using a colon instead of equal sign. Now that I knwo how to do it properly, I certainly will! [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 01:06, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

== Category sort order ==

G'day Jessica, you can set the sort order on a page by using the [[m:Help:Magic words|magic word]] ''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', e.g.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Albatross recipes|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
You can also tell Wiki that the default sort key for categories is the page name, using another magic word: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORT:{{PAGENAME}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (although I haven't used this one myself yet). 

NB: It isn't always appropriate, e.g. when the page name has non-ANSI characters like &quot;ö&quot;, as they are sorted ''after'' all ANSI characters, thus leading to unintuitive sorting. In such cases, I put the page name using only ANSI characters. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:53, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

== Awesome Copyediting ==

I've been watching some of your copyedits on the RC list. Even though small edits tend to be a thankless job and they often go unnoticed, they undoubtedly make wikibooks a better place. You do great work, it's good to have people like you around. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 23:52, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

:Hey, thanks! I always get a bit nervous when I see &quot;you have new messages&quot; because I'm waiting for the day someone yells at me for fixing their commas. It's happened more than once at Wikiproper, and I know people often hold their recipes sacred, so sooner or later, I'm going to ruffle a feather, I know. Thanks very much for appreciating the small edits. They're not much, to be sure, but I like to think they help. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 02:33, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

::'''''Hey''''', what's all this with edits to my [[Cookbook:Mapo Doufu]], huh? But seriously, I'd like to join Whiteknight in congratulating you on your efforts! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:28, 1 May 2007 (UTC)
:::Boring but &quot;me too&quot;, good work (ignore the one above - not from &quot;round here&quot; &lt;g&gt;).  Feel free to call on any of us if you want a hand --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:54, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

::::Dudes! Thank you! You're too nice. I'm here mostly to educate myself about food and cooking - thanks to the wiki cookbook, I have mastered omelets! - and figured I might as well fix the little errors along the way. I only do it because errant punctuation puts me right up the wall. It's a sickness. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 21:29, 1 May 2007 (UTC)
:::::Sideline but this ain't WP (there are some refugees here tho) &lt;g&gt;.  Stick around and teach us about commas!  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:36, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

::::::Yes please Im a'll for punctuation's in the right place's. And sentence structure too thats good to see and grammer and spelling to do stick around we need more help! (Yes, drives me up the wall too!) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:20, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Lime and Marscapone Cheesecake ==

G'day Jessica, I see that this recipe is still under the misspelt title - did you see my reply to your [[User talk:Webaware#Dear sir, please help a fool with titles|question]]? I thought I'd leave it to you to change, so that you'd get a chance to try a page move. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:13, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

== FYI ==

You have probably already seen this, but if not I suggest you take a look at [[Cookbook:Policy]] to see what sorts of standardization we have going on; you seem to be interested in maintaining the quality (at least of the formatting) of the recipes in the cookbook. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:24, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

== Names ==

G'day Jessica, nice work on Cookbook - FAB! However, please be careful with names in recipes - e.g. locality names (Dijon), product names (Marmite, Vegemite), and people's names (Graham crackers - although I'm not sure on the last one, as it's an American product, and they tend to not care about people's names much). cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:52, 8 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

*EBCTCG analysis of individual patient data from 10 trials (PMID 16360786) suggests 5-year outcome benefits:
**Overall LR: 26% vs. 7% (SS)
***If LN- LR: 23% vs. 7% (SS)
***If LN+ LR: 41% vs. 11% (SS)
**BCA mortality: 36% vs. 30% (SS)
**This may translate into preventing 1 BCA death for every 4 local recurrences prevented, at 15 years
**Risks of RT for breast cancer:
***Excess risk of contralateral breast cancer (RR 1.18) associated with older RT regimens
***Excess risk of non-breast cancer deaths (RR 1.12) associated with older RT regimens. Excess mortality from heart disease (RR 1.27) and lung cancer (RR 1.78).


*'''CALGB 9343''' (RTOG 97-02, ECOG) (1994-99) -- 70 years or older, T1N0, ER+ -- TAM. vs RT + TAM
**636 pts. Randomized to tamoxifen +/- RT. 56% &gt;75 y/o. ALND 37%. RT 45/25 + boost 14/7
**'''5-years, 2004''' PMID 15342805 &amp;mdash; &quot;Lumpectomy plus tamoxifen with or without irradiation in women 70 years of age or older with early breast cancer.&quot; Hughes KS et al. N Engl J Med. 2004 Sep 2;351(10):971-7. Median F/U 5 years
***5-yr outcome: LR tamoxifen 4% vs TAM+RT  1% (SS). No difference in rate of mastectomy, distant mets, or 5-yr OS (87% vs 86%)
***Side effects: 
****Physicians: cosmesis, breast pain, edema, hyperpigmentation worse at 1 year; no differences at 4 years
****Patients: breast pain, fibrosis worse at 1 year; breast pain, arm/shoulder stiffness worse at 4 years
***Conclusion: lumpectomy + tamoxifen alone is acceptable for women 70 years or older with T1N0 ER+ tumors
**'''10-years, 2010''' [http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/15_suppl/507 ASCO 2010 Abstract] -- &quot;Lumpectomy plus tamoxifen with or without irradiation in women age 70 or older with early breast cancer.&quot; (Hughes KS, Abstract #507) -- Median f/u 10.5 yrs
***First recurrence local in 9% (Tam) vs 2% (Tam+RT) -- IBTR 8% vs 2%, Axilla 1% vs 0%. RT prolonged the time to first recurrence. 10-year freedom from mastectomy 96% vs 98%, freedom from DM 95% vs 93%. Breast cancer specific survival 98% vs 96%, OS 63% vs 61%. Only 7% of deaths were due to breast cancer.
***Conclusion: RT results in absolute reduction of 6% in IBTR. No impact on overall survival, cancer specific survival, breast conservation, or distant DFS.
**'''2013''' PMID 23690420 -- &quot;Lumpectomy Plus Tamoxifen With or Without Irradiation in Women Age 70 Years or Older With Early Breast Cancer: Long-Term Follow-Up of CALGB 9343.&quot; (Hughes KS, J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul 1;31(19):2382-7.) -- Median f/u 12.6 yrs
***10-yr freedom from locoregional recurrence: 90% (Tam) vs 98% (TamRT). No significant differences in time to mastectomy, time to DM, BCSS, or OS. 10-yr OS was 66% and 67%. 
***Conclusion: &quot;With long-term follow-up, the previously observed small improvement in locoregional recurrence with the addition of radiation therapy remains. However, this does not translate into an advantage in OS, distant disease-free survival, or breast preservation. Depending on the value placed on local recurrence, Tam remains a reasonable option for women age ≥ 70 years with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer.&quot;

*'''Canada multi-institutional''' (1992-2000) - 50 years or older, pT1-2N0
**769 pts. Randomized to tamoxifen +/- RT. Median age 68. BCS, pN staging 83%. Almost all had positive receptors (81%) or unknown receptor status (13%). RT 40/16 + boost 12.5/5 
**'''2004''' PMID 15342804 &amp;mdash; &quot;Tamoxifen with or without breast irradiation in women 50 years of age or older with early breast cancer.&quot; Fyles AW et al. N Engl J Med. 2004 Sep 2;351(10):963-70. Median F/U 5.6 years
***5-yr local: LR tamoxifen 7.7% vs TAM+RT 0.6% (SS); DFS 84% vs 91%. Planned subset outcome (T1 ER+): LR 5.9% vs 0.4% (SS). 
***5-year regional: axillary relapse 2.5% vs. 0.5% (SS). No difference in DM or OS.
**Conclusion: RT in addition to tamoxifen significantly reduces local and axillary recurrence

*'''German GBSG''' (1991-1998) -- 2x2 factorial BCS +/- RT +/- TAM
**Randomized. ''Stopped prematurely due to slow accrual.'' 2x2 factorial. 347 out of target 700 patients with pT1N0, ER+, Grade I-II, EIC-, LVI-, SM-, ALND with minimum 10 LNs. Age 45-75 (&gt;=60 in 54%). Randomized to +/- RT and to +/- TAM. RT 50/25 + boost 10-12 Gy. TAM 30 mg x2 years
**'''6-years; 2004''' PMID 15093574 -- &quot;Radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery; first results of a randomised clinical trial in patients with low risk of recurrence.&quot; (Winzer KJ, Eur J Cancer. 2004 May;40(7):998-1005.) Median F/U 5.9 years
***Outcome: 6-year ITBR BCS 29% vs. BCS+RT 4% vs. BCS+TAM 2% vs. BCS+RT+TAM 3% (SS); regional failure 0% vs 1% vs 0% vs 0%; EFS 64% vs. 86% vs. 92% vs. 84% (SS). Strong (p=0.005) interaction between RT and TAM, since majority of events in BCS only group

      <text xml:space="preserve">Formed Manchester, England, 1977. 

=History=
Starting out as a punk/thrash outfit, '''A Certain Ratio''' have become elder statesmen of Manchester dance music, on the strength of fifteen years of merging an eclectic and colorful mix of sounds and styles. Combining the ‘do-it-yourself’ attitudes of punk with music of a more industrial nature, '''Jeremy Kerr''' (bass), '''Martin Moscrop''' (guitar), '''Peter Terrell''' (keyboards/tape loops) and '''Simon Topping''' (vocals) quickly came to the attention of two of the senior figures of the Manchester music industry. '''Anthony Wilson''' (founder of Factory Records) became the band’s manager after '''Rob Gretton''' - his business partner and original manager of New Order - tipped him off. Factory released ACR’s debut single, “All Night Party”, pressing 5,000 copies in May 1979, which soon sold out.

The band quickly fixed on dance music as the direction they would take, and released the legendary single “Shack Up”, which made the Billboard R&amp;B chart in America. Years ahead of the Manchester dance explosion, ACR built a catalogue of experimental dance releases that in the early 80s stood at odds with the dominant goth and new wave scenes. Joined by drummer '''Donald Johnson''', the band released the well-reviewed THE GRAVEYARD AND THE BALLROOM, put out their first 12” single, “Flight” , and embarked on a US tour that led to another experimental album, TO EACH. Inspired by the sound of Nu Yorican street percussion music the band’s sound was evolving into an almost South American blend of jazz-funk, aided in part by the addition of trumpet and the move of Simon Topping from vocals to percussion. Typified by the 1982 album SEXTET, this style continued to win good press though almost all ACR releases were overlooked by the public. 

Late 1982 saw the exit of two founder members, Peter Terrell and Simon Topping – who left to study congas in New York – and a transitional third album I’D LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, featuring new recruit '''Carol McKenzie''' on vocals. Another new addition, saxophonist '''Tony Quigley''', made 1985’s farewell Factory single, “Wild Party”, their biggest underground hit yet. Leaving on the high note of the Force album, the band then signed to A&amp;M records and set up their own SoundStation studio in their home town. 

ACR’s short dalliance with A&amp;M produced just two criminally ignored albums, GOOD TOGETHER and ACR:MCR. Including the dance hit “Won’t Stop Loving You” (aka “The Big E”), ACR:MCR was released as the Manchester dance explosion of 1989 was in full swing and was in part an attempt to stake a claim on the genre they had pioneered. This paved the way for a move to robsrecords, the label set up by Rob Gretton after he left Factory. By the end of 1992 ACR had built a new following through five single releases and the album UP IN DOWNSVILLE (which contained vocals from Primal Scream’s '''Denise Johnson'''). The band went into another period of hiatus, only surfacing for LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN RATIO, a remix album from Creation Records that accompanied the label’s reissues of the ACR back catalogue. LOOKING FOR… featuring mixes by the likes of Electronic, Sub Sub and The Other Two, created a certain amount of interest, but was sadly lost in a sea of similar remix projects emerging at the time. In 1997, however, CHANGE THE STATION (robsrecords) brought the elder statesmen of gritty northern English dance music back into the public eye with a fine blend of silken vocals courtesy of Denise Johnson and '''Lorna Bailey''', ambient pieces and clean-cut hard-edged rhythm.  

The band have been lying low ever since, though Moscrop now DJs under the ACR banner and Soul Jazz Records have done their bit for the band’s cause with their 2002 release EARLY. 

=Featured Albums=
* Sextet – 1982 – Factory
The epitome of their 80s output, this album mixes jazz with ambient influences. Sleeve design by Ben Kelly, who went on to design Factory’s renowned Hacienda nighclub in Manchester. 

* Acr:Mcr – 1989 – A&amp;M
ACR live, featuring the dance-floor classic “Won’t Sop Loving You”. 

* Up In Downsville – 1992 – robsrecords
ACR’s only album for Rob Gretton includes a brace of dance-floor singles. 

* Early – 2002 – Soul Jazz Records
The definitive two-disc collection showcases the best of the band’s early recordings, featuring both classic cuts and a selection of B-sides, alternate mixes and Peel session recordings. Listening to these tracks now, it’s easy to trace the trajectory of ACR’s influence through the sound of electronic 80s pop, through techno, through house, electronica, and beyond.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amount of substance''' is a physical quantity.  Its symbol is ''n'' and its SI unit is the mole, whose symbol is mol.

One mole of objects is 6.0221415 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; objects.  That's 60 221 415 000 000 000 000 000, or about sixty billion trillion objects.  The number 6.0221415 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; is called ''Avogadro's number'' or ''Avogadro's constant'' and has the symbol ''L''.  This number is usually rounded down to 6.02 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; or 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.

One mole of a molecular substance is 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; molecules.  One mole of a non-molecular substance (such as NaCl) is 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; ''formula units'', e.g. 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; lots of NaCl, so 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; sodium ions and 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; chloride ions.

&lt;small&gt;'''Notes:''' An SI unit named after a person has the first letter of its symbol capitalised, but the full name of the unit written out is all lower case. For example, the unit of energy named after James Joule is called the joule (lower case) and has the symbol J (upper case). An SI unit that is not named after a person has an all-lowercase name and symbol. For example, the unit of amount of substance is called the mole (lowercase) and has the symbol mol (lowercase). The symbols for quantities are always in ''italic'' type, whereas the symbols for units are always in upright (normal) type.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Extra common&quot; sugar?==

This page is the one and only result for a Google search for the phrase &quot;extra common granulated sugar.&quot; I've never heard this phrase. I've changed it to &quot;coarse sugar,&quot; which is often used as a coating for cookies (it is less likely to mean &quot;powdered&quot;, but I'm unsure). If anybody could clarify this, it would be much appreciated. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 18:40, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>/* &quot;Sauerkraut?&quot; */ uncooked, fermented.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Sauerkraut?&quot;==

I only know sauerkraut as a cooked dish made of shredded cabbage. This recipe seems to refer to it as a raw leaf. Can anyone clarify? Thanks. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 22:09, 29 April 2007 (UTC)
:[[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|Sauerkraut]] is actually fermented cabbage. This recipe may be a mistranslation, i.e. they might really mean fresh cabbage. However, sometimes whole cabbages are fermented to make sauerkraut, and maybe that's what they mean here. With any luck, someone with knowledge of Croatian cooking will stumble across this and sort it out one way or another!

''This party food, or just anytime snack recipe was given me by my friend Marvin in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.''

==Ingredients==

===Dry ingredients:===

* 2 boxes Rice Chex
* 1 box Wheat Chex
* ⅔ box Cheerios
* 1 bag thin pretzels
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]]
* 1 pound [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]]
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashews]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

===Sauce:===

* 3 sticks [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* Heaping ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon grease]]
* 1¾ to 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic salt]]
* 2 tablespoons plus dash [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
* Heaping ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] Accent
* 2 heaping tablespoons [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]

==Procedure==

# Melt and mix the sauce ingredients.
# Mix all dry ingredients, but salt, in a large canning pot.
# Sprinkle a little of the sauce mixture over dry ingredients and shake.
# Repeat until sauce is gone.
# Salt the mixture by sprinkling and shaking in the same way.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 1½  to 2 hours at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|200°F]] in covered canning pot.
# Remove frequently to shake.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Put the sauce in a canning jar, and punch several holes in the lid. Sprinkle by turning the jar upside down.
* It took up to seven times of sprinkling and shaking to salt the mixture.
* It is possible to substitute some vegetable oil for the bacon grease, but the result is less authentic.

==Uses==

* PARTY!

''My colleague Venayagaratnam (&quot;Sri&quot; from Sri Lanka) gave me this recipe, and I enjoyed it the first time I made it.''

==Ingredients==

* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed (see Tips)
* 1 small piece [[Cookbook:Ginger|fresh ginger]], crushed
* 8 pieces [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] thighs, cut up
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] or other [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 to 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|butter chicken masala powder]]
* 1½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# In a cooking vessel, put oil and chopped onion, and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]] until light brown.
# In medium-high temperature, add chicken and salt and leave for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring in between.
# Add crushed ginger and garlic and stir for 2 minutes and add curry powder and stir and leave it for 2 minutes.
# Add water and let it [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]] for 5 minutes.
# After that reduce heat to low flame and let it cook for 15 minutes.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* May substitute 1 teaspoon garlic powder for crushed garlic
* It took me several minutes more than 15 to cook it down in the last step.
* &quot;Parampara&quot; Butter Chicken Mix is the spice mix Sri found for me in an Indian food store in North Carolina's Triangle area.

== [[WB:RFA]] ==

I have nominated you for adminship. You are a trustworthy member of this community, and you have been very helpful in your time here. I hope you accept your nomination, i feel that you would make a good admin. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, but no thanks. I don't have the time to be an admin ''and'' make contributions to WB. Admin stuff is my least liked work, and I get enough of it in my day to day life. I do appreciate the sentiment, however. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

== Work, work, work.... ==

You may care to look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/196.22.221.134], I spotted it on RC yesterday but haven't got round to it yet - interesting collection! Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:31, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, I know - likewise, I spotted it and other bits on RC, but have not had the time. I couldn't really ignore a direct request for help in the Staff Lounge, though! Ah well, back to work. Maybe I'll get some WB time again soon. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

::Done some of the moves and fixed SA cuisine where I have - not sure all are &quot;valuable&quot;, will do more when time - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:09, 6 March 2007 (UTC)


== Archolman ==
:No worries, just sing out if you need a hand, either on this (my) talk page or on the [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook: talk page]]. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

:I put some more recipes in there, hope you get the chance to try some. I think I'm getting the hang of the formatting &amp; templating as well.
--[[User:Archolman|Dick]] 00:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== Morning ==

Well you know what I mean.  No problem but did the mail from the new address get to you?  Not sure about filtering etc - not expecting any answers, just wanted to know you'd got it.  Hope all is good - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:48, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
:No, send me another and I'll look at the spam-trapped ones more carefully! But don't expect a quick answer, as I'm off to munch on some [[Cookbook:Mapo Doufu|mapo doufu]] now. Hmmmm chili, garlic, ginger, Szechuan pepper, chased down with a nice shiraz! :P [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

== featured books ==

Hey Webaware, I figured I'd comment here to not clutter up that page with silly musings. I agree that excessive linking to Wikipedia can be a distraction, but I have always taken that convention to mostly be a discouragement to ''only'' use Wikipedia links rather than trying to write information to your focus. I myself find links to Wikipedia extremely useful when I want people to be able to reference a topic that isn't covered by a book but is still nice to know if you forget (e.g. I have a link to what a hyperbolic function is in an engineering book, but if I tried to explain explicitly what every function was it would be a math book, not an engineering book). Regards! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 13:59, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Mattb112885, I agree and also use Wikipedia links. With the book I commented on, it seemed however that there was actually quite a lot of that going on, and that the book could have benefited from turning many of the WP links into pages, or perhaps glossary entries. I just thought I'd make mention of it, in case it had any bearing on that book's prospective status as Featured Book. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:14, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

==Fixing Metrication==
I know that 285ml is a better conversion of a half pint but I chose to use 275ml as people are (and often can't) never as precise.  Similarly conversions of temperature will always be rounded as figures like 176c just sound ridiculous.  I just wish that Wiki foundation would make the sensible decision to only use metric measurements or at least provide some kind of automatic conversion so the whole world isnt baffled by American measurements. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:46, 28 April 2007 (UTC)
:In that case, 300ml would have been better, as it is the usual conversion of a UK pint to mLs. I agree completely with you on the accuracy thing, as I've seen lots of silly conversions in here; my particular pet peeve is conversions of fluid ounces to grams. As for &quot;only metric&quot;, that just doesn't work with recipes that have been handed down in terms of relative measures like cups and teaspoons, and often conversion to metric even of pounds and ounces loses information (think of ½lb tins etc.) Our best bet, I feel, is to just preserve the original information and provide sensible metric equivalents. I only wish people would consider doing that when they submit a recipe with measurements all in furlongs and Fahrenheit! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:52, 28 April 2007 (UTC)
::No problem.  Feel free to make any corrections.  I'm never sure what to do with measurements in 'cups'.  Flour is about 150g for a cup and other solids are approx 240g for a cup - but is there any point?  Do you think that measurements in cups should be left as they are or converted?  I also generally take an ounce to be 28g (or 30g for larger measurements), a pound as 450g.  Not usually any problem with converting temperatures but obviously I sensibly round up/down - 350c=180c, etc.  I've never bothered converting teaspoon measurements as these are usually universal or minimal measurements anyway.  Thanks for checking over the changes anyway.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:59, 28 April 2007 (UTC)
:::See [http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/gram_calc.htm here] for some general conversions, and note that I think you're working in UK cups whereas most recipes here are in US cups. I generally don't bother converting cups, because they are relative terms and many recipes with measurements in cups have ''everything'' in relative terms (cups, teaspoons, tablespoons). However, where there is a mix of relative and by-weight, I think that metric equivalents are a good idea. 
:::In general, I don't like measurements in cups for relaying information, because my metric cupful of flour could weigh more or less than your metric cupful of flour based on how we separately pack the flour into the cup (with more or less pressure on the flour), in addition to the climatic conditions around us. When brewing and baking bread, I do everything by weight. For most cooking, however, it doesn't matter much, especially with flour, as the cook needs to adjust the relative amounts of flour, water and other ingredients to suit themselves, the climate, and the batch of flour they are using - you know, stick a whisk through it and see if it needs another splash!

Like the traditional [[Cookbook:Spanish_Omelet|Spanish omelet]], the frittata is a thick, hearty omelet filled with vegetables. A frittata may be filled with any variety of vegetables, cheeses, pastas, or meats. This recipe is for a simple vegetarian one.

==Ingredients==
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 1 bunch of fresh [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], trimmed and chopped
* 8 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 3 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (whole fat milk is best, but part skim would be fine.)
* 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] or 1 teaspoon dried basil
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* pinch of ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 3 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]], grated

==Equipment==
*12-inch (30cm) oven-safe [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] (i.e. no plastic or wooden handles)
*medium bowl
*[[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] or fork

==Procedure==
# In a bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, basil, salt and pepper. Set aside.
# Preheat broiler. Heat the olive oil in a large, heat-safe skillet over medium heat. 
# When the oil is hot, add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about a minute. 
# Add the chopped asparagus and sauté for about 5 minutes until it begins to become tender. 
# Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook about 4 minutes or until bubbles begin to form in the center of the eggs. 
# Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top of the eggs and immediately transfer the pan to the oven. 
# Cook under the broiler until the top puffs and browns, about 3 minutes. 
# Remove the pan from the oven (careful, it will be hot!) and cut the frittata into wedges. 

Serve immediately with crusty bread and fresh fruit for a light spring dinner. Wrap leftovers (if there are any) in tin foil and chill in refrigerator. Leftover frittata makes a great sandwich: just allow the eggs to come to room temperature and place them between two slices of buttered, toasted bread. 

Serves 2.

==Variations==
* Try bitter greens like [[Cookbook:Swiss Chard|Swiss chard]], ruby chard, or [[Cookbook:Broccoli rabe|broccoli rabe]].
* [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|Bell peppers]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], and [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]] are all delicious in a frittata. 
* For a meat version, try adding cubed [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], chopped [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]], or any variety of [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]].
* Different cheeses can be used, such as fontina, cheddar, havarti, Emmenthal, or Pecorino Romano. 
* You may also add half a cup of cooked, drained [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] such as linguine, spaghetti, or even macaroni. 
* Adding breadcrumbs to the beaten eggs is another good way of adding bulk.

Really, the possibilities are endless.

This system is often bundled with such programming tools as, Rexx, C, C++, C, COBOL and RPG.  It boasts a fairly herrendous (sp~) editor known as SEU, which one could probably draw some contrast with vi.

Lore of Learning captures timeless principles of learning for teachers and learners alike. 
The book is written for contemporary times as technology is transforming the way people go about learning and gain access to information and knowledge, but draws on insights from as far back as the earliest writings on knowledge and learning, and from a range of cultures.

==Table of Contents ==

The structure (volumes, parts, chapters) is not pre-determined.

The idea is to cover learning through the ages, describe the relevance of the ancient and modern thinking in the present, and to speculate about the future. Something like:

# Preface
# Introduction
# Learning in Ancient Times 
# Learning in the 20th Century
# Contemporary Pedagogical Praxis
# Future Scenarios
# Global, Planetary Learning
# Resources

The sections/parts/volumes could be structured for the users in completely different ways ... [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lore_of_Learning/Process/Discuss_Structure discuss].

==Readership(s)==

''Lore of Running''&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Tim Noakes|Noakes, Tim]]. 2003. ''The Lore of Running.'' (4th edition) [[w:Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0-87322-959-2&lt;/ref&gt; by [[w:Tim Noakes|Tim Noakes]], which inspired this book, was clearly directed at marathon and ultra distance athletes. Lore of Learning will also need to decide on where to focus - or perhaps create several volumes, for example: 

* by educational level and/or subject area: 

 * OCW and OER in Tertiary Institutions
 * University Science and Engineering
 * Postgraduate Humanities
 * Technical and Vocational Learning 
 * Self Learning for Employability
 * College Level Science
 * K12 Science and Mathematics
 * Becoming a software development guru (see for example, [http://www.pedagogicalpatterns.org pedagogical patterns].
 * Foreign language learning
 * Sport and martial arts (physical - mental)
 * Fine Arts

==Inspiration==

The theme suggests integrating experience through the ages into contemporary technology-enhanced learning to meet the challenges of today and the future. 

Lore of Running (Tim Noakes), inspired the title of this book - while thinking of better acronyms for OER - &quot;LORE&quot; - libre and open resources for education - removing the barriers to social constructionist learning and peer production in the networked knowledge society. However, this book is *not* about OER/FLORE, though there may emerge references and even chapters on this later.

Much has been written on OER and the processes for establishing OCW in an institution, but more is needed on pedagogy. What principles apply in a networked world, and how are these best applied and accentuated with current and future technology?

A thesis of this book is that the way people learn has actually not changed that much over the millennia. We learn from our parents, our friends, from nature, from all our experiences - an integral part of life. It is hoped that this book will capture the wisdom of the ages about learning, and ultimately illustrate how we may broaden the reach of this wisdom, amplifying the learning of everyone in a connected world.

===The Timeless Way of Building===

Alexander (1979) published this book on architecture which has inspired a patterns movement covering many disciplines. My own interest came from software development initially (see below), and has more recently extended into other fields that have caught my attention (ecology, psychology, pedagogy, sport, physiotherapy, ... actually, the list is endless, hence &quot;knowledge patterns&quot;).

===Software Design Patterns===

Peruse [http://martinfowler.com/books.html this list] for example, and note the titles concerning patterns.


== Writing Style ==

The intention is for this book to express a feeling of timelessness.

This is a principle to be kept in mind while writing - not a prescription.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWAN QWAN]

==Multilingual and Multicultural==

Consider translations and cultural conversion - from whatever language/culture the first version of a chapter may have been written.

==Lateral Ideas==

===Link to Second Life?===

Link this to SecondLife (or preferably an open source standards compliant equivalent which enables people to expand the grid) and encourage people to (re)create learning experiences that have worked through the ages - from Socrates to OER to hip-hop and mobile learning etc. ... with access to the legendary gurus in various cultures ....

For example:

* take a walk through Socrates's garden and ... know thyself, or 
* visit the Swami/ Zen master/ Sufi/ ... and gain some enlightenment, or
* take a walk through the Fynbos with Dave Richardson and learn about alien plant invasions in this environment, or 
* come to this meeting room ... to participate in a town planning exercise, and learn about multi-stakeholder management in such endeavours, 
* etc.

The book becomes a living growing document describing learning and teaching through the ages, and modern &quot;implementations&quot; . I hope people are already creating such learning opportunities ... any links? [[User:Ktucker|Ktucker]] 09:42, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''POSIX.5'''  is an IEEE (IEEE Standard 1003.5b-1996) and ISO (ISO/IEC 14519:2001) standard  defining an Ada interface to the [[w:POSIX|POSIX]] system calls.

The scope for the standard is the same as in POSIX.1 (C API) but defines a thick binding for the interface, thus benefiting from Ada features. Some functionality provided by POSIX.1, but already present in Ada, is skipped. The ISO standard is currently being revised [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG9/n479.pdf] [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG9/n477.pdf].

There exists an open-source implementation for GNAT called Florist (Florida State University/Forest), originally written by the Florida State University and eventually maintained by AdaCore.

The following compilers are known to provide an implementation of the standard: ''Object Ada for Linux'' [http://www.aonix.com/pdf/oa-linux.pdf], GNAT [http://www.adacore.com/home/products/gnatpro/toolsuite/libraries/], MAXAda [http://www.ccur.com/pdf/cpb-sw-maxada.pdf] and PowerAda [http://www.ocsystems.com/user_guide/powerada/html/powerada-93.html#MARKER-9-1133]. 

An incomplete implementation for GNAT over Windows is called Win32POSIX.

This wasn't the correct place to create it, so I took the liberty of creating a new book for you: [[Learn Hebrew]]. You can create your book here.

== Before introduction ==
This might seem as an extremely complex way of solving the problem of negative thoughts in the chatroom, when encountering hurtful conversations.

== Introduction ==
This section was made from my experiences of people going to chat, getting disappointed and leaving, and telling in public they left because of the chat.
This chapter will analyze in detail (extreme detail) of a solution or solutions regarding the various problems that occur, and the many possibilities of their solution.

== Further highly abstract(warning) information about this section ==
Various things in this chapter is also intended to be used as a &quot;reference point&quot;. This might mean that you could ask the person  if they agree to some guidelines that are presented in various sections.
These will be shown later in a specific &quot;Guidelines&quot; section, which will have the use of letting a person read them and think if they agree.

== Chatting in general ==
Chatting is when you communicate with other people by sending them text messages, and they do what you do too.

== Problems and solutions ==
This section is general information on what to do in various situations.

=== Bullying in the chatroom ===
This is when a person sends you an abusive message to the chatroom.

==== solution (abusing them too) ====
*You reply in the chatroom also by sending them an insulting message back yourself.

===== Good things that come out of this action =====
*You might feel better by insulting the other person in return.
*The public might know you did not like the insulting message.

===== Bad things that come out of this action =====
*Your wasting time on chatting with the person that insulted you.

==== solution (telling once) ====
*You reply to them in a private message: &quot;I'm sorry, I can't concentrate on what you say today. I must filter your messages for the good of both of us to prevent misunderstanding, and I'm looking forward to talk to you another day&quot;

sidenote: Good and Bad sections not further analyzed yet

==== solution (sending some messages) ====
You send them a private message &quot;I found your message abusive type_their_nickname_here. Was your intention to type an abusive message?&quot;

===== Their possible responses =====

====== They say &quot;yes&quot; ======
Then you won't send them a message again, regardless of what they do, and you might technically ignore them.

====== They say &quot;no&quot; ======
*You send them a message back &quot;ok&quot;.
*If you come to this section a second time where they have said &quot;no&quot; then do this:
**Send the person in a private message: &quot;I'm sorry. I think we are misinterpreting each other today. I can't concentrate regarding what you say to me, so I'll have to filter out your messages for the good of both of us&quot;

====== They don't send you a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; message ======
*Then you send them in a private message: &quot;I'm sorry. I think we are misinterpreting each other today. I can't concentrate regarding what you say to me, so I'll have to filter out your messages for the good of both of us&quot;
sidenote: Now you might not mean this, but that is the message according to this solution, well it can't be perfect but I'm sure it will help to a degree.

=== Standard responses ===
note: Whether these responses are sent in the chatroom or privately is not covered in this section, but only responses are covered.

The purpose of this section is to type a certain thing for various occasions that might happen. For example, each time you feel abused by a message you might type something standard like &quot;I have not abused you, and even you by trying to abuse me, I will not fall for your wish to reply back and start a flame war. I can keep my self control instead of wasting time by doing such a thing&quot;. Now on to the practical part.

==== Disturbed response named: &quot;short disturbed response&quot; ====
&quot;Hi. I'm sorry I can't reply any more to your messages.&quot;

== Guidelines ==
This section was originally made in the case that you were having a bad mood in the chatroom.
Further on this section was made as an idea of showing a certain set of rules to a person. Asking if a certain person agrees to them and if not certain actions might be taken by you.
note: this is not just for others. You might also state publicly that you follow a certain guideline, because of your current mood. This can help others understand how you feel, or close to how you feel...and knowing that you tell about it publicly might make you feel more calm.

An example: This might confuse, but you might state for example just when you enter the chatroom that you are not in great mood, and you would like to chat calmly, or only through private chat messages.

==== Guidelines for personal use ====
These are guidelines that people might not need to view, and might just be aware of that you follow certain guidelines that regulate your behaviour. (yes, you can regulate yourself by these)

===== guideline1 communicating in private with friends =====
The following described under &quot;content:...&quot; is information about this specific guideline

content: I'm in no good mood, and I will not take part in the discussion in the chatroom, but only send messages to people I already know, and if I find none, then as of this rule I will still not type any message in the chatroom.

==== Guidelines for public use ====
I will also use a new term called &quot;ruleset&quot;, although I can't describe it yet since my thoughts are very abstract.
The purpose of the section is to type about guidelines that other people will view including you.

===== ruleset1 confusion prevention (complex) =====
First the reason for this ruleset, is that it's expected you are confused while at the chatroom. Since you are confused, you might wish to avoid messages that confuse you, and you might want a balance where all messages that confuse you are filtered out. That's what this ruleset is about.

#Will not reply to things that confuse you
##Example: Someone says &quot;oh yeah&quot; and you can not or do not wish to get involved in the discussion that gave this response from a certain person. So you will ignore that message.
#If opinions confuse you, or make you ponder which you don't want to do according to this ruleset, you might filter it out, but only after you've noted 3 confusing things from a certain person.
##example: person A says at 3 different times &quot;lalala hoho&quot; and &quot;they should not be allowed to do that&quot; and &quot;yehhh, oops&quot;, and let's say that these 3 message confused you , then you filter the nickname out.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Section on why I created this and named it X ==
*reason I created this section: Many people have left both forums and the chatrooms for a very long time because they've had bad experiences. So I made this section to analyze what are the problems, and type about solutions.
*reason I named it X: I'm not yet sure to what chapter it will belong, or if it will belong. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 18:43, 30 April 2007 (UTC)


== A problem solving technique ==
Hi! I'm not an aspie but I would still like to contribute this little problem-solving technique that might be useful:


Whenever someone says or does something that you perceive as hurtful, do this:

1. '''Identify''' what you perceived as hurtful and tell it to the person responsible for the hurtful remark or action (eg. &quot;That was a hurtful thing to say&quot;).

2. Tell that person how the remark makes '''YOU feel''' (eg. &quot;It makes me sad to hear that&quot;).

3. Ask the person to '''clarify''' what he or she means and what '''intent''' he or she had (eg. &quot;What did you mean by that?&quot; and &quot;Did you really mean to hurt me?&quot;).


It is mostly helpful to try to respond in a positive or humourous way, thereby disarming the situation and getting an upper hand on the other person. A conversation example:


Person 1: ''You suck big time at X!''

Person 2: ''Ough! That hurts man! Someone please remove this dagger out of my chest! Do you really mean to be this evil?''


Note that Person 2 did all the steps described above. If joking doesnt make the person stop, you might have to explain things in a more serious manner, eg:


''Saying things like that hurts people. Now I am a bit sad because you said that. Is that what you intended to?''


There are a number of outcomes when you respond like this:


1. You have misunderstood the remark and the other person tells you this.

2. The other person apologize.

3. The other person tries to re-explain the remark in a more positive light because he/she understands that the remark was perceived as hurtful by you.

4. The other person continues the abuse. If this happens, discontinue the conversation because it's not worth your time or energy.


Hope this is helpful!

== Comprehensive reorganization ==
There have been a number of fragmented conversations recently all aimed at reorganizing some important pages here on wikibooks, and hopefully to produce a more efficient system of discussion. I am going to summarize some of the important points here, and interweave them with some of my suggestions:
#There is a push to reorganize some of the &quot;get help&quot; pages into a single resource. Specifically, the [[WB:VIP]] and [[WB:AN]] pages, along with new sections for requesting other types of help and services from administrators and staff are going to be merged into a comprehensive new page. It has not been decided what the name of this new page will be.
#The staff lounge is far too long, and there is some sentiment that we should break it up into a number of subject-specific subpages. The staff lounge would become predominantly a wikipedia-style disambiguation page that will direct people to the appropriate venue. The general concensus is that there should not be too many subpages to the staff lounge, because that will only create more confusion.
#Some of the proposed subpages of the staff lounge are:
#*news (points to the bulletin board)
#*help (points to the new &quot;get help&quot; page, discussed in point 1)
#*announcements (points to a page where we can announce other discussions, such as important RfA votes, and policy votes)
#*basic help (points to a page where people can ask for general editing help)
#*subject help (points to the study help desk)
#*General discussion 
#The staff lounge page can be kept as either the general discussion area, or a general noticeboard to post links to important discussions happening in the subpages.

While all of these points won't necessarily be implemented, there is some change coming to a number of pages here on wikibooks. I would like people to post their questions/comments about this project here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
:I think that a reorganisation of the help sections would be a good idea, as specific help items can be dificult to find, especially for new users. I also believe that a reorganisation of the staff lounge may have the potential to be a good idea.

== Image Delinking ==

Several users on this project are busy dealing with our backlog of untagged images. Previously, we had been deleting images indiscriminately, a process that drew criticism. These image deletions, while appropriate under policy, have created another problem with books being filled with red links where images used to be. An effort is underway now to correct these red links, attempt to find suitable replacements, and contact the original uploaders for more detailed copyright information.

'''I would like to ask the community therefore, not to delete these red links''', and instead report them to myself or [[User:Iamunknown]] as they are found. All help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Probably OR problem ==

Herbythyme and I were discussing the book [[ATALL]], which appears to be an approach developed by the main author and added to by his students. On his website, he writes &quot;I am currently focusing my research activities on what I call Autonomous Technology-Assisted Language Learning (ATALL). ATALL involves using and developing technology, in particular Internet media and communication tools, to enhance education in foreign-languages and cultures.&quot; 

While it's a good, active book, it's probably something that should be transwikied to wikiversity because of the Original Research component of it (if I understand correctly, it's more or less describing the author's pedagogical approach, which is precisely what Wikiversity is designed to do).

I thought I would bring this up here rather than on VfD, but perhaps it belongs there? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== wikibooks junior physics: the elements ==

I just discovered Wikibooks, and see that the section on physics needs a lot of filling in. For example, under the heading, &quot;common non-metal elements&quot;, nothing exists! Right underneath, however, one common non-metal element, hydrogen, has an article already written under the heading &quot;published articles.&quot; How can I have this entry appear under &quot;common non-metal elements&quot; without necessarily removing it from the other list, where someone may want to find it?

Also, how can I add new, obviously-needed, elements to the list(s) while still conforming to the rather nice format that already was used for other elements?  Is there a template available for that? I have the ability to fill it in, but want it to appear in a consistent fashion.

Thanks.

:Most of those pages already exist, and there are links on the main page. All the elements have subpages of the form &quot;Wikijunior The Elements/XXX&quot;. where XXX is the name of the element using title caps. You can add links to these pages in the non-metal elements part by using this format. Links that show up as blue lead to pages that already exist, and links that are red do not yet exist. Please let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:43, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Can I do a complete rewrite of a book not started by me? ==

Dear all,

I am a newbie and if this sounds stupid, kindly forgive me. I am working on the book on [[Principles of Finance]]. I wanted to know if I could do a major rewrite as right now the thing is not in proper shape and I would like to arrange it in an orderly fashion. Can any of the senior editors help me out with this. Also, wanted to know if I could create a table of contents of my own instead of the default one that is being displayed on the page right now??

Thanks in advance and sorry once again if I asked a stupid noob question.

--Venky 13:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:Looks like the book isn't all that active, so I'd say go ahead and be bold! The Table of contents on that page is just for the headers... you can make it disappear, but you can't really re-order it unless you reorder the headers. Probably your best bet would be to start making chapters... you can make &quot;red links&quot; to the chapters from the main page by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/CHAPTERNAME/]] on the main page, then click on the red link and start writing. &lt;/nowiki&gt; So far there is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Principles+of+Finance&amp;namespace=0 only an author's page and a to-do list] as chapters. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Subprojects, etc. ==

I realise we've been discussing wikiprojects a bit, but it seems to me a more specific kind of &quot;project protocol&quot; might be useful for getting the individual books organized. I've brought up pieces of this before, but I'm hoping we can re-address the topic a bit.

There is often talk about each book having it's &quot;community&quot;, and it seems to me that some steps towards making that sort of thing &quot;official&quot; might be a wise idea, since the various books sometimes have radically different approaches to style, inclusion, and so on. 

What might be good is if each of the larger projects has some easy to find features, such as:
*A &quot;policy&quot; or &quot;LMOS&quot; page, which defines the scope and standards of the project
*A &quot;contributors&quot; &quot;community&quot; or &quot;authors&quot; page where contributors sign in to be recognized (book-specific userboxes would be nice too!)
*A &quot;project&quot; or &quot;discussion&quot; page where policies, to-do lists, and chapter deletion are discussed (the deletion of chapters from books with large, active communities probably doesn't belong on [[WB:VFD]]). 
*An &quot;interproject communications&quot; page, with boxes similar to sister project boxes that might be used from other books (or indeed other projects). Perhaps &quot;book-specific welcome templates&quot; could be added there as well for new contributors to a particular book.

The idea is to have a &quot;standard notation&quot; that will give any wikibookian who is aware of the standard some quick and easy access to these pages. For example, you could find if the book has specific policies by going to Bookname/Policy or Bookname/LMOS, find the contributors by going to Bookname/Contributors, ask questions about the book on Bookname/Discussion, and so on. This would perform a similar function that is provided by wikipedia's wikiprojects... essentially making it easier for new contributors to find their way around, and for other wikibookians to use when they need to know something. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:I would strongly support this, under the condition that we specify what happens if a book doesnt have these things you've pointed out. Many books hvae only one author, or no active authors, and these are not likely to develop a set of standardized policies or even an LMOS for future contributors or editors to follow. For instance, we cannot leave the VfD of individual chapters up to the book community if that book has no community to speak of. If we created a template with links to a &quot;/Contributors&quot; page, and a &quot;/Projects&quot; page (among others), and we automatically tagged all new books with this template, authors would be more likely to use them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:55, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

::Well, I don't think this should be a requirement, but rather an option. A modified welcome template for those who start new books might be a good idea, but on the other hand if they don't get collaborators right away the /Project page in particular might emphasize a certain kind of loneliness that is inherent in the writing of wikibooks, and particularly discouraging to wikipedians who expect more input. It seems to me that some sort of combination of this and parts of what's on [[WB:RFC]] might ease the way... my hope is that we can find a way to both encourage new contributors while at the same time giving the established contributors of a book a way of relating their aspirations, lessons learned, etc. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

As a new member of wikibooks I think this sounds like an excellent idea and one which I felt was missing when I first began to look at the different books.  After all each book is a project in itself, so a project page makes a lot of sense.  I wasn't sure about the policy of adding &quot;non-book&quot; subpages, would it be acceptable just to add a &quot;/Projects&quot; page to a given book?  Would it make sense for each project page to have standard sections such as: what is in and out of scope for that book; A list of tasks needing attention on that book; a projetc log etc..? I'm sure we can come up with some others--[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 19:55, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

=='''Appropriate to use Wikibook for Tech Manual?'''==
I'm a member of the Experimental Aircraft Assocation.  We build airplanes in our spare time.  Would it be appropriate to use Wikibooks for creating a detailed &quot;User Guide - Technical Manual&quot; on how to use a specific manufacturer's Electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS)?

The current manual isn't bad, but we have a Yahoo Group of about 600 members that use the EFIS system, and we would like to improve the existing technical manual in a collaborative manner.  The company that makes the EFIS comes out with updates to the technical manual about once a year.  The Yahoo group would like to create updates much more frequently (say once per month or quarter) and greatly improve the content.

We would have to obtain company approval to do this given the GNU licensing...but before we press the question...is writing a tech manual using WikiBooks appropriate?  Or should I look for another collaborative writing environment?

Thanks for the great site!!!

== Covers for print version ==

I have created two templates: {{tl|print version cover}} creates &quot;cover&quot; of a book when the book does not have a separate cover page. Second one, {{tl|print version cover text}}, was designed to be used on separate cover pages, to add link to original book (required by GFDL) and &quot;GFDL disclaimer&quot;. Detailed descriptions can be found on template pages, together with application examples.

How do you find these templates? Should GFDL disclaimer be more formal (&quot;Copyright... Permission is granted... with no Invariant Sections...&quot; etc.)? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

Is it just me or does the main page of Wikibooks looks awful?  Until you scroll down all you can see are rows of boring text and not even a single image outside of the sidebar.  I rarely visit the main page as I usually head straight for the RC list but most new users see that depressing main page on their first visit.  I certainly wouldn't stay around if that's what greeted me.  Anyone else have an opinion about how the current main page looks?

:This issue comes up about every six months or so... and for a good reason.  This is the &quot;main face&quot; of Wikibooks and is the best way to introduce this project.

:One of the issues that has come up is the elimination of the &quot;Book of the Month&quot; and &quot;Collaboration of the Month&quot; in January, because it was felt that a general cleanup of Wikibooks needed instead of pushing for any specific Wikibook.  I believe this to be a failure, so far as it has made the main page very empty and nothing was put into its place.  So unless there is a serious objection, I would like to reinstitute those two &quot;features&quot; of Wikibook for March.  If they are not restarted, I would like to have something very significant that would take their place that would also feature a significantly completed Wikibook or something that certainly is &quot;the best of Wikibooks&quot; that would rotate every month.... in essence, a Wikibook of the Month.  I also don't think it should be arbitrarily decided by the admins or a special committee, but by the rank and file Wikibookians.

:The main point of the Collaboration of the Month was to pick one particular Wikibook that could become a featured Wikibook, but at the same time needed a serious infusion of support and effort.  I don't think this need has passed either, and the real question again is how is this Wikibook selected?  For this particular Wikibooks feature, I think it was abused and turned into mainly a P.R. campaign by the group developing that particular Wikibook which became featured.  At the same time, if competing Wikibooks try to get the same coverage, what seems to be the problem here?

:de.wikibooks has a feature we don't have which is, roughly translated, a &quot;finalization of the month&quot;, where a significant Wikibook that is near ready for publication has requested a formal editorial review.  This is essentially like the Wikipedia A-Class review, but is done on one Wikibook per month.

:We have also in the past had a statistical summary for &quot;growing Wikibooks&quot; and other interesting statistics.  I know that these features can be &quot;gamed&quot;, but it might also encourage the primary activity here of actually developing content, which is something we need to refocus here on Wikibooks.  A statistical graph showing current growth of Wikibooks is also something that could add some extra splash and pizzaz to the main page.  Raw information about Wikibooks (the full text of all en.wikibooks content) can be [http://download.wikimedia.org/enwikibooks/ downloaded here], and there are some tables that don't require the full db download in order to be useful and allow comparisons between various Wikibooks.  The full en.wikibooks data dump (minus images) is 86 MB, for those who want to be adventurous and try to plow through that much data.

:The point to all of this is that there are things that can be legitimately added to the main page that either have been there in the past or have been done by other Wikibooks projects in other languages... and have enhanced the appearance overall of this project.  I agree that this is something that needs to be worked on.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

I'd also like to see the return of the Book of the Month and Collaboration (although I agree that Collaboration seems to be just another book of the month in practice).  If we can't agree to return these features then we should at least move the Categories panel (Natural Sciences, Computing, Social Sciences, Humanities, Miscellaneous and Special Groups) to the top of the main page as this is more appealing visually and less cluttered.  I also like the idea of 'Finalization of the month' and this could also be an added feature in Wikijunior and the Cookbook.  Also maybe we could have a Cookbook feature on the main page because Cookbook pages tend to have nice bright images, somewhat which is much needed on our main page.  Any comments?

:I think having &quot;featured books&quot;, &quot;collaboration of the month&quot;, etc. on the main page is a bit silly... almost ''all'' of the material here is &quot;not ready for the presses&quot;, but it ''is'' a good start. IMHO, the main page should be aimed towards inviting people to contribute, rather than inviting institutions to &quot;keep us in mind, because some day we'll have some good textbooks for you.&quot; I would even go so far as to suggest that &quot;completed books&quot; don't need listing on the main page at all, except perhaps at the bottom of the page. 

:I think we need to be realistic about this: it takes an enormous amount of time and effort to write textbooks... Wikipedia is essentially a single (many volumed if it were paper) reference book which has tens of thousands of contributors and yet is still not completed after several years of hard work. Wiktionary likewise. Wikibooks is responsible for writing all the other non-fiction books in the library... if your mental image is anything like mine, I've made my point. 

:We also need to be hopeful about this: given a decade or two, someone might be able to go to college (or high school, etc.) and see that GFDL license on the back pages of most of their textbooks, and be a few bucks less into debt because ''we'' (you and me, the Wikibookians) have come up with the world's best textbooks.

::*Should we be focused more on readers or contributors? Considering our dearth of &quot;really good&quot; material, I agree with Johnny that we should probably be catering to the latter for now.
::*What books do we want to advertise, and how do we want to advertise, and how exactly do we want to advertise them? Do we want a &quot;Book of the Month&quot;, or a &quot;book of the Week&quot;, or a &quot;Book of the day&quot;? Who is going to take charge of the advertisment on the main page?

:::Any book requires both good contributors and good readership. Without the former, there's nothing much to read, whereas without the latter, there's little point in writing it.
:::With the way that Google works currently, I imagine that readership wouldn't really be that much of a problem - the Wiki projects are well represented in search engines, often appearing in the first few links on the first page of a related search.

After changes the main page is very unfunctional. We should advertise ourselves by showing the best we have. Instead, we give just a list of categories. This is not the way. We have to convince visitors that there's something finished, worth reading on Wikibooks. Look at the main page on Wikipedia: the list of categories is very small, most content is &quot;self-advertising&quot;: fragments of good articles.

List of books near completition is essential on main page. We need it to boost Google PageRank of our books, to encourage visitors to try out some good books. Currently the main page is too spartan. There is even not enough content to make main page as long as list of interwikis on the left. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

Hi, I've requested a transwiki move for a Wikipedia article but I'm not sure I've put it in the right place. I placed it on [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]] but now I've discovered [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log]] and the related page [[Wikibooks:Pages to be transwikied]] which seems to have a different list. Which is the correct one? [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 11:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:You listed it in the right place, just no-one saw it :). Unfortunately there were too many edits on the wikipedia side for the import tool to handle though... the best I could get was all edits up to June, 2006. If you like, you can just copy from there and leave a note on the talk page about the copying (include a link to the current diff). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

This book, IMHO, would be improved by adding a '''Categories''' section to the title page for (among others?):
:Appetizers
:Canapes
:Tapas
:Breakfast
:Lunch
:Entres
:Deserts
Authors may then categorize entries with appropriate (multiple) tags that will get their entries listed for the category.&lt;br&gt;

Also a '''User Rating''' box, along the lines of Amazon's for books, say a 1 to0 5 scale, that dispalys a running average of what others think of the recipe, presumably having tried it. I don't know  how to impelement this; but some Admin may do that for us. Yes? [[User:Frankatca|Frankatca]] 19:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

How do I find out the copyright status for images I wish to use for my book. Kindly advise on the same. Is there a way to identify it? Thanks in advance.

: Current international copyright law says all images are copyrighted by default. If there is no explicit statement of releasing an image into public domain or licencing it under a free license, there is no way to use it. One exception is a narrow scope of [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy|fair use]] we have on Wikibooks. Old images become public domain 70 years after death of their author. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== Is this a Wikibook? ==
Hi. I've been putting together a wiki-version of an academic art book called New Media Art, by Mark Tribe. Tribe teaches an entire course based on the book at Brown University, and I know it is used in classes at other institutions. I started to put it up on wikibooks, since that seemed to be where it fit best (rather than wikipedia or wikiversity). You can see the content so far at: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/New_Media_Art. I was soon warned by two editors that it was not appropriate content -- that it was encyclopedic/macropedic and thus not a &quot;textbook.&quot; Though the content of the book is structured in an encyclopedic way (a series of sections, each on a particular artist or artist group), it can still be considered an art historical text. The introduction, for instance, gives a broad overview of the New Media art tradition and ties together the artists discussed in the rest of the book. I've already been told that the content I've put up so far will probably be deleted. Where does this book belong, if not in wikibooks?

Your help is greatly appreciated! I'm new to the whole wiki communication thing, but I think you can leave me a comment on my &quot;talk&quot; page: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Lblissett

Thanks again. [[User:Lblissett|Lblissett]] 20:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)Lblissett

:The &quot;not a macropedia&quot; guideline was created to help distance our project from our more popular older sister, wikipedia. The idea behind the guideline is that a book should not just contain information, but it should also ''teach'' that information to a specific target audience. This book is still young, and you are a new contributor, and I think it is unlikely that any new user would understand these little difference from the start. 
:The fact that this book currently resembles a macropedia does not mean that it will always remain so, and If you were willing to work to fix the formatting (under no particular timeline), then I am inclined to say that you and your book should stay here. I will even be willing to help you out, if this is your intention. 
:By the way, how closely is your book related to Mark Tribe's book? You can't just copy+paste information from a copyrighted book to this website, unless you have his express permission. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Monitoring Wikijunior ==
Today (Fri, 9 Feb 2007), I scanned the Wikijunior page, and, under &quot;current titles&quot; read the list copied below. It, and the introductory paragraph (copied at the very bottom), are clearly cases of vandalism, but I see no way of deleting this stuff myself -- that page seems not to be editable, or perhaps I'm too unfamiliar with the protocol to find out how to edit it.  I hope someone who knows how will rectify it soon!

Welcome to Wikijunior
The aim of this project is to produce a series of full-color booklets for children aged 8 to 11. The subjects will be appealing to kids, and the writing will be light and friendly. These booklets will be richly illustrated with pornographic photographs, diagrams, sketches, and original drawings. The texts will also follow a format, so that each booklet, while different, will also have certain common features.

::There was a discussion on Wikipedia to set up a group of users that would fall somewhere between &quot;administrator&quot; and &quot;registered user&quot;.  I was actually quite supportive of the idea, as I believe the full admin powers are perhaps a little to overwhelming and perhaps powerful for those overzealous new users who are just starting out.  The main feature to be given to this group was the ability to do the quick reverts when doing a recent changes review (or looking at your watch list) as an attempt to help fight against vandalism.  Adding a level to page protection could be viewed in similar light, where people who are generally trusted could do edits on semi-protected pages but wouldn't have to deal with the hassels of doing all of the duties of being an administrator.  Unfortunately (from my viewpoint), the proposal was defeated on Wikipedia.  We do have the ability to semi-protect pages so that only registered users with more than a certain number of edits and has been around for more than a few days would be allowed to edit a page.  This keeps the typical vandal (generally they create the account, do the damage on the same day immediately, then throw the account away) from being able to do too much damage, but allows serious user the ability to edit.  We have had some complaints about this when done on voting pages, but I havn't seen too many problems when this is done elsewhere.  Semi-protection, however, seems to be flaky in terms of what is actually protected by the software.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:31, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
:::I think the page is already semi-protected as you describe. It seems that this vandal created the account, came back 4 days later and vandalized the Wikijunior front page. A very unusual situation to be sure. It was reverted quickly despite having some of our most dedicated vandal fighters on wikibreak.

:#Protecting an image does not prevent a new image from being uploaded to that page. If we protect an image used on WJ, it can still be overwritten by a new upload.
:#Besides the images, I would say that that wikijunior main page is sufficiently &quot;high traffic&quot; as to warrant some sort of protection. I would be inclined to say that only sysops should edit that page (because there currently is no middlground between registered users and sysops).
:#If [[User:Xixtas]] is the key contributor to the WJ page, I would be inclined to say that he should become an admin. This would serve the dual purpose of making the main page more protected against vandalism, and giving a trusted user of this community some recognition.

== Fair Use ==
I ask all wikibookians to take a look at this link: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Important_notice_regarding_fair_use_that_all_administrators_should_see]
The WMF has decided to not allow Fair Use materials on the projects, something that Wikibooks traditionally allowed here. This link is an unofficial announcement, but it has claimed the WMF will make an official declaration about it in the future. 

With that in mind, I have altered the text of both [[Wikibooks:Copyright]] and [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy]] to reflect this stance. While the wording of my changes may certainly be open to debate, I think it would be a very bad move for this project to try and oppose the WMF on this issue. Once we get the wording right, I think we should make the [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy]] an official policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Wait. This message from Kat Walsh does not forbid fair use from what I understand. Kat only writes that no project should use &quot;licenses other than those allowed on Wikimedia Commons and limited fair use&quot; - so there should be no transitional licenses, like Noncommercial or No-Derivs. I think you overinterpret the message. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I share Derbeth's sentiments; Kat Walsh is not expressly forbiding fair use, just severely limiting it. Also, I think you may be jumping the gun: remember, &quot;A formal declaration in the form of a Board resolution has not yet been made and will be forthcoming.&quot; While I definitely support limited fair use, I think that we should not forbid it in its entirety. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I Posted this on the mailing list but for community's sake I'll post it here too. Now that I've thought about it, and read the letter again, I think that the WMF IS saying that fair use should be limited a lot more, but they didn't say that all fair use could go (indeed, they explicitly said that if there was no possible alternative to fair use, then it would be better to use it). That said, I do think a tightening is in order, and I would propose that we should either have some specific categories in which fair use could possibly be allowed (such as perhaps screenshots and logos as someone mentioned on the fair use policy talk) or judge the images on a case-by-case basis. Of course the latter would not be too practical if we had a lot of requests, but the purpose would be to limit the number of requests so that people are willing to seek other options, such as a free alternative or corporate permissions, or such things as that. I also propose that we have a more formal way to recognize the current copyright owner for those fair use images that ARE used, since by law one's sources have to be cited regardless to avoid plagiarism and other nasty stuff, unless it is common knowledge, and the fair use images probably can't be considered common knowledge since by definition they are copyrighted by someone.

::I disagree with both [[User:Derbeth]] and [[User:Iamunknown]]. I find these quotes from that message particularly illustrative:
::*''The mission of the Wikimedia Foundation is to develop educational content under a free content license or in the public domain. For content to be &quot;free content&quot;, it must have no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to use, redistribute, or modify the content for any purpose.''
::*''...all media we allow on our projects must be free for all users and all purposes, including non-Wikimedia use, commercial use, and derivative works.''
::*''...all media on Wikimedia sites which are used under terms that specify non-commercial use only, no-derivatives only, or permission for Wikimedia only, need to be be phased out..''
::It is important to remember here that fair use is &quot;no-derivatives&quot;, and is  not usable for &quot;all purposes&quot;, two things that Kat expressly says are not acceptable. The two exceptions that are listed are &quot;historically important photographs and significant modern artworks&quot;, a category of images that is small, and can be dealt with individually. Kat also says 
:::''...no project may have content policies less restrictive, or that allow licenses other than those allowed on Wikimedia Commons and limited fair use.''
::This says to me that we at least need to impose the limitations that are being described here, with the possible exception of historical photographs and modern artworks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

I think that you misunderstand the message. Kat says: &quot;Some works that are under licenses we do not accept (such as non-derivative) may meet these [fair use - Derbeth] conditions.&quot; Kat does not disallow fair use: she mentions &quot;limited fair use&quot; as an acceptable license for images.

Whiteknight, I'm not sure if you are familiar with image copyright issues. Some time ago, English Wikipedia accepted images which terms of use disallowed commercial use or making derivative works; these &quot;Noncommercial&quot; and &quot;Non-Derivative&quot; terms apply mostly to [[w:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] licenses, which have NC and ND variants. After message from Jimbo all these images were either removed or their license was changed to &quot;fair use&quot;. I think that Kat's message is an enforcement of similar policy on all Wikimedia Projects. Works of &quot;noncommercial use&quot; and &quot;no-derivative works&quot; are not equivalent to &quot;fair use&quot;. &quot;Fair use&quot; is a &quot;backdoor&quot;; with NC or ND works you can legally use them (copy, sell, etc.) as long as you follow their license having NC or ND clauses. Please read about variants of Creative Commons licenses if you already haven't done it.

From what I understand, Kat is saying that there should not be any &quot;half-free&quot; works: either the image is fully-free (no NC, ND clauses in license) or it has to be a subject to fair use. The motivation is to make authors of NC and ND works to license them under fully free licenses.

To sum up, you '''should not''' change important, project-wide, enforced policies ([[Wikibooks:Fair use policy‎|Fair use policy‎]], [[Wikibooks:Image use policy‎|Image use policy‎]], [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]) without asking anyone for opinion. There was no clear &quot;Foundation does not allow fair use on any project and wants all of fair use media to be deleted&quot;; Kat wrote: &quot;A formal declaration in the form of a Board resolution has not yet been made and will be forthcoming&quot;. You have no right to make such changes without explicit order from the Foundation. I expect you to revert all your changes to project policies. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:My changes to the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] page were premature, I admit that and I apologize for my haste. The [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy]] page are both just ''proposals'', and I don't feel that I need any special permission to alter the text of those pages. Both of those proposals are old and have never been accepted, making me wonder how much the community wants them to remain unchanged. I wont make any further changes to these pages until after the WMF makes an official statement on the matter. 
:I don't feel that my understanding of Kat's message is a &quot;misinterpretation&quot;. Many people here are reading that message with a bias towards keeping Fair Use images, and people are trying to find a means to that end in the text of the message. Everything in that message says to me that the WMF wants to ban fair use images, barring a very limited set of exceptions. We all need to prepare for the WMF's final word on this matter, and I am urging people to prepare for the &quot;worst&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:37, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

==Changes to main page==
[[Wikibooks:Nearly_complete]] has a list of most of the books that are fairly substantial. If we were a commercial site we would have a listing of this type as the main page. Should our main page look like [[Main Page/test|this test version with a booklist incorporated]]? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]]

Here are some examples of commercial ebook sites:

http://www.ebooks.com/

http://www.free-ebooks.net/

http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page

http://www.ebookimpressions.com/

Wikipedia was based on the layout of existing encyclopedias.  Wikibooks has copied this layout to some extent but Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  At Wikibooks we need to advertise our books, up front, to give people a good read straight away.  Most people are coming to Wikibooks to read, not to write. 

I would like to propose that the main page is changed into a classic ebook front page with a book list, images of front covers and brief descriptions of books.  The Spanish Wikibooks has already opted for this type of layout but, unlike Spanish Wikibooks we can populate our main page with virtually complete textbooks (Although their guide to Seville Cathedral is interesting).  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:20, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

:I can't remember where I heard the statistic, but apparently over 90% of traffic to WMF sites is composed of readers, not writers. With that in mind, I think that more people are going to appreciate wikibooks, and hopefully join our project if they see some inspiring examples of good books right on the front page. I agree with this effort 100%, and besides a few minor changes, I like this new page, and I like the idea of transcluding it into our main page. 
:I've started working on a set of criteria at [[Wikibooks:Good books]]. Ignoring the fact that this page is a &quot;Wikiproject&quot;, I would like everybody to take a look at these criteria and make sure they are acceptable by the community. If we dont want this to be a wikiproject, then we should likely turn the criteria into a policy or guideline. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
::I definitely think that the main page needs to approcahed from a PR perspective, to draw in readers. If necessary a link could be put on the main oage to a secondary main oage for editors. If the main page was designed with the reader in mind, i think that wikibooks would definitely get more traffic and consequently more editors.

I also think that a list of &quot;good books&quot; should be an essential part of Wikibooks main page. As I have written in another thread, current main page is very poor from PR point of view; it does not offer anything to a random visitor. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:It's a big improvement over the previous version of that page, but you are right that we still need more content on it to catch the attention of visitors. I say we transclude the book list onto the main page, and maybe add additional links to books later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

==Common resources for language learning==
Hello. I am active on fr.Wikibooks where I am working on a book [http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/N%C3%A9erlandais_dans_le_secondaire see here]. I think that some work may be shared between different courses on the same wikibooks and on courses on different wikibooks. For example, I made several galleries with pictures from Commons to learn vocabulary. See for [http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/N%C3%A9erlandais_:_les_transports_:_vocabulaire_illustr%C3%A9e Vocabulary on transport]. I think that such galleries may be used for learning Spanish, Japanese, etc on all Wikibooks. I am not very familiar with Wikibooks in English. Could you suggest me a good place to start importing these galleries on this site?. Regards.--[[User:Youssefsan|Oualmakran Youssef]] 12:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

Hi.  Thanks for your message.  I like your idea and think that different Wikibooks should work together more.  With regard to sharing language resources - this is a great idea.  I've done some work on the English and Polish books and having such a vocabulary list readily available would be useful for other language books on Wikibooks English and of course for other Wikibooks also.  I may have to steal your example given and then I'll make some other vocabulary galleries myself...

==Create subpage for arbitration discussion== 
I would like to propose that all discussion on staff lounge related to arbitration, dispute resolution, and the current dispute be moved to a subpage titled [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Arbitration]]. This would help to make both workplaces more productive, IMO. The conversations I would propose to move are: 

* Wikibooks:Resolving disputes
* Arbitration Policy
* Taming the elephant in the room...
* Wikibooks:Editorial board
* Arbitration, my role, and the Wikibooks &quot;community&quot;
* My thoughts on Arbitration Committee proposal

Individuals have argued that some of these discussions should not be in the staff lounge at all. I think moving them to their own temporary workspace makes sense. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

*{{support}}. '''be bold''' and just do it, but make sure to include appropriate links from the old discussions to the new locations. I still want to go forward with the plan (some weeks ago) to partition staff lounge into a number of sub rooms, but I haven't had the time to do it just yet. Maybe I will have time tonight or tomorrow for such an undertaking. Of course, perhaps it would be prudent to get everybody's permission ''again''. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:18, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

== Sub Discussion rooms ==
I want to re-raise this issue now, in light of the previous discussion. Are people here still interested in breaking the staff lounge into smaller discussion rooms? I envision a small number of &quot;standing rooms&quot; for discussion, such as an administrators room (to replace [[WB:AN]], and possibly other rooms), and a general discussion room. Other rooms could be created for the discussion of particular topics, as needed. This main page could likely contain links to the sub rooms, and links to the archival pages. There previously was support for this, and then we all got side-tracked. If people are still interested in this, I have time to work on it this week. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

*{{support}} - I don't even know if we're using the green things here or not, but I'll be trendy and give a support vote. I'd like for [[WB:AN]] to be removed and somewhat hybridized into having items for admins in several other pages. I think we need to define a hierarchy here of how things will work. We will use [[WB:RFC]] to handle user issues (and I think we should split that page up too) and then split up the AN functions into several pages as well. I don't think this should be under [[WB:SL]], but under a new Wikibooks namespace page elsewhere. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:20, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
**[[WB:AN]], and [[WB:VIP]] should likely be merged into a single room, that would be easier for an admin to monitor. Whether this new administrators room is here in the stafflounge hierarchy or not is not really an issue of concern (we can move it wherever we need). I think we could have several pages here: (1) General Discussion, (2) Administrator Discussion, (3) Technical Help, (4) Subject/Project Help. At the very least, if we have the administrator page somehwere else, we could post a link from here to there. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
*{{support}} - particularly things like arbitration discussions and similar slanging matches really should not be paraded here for all to see (a likely source of discouragement for new contributors). If people want to know about them, they can wander into those sub-pages. Kind-of like &quot;take it outside, fellas&quot;. However, I think that the main Staff lounge page should still be used for General discussion, Technical help and at least the requests for Project/Subject help. I for one have learnt a lot from reading this page (particularly, &quot;never become an Admin&quot; :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:52, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
*{{support}} - I only pay attention to what ever's at the bottom of the page as it's now too time-consuming to dig through the rest.  Separate rooms would be a great idea provided that they're linked to from here.

*{{support}} - I like this idea since staff lounge is way too big for anyone to keep track of... I do think though that we should make the links more prominent (maybe where the links to reference desk and such are now?) because otherwise people will ignore them and just post their comments here anyways, I know I wouldn't have noticed them if it hadn't been for this topic.

:::Thanks! I like it too, although I still want to do a little more work on it before I move all the pages around. I dont think that the staff lounge should necessarily be &quot;protected&quot;, but we should put a note that discussions on that page will be moved to more appropriate places. We'll see what we come up with though. It looks like we have plenty of support for this, now we just need to do it right. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
*{{support}} - Woo! I'm trendy! Umm... seriously... yeah. Staff lounge has gotten far too large; hard to see new stuff going on. If there were sub-areas, it would be a lot easier to set Watches on specific areas that actually were of interest to us. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 00:35, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Template:Goodbook]] ==
I've started work on this template which produces a &quot;book blurb&quot; for advertising high-quality books. The template is based off the current text blurbs used on [[Main Page/test]] to advertise good books. I would like to get some feedback about this template before we try and put it into wide-spread use.

Eventually, I think that book authors can insert these blurbs on the bookshelf pages, and a bot (or patient human) could scan the bookshelves, find these templates, and use them on the main page automatically. This would help to partially automate the task of updating the book entries on the main page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] archive links ==
Immediately after I finished moving around the staff lounge, i started getting complains from people who thought we should delete the archive links from that page. The archive links do take up a lot of room on that page, but I dont necessarily see a problem with them staying on that page. There are a few options:
#Do nothing, leave the links where they are.
#Move the links to a different &quot;archive main page&quot; or something, away from the staff lounge main page
#Remove the links entirely, delete the archive pages, because all the discussions are available via the page history.
What do people think? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

I can't find it, and it might suit our purposes more appropriately. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction. Thank so much.--[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 09:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

== Archiving ==
The previous monolithic staff lounge became large for a number of reasons. First, it was the only place to go to discuss a large number of topics (since remedied), but also because there was frequently a large delay between archivals of old discussions. Wikipedia is very aggressive in archiving it's village pump: Messages are sent to the archives after 1 week, and are ''deleted'' from the archives a week or two after that. That system mandates that discussions ''must be moved to a better place'' within 2 weeks if people want to continue the discussion.

I don't think we need to quite to go the lengths that wikipedia does, but we should give some serious thought to how we want to archive, and how frequently we want to do it. We now have 4 or 5 discussion pages that we can use for a variety of subjects, but if we neglect maintenance, all of them will be large and unwieldly like the old SL was. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

== Progression with Wikibooks logo ==
I haven't been active here for a while, but was surprised to see the progressive changes that have taken place both with the main page and the staff lounge, though I don't think the logo discussion has moved on with as much pace.
Looking at the page, it seems that they have pondered over the colour specifications for three months. My question is, echoing the previous debate, do users present at Wikibooks actually support changing the logo? --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 19:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:I couldn't care less, honestly :). We can't actually change it locally (at least i don't think we can), but I assume the devs will make the switch whenever a consensus is reached. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:I would be in favor of a change, the new logo is far more professional and sleek then our current version. There is something to be said for nostalgia, but the current logo is simply lower-quality then he newer logo is. I think the whole discussion over the colorscheme is moot, but if the WMF wants to impose arbitrary restrictions then we can't argue too much. I just wish they would finalize it, so we would have something to actually vote on. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

In my opinion the logo selected on meta is ''very amateurish'', I can't see any good things of it apart from possibility to create a favicon. The discussion about the colours makes it only worse and for me, it's agains good habits to change the project ''after'' it was chosen. People voted on a certain design, including the colour scheme, and it's a manipulation to completely change the chosen logo after the vote is finished. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

:I've been lead to believe that the new logo will not be implemented here unless our community votes and agrees to include it here. In other words, en.wikibooks could vote not to use the new logo, in the same way that [http://fi.wikibooks.org/wiki/Etusivu fi.wikibooks] has voted to use the new logo with the red-blue-green colorscheme. Similarly, I think that we could vote to use the new logo as-is (without changing colors), or that we could vote to keep the current logo. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

::I actually like the fi.books logo with that color scheme since that's a color group that actually works.

:&quot;Catastrophic&quot;? that seems awfully dramatic for a simple logo change. The current logo is very low quality, both in terms of design and resolution. I've used CSS to change the logo manually in my browser so that I don't have to look at it anymore. The new logo might not be the absolute best choice, but i think it's certainly better then what we have now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== A &quot;bill of rights&quot;? ==
If Panic is right, I'm outta here. Let me explain:

He seems to believe that he can change his mind about any content he contributes under GFDL (as in, change the licence), and that minor contributions (such as copyediting, etc.) don't mean that he can't revoke the license. This would mean that if someone starts a book, and I lend a helping hand here and there, the author could later just change his or her mind and demand the book be deleted, meaning that my good faith efforts to help improve the book were just time wasted. 

I'd like to be clear on that, because if that's really what the GFDL means, I'd rather not waste any more time here. If the GFDL &quot;might&quot; mean that, then I think we need to make a very clear local policy, stating that previous contributors do not have the right to demand their contributions be deleted (because they've decided they didn't want to release it under GFDL after all, and including their contributions is now copyvio), since it's unfair to those who come later in the interests of improving the book. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:55, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

: For me, the only way for Panic to revoke his agreement to use his work here, is to show that he was insane any time he edited here. It's like selling a car: you cannot come back one year after making the deal and say &quot;hey, give me my car back, I need it desperately&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

::Well, it turns out that he can do this (on pages he started), though he would have to pursue legal action against subsequent editors to force them to revoke the GFDL as well. I've offered to simply delete the C++ book, since it's crap now, and has no chance to grow until he gives up editorial control (which he clearly won't do). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:56, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

:Derbeth is right. To paraphrase Lawrence Lessig (and the below was written by him under a creative commons license, but because I'm crediting him, you need not worry about it): One point to clarify, however, is that GFDL licenses are permanent, in the sense that the term is as long as copyright runs.

:But just because you can’t revoke a particular license doesn’t mean you can’t revoke the offer. If, for example, you offer content under a GFDL license for a month, and then change your mind, you can stop offering the content under that license. Anyone who accepted your offer while it was valid, of course, has a deal. But no one after you withdraw the offer can accept anymore.

:In other words (I am no longer paraphrasing Lessig here), he could republish ''his'' original contributions under a non-free license (such as the default of traditional copyright), and no one would be able to copy it. But when he submitted the text to wikibooks under the GFDL, he irrevocably licensed that text to wikibooks under the GFDL, and that license on that work will last until his death. He may no longer want to license his work under the GFDL to anyone, and he may wish he hadn't licensed his works under the GFDL to wikibooks. But the fact of the matter is that he did, and now wikimedia gets to alter, republish, publicly display his text, etc. and he cannot restrict us from doing so on the basis of copyright violation.

:By licensing his own work to us under the GFDL (by submitting it) he gave us a license to use that work, and that license will last until his copyright expires and the work goes into the public domain. It changes nothing if he later regrets said licensing. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 19:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

::Once an edit has been made to an author's original contribution, even a minor edit, that work ceases to be the author's work, and instead becomes a derivative work with multiple copyright holders. As a GFDL derivative work, it is not possible for an author to unilaterally alter or remove the license. Further more, The author has granted that license to the WMF (and wikibooks in particular) for use, and no author can have his contributions removed without consent from the WMF or Wikibooks. Panic, as usual, is wrong about the GFDL. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

::To reiterate this point, let me link to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:GNU_Free_Documentation_License#9._TERMINATION Section 9 of the GFDL], where it states expressly that an author may not cancel the license agreement with the licensee (Wikibooks) unless the licensee is found to be in violation of the GFDL. By clicking the &quot;Save Page&quot; button, an author is granting a license to Wikibooks to host the material, and that license cannot be cancelled or modified unless Wikibooks screws up (which it doesnt). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:50, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

I would like to commend [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] and the other contributors, for their outstanding design of the recent main page overhaul.
Though attempting not to sound idle, I would like to bring the community portal, to the attention of Wikibooks users.
It has not been edited since the 18th of October 2006 and is a testament to our lack of structure. If we were to produce a similar test page to that of the main page and contribute, I would confidently foresee that it will develop to become intuitive and informative. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 23:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

:The [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] was nice a few years ago, but you are correct that it has since fallen into complete abandonment. Updating the staff lounge and the main page are, i hope, harbingers of a new renaissance here at wikibooks, and updating the community portal seems to be the next logical step in this process. You can feel free to start creating a new page at [[Wikibooks:Community Portal/test]] if you would like (and i assume that you ''would like''). In fact, you should feel completely free to create a proposed revision of ''any page'' that you see that needs a little work. I would certainly help with the community portal project, at least at first, but i'm not nearly the HTML/CSS wizard that some people around here are. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

== Tech help needed with NavFrame (Spanish Wikilibros version), please! ==
The version of NavFrame in the Spanish Wikibooks project seems to have developed a &quot;tic&quot;, and I need somebody to &quot;cure&quot; it please, as I am making heavy use of several templates that call up NavFrame. I posted a [[:es:Wikilibros:Café#Problema técnico: ¿Alguien puede corregir un &quot;tic&quot; en la versión española de NavFrame, por favor?|request for help]] in the Wikilibros café yesterday, but nothing's been done and there has been no indication that anyone is going to do anything, so I wonder if perhaps somebody here who understands the technicalities would be kind enough to drop by and fix it? I am developing books following a very similar pattern, with virtually identical templates, on both English and Spanish wikibooks and the English ones work fine, so the problem seems to be a glitch in the programming of the Spanish NavFrame version. It would be great if both versions of NavFrame could behave identically except for the language of the buttons: &quot;Show&quot; -&gt; &quot;Mostrar&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; -&gt; &quot;Esconder&quot;. At present, the &quot;tick&quot; of the Spanish NavFrame consists of displaying both of these buttons twice in succession, so what you get is &quot;Mostrar Mostrar&quot; and &quot;Esconder Esconder&quot; (with two separate links). Apart from being unsightly and looking silly, the real nuisance is that this takes up too much room on the bar leaving the bar's own text cramped (especially when the width is set to less than 100%). Another &quot;funny&quot; behaviour of the Spanish NavFrame I've noticed, not present in the English one, is that the text of the title bar is not centred on the whole bar as it should be, so that when you click on &quot;Show&quot;, the title bar text is not aligned with the rest of the table, which ''is'' centred properly, but shifted somewhat to the left. This also affects the aesthetics of my templates. So again, can't the Spanish algorithm just be realigned with that of the English version and just the language of the buttons replaced? Here are examples of my templates in action in both languages: [[Miskito/Lesson 1|English here]] and [[:es:Euskera/Lección 1|Spanish here]]. Many thanks to any wizard who can fix this! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

:The JavaScript that creates the navigation bar differs between en and es. This may or may not be the problem - I see it in both IE and FF (contrast that with the script comment below). The [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=-&amp;action=raw&amp;gen=js en copy] has this for function createNavigationBarToggleButton():
&lt;pre&gt;
// Find the NavHead and attach the toggle link (Must be this complicated because Moz's firstChild handling is borked)
for(var j=0; j &lt; NavFrame.childNodes.length; j++) {
  if (NavFrame.childNodes[j].className == &quot;NavHead&quot;) {
	NavFrame.childNodes[j].appendChild(NavToggle);
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
:whereas the [http://es.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=-&amp;action=raw&amp;gen=js es copy] has this:

// add NavToggle-Button as first div-element 
// in &lt; div class=&quot;NavFrame&quot; &gt;

	NavToggle,

== State of Wikipedia ==

I want to draw some attention to a recent essay written on wikipedia concerning the state of that project: [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipedia is failing]]. This essay shows some problems with wikipedia, some of which I will enumerate here:
* A lack of good articles on &quot;vital topics&quot;. 
* Good articles tend to degrade over time, as a result of vandalism, and poor-quality (but good faith) edits that aren't patrolled.
* The vast majority of all articles (over 99%) are low-quality.
This raises some questions about our work here on wikibooks. We also are criticized for our lack of books on &quot;core topics&quot;, and several books in the page [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] are too poor to really appear on that page.  These are things that we really need to be thinking about, because they are issues that could become bigger problems for us in the future. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

::I can understand your frustration! I've been dealing with the indecisiveness of this community for 2 years now, and it never gets any better. A big problem that I see is that there is alot of work that needs to get done, but there is no plan to do it. And worse then not having a plan is having a whole community that refuses to agree on a plan. People generally would rather have no solutions at all then to have a solution that isn't 100% agreeable. I think what people really need to realize is that much of the time they aren't going to agree with things that happen around this project, but that doesnt mean that things should stop happening. Sometimes the best thing for a person to do is simply stop arguing for the greater good. Once we start getting a plan together that people can all follow (whether they agree 100% or not), it will go a long way to improving Wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Well, in any collaboration people will have to make compromises in order to move forward, the thing is that a lot of people seem  to only be interested in moving forward on their own terms on this project since there is no real &quot;deadline&quot; for things to get done, unlike in many &quot;real-world&quot; collaborations, so people figure the most patient\stubborn will have their own way. It may be something inherent in how the wikimedia system works, since no one has the power to cause change unless they claim it, and if someone does claim that power there'll always be opposition. The solution I'd suggest is to decide what needs to be addressed first, and then we can address it and look for a majority decision (there is a reason government is not run by the consensus of its people, and I do not personally feel that it is feasible to go based on having unanimous decisions), and go based on that. Maybe we can use the main page as a place from which we can inform people of what is happening? If we put it in a prominent place we cannot say people are unaware of the decision, and therefore if people do not vote we can only go on what votes we have. As a side note, with regards to the RC, I admit that I haven't been welcoming people, I thought that was your niche in the project ;). But yeah, if I see a red talk page for a registered user I could do that. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 17:36, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

*&amp;mdash;reset
IMHO, whilst this project has many and varied needs, there are two specific ones that stick out a mile and that Whiteknight alludes to:
* We need a lot more contributors, especially ones that have time and inclination to do some of the donkey work (i.e. not focus on a specific book)
* We need better organisation
Getting better organisation is the hard bit, as it requires some agreement from people, and some policies (which I believe some, like Whitenight, have been working on). There truly is an enormous amount of work to be done here, but it needs to be done through coordinated effort. The Wikiprojects mentioned a while back are a prime example of the sort of coordinated effort needed here. Good contributors need to be enticed to join projects so that there is a chance of getting things done. 
Some of the projects that I perceive, outside the obvious book-specific projects, are:
* Policy - a coordinated effort to hammer out Policies and Guidelines, and get them agreed upon (Whitenight has been doing a lot of that already, I believe).
* Help pages - the help system here isn't up to scratch, and needs a lot of work.
* Images - there is still a licensing problem with some images (and other media), plus now a lot of good images have been erroneously deleted and pages vandalised in the process; needs a coordinated effort, with a set of guidelines this time.
* Quality patrol - I believe that WB would greatly benefit from a coordinated effort to address book quality, operating under a strong set of guidelines and addressing a book or bookshelf at a time.
However, even if it could be agreed that the above Wikiprojects were needed, there remains the problem of contributors. We need more! Those that are here now are generally here for a purpose - the book(s) they are working on - so we need more contributors if we want to address any of the above points. Maybe we need to advertise on the [[w:Wikipedia:Community Portal|Wikipedia:Community Portal]] or something - I don't know - but we need more contributors (and we need guidelines for them to follow, and we need contributors to write the guidelines...)

(sigh) My AUD0.02 is running out now, and I don't have another to put in the slot. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;Better organization&quot; is certainly a need here, but it's so poorly defined. We do have the bookshelves, and to some degree that is a very good start. There have been other efforts to organize and categorize books, such as the [[WB:CCO|Card Catalogue Office]], the infobox project, the dewey-decimal categorization, the alphabetical list of wikibooks, etc. The list at [[Wikibooks:Requested books]] is essentially useless, because that list isn't well maintained, and the books listed there don't get started. The list at [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] is similarly unmaintained, with a number of books on that list being in poor condition, and a number of good books not being listed. Mass-categorization was a strong effort at organization spearheaded by [[User:Jguk]], but with his decline in activity, that project has fallen by the wayside. 
:The issue about getting new contributors is one that is echoed frequently, but that there aren't any good ways to fix. We could advertise on wikipedia, but that is likely to be scorned or even deleted outright. I think there are some places where we could advertise, like websites for educators or websites for textbooks or whatever, but that's likely to create a problem in itself. Unfortunately, I dont think that getting new contributors is going to be particularly easy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

::Um, I meant ''organised effort''. There are some groups of people who have spontaneously organised themselves around specific books being edited, and it seems that some educators have organised their students into editing a book here and there, but there is no concept of the Wikiproject here as there is on WP; this is what I meant, essentially. 
::Categorisation is something I haven't looked at here (mostly because it seems that someone is or has been looking at that), but it sounds like a candidate for a Wikiproject.
::In terms of attracting new contributors, perhaps we need to think about what brings people to WB in the first place. I came here because I had a need to post some recipes somewhere, and the Cookbook looked like a good place for it, but what specifically brought me to WB was a link to the Cookbook from a WP page. Since then, I've had a need to record centrally some software documentation and notes, so I've started a book here, but would never have conceived of doing that before I stumbled into the Cookbook.
::Maybe we should look at promoting WB though sister links in other Wiki projects, particularly WP. Links do get followed. What is then needed is a slick [[#Main Page|Main page]] that encourages people to become contributors :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Oh, organized effort is good too (sorry for the misunderstanding). The wikiproject idea is one that I have been trying to promote, but there have been some notable criticisms of them have have slowed me down. The wikiproject system is a really good one to manage large groups of editors, which we dont have yet. If we have the system in place though, we will be in good shape to support more editors when we start growing. Of course, this brings us back to the need to have more contributors, which is likely our most pressing problem. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:56, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

I agree with most of the above and so OK - I must be mad.  Below this there is a proposal.

'''Do not discuss it, do not wonder if the tag would look better in a pretty colour, do not say that it is not your book, under no circumstances refer to policy and a discussion.'''

Maintenance tags are necessary - they do '''not''' enhance the image of Wikibooks.  If you want to make Wikibooks better let's deal with some of these (you may find it hard to get to the category as it is buried in dust - in the one I am pointing to some birthday celebrations are due).

===Proposal===
'''Everyone''' reading this goes to [[:Category:Naming convention change]].  They take one book and they correct the naming of it (including the redlinks) and remove the tag.  If you do not know what to do ask.  When this is done we deal with something else.  This is a community wide issue and requires community wide action.  &lt;big&gt;'''Do it'''&lt;/big&gt; - bad karma will follow you for an hour if you don't!  I'm off to do the first on the list now. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I was was swamped yesterday because of the weather, but this is a great idea and i definately have time to fix a book tomorrow. Maybe that's what we need to do, have either a &quot;small project of the day&quot;, or similar for a week. We can pick things that require less then 30min of work, and ask each person to just do one (fix one bad naming convention, tag 10 images, dewikify 1 page, etc) task from the list. This requires, of course, people to compile such a list of tasks.

Some of the NCs are extensively cross-linked which makes things more interesting/difficult, but just gotta go back and fix the crosslinks/double redirects after its all moved, and work from the outside in on branched books.

===Wikibooks should do it a book at a time===

The most important objective in Wikibooks is [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]].  Each set of authors should try to get their books into a state suitable for a fixed edition. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:13, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
:This fails to address the vast majority of books that have no &quot;current author&quot; and bring down Wikibooks as a whole IMO --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:::The trouble with a Wikipedia approach to Wikibooks is that a book is so much bigger than a Wikipedia article. Two hundred pages in a book are the equivalent of two hundred Wikipedia articles and about 400 Wikipedia editors. We are never going to get 400 editors per book on Wikibooks. Wikibooks needs a few individuals with wide expertise and drive or whole classes of students doing a project and these people have to see the book through to the bitter end.  The books that are left open ended with a few outline chapters tend to stay that way. So '''Wikibooks is not Wikipedia''', not even vaguely.  I favour putting the skeleton books into a closet so that if a motivated author or group arrives they can resurrect a given book if they desire.[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

::It will be easier to write good books, if the authors have examples of other good books to emulate. Even though it is certainly possible for an author to not follow an example and still make a good book, it is more likely that regular authors will repeat what they see. It should be the goal of every book to be used in a classroom somewhere, and that requires publishing and distribution. Many books do have no current author. Perhaps we should start an &quot;Adopt a book&quot; initiative as a way to find authors, and possibly draw new contributors to wikibooks.

:::: I also agree, which is why perhaps everyone should get onto the good books wikiproject and nominate one book soon, so that we have a good list to work from from which we can choose some to display on the main page. This may be more encouraging to potential contributors than seeing stubs on the main page, since they'll tend to think &quot;oh my, if there is nothing here there's too much work to be done and no one is here to do it, I better not get involved&quot; or something like that, I know I thought that when I first came here. I was also somewhat shocked that it wasn't formatted the same as wikipedia (though I got over that more quickly). Whereas if potential contributors see a good, solid start in the good books we have so far, they may be more willing to build on the groundwork we already have. 

:::: As for the adopt-a-book project, I think its a good idea, problem being that since we have a limited number of contributors, a large number of books would have to be left alone since no one here would know enough about the topic to write a book on it. I mean, we could adopt books and then just add as much as we could to them. I think, however, that whiteknight is right: It would give new contributors something to concrete to work on and therefore make them more likely to contribute. It's like all the old writing prompts from middle school, the hardest ones were the completely open-ended assignments, give them something more specific and they'll be more comfortable starting off.

:::: One final point, if we DO end up going the route of having a stable and unstable version, the main page should point to the stable version, since for example we wouldn't want a new contributor coming into a book full of vandalism or that's currently in transition or something, and thinking &quot;why is this one of the best books on Wikibooks?&quot;. This is another argument for use of stable versions and I think they're an excellent idea, though I can't remember what the arguments against them were.

=== Listing problems by time to correct ===

I think one of the most helpful things that we can do is to list problems in terms of how much time it will take to correct. For instance, we can say:
*'''Fix Naming Convention''': 10 minutes
*'''Create Inter-page Navigation''': 30 minutes
*'''Categorize book and all pages''': 20 minutes
We can break this down into categories, and people can go to &quot;Category:10 Minute Problems&quot; or &quot;Category:30 minute problems&quot;. There are plenty of times in my day when I have 10 or 20 minutes, and I dont want to start anything &quot;big&quot;, but I do want to help out. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

: Here's another couple (some of these were your suggestions):
:* ''' Dewikify a page''': 10 minutes
:* ''' Add verification to an unverified page''': 30 minutes
:* ''' Write a module with a red link/fix a stub''': 1+ hours (depending on how detailed you want to get and how much you know about the topic)
:* ''' Check the user creation log and welcome newest contributing users''': 10 minutes
:* ''' Make a print version for one book''': 30 minutes
:* ''' Fix 30 double-redirects (if any exist of course)''': 10 minutes
:* ''' Rewrite one help module so that it makes sense, and mark it as such''': 1+ hour (note that I DO think we should mark the useful vs. non-useful help pages, if not just for the sake of knowing which ones still need the most work and also for people to know what is still a work in progress)
: Feel free to add anything else you want. From where would we link these categories so that people see them? &quot;module cleanup&quot;? Staff lounge (top)? Main page? (probably not if we're looking to get substantial contributors) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 00:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:I'd suggest that ''Fix naming convention'' would be at least 5 minutes per page, if done correctly. Bear in mind that one needs to:
:* Check to see what links to the page
:* Check to see whether the page / book will be merged into something else (at which point the page move effort should end!)
:* Move the page, including the talk page (just a checkbox on the page move request)
:* Fix links in other pages, so that they point to the moved page
:* Fix any links that may be referencing other pages in the book, also to be moved
:* tag for delete any unlinked redirects to the page, unless it is the root page of the book (bearing in mind that external websites, including Wikipedia, may link to the old book name)
:* tag for delete any unlinked redirects to the talk page, if it exists
:* Fix any red links for pages in the book, so that they point to (non-existent) pages that comply with the naming conventions also
:So, at least 5 minutes per page, bare minimum. With a complex book, that can mean a good couple of hours with cross-checking of interlinked books. Anything less is asking for another &quot;image cleanup&quot; debacle :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:I don't know about that, i personally use something called PRIMO PDF, it's nice because you can make anything you can print into a pds, because all you do is select print and select Primo PDF for the printer and it has a dialog that allows you to setup the pds and where to save it then click ok and you got a PDF.  So i can use word or whatever app i want/need to.[[User:RyanB88|RyanB88]] 21:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

:: Yeah, CutePDF does the same thing... problem with those programs though is that you're stuck with what you get, unless you copy and paste it into a word processer and change the indents, page breaks, etc. first, and THEN print it. OpenOffice would be more convenient if you're going to do this since you don't need to install another program, but programs like PRIMO and CutePDF do allow you to make PDFs from whatever you want (including HTML, as I do all the time, and also PS files which I personally do not like since I cannot scroll between pages like you can with PDFs, so I just convert them).

I happened across the given templates surveying templates for [[W:WP:TSP|Wikiproject template sharing]], and thought some here might be interested or make use of such:

#{{Tlxw|equation}} -- Handy formatting tool for writing technical modules, it (manually) numbers equations on right hand side of page, displays math in the middle.
#There may be a few others of use as well, see [[W:Category: List templates|W:Cat: List templates]].

:*The overall purpose of [[M:TSP|Wikiproject template sharing]], is to empower all editors with choices and to make us all more productive when doing cross-sister contributions by providing as much as possible, the same standardized tools with good documentation. [[M:DPP]] was in fact in part inspired by lobbying I'd been doing all last summer to improve documentation practices on Wikipedia. DPP[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Template_limits &lt;small&gt; (and why)&lt;small&gt;] is a bit more formalized and elegant than the include/noinclude nesting I'd suggested and started by including snippet sections of talk pages, where inefficient and disrespectful of a volunteer's time, usage was haphazardly sometimes good, sometimes awful, but nearly always mixed in with discussion loaded with Jargon and arcana. That movement to better face documentation for the benefit of the user  was all in flux when Tim Starling put the limits on template expansion, so the two merged and became the doubly beneficial doc page pattern. That will hopefully soon also extend internationally (Already does, based on interwiki's on many templates-- See the lists in {{Tl|Tl/doc}} in edit mode for example). So until we get some of your local editors involved directly, if it's all the same to you, I'll just drop the occasional note about something I think someone here might find useable and useful. &lt;g&gt; {{I2}}&quot;Useful&quot; ''does not equate'' &quot;directly&quot; with immediately useable in the case of the poets template... but the stimulus of seeing it might be inspirational to someone here who is into poetry and perhaps assembling an anthology of such. Hence, without a crystal ball, I mentioned it. OTOH, the 'equation' I mentioned does the math formatting AND the same labeling function as your 'eqn', so it's a better human time saver--less keystrokes==less chances of a typo. So far as I sampled, it's output and 'eqn' are virtually identical with respect to the template labeling. Q.E.D.{{I2}}A new mention for your collective consideration is the flexible set of templates illustrated here: {{tlxw|Bar box/doc}}, which  can be used to make a variety of bar graph presentations. If there is any tool of a particular nature someone is desiring, do let me know, the guys working on surveying an recatting the wp templates are well along, and I can have them keep an eye out, etc. Best regards // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 06:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

== Special pages ==

I've been doing some cleanup lately using [[Special:Wantedpages]]. It's a good way to look for certain things, like copy-paste transwikis, and books that use wikipedia style linking rather than chapter linking. A lot of the ones at the top of the list are created through TOC templates, but further down there are a lot of &quot;one-word&quot; links (including a lot of links to dates!), which can be followed to find books that aren't using links properly. 

Also, I had gotten [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] below 1,000 a few months ago, but it's well above 3,500 now. We haven't done a &quot;policy of the week&quot; for a while, but maybe we could try to finish up with [[Wikibooks:Categories]], in order to have a consistent way to clear that log? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== Combining Wikis ==

A while ago I started a TI-Basic wiki aptly named [http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com TI-Basic Developer] because I didn't think there was a TI-Basic wiki on the Internet, but now that I know this wiki exists, I think it would be good to combine wikis. It seems rather pointless to have both wikis separately working towards the same goal, when we could just consolidate our efforts and create one single high-quality wiki.

While this TI-Basic wiki has some quality content, TI-Basic Developer actually has considerably more content and is further along in its development (please check it out and see for yourself), so I think it should be the wiki that is used. Every user here would be eligible to become a member, and the admins could keep their admin positions. I don't know who the admins are for this wiki, but could they please consider this offer and write a response back. You can also contact me by email at tibasicdev @ gmail . com (remove spaces). Thanks --[[User:Burr|Burr]] 13:03, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

== TI-Basic vs traditional ==

You should definitely mention ticalc.org [http://www.ticalc.org/] as it's resources are vast. Also, I think this would be helpful. [http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html Virtual TI]. Is TI-Basic the same as Basic? Just wondering. --[[User:Gflores|Gflores]] 01:49, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:TI-Basic is a version of BASIC... It works much the same way but some commands are changed, added or removed. [[User:Nilsmo|Nilsmo]] 19:22, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

::The basic used on the calculators is different from the more traditional basic.  It has while loops and other features that I can't remember right now that traditional basic doesn't have. --[[User:Peterw|Peterw]] 23:17, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

== TI83/84 vs TI86 vs TI89 ==

There are different versions of TI-BASIC depending on calculators. How should this be handled? (For example, GetKey codes are different in different graphing calculators.) [[User:Nilsmo|Nilsmo]] 19:22, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

:And by the way, seeing how the only true difference in programming on TI-83 compared to the TI-83 plus is that you can't use lower case and some catalogue features, I think we shouldn't limit the guide to just the plus, we can just mention the limitations and correctly label in the catalogue list (upcoming). [[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 22:24, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

::I think we could start each section with the general stuff and add subsections detailing the differences. Just an idea. I haven't programmed outside of the 83/84/+ line so I don't know how different it can get. [[User:Gdd|Gdd]] 02:29, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

:True, 83+ BASIC isn't much different from 83 BASIC, but the BASIC used on TI-89 calculators is very different from the code used on TI-83s. The command for clearing the screen is even different on the 89 and it will be quite hard to explain the major differences in, for example, menus and pixels for the two calculators. Since most of us, including myself, seem to be programming singularly for the 83+ line, I suggest this wikibook at least tell the reader that this tutorial is only designed for 83, 83+, 83+ Silver Edition, 84+ and 84+ Silver Edition calculators. [[User:Nilsmo|Nilsmo]] 13:30, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

::So... is this module focusing on the 83 Plus (and subsequently the regualr 83) or is it going to encompas as many calculators as possible?  Or just 83/84 family? --[[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 22:54, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes. (I think) Nobody here owns an 89 so it would be impossible to teach that... [[User:69.251.238.76|69.251.238.76]] 17:04, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== A volunteer ==

Hey, I have been programming in TI-BASIC for a long time and I will gladly conrtibute as much of my free time to building this Book up; however, some reorganizing must be done to make s easier to learn the commands as they are need in programming rather than as they appear in the lists (If should be followed with End along with Then and Else, and should be all on one page).  Also, I think this is a great opportnity to create a Tricks/Tips page with a vast library of byte-saving shortcuts and efficiencies.  Also, this is my first time making major updates to a Wiki document, so any info/help is appreciated, but since I learned all my TI-BASIC trhough trial and error and experimenting, I should be able to study other documents/additions and copy the way it is written.  [[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 00:39, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

== Tricks ==

The tricks section is a good idea. Tricks that can be done using TI-BASIC are quite valuable, and, in some cases, necessary for a useful program. I know many of these so maybe I'll start a new section on them. [[User:Nilsmo|Nilsmo]] 13:30, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

:Just ballpark it, how many different Getkey possibilities do you think there are?  I know of 4 or 5, but I've heard others talk about faster ways.  Do you know? ([[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 16:25, 8 December 2005 (UTC))

== Fix up Necessary Items ==

The Necessary Items page is now updated to include other computer software and ticalc.org but I wasn't logged in when I updated it so, yeah.  [[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 14:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

== Overall plan and Layout==

Are you sure this is the best layout. Could someone give an abstract of what each section is about? Which section will link ports be placed in? [[User:Gdd|Gdd]] 02:29, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah, it is best to learn the language in the order from simple to more complex, of course, learning commands of the same category or that are used together (ie. If/Then/Else/End) at the same time or following each other.  But what I don't understand is this, are we writing a book for programming in all TI-BASIC forms for all supporting calculators, or just for the 83/83Plus?  Also, I think that for those who want to learn from scratch can read from beginning to end, while those who need to learn only certain aspects can do so by using links.  Therefore, the layout must be in order, but must allow easy acess to all the disussed topics.  And by the way, I made a mistake in the IF section becuase it was late at nigth and I forgot to mention that when using End to close off If regulated instructions, there must be a Then after IF.  Anyway, I'll get around to adding and fixing soon, but the last two weeks of college are nuts.  [[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 11:51, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

::Great job to whomever added the links at the bottom of each page.  Very useful.  So right now we should make a plan to organize both the pages and the TOC.  Also, is there another way to make boxes that look different from the pre /pre ones?  [[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 11:00, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:I feel that Output should come before Input.  And somewhere early we need the assignment operator (STO) --[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 05:34, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

Alright, I've been thinking and taking others's suggestions so far into consideration and the current plan should be as follows:
     - Abstract
     - Introduction (including about TI-Basic, programming,
       differences in versions, conventions used in module,
       TI-Basic and overall computer lingo, ...)
     - Necessary Items
     - Variables (letters, strings, matrices, functions, ...
       although we shouldn't force learning matrices on newcomers
       since for most simple starting stuff, you may never use them.
     - Output
     - Input
     - Criteria based instructions (starting with If/Then/Else/End,
       then While, then Repeat, then For(, and then IS&gt;( and DS&lt;(
       optionnaly (I have personnaly never used them, but would like
       to).
     - Other CTL commands (like Lbl/Goto, Pause, Stop, ...
       baisically the rest)
     - The rest of the I/O commands in order of how easy they are to
       understand/implement
     - Then get into more advaned programming
     - Trick, Tips, and Optimizations
     - Conclusion
Of course, people will surely find more to add, but I have class now...  ([[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 13:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC))

:IS&gt;( and DS&lt;( are mainly left over for compatibility with the original TI-81 which had very little decision and looping capability.--[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 01:31, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::Right, so as a sole TI-83 Plus Basic programmer, I don't really &quot;need&quot; IS&gt;( and DS&lt;( ?  Ok, makes no difference, I never understood the explanaitions on how to use them and frankly never felt the need to use them. ([[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 13:14, 8 December 2005 (UTC))

== Instructions sub-module size ==

I must suggest a change in the plan for the list of instructions.  Having a whole module for each one does not seem appropriate to me.  I like the content so far, and there is some more detail and an example or two that could be added.  But even with that, a lot of them would consist only of two or three paragraphs - - a little small for a module.

Having a module for the CTL instructions and having the link to IF be [[TI-Basic:Instructions:CTL#If]] makes more sense (especially for those that are really small like Stop.)
--[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 05:28, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:You see, I wanted to do exactly that: have one CTL page and one I/O page so that not only would all the instructions be in one placed, but anything can be linked with the #IF an so on; however, this is the first time I write for Wiki and in a previous edit I tried to use the # somewhere in a link but I don't know how to use it properly.  Can anyone explain how to link to sections within a wiki page?  I've checked the Wiki help section and they give no such information.  I agree this way of organizing the guide in much more efficient.  ([[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 13:18, 8 December 2005 (UTC))

== Input and GetKey ==

I agree with the present Table of Contents that GetKey should be a separate module.  If so, we should move It's coverage from ''Input''.
--[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 05:44, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:Yup, once we get a seperate CTL module and a seperate I/O module (then hopfully a Draw module and Vars module and so on) then we can have a line in it uder the Getkey section with a brief description of what the Getkey command does and link to the real Getkey module and link to the Tips, Tricks, and Optimizations module, where I can ganarntee will have many Getkey techniques.  ([[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 13:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC))

== TI-Basic Wikibook conventions ==

I figure the modules and expalnations for each instrcution, as well as the overall presentation, should be written and displayed the same way no matter the topic or the writter, so we will need an agreed upon convention for writting the modules.

My suggestion is:
-introduce the instruction (what it does an where to find it)
-give its general form or forms (for example: line([initial x],[initial y],[final x],[final y]) and line([initial x],[initial y],[final x],[final y],0) for the line( instruction )
-explain how the calculator handles it
-give explanations and examples of its uses (basic in the basic section and more advanced uses in the advanced section) and use the preview boxes
-explain/demonstrate exceptions or irregularities (if applicapble)
-link to other modules or sections in this Wikibook with relevant information to the instruction/information discussed
-include the Previous and Next links along with the main page link to the table of contents.

I'll try to make the [[TI-Basic:Instructions:If|IF]] page I wrote look like this and who ever wants to make suggestion can, then we can begin writing them all (just can't believe how long it will take to complete the Catalogue page!!)
[[User:Gtabmx|Gtabmx]] 16:21, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== TI BASIC Advanced? ==

What about those of us who are really advanced?  I'll write an advanced tutorial if you want me too--you can put it in wherever.  If you don't think I'm advanced enough, e-mail me and I'll tell you about some games I made--maybe send you the coding if I have time. Look...
---A Cave game(not side scrolling, but hey, whatever)
---A 5-7 frames per second side-scroller (an Optimized SiCoDe WAR)
---A Nibbles game (I can make the snake take a dump with lethal crap)
---A puzzle game where you get from 1 pt to another avoiding spikes, and all you have is an anit-gravity suit
And so on....
But don't mind me--I'm ranting, but I WILL write an advanced tutorial for this book.
I've seen other advanced tutorials and stuff from SiCoDe(supposedly the best while they were still here) and even those guides\games have problems.  I mean, gotoing out of a loop? HELLO???
That was in WAR!!  Yeah, the 6 fps game.  I optimized it so it no longer does that, and there is virtually no pause when the bomb explodes.  Go get it from sicode.ticalc.org if you don't believe me.

Sorry if I'm just wasting space--kill this if you want.  Just contact me at harrierfalcon32@yahoo.com

== Purpose of this chapter &quot;How can I make my life more predictive&quot; ==
The reason is to do self regulating rules for one to follow, and even kind of &quot;competition rules&quot; (Its purpose is to make your life more stable).

== predictive rules ==
These rules are made with great detail so it will be possible to cope with a problem in a specific and an easy to understand way.

=== Sleep rules (group) ===
These are rules regarding sleeping as a priority

==== rule: &quot;7 days sleep rule&quot; ====
*'''Purpose of the rule'''
You can follow this rule if you find it troublesome to get enough sleep, letting your body get the rest it needs.
*'''Why this rule is useful'''
If you have trouble deciding when you should go to sleep this rule could help with decision making.
*'''Why this rule is not useful'''
It is not yet complete, or other reason. (add freely)

===== Actions or procedures =====
Choose between the explanations. If you do not understand the first explanation skip it, and read the next explanation. You can understand successfully this rule by reading the first or the second explanation, because both explanations try to explain the same thing but in a different way so that as a large audience as possible may be able to understand what is explained.


#Explanation1: 
*If you read this now, and wish to follow this rule, go to sleep now if the clock shows 23:00 or past 23:00.
*If the clock is before 23:00 you can decide yourself when to sleep, but it is advised you sleep within the last 15 minutes until the clock shows 23:00. When you wake up, note the time it is somewhere where you can keep stable track of these notes.
#Explanation2 (not yet updated): If you wish to start following this rule it means that if the time is past 23:00, you'll save any unsaved work, close your computer and prepare for sleep, and then go to sleep. In the morning note down the time you woke up. If you do this you can claim rightly that you've followed the rule partly by saying: 'Rule &quot;7 days sleep rule&quot; partly followed.'

===== Problems and questions =====

#Explanation1: If you are willing to follow this rule even as the time is after 23:00 and you've been awake for more than 15 hours, then you will follow the rule partly &quot;rule followed within x extra hours&quot;
*if you go to sleep within 1 hour after 23:00, then you can say &quot;rule:7 days competition rule1&quot; followed 1 hour.
*if you go to sleep within 2 hours after 23:00, then you can say &quot;rule:7 days competition rule1&quot; followed 2 hours.

===== Prerequisites =====
#To follow this rule you need to know the time you woke up, either by having noted it down or remembered(not recommended) it.
##You also need to have been awake for no more than 15 hours. If you know when you will be awake for more than 15 hours, then go to sleep before that limit is passed.

=== Chat &quot;rules&quot; (group) ===
These are rules for use in a chatroom or in private messages. Some of these rules might not be accepted to be used in certain chatrooms by the channel operators, and some rules might also be disliked (or liked) in private message chatting.

==== rule:basic actions about communication ====
This specific rule has the above title as name

====== Why this rule is useful ======
#If you want to meet new people these rules could help
#Helps get yourself organised if you've got very bad experiences in the chat room(any chat room), and you do not wish anymore to chat with people there. In this case these rules might help you communicate the basic things, like greeting, saying goodbye. Asking people to be polite etc.

====== Why this rule is not useful ======
The basics of communication is known to many people, and that might make them see these rules as something very simple as they already know them.

===== Prerequisites =====
Prerequisites might be needed for subsections, but not on this section.

===== Actions or procedures =====

# Explanation1 option 1: This section is about sending messages in the public chat room
##Greeting a person:
###To greet the person say &quot;hello, nickname-of-person&quot;.
###Expect a reply. If there is no reply from the nickname, then the next step can't be followed.
##Finding common interests:
###Say &quot;nickname-of-person, what are your interests?&quot; or &quot;nickname-of-person, what do you find interesting?&quot;
###After discussing and wishing to learn more about the other person's interests ask &quot;nickname-of-person, do you have any other interest except the one's you told me about?&quot;
# Explanation1 option 2: This section is about sending messages to a certain nickname.
##If you do not know if the nickname prefers private messages then send this message to the nickname: &quot;Do you like or dislike private messages?&quot;.
##Greeting the person:
###To greet the person say &quot;hello&quot;.
###Expect a reply. If you find the reply abusive in any way, then do not continue typing any message to the nickname in private. If there is no reply from the nickname, then the next step can't be followed.
##Finding common interests:
###Say &quot;what are your interests?&quot; or &quot;what do you find interesting in your life?&quot;
###After discussing and wishing to learn more about the other person's interests ask &quot;do you have any other interest except the one's you told me about?&quot;
# Explanation2:

==== chatroom multi feelings 1 warning ====

===== purpose of the rule =====
It's purpose is to be able to have self control in the chatroom while more than 1 nickname sends you a message that makes you feel abused.

====== Why this rule is useful ======
Because when you do not know what to do and feel in an ill mood, then it could be good there were precise instructions on what exactly to do, or what &quot;not to do&quot; while being in this situation.

====== Why this rule is not useful ======
It might confuse you, and you might be able to do this spontaneously, without needing the help of these &quot;written rules&quot; (which are different than the so called &quot;unwritten rules&quot;)

===== Prerequisites =====
No known yet.

===== Actions or procedures =====
Here is one explanation. If you believe it could be described in an easier way, then add content to the explanation2 section:

# Explanation1: Let's say for example that nick1 sends you a message you find abusive and the same does nick2. 
##Say to the channel: &quot;Anyone who wishes to send any complaints of other people can do it through pm. This is a public channel, and there's no reason to use abuse messages&quot;
##Now you have no right according to this 'rule' to speak to these people in the chatroom, except the &quot;1. Section message&quot; message, which you can send once every 2 minutes.
##You can use the message &quot;please continue in pm as I said&quot; which you can send as much as you prefer. You can also offer to teach how to send in private messages, because some people might not know how to do it, or might not know how to see incoming private messages.
###As a next step talk to the nicks in private messages. This is the final step.
# Explanation2:

==== chat room disturbed 1 ====

===== purpose of the rule =====
These set of actions are about the case that a person starts using swear words against someone or against anything else, and what you should do in that case.

====== Why this rule is useful ======
If you do not like:
*swear words in the chat room, or
*abuse messages directed towards somewhere(even yourself), or
*you do not know towards who the messages are, or
*you do not like swear words in the public chat room
...then the procedures in &quot;Actions or procedures&quot; might help to understand exactly what to do.

====== Why this rule is not useful ======
Nothing known yet

===== Prerequisites =====
Nothing known yet

===== Actions or procedures =====

# Explanation1 case 1: more than one user, use words you are feeling uncomfortable with.
##Say: &quot;[put-nicknames-here-separated-by-space], please stop using swear/abuse words&quot;
# Explanation2:

=== Prediction rules ===
Abstract category of rules

==== rule:Planned computer use 1 ====
*'''description:'''
It's for use in the case that you plan to do a certain thing on the computer but end up forgetting it, and then starting surfing the internet or doing unrelated things on the computer continuously and in an unpredictable way.
*'''ways to follow the rule'''
#rule &quot;Planned computer use 1&quot; close computer followed
##will follow the rule and at the end close the computer
#rule &quot;Planned computer use 1&quot; open computer followed
##will follow the rule and at the end do anything spontaneous that comes to mind at the computer.

===== Actions of rule =====
#Note down somewhere (on paper, on an electronic device or elsewhere) about what you plan to do on the computer.
##Also note down if you plan to close the computer afterwards or let yourself do anything spontaneous at it.
#Next do the steps, and at the end do what you've chosen regarding &quot;ways to follow the rule&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==

The purpose of this book is to teach both the basics and more advanced aspects of the TI-BASIC programming language.  Although the book's intention is to instruct newcomers with no previous TI-Basic programming knowledge or experience, those who have some experience in programming can use the table of contents to inform themselves on certain aspects of the language, like optimizing code or learning the small yet important differences between certain loop types.  Hopefully, the Wiki Community can contribute a vast amount of useful TI-Basic programming knowledge, which will allow this book to provide a much more in-depth look at TI-Basic. Currently, this book only provides information regarding TI-BASIC programming on the TI-83+ or 84+. Of course, the Silver Editions of the two calculators can be used with this guide.

To learn the language and programming skills in order from beginning to end, the reader should start with this page, the Introduction, and use the links at the bottom of each page to move to the next chapter.

==Overview==
TI-Basic is a simple programming language used on Texas Instruments (TI) graphing calculators which integrates many normal graphing calculator commands (like storing variables or graphing) into its code.

TI-Basic is a relatively easy language to program in, especially when it is compared with Assembly, the other main language that can be used to program TI graphing calculators. Programs written in TI-Basic, compared to programs written in Assembly, have a small filesize (due to that fact that commands like 'If ' and 'Menu(' use just 1-2 bytes of memory). However, this makes execution of TI-Basic programs very slow, because the calculator first reads through and parses each line of code before translating it into Assembly and executing it (in other words, it suffers from the same performance issues as any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language interpreted language]). Despite its slow speed, the use of TI-Basic is appropriate for many simple programs.

==Assumptions==
This wikibook assumes that you have at least a partial understanding of the following concepts:
*What a [[w:Programming Language|programming language]] is
*Basic [[w:Elementary algebra|algebra]]
*Operation of a [[w:TI-84|TI-84 calculator]]

==Versions of TI-BASIC==
The two main versions of TI-Basic in use today are these:

*TI-Basic that comes on the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-84+ and TI-84+ Silver Edition calculators. It is the less powerful version of TI-Basic, but is still fairly versatile.
*TI-Basic that comes on the TI-89, TI 89 Titanium, TI-92, TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 calculators. It is the more powerful version of TI-Basic.

Note that there are slight variations between the two.

== NPOV ==

I have marked this article as NPOV, it states that the doctor who invented it was &quot;something of a genious&quot;, that there are &quot;over 3000 remedies proved&quot;. Now, the word proved, would indicate the presence of a scientific approach, but the article also states that science &quot;is not advanced enough yet to explain how homeopathy works&quot;. It also uses weasel words, saying that &quot;Homeopathy is very widely used&quot;.

For example, you can teleport through a wormhole to get to different countries, ride virtual roller-coaster rides; visit museums, and buildings. To create your own virtual homepage (or virtual worlds), you need to register and pay a monthly fee. It seems as if used wisely and creatively, it can be a great place to chat in a foreign language. Sadly, only PC users can access the interface.

====[[Wikipedia:Voice over IP | Broadband Internet Phone Service]] ([[Wikipedia:Voice over IP |VoIP]])====

Many new and traditional telephone companies now offer unlimited local and long-distance calls (domestic and international) for a fixed monthly fee to customers who have a broadband Internet connection.

As the fees charged are typically much less than traditional phone service, VoIP telephone service can be an economical way for users that already have broadband Internet service to practice their foreign languages with partners in other countries.

For example, for user in the United States, [http://www.broadvoice.com BroadVoice] offers unlimited calls to 21 countries for $19.95 a month.  For $24.95 subscribers can call 35 countries.

[http://www.talkaboutvoip.com Talk About VoIP.com] and [http://voxilla.com Voxilla] provide forums and useful information about VoIP service.

Before subscribing to a VoIP telephone service, you might want to make sure first that you can transfer your current telephone number to the VoIP service.  You should also check if emergency dialing services (such as 911 in the U.S. and Canada) are available.  Also keep in mind that unlike a traditional telephone, VoIP service will not work if your Internet connection is interrupted of if you experience a power failure.  For these reasons it is a good idea of have a backup landline or cellular service.

Most traditional telephone companies such as MCI and AT&amp;T in the United States now offer VoIP telephone service.

* [[wikipedia:Skype | Skype]] [http://www.skype.com] '''Advantages''' of Skype are that it is cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Pocket PC), has a directory in which users living in selected countries who speak selected  languages can be found, and has a video Skype also has a search function to find other members in desired countries speaking desired languages as well as the ability to search for users to who want to be contacted by other Skype users (Skype me). The '''disadvantages''' are that it uses a proprietary protocol, does not interoperate with other communication systems, can use bandwidth from connected computers for other calls, does not indicate when the other party is typing when text chatting, stores text chats on the user's local computer, and does not provide an option for audio recording. Starting in May 2006 and continuing until the end of 2006, Skype offers free  SkypOut calls from computer to any regular or mobile telephone in the U.S. or Canada. For adding audio recording features to Skype, see [[wikipedia:Skypecasting|Skypecasting]]. [http://www.powergramo.com/ PowerGramo] is a free program that allows Windows users to record Skype calls.
** [http://www.skypejournal.com Skype Journal]
**[http://tandemlearn.com/SkypeCompanionInstaller.exe  Skype Companion for Language Learners] is a program that helps Skype users find partners for language practice. The software is under active development. It's currently only available for Microsoft Windows, although Skype has announced that the Skype API (which this software uses) will soon be available for Linux and Mac OS X.

* [[Wikipedia: Google Talk | Google Talk]] [http://talk.google.com]. '''Advantages''' of Google Talk are its simple interface and use of Jabber (non proprietary) protocol which makes it interoperable with some other instant message systems, shows when the other party is typing in text chat mode, and stores chat sessions on a central server along with the user's Gmail messages under &quot;Chats&quot;.  '''Disadvantages''' are that it does not have conference call capabiility, does not provide video, and does not allow audio for Macintosh users, and uses must have a [[wikipedia: Gmail | Gmail]] account to use Google Talk.

* [[Wikipedia: Gizmo Project | Gizmo Project]] [http://www.gizmoproject.com official website] The advantages of Gizmo Project are that is uses an open source open protocol ([[Wikipedia: SIP | SIP]]) and therefore is interoperable with other SIP products. It is cross-platform (Windows, Macintosh, Linux). Users can also receive free calls as dialed to one of several regular telephone numbers in the U.S. and U.K. (the caller must pay any normal charges incurred for the call). Conference calls with a large number of participants can be made. There are a large number of [[Wikipedia: Session_Initiation_Protocol | SIP]] [http://sipphone.com/numbers/ telephone networks and university telephone systems] that can be called using Gizmo. Gizmo also allows instant message communication with over 10 million [[Wikipedia:Jabber | Jabber]] system software users worldwide.

First of all it is a completely free program that only takes a downloading. MSN Live Messenger allows people anywhere in the world to interact using synchronous audio or text chatting, with the option of using a webcam. MSN also saves all text chats so people can go back a reference their conversations.

* [[wikipedia:Windows_Messenger | Windows Messenger]] ([http://www.microsoft.com/windows/messenger/ official site])

* [[wikipedia:Yahoo_Messenger | Yahoo Messenger]] ([http://messenger.yahoo.com official site]). Yahoo Messenger has the option of joing language specific chat rooms once the program is up and running. The user needs to select the &quot;Messenger&quot; drop window, select &quot;Yahoo Chat,&quot; and then select &quot;Join a room.&quot; Once the room list has been populated, the user needs to select the &quot;Cultures &amp; Community&quot; folder followed by the sub-folder &quot;By Language.&quot; Once this category is visible, it is possible to select a chat room in French, Spanish, Italian to name a few. It is also possible to use video and sound when chatting in the room. It should be mentioned that some of the content in these chat rooms can be of a vulgar nature, so users need to be prepared to hear or read such words/expressions. However, the positive benefits of hearing native speakers and possibly watching them on their webcams (if they allow you to watch them) is a great way to personalize L2 learning.

Unlike the other synchronous voice communications programs listed here, Gizo uses the [[Wikipedia:Session_Initiation_Protocol | Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) standard so it can communicate with other voice over IP (VOIP) products.  Like Skype, Gizmo lets you call other Gizmo computer users for free and also lets you call (and receive calls from) regular telephones located anywhere in the world for a per-minute charge (although usually much cheaper than regular long-distance phone calls) For Windows and Macintosh with Linux version promised soon.

===VoIP USB-Telephone Adaptors (USB to RJ11)===

VoIP USB-telephone adaptors allow you to connect VoIP systems such as Skype, Google Talk and VoipBuster to your regular telephone system. This allows to do things such as:
#Use your regular home telephone system to receive and make VoIP calls from your computer.
#Call your home telephone number from your mobile (cellular) phone to place a call from your computer or to another phone (thus avoiding high mobile-phone international long-distance toll charges)
#When travelling abroad, you can use a computer VoIP call to connect to your home telephone and call your local calling area, again avoiding international long-distance charges
#Connect a cordless phone base station to your computer, allowing you to use use your cordless phone to make and receive Voip calls via your computer.

One source of VoIP USB-telephone adaptors in the U.S. is [http://www.von-phone.com von-phone], offering two models. The [http://www.von-phone.com/skype_gateway_with_remote_calling_and_call_recording.php AU-600] allows you to record your calls on your computer, but works only with Skpe on Windows. The [http://www.von-phone.com/usb_skype_phone_adapter.php B2K] does not offer call recording, but can be used with both Windows and Linux using Skpe and with Windows using Google Talk, VoipBuster, Net2Phone, X-TenMate and SJPhoneMate for SJPhone.

This template is made to be used at the bottom of each section-page of the [[LaTeX]] book.

Usage:  {{nowrap|{{tlx|{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage|Nextpage}}}} produces a horizontal bar with links to {{nowrap|LaTeX/Prevpage}} and {{nowrap|LaTeX/Nextpage}}, that looks like this:

{{{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage|Nextpage}}

Either parameter can be empty, in which case that element is omitted from the bar (so that this template can be used on the first and last sections of the book).  {{nowrap|{{tlx|{{PAGENAME}}||Nextpage}}}} would look like

{{{{PAGENAME}}||Nextpage}}

while {{nowrap|{{tlx|{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage}}}} would look like

{{{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conventions==
A number of conventions are used in this book.  Learning these conventions will aid in the learning process.

As this is a book designed to teach one how to program TI-Basic programs, there will be several pieces of code throughout the chapter.  Thus, special boxes have been designed so that one can easily find where certain portions of code exist.

There are three main code boxes:  Syntax, Examples, and Output.

===Syntax===
Syntax is the way a command must be stated.  For example, the output function has certain restrictions.  There must first be a Y coordinate, an X coordinate, and then what is to be outputted.  To inform one of all these restrictions, this book would display them in the following fashion:

&lt;BEGIN&gt;

{{bcode:Syntax|
Output(''Row'',''Col'',''Stuff''
|
*Where ''Row'' is a number or real variable that will determine the vertical position of ''Stuff''
**''Row'' can be a number between 1 and 8 (there are 8 lines of text on the screen)
*Where ''Col'' is a number or real variable that will determine the horizontal position of ''Stuff''.
**''Col'' can be a number between 1 and 16 (there are 16 characters across the screen)
*Where ''Stuff'' is a string, number, equation, or variable of any type, that is to be displayed at the specified location.
}}

&lt;END&gt;

===Examples===
Examples are just that, Examples.  They are examples of the commands in use, sometimes only containing one command, sometimes containing more.  Often there are more than one example for a given function, with different variations in the way the command can be used.  Examples are formatted as follows

&lt;BEGIN&gt;

{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
}}
The previous example will always display &lt;tt&gt;HELLO WORLD&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;END&gt;

Usually, but not always, there will be some sort of explanation either before or after the example.

===Output===
Output is merely used to show one how certain programs or functions would look on the calculator. If there is an example prior to the Output box, it is implied that the program was executed from the homescreen, but that the program name is not present (i.e. there is no pgrmPROGRAM display for each output).  Outputs are displayed as follows:

&lt;BEGIN&gt;
{{bcode:Output|
HELLO WORLD
}}
&lt;END&gt;

==Calculator vs Computer==
===Code===
It should be noted that the calculator screen can only show a certain amount of characters (16 characters).  This constraint is ignored in this book.  In other words, while the code would be like this on the calculator:
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;Hello, Wo
rld!&quot;,&quot;My name i
s Bob
}}
It it still written this way in this guide:
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;Hello, World!&quot;,&quot;My name is Bob
}}
&lt;!-- There is only exception to this.  When it is neccessary to show the actual display (i.e. a certain format is needed, the follow --&gt;

===Commands===
It must be understood that to &quot;type&quot; commands (commands are all code other than strings and mathematical functions) like &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; for example, are not written by typing each character (&lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt;), but rather by accessing the token &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; in one of the menus built into the calculator.  Most instructions are only found in certain menus.

The &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; instruction, for example, can be found by pressing PRGM, then moving to the I/O menu, and then either pressing 3 or scrolling down to it and pressing &lt;tt&gt;Enter&lt;/tt&gt;.  Each keypress, in order.  ((NOTE: This assumes you are already in the Program Editor, this makes a big difference))

In this book, in order to shorten the commands, the above would be shown as '''PRGM:I/O:3'''.  

These are the exact keys that are pressed in order to access the command, seperated by a semicolon ':'.  If a command is accessed by pressing the second key, the menu has the menu name listed first, then the actual key text listed in parenthesises.

So, in order to find &lt;tt&gt;Pxl-On(&lt;/tt&gt;, the instructions would be '''2nd:DRAW(PRGM):POINTS:5'''. the '''2nd''' key is pressed, followed by the '''DRAW''' menu (which is really the secondary '''PRGM'''), then one navigates to '''POINTS''', then presses 5 or finds the function 
&lt;tt&gt;Pxl-On(&lt;/tt&gt;, on the list.

It should also be noted that most instructions can also be accessed through the Catalog,
'''2nd:CATALOG(0)'''.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Topic 2: Mechanics&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
==Kinematics (2.1)==
===Kinematic concepts===
'''2.1.1''' ''Define displacement, velocity, speed and acceleration.''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|+Kinematic Units
|-
!  !! Symbol !! Definition !! SI Unit !! Vector or Scalar?
|-
! Displacement
| ''s'' || The distance moved in a particular direction || m || Vector
|-

|}

*Vector quantities always have a direction associated with them.

'''2.1.2''' ''Define and explain the difference between instantaneous and average values''
of speed, velocity and acceleration.

*Average value - over a period of time.

*Instantaneous value - at one particular time.

'''2.1.3''' ''Describe an object's motion from more than one frame of reference.''

===Graphical representation of motion===
'''2.1.4''' ''Draw and analyse distance–time graphs, displacement–time graphs, velocity–time graphs and acceleration–time graphs.''

'''2.1.5''' ''Analyse and calculate the slopes of displacement–time graphs and velocity – time graphs, and the areas under velocity–time graphs and acceleration–time graphs. Relate these to the relevant kinematic quantity.''

===Uniformly accelerated motion===

 ''Determine the velocity and acceleration from simple timing situations''

 ''Derive the equations for uniformly accelerated motion.''

 ''Describe the vertical motion of an object in a uniform gravitational field.''

 ''Describe the effects of air resistance on falling objects.''

 ''Solve problems involving uniformly accelerated motion.''

==Forces and Dynamics (2.2)==
===Forces and free-body diagrams===
===Newton’s first law===
Newton's First Law of Physics states that a body will remain at rest or moving with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

===Equilibrium===

Equilibrium is the condition of a system in which competing influences (such as forces) are balanced.

===Newton’s second law===
ΣF = ma

Alternately:
ΣF = Δp/Δt
In words, the resultant force is all that matters in the second law. The direction of motion depends on the direction of the resultant force.

===Newton’s third law===

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal and opposite force on body A.

==Inertial Mass, Gravitational Mass and Weight (2.3)==

An object's inertial mass is defined as the ratio of the applied force F, to its acceleration, a.

&lt;math&gt;m_{Inertial}= \dfrac{F}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

==State Newton's first law of motion (2.2.4)==

In ancient times, Aristotle had maintained that a force is what is required to keep a body in motion. The higher the speed, the larger the force needed. Aristotle's idea of force is not unreasonable and is in fact in accordance with experience from everyday life: It does require a force to push a piece of furniture from one corner of a room to another. What Aristotle failed to appreciate is that everyday life is plagued by friction. An object in motion comes to rest because of friction and thus a force is required if it is to keep moving. This force is needed in order to cancel the force of friction that opposes the motion. In an idealized world with no friction, a body that is set into motion does not require a force to keep it moving. Galileo, 2000 years after Aristotle, was the first to realize that the state of no motion and the state of motion with constant speed in a straight line are indistinguishable from each other. Since no force is present in the case of no motion, no forces are required in the case of motion in a straight line with constant speed either. Force is related to changes in velocity (i.e. acceleration)

Newton's first law (generalizing Galileo's statements) states the following:

'''When no forces act on a body, that body will either remain at rest or continue to move along a straight line at constant speed.'''

A body that moves with acceleration (i.e. changing speed or changing direction of motion) must have a force acting on it. An ice hockey puck slides on ice with practically no friction and will thus move with constant speed in a straight line. A spacecraft leaving the solar system with its engines off has no force acting on it and will continue to move in a straight line at constant speed (until it encounters another body that will attract or hit it). Using the first law, it is easy to see if a force is acting on a body. For example, the earth rotates around the sun and thus we know at once that a force must be acting on the Earth.

Newton's first law is also called the law of ''Inertia''

Inertia is the reluctance of a body to change its state of motion. Inertia keeps the body in the same state of motion when no forces act on the body. When a car accelerates forward, the passengers are thrown back into their seats. If a car brakes abruptly, the passengers are thrown forward. This implies that a mass tends to stay in the state of motion it was in before the force acted on it. The reaction of a body to a change in its state of motion is inertia.

A well-known example of inertia is that of a magician who very suddenly pulls the tablecloth off a table leaving all the plates, glasses, etc., behind on the table. The inertia of these objects make them 'want' to stay on the table where they are. Similarly, if you pull very suddenly on a roll of kitchen paper you will tear off a sheet. But if you pull gently you will only succeed in making the paper roll rotate.

==Work, Energy and Power (2.5)==
=== Work ===

Work refers to an activity involving a force and movement along the direction of the force.
It is a scalar quantity that is measured in Joules (Newton meters in SI units) which can be defined as:

'''Work done= F×s×cosθ''' 

Where F is the force applied to the object, s is the displacement of the object and cosθ is the cosine of the angle between the force and the displacement. 
In a linear example (with the force being exerted in the same direction as the displacement), the cosθ is equal to 1 and the equation simplifies to &lt;math&gt;Work=F\times s&lt;/math&gt;. 

Example calculation:
If a force of 20 newtons pushes an object 5 meters in the same direction as the force what is the work done?
 F= 20 N
 s=5 m
 W=F×s=20×5= 100 J 
 100 Joules of work is done

''Examples (when is work done?):'' 
 Force making an object move faster (accelerating)
 Lifting an object up (moving it to a higher position in the gravitational field)
 Compressing a spring

When is work not done
 When there is no force
 Object moving at a constant speed
 Object not moving

Some useful equations;

If an object is being  lifted vertically the work done to it can be calculated using the equation

'''Work done= mgh'''

Where m is the mass in kilograms, g is the earth's gravitational field strength (10N kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and h is the height in meters

Work done in compressing or extending a spring

'''Work done = ½ kx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

Where k is Hooke's constant and x is the displacement

=== Energy and Power ===

Energy is the capacity for doing work. The amount of energy you transfer is equal to the work done. Energy is a measure of the amount of work done, this means that the units for energy and work must be the same- joules.
Energy is like the &quot;currency&quot; for performing work. To do 100 joules of work, you must expend 100 joules of energy. 

Conservation of energy

In any situation the change in energy must be accounted for. If it is 'lost' by one object it must be gained by another. This is the principle of conservation of energy which can be stated in several ways:

:The total overall energy of a closed system must be constant
:Energy is neither created or destroyed, it just changes form.
:there is no change in the total energy of the universe

Energy can be in many different types these include:

:Kinetic energy,  Gravitational potential energy, Elastic potential energy, Electrostatic potential energy, Thermal energy, Electrical energy, Chemical energy, Nuclear energy, Internal energy, Radiant energy, Solar energy, and light energy. 

You will need equations for the first three
:'''Kinetic energy = ½ mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' where m is the mass in kg, v is the velocity (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
:'''Gravitational potential energy= mgh''' where m is the mass in kg, g is the gravitational field strength, and h is the change in height
:'''Elastic potential energy =½ kx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' where k is the spring constant and x is the extension

Power -measured in Watts (W) or Joules per second (Js&lt;small&gt;-1&lt;/small&gt;)- is the rate of doing work or the rate at which energy is transferred.  

Power= energy transferred÷time taken= energy transferred÷time taken

If something is moving at a constant velocity ''v'' against a constant frictional force ''f'', the power ''P'' needed is ''P= fv''

If you do 100 joules of work in one second (using 100 joules of energy), the power is 100 watts.

Efficiency is the ratio of useful energy to the total energy transferred .

===Work-Energy Principle===

The change in the kinetic energy of an object is equal to the net work done on the object.

&lt;math&gt;W_{net} = \dfrac{1}{2}mv_{final}^2 - \dfrac{1}{2}mv_{initial}^2&lt;/math&gt;

This fact is referred to as the Work-Energy Principle and is often a very useful tool in mechanics problem solving. It is derivable from conservation of energy and the application of the relationships for work and energy, so it is not independent of the conservation laws. It is in fact a specific application of conservation of energy. However, there are so many mechanical problems which are solved efficiently by applying this principle that it merits separate attention as a working principle.

For a straight-line collision, the net work done is equal to the average force of impact times the distance traveled during the impact.

Average impact force x distance traveled = change in kinetic energy

If a moving object is stopped by a collision, extending the stopping distance will reduce the average impact force.

==Uniform Circular Motion (2.6)==
{{BookCat}}

The centripetal force with constant velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, at a distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the center is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;F = m\dfrac{v^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

{{cquote|To understand the natives, you must learn their language.}}

A '''software program''' or '''application''' consists of a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do. A cake recipe can be thought of as a program with a list of instructions that tells a person what to do to make a cake. You can refer to the same cake recipe anytime you wish to make a cake when you know the language the instructions are written in. A computer can refer to the same software program to repeat the same sequence of instructions again later when the instructions are within the set of instructions the computer can follow. The set of instructions a computer can follow is known as an '''instruction set'''.

[[File:IPO Diagram.svg|400px|center]]

An instruction may need to receive '''input''' for a computer to do something, process the input as '''data''', and return information as '''output'''. The output of one instruction may be used as the input of another instruction. Input and output may be anything the computer is designed to do. A cake making computer might need to know how many servings to make as input, inform you of how much of each ingredient is needed as output, and process the ingredients to make cake.

A '''programming language''' consists of the set of available instructions that can be used to tell a computer what to do and grammatical rules that when followed can be used to create meaningful expressions, such as &quot;1+1&quot;. The English language has grammatical rules that when followed can be used to create meaningful sentences from different types of words, like nouns and verbs. rules Language when grammar sense followed make are (Languages make sense when grammar rules are followed). The importance of proper grammar should be clear.

An '''expression''' is a sequence of one or more grammatically correct instructions that tell a computer what to do. A '''compiler''' is a software program that translates the meaning of expressions of a programming language into appropriate instructions for a computer. Anyone who understands how to write expressions of a programming language can tell a computer what to do by using a compiler to do the translation, much like a person who knows both Spanish and English can be a translator for people who only know English or Spanish. A person who understands and can use a programming language to write software programs is called a '''programmer'''.

[[File:Oxygen480-apps-accessories-calculator.svg|150px|left]]
An electronic calculator is one of the simplest forms of a computer with expressions consisting of numbers, mathematical operators and functions like log() that can be combined together to a create mathematical expression that the calculator can process to return a result. The mathematical expression &quot;1+1&quot;, for example, consists of the instruction add which takes as input two numbers and when processed by the calculator returns &quot;2&quot; as the result or output. However unlike calculators, the instructions of one computer may not mean anything to another computer, just as two people who don't share a common language may not understand each other. Programming languages, like C++, make writing portable programs easier, through translation of a consistent language into instructions that the target computer can process.

Expressions in C++ consist of numbers, operators, variables, functions, classes, enumerations and other things which make up the language. In English, various punctuation marks end a sentence. In C++, a semicolon (&lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;) ends all statements, such as &quot;a=1+1;&quot;. A '''block''' is a group of statements surrounded by open and closing curly brackets (&lt;tt&gt;{}&lt;/tt&gt;). Blocks serve much the same purpose as paragraphs do in English.

== Example program ==
Now that you understand the basic building blocks of C++, you are ready to see your first C++ program:

&lt;div style=&quot;padding:0.5em 1em; margin:1em 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot; enclose=&quot;div&quot; line=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
/*
   helloworld.cpp
   Displays:
   Hello World!
   My name is Dell!
*/

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
   std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl &lt;&lt; &quot;My name is Dell!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   return 0; // exit program
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You have probably seen some things that don't make sense yet. Let's look at this, piece by piece.

Lines 1 through 6 denote a C++ comment. Comments help those reviewing code and are completely ignored by compilers. Comments are often used for record keeping purposes, or to cause a section of code to be ignored by compilers. Similar to blocks described above, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;/*&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; begins a comment block, and the first occurrence of &quot;&lt;tt&gt;*/&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ends a comment block.

Line 8 is the first instruction that compilers will not ignore, it reads &quot;&lt;tt&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; tells the compiler to consider the content of a file to be part of the current program. In the case of iostream, a C++ program will be able to receive input and send output. Inclusion makes programming in C++ easier by allowing you to reuse other programmer's existing work in your own program.

Line 10, you will find more key term(s) in C++. &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is one of the basic types in C++. &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is short for integer. An &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; can hold any whole number value, positive or negative, within certain limits, but we won't get to that for a while.

Next you will find &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;, a function name. C++ programs begin by calling the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function. C++ programs must have only one main function and that function must return an integer.

Next you will find &lt;tt&gt;()&lt;/tt&gt;, which means this function isn't passed anything. We will talk about functions later.

Next is &lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt;, which indicates the beginning of a block. This particular block is called a ''function block''. We will discuss other types of blocks that exist in C++ later as new concepts are introduced.

Before continuing, meet &quot;using namespace std;&quot;. This expression means that std:: doesn't need to be included before certain things in the standard library. This can save typing, but at a cost which we'll get to later. After including that the code can be shortened like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;padding:0.5em 1em; margin:1em 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot; enclose=&quot;div&quot; line=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
/*
   helloworld.cpp
   Displays:
   Hello World!
   My name is Dell!
*/

#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; &quot;My name is Dell!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
   return 0; // exit program
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Next, &quot;what are those weird &lt;&lt; things doing in the code?&quot; you may ask. This tells the compiler &quot;Ok, this is what we are going to print to the screen.&quot; and when you see something like:

'''cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; &quot;My name is Dell!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;'''

You may wonder why not just do this?:

'''cout &quot;Hello World!&quot; endl &quot;My name is Dell!&quot;;'''

The reason is syntax. Without the &lt;&lt; in place, the compiler doesn't know when to perform the next task (which in this case, the 2nd task is the &quot;Hello World!&quot;). Technically, this is what the computer thinks (you don't have to read it if you understand):

&quot;Ok, i see a cout. That means print stuff to the prompt. Next to it i see &quot;Hello World!&quot;, ill send that to the screen. Oh, i see a &lt;&lt;, im moving on to the next step. The next thing is endl, so i will create a new line. Another &lt;&lt;! Wow, i need to play the lotto. Ok, so now i have to print &quot;My name is Dell!&quot;. Now i see ;. Ok, im done with this whole line of code.&quot;

Now, the basis in which programming interactive programs... variables. In short, variables store stuff, as in a storage bin. This will be finished later...

----

Throughout the rest of this book, you will learn more about C++, the standard rules of the language, and come to understand this and other C++ programs you may encounter. The rest of this chapter takes a look at what each of the remaining chapters in this book covers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

'''Virtual Memory''' is a computer concept where the main memory is broken up into a series of individual ''pages''. Those pages can be moved in memory as a unit, or they can even be moved to secondary storage to make room in main memory for new data. In essence, virtual memory allows a computer to use more RAM then it has available.

If a simple virtual==physical address path is adequate for your CPU, you don't need virtual memory.

Most processors have a very simple address path -- address bits come from the PC or some other programmer-visible register, or directly from some instruction, and they are directly applied to the address bus.

Many general-purpose processors have a more complex address path: user-level programs run as if they have a simple address path, but the physical address applied to the address bus is significantly different than the programmer-visible address.
This enables virtual memory, memory protection, and other desirable features.

If your CPU needs to do this, then you need something to translate user-visible addresses to physical address -- either design the CPU to connect to some off-chip bank register or MMU (such as the 8722 MMU or the 68851 MMU) or design in an on-chip bank register or MMU.

You may want to do this in order to:
* support various debug tools that trap on reads or writes to selected addresses.
* allow access to more RAM (wider physical address) than the user-level address seems to support (banking)
* support many different programs all in RAM at the same time at different physical RAM locations, even though they were all compiled to run at location 0x300.
* allow a program to successfully read and write a large block of data using normal LOAD and STORE instructions as if it were all in RAM, even though the machine doesn't have that much RAM (paging with virtual memory)
* support a &quot;protected&quot; supervisor-level system that can run buggy or malicious user-level code in an isolated sandbox at full speed without damaging other user-level programs or the supervisor system itself -- Popek and Goldberg virtualization, W xor X memory protection, etc.
* or some combination of the above.

== Implementation ==

Virtual memory can be implemented both in hardware and (to a lesser degree) in software, although many modern implementations have both hard and soft components. We discuss virtual memory here because many modern PC and server processors have virtual memory capabilities built in.

Paging systems are designed to be transparent, that is, the (user-mode) programs running on the microprocessor do not need to be explicitly aware of the paging mechanism to operate correctly. 

Many processor systems give pages certain qualifiers to specify what kinds of data can be stored in the page. For instance, many new processors specify whether a page contains instructions or data, so that data pages cannot be executed as instructions, and instructions cannot be corrupted by data writes (see [[w:W^X|W^X]]).


The hardware part of virtual memory is called the memory management unit (MMU).
Most MMUs have a granularity of one page.

A few CPU designs use a more fine-grained access control to detect and prevent buffer overflow bugs, a common security vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;

2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memory Accessing ==

Memory addresses correspond to a particular page, and an offset within that page. If a page is 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; bytes in a 32-bit computer, then the first 22 bits of the memory address are the page address, and the lower 12 bits are the offset of the data inside that page. The top 22 bits in this case will be separated from the address, and they will be replaced with the current physical address of that page. If the page does not exist in main memory, the processor (or the paging software) will retrieve the page from secondary storage, which can cause a significant delay.

== Pages ==

A page is a basic unit of memory, typically several kilobytes or larger. A page may be moved in memory to different locations, or if it is not being used, it can frequently be moved to secondary storage instead. The area in the secondary storage is typically known as the '''page file''', the &quot;scratchpad&quot;, or something similar.

== Page Table ==

The addresses of the various pages are stored in a paging table. The paging table itself can be stored in a memory unit inside the processor, or it can reside in a dedicated area of main memory.

=== Page Faults ===

A page fault occurs when the processor cannot find a page in the page table. 

=== Translation Look-Aside Buffer ===

The translation look-aside buffer (TLB) is a small structure, similar to a cache, that stores the addresses of the most recently used pages. Looking up a page in the TLB is much faster then searching for the page in the page table. When the processor cannot find a particular page in the TLB, it is known as a &quot;TLB Miss&quot;. When the TLB misses, the processor looks for the page in the page table. If the page is not in the table either, there is a page fault.

Notice that even though the TLB can be considered a kind of cache, caching part of the page table stored in main memory, it is a physically separate structure than the instruction cache or the data cache, and has several features not found in those caches.

==== TLB entry ====

The SRAM in the TLB can be seen as entirely composed of TLB entries.
The format of the TLB entries in the TLB SRAM is fixed by the TLB hardware.
The paging supervisor -- part of the operating system -- typically maintains a page table in main memory which stores the page table entries in exactly the same format as TLB entries.
Each TLB entry contains:
* the virtual address of a page (analogous to the &quot;tag&quot; in a cache)
* the physical address of a page (analogous to the &quot;data&quot; in a cache)

While not essential, some TLB hardware has many other optional control and protection fields and flags in the TLB, including:
* the no-execute bit (NX bit), used to implement W^X (&quot;Write XOR Execute&quot;)
* a &quot;dirty bit&quot; (also called the &quot;modified bit&quot;), set whenever there is a STORE written into that page, and typically cleared when the modified page is written to the backing store.
* the writable bit, used to implement PaX, sometimes cleared and later set by the OS in order to implement copy-on-write (COW)
* which virtual address space a physical page belongs to (unnecessary on a [[w:single address space operating system|single address space operating system]])
* the supervisor bit
* statistics on which TLB entries were most recently or most frequently used, used to decide which TLB entry to discard when loading a new TLB entry from main memory
* statistics on which page was most recently or most frequently used, used to support LRU or more sophisticated page-replacement algorithms that decide which page currently in main memory to &quot;page out&quot; to the backing store when the OS needs to load some other page from the backing store into physical memory

The page table entries may include additional per-page fields that are not copied into the TLB entries, such as
* the &quot;pinned bit&quot; (aka &quot;fixed flag&quot;) that indicates that a page must stay in main memory -- the paging supervisor marks as pinned pages that must stay in main memory, including the paging supervisor executable code itself, the device drivers for the secondary storage devices on which pages are swapped out; interrupt handler executable code. Some data buffers are also pinned during I/O transactions during the time that devices outside the CPU read or write those buffers (direct memory access and I/O channel hardware).
* a &quot;present&quot; bit (clear when that particular virtual page does not currently exist in physical main memory)

== re-naming a page ==

Hi, i search the instructions etc, but i couldn't find it...

How do i rename a page? I am writing a user manual for a software. Name is eac3to, but wiki automatically created a page with first letter upper case (Eac3to) which isn't preferred.

== Stoichiometry ==
=== Reactions of acids with bases ===
acid + base → salt + water


AH + BOH → AB + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O


&lt;math&gt; a\mbox{H}_b\mbox{X} + b\mbox{M(OH)}_a \to \mbox{M}_b\mbox{X}_a + \mbox{H}_2\mbox{O} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reactions of acids with metals ===
acid + metal → salt + hydrogen


2AH + 2M → 2MA + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

2HCl + 2Na → 2NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;


2AH + M → MA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

6HCl + 2Al → 2AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;


For any acid, H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;X, and any metal, M, with valency ''a'', the stoichiometry of the metal-acid reaction is as follows:

&lt;math&gt; a\mbox{H}_b\mbox{X} + b\mbox{M} \to \mbox{M}_b\mbox{X}_a + \frac{ab}{2}\mbox{H}_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

2HCl + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Schrödinger equation for a one-electron system ===

The amount of energy required to achieve atomisation is termed the '''enthalpy change of atomisation''', ΔH&lt;sub&gt;at&lt;/sub&gt;, measured in kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The quantity you find in most data tables is the '''standard enthalpy change of atomisation''', which is the amount of energy required to convert one mole of an element in its standard state to a monatomic gas, under [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Standard conditions|standard conditions]].

The equation for atomisation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n} \mbox{E}_n (\sigma) \rightarrow \mbox{E(g)}&lt;/math&gt;

:where σ represents the standard state of the element, so
* if E is a solid is its standard state, σ = s
* if E is a liquid is its standard state, σ = l
* if E is a gas is its standard state, σ = g.


For example, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_{at}^{\circ}(\mbox{Na})&lt;/math&gt; represents the standard enthalpy change of atomisation of sodium, &lt;math&gt; \mbox{Na(s)} \rightarrow \mbox{Na(g)}&lt;/math&gt;

The case of chlorine is slightly more complicated: &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_{at}^{\circ}(\mbox{Cl})&lt;/math&gt; represents the standard enthalpy change of atomisation of chlorine, &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \mbox{Cl}_2 \mbox{(g)} \rightarrow \mbox{Cl(g)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Opening the program===
To begin programming, open the Program Editor with the keystrokes ''PGRM:NEW''.  Then enter the desired name of your program and press enter.  The program should be completely blank.  The following examples are the only ones that will show the actual program name.

For the sake of this chapter, the program's name is TEMP.

===Enter===
Here's the initial screen - your clean slate.
{{bcode:Example|
PROGRAM:TEMP
:
}}
Hitting the &lt;tt&gt;ENTER&lt;/tt&gt; key will add a new line.  After pressing &lt;tt&gt;ENTER&lt;/tt&gt;, the screen will look like this:
{{bcode:Example|
PROGRAM:TEMP
:
:
}}

===Hello, World===
Now, one of the most very basic programs will be created: Hello, World!

Enter the list of commands as follows:
:'''PGRM:I/O:8''' (ClrHome)
:ENTER
:'''PGRM:I/O:3''' (Display)
:&quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
If you followed the commands, the program should look like - 
{{bcode:Example|
:ClrHome
:Disp &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
}}
The ClrHome command clears the home screen, removing any clutter on it before your program started. The Disp command displays anything after it. There are other ways of displaying output, but Disp is the simplest. To run the program, press '''2nd:Quit(Mode)''' then '''PGRM''', find the program in the menu, and hit enter.  The program name will be prefixed by 'pgrm' when displayed on the homescreen (&quot;prgmTEMP&quot;). Press enter again and the program will run, displaying:
{{bcode:Output|
HELLO, WORLD!
}}
And that's your first program.  A more thorough explanation of each command used can be found in later chapters.

To edit the program again, go to '''PGRM:EDIT''' and find the name of the program.

After toying around with the program editor for a while, you might have noticed something if you've had experience programming. ''There's no indentation.'' This may be a scary notion - after all, how do you keep track of those blocks of code? The lack of indentation does interfere with readability, but there is simply not enough screen real estate to allow for indentation. The screen resolution on your calculator is extremely poor, and individual pixels can be seen with the naked eye without squinting. Unfortunately, it's one of the things you'll just have to get used to in TI-BASIC programming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Calculating the pH of a buffer solution ==
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}{ \left ( K_a \frac{\left [ \mbox{acid} \right ]}{\left [ \mbox{salt} \right ]} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===
For any equilibrium

&lt;math&gt; a\mbox{A} + b\mbox{B} \rightleftharpoons c\mbox{C} + d\mbox{D} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the equilibrium constant, ''K'', is defined as

&lt;math&gt; K =  \frac{ [\mbox{C}]^c [\mbox{D}]^d }{ [\mbox{A}]^a [\mbox{B}]^b } &lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, for the dissociation equilibrium of any acid

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)} \rightleftharpoons \mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)} + \mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the acid dissociation constant, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as

&lt;math&gt; K_a =  \frac{ [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] [\mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be rearranged to make [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)] the subject:

&lt;math&gt; [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] = K_a \frac{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [\mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;


Two assumptions are required:

'''1''' Every A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion comes from the salt

:Although this is not quite true, it is a close enough that the pH value we get from the final equation is very close to that found experimentally.  It allows us to assume that

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)} \right ] =  \left [ \mbox{acid} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;


'''2''' Every HA molecule remains undissociated

: Again, despite being slightly inaccurate, this assumption creates the following useful equation

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)} \right ] =  \left [ \mbox{salt} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;


The equations in assumptions '''1''' and '''2''' allow us to replace [A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)] with [salt] and [HA(aq)] with [acid] as follows.


The effect of assumption '''1''' is that

&lt;math&gt; [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] = K_a  \frac{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [\mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;

becomes

&lt;math&gt; [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] = K_a  \frac{  [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [ \mbox{salt} ] } &lt;/math&gt;


The effect of assumption '''2''' is that

&lt;math&gt; [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] = K_a \frac{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [ \mbox{salt} ] } &lt;/math&gt;

becomes

&lt;math&gt; [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] = K_a  \frac{ [\mbox{acid}] }{ [ \mbox{salt} ] } &lt;/math&gt;


By definition,

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}{ \left ( \left [ \mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)} \right ] \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

so

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}{ \left ( K_a \frac{\left [ \mbox{acid} \right ]}{\left [ \mbox{salt} \right ]} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Calculating the pH of a weak acid solution ==
The pH of a weak acid solution can be calculated approximately using the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}{ \left ( \sqrt{K_a \left [ \mbox{acid} \right ]} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===
For any equilibrium

&lt;math&gt; a\mbox{A} + b\mbox{B} \rightleftharpoons c\mbox{C} + d\mbox{D} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the equilibrium constant, ''K'', is defined as

&lt;math&gt; K =  \frac{ [\mbox{C}]^c [\mbox{D}]^d }{ [\mbox{A}]^a [\mbox{B}]^b } &lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, for the dissociation equilibrium of any acid

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)} \rightleftharpoons \mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)} + \mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the acid dissociation constant, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as

&lt;math&gt; K_a =  \frac{ [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] [\mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;


Two assumptions are required:

'''1''' The concentrations of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) and A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) are equal, or in symbols:

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)} \right ] =  \left [ \mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

:The reason this is an approximation is that a very slightly higher concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) exists in reality, due to the autodissociation of water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{unicode|⇌}}  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq).  We neglect this effect since water produces a far lower concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) than most weak acids. If you were studying an exceptionally weak acid (you won't at A-level), this assumption might begin to cause big problems.


'''2''' The amount of HA at equilibrium is the same as the amount originally added to the solution.

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)} \right ] =  \left [ \mbox{acid} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

:This cannot be quite true, otherwise HA wouldn't be an ''acid''.  It is, however, a close numerical approximation to experimental observations of the concentration of HA in most cases.


The effect of assumption '''1''' is that

&lt;math&gt; K_a =  \frac{ [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] [\mbox{A}^- \mbox{(aq)}] }{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;

becomes

&lt;math&gt; K_a =  \frac{ [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}]^2 }{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;



The effect of assumption '''2''' is that

&lt;math&gt; K_a =  \frac{ [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}]^2 }{ [\mbox{HA} \mbox{(aq)}] } &lt;/math&gt;

becomes

&lt;math&gt; K_a =  \frac{ [\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}]^2 }{ [\mbox{acid}] } &lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to give

&lt;math&gt;[\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}]^2 = K_a \left [ \mbox{acid} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

&lt;math&gt;[\mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)}] = \sqrt{K_a \left [ \mbox{acid} \right ]}&lt;/math&gt;


By definition,

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}{ \left ( \left [ \mbox{H}^+ \mbox{(aq)} \right ] \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

so

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}{ \left ( \sqrt{K_a \left [ \mbox{acid} \right ]} \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== &quot;New&quot; models ===

==== Fault-Tolerant Web Sites ====
Many people have speculated that peer-to-peer file sharing technology could be used to improve wiki and other kinds of Internet services.

==== High quality video or large files distribution ====
The Internet infrastructure was not designed to support broadcasting. P2P partially solves this infrastructural bottleneck by switching the server or content provider from a single point to a decentralized infrastructure, that depends not on the specific network limitations but on the protocol that optimizes the distribution and its popularity.  

{{TODO|Complete, cover “multicasting”}}

In February 2008 the European Union announced its commitment into a four-year project that aims to create an open source, peer-to-peer BitTorrent-like client called P2P-Next, based on an improvement of the Delft University of Technology python project Tribler. The EU will contribute 14 million euros (£10.5 million, $22 million) into this project and another 5 million euros (£3.7 million, $7.4 million) will be added by another 21 partners that includes the European Broadcasting Union, Lancaster University, BBC, Markenfilm, VTT Technical Research Center and Pioneer Digital Design Center Limited.  

===== Video distribution =====
Even if several of the existing P2P applications do support video distribution, rarely have they had a consistent infrastructure and the main goal to permit subscribing to video content. Several do provide searches but a careful integration of a video player/media manager with the distribution is so far extremely rare and an evolving proposition.

Considering the door the centralized systems like YouTube, Google Video and their ilk opened in regards to online video, this new need for distribution has lead to the creation of several P2P offering, like Joost (from the same team as the Kazaa and [[The Computer Revolution/Communication/Skype|Skype]] applications), Tape it off the Internet or Veoh TV. 

Of particular notice among the new emerging platforms is Miro (formerly Democracy Player), one of the first projects of this kind. Available at http://www.getmiro.com/ , it is open-source (supports all current versions of Windows, Mac OS and several Linux distro) non-profit video player that supports practically every format. Created by the Participatory Culture Foundation (PCF, a non-profit organization), it automates subscribing to video RSS feeds that are then downloaded using Bittorrent that reduces the money spent on bandwidth required for distribution. Available is also the Miro Video Converter application, that promotes the video conversion to the patent-free [[FOSS Open Standards/Comparison of File Formats#Theora|OGG Theora codec]] (which provides the same quality of the non free h.264) and has been backing the campaign to get Video on Wikipedia.

===== Real time video =====
Transmission of live events to millions of people using the actual infrastructure imposes limits on the quality of the output and high expectations on the hardware resources, not only on network resources but on the encoding and playback capabilities on each side of the transfer.

This has lead to the use of P2P network, as an attempt to save server bandwidth.  An example of this new approach is the MSR Asia Peer-to-peer Video Broadcast System ( http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/p2pbroadcast/ ) from Microsoft Research Asia that was used in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games claiming the use of more than two million Internet peers.

==== Distribute digital content over semi-private P2P networks ====
P2P has also been used in recent times to help ease the load on distribution digital content in general in a system of restricted participation (non-public access) and dedicated function.

[[w:BitTorrent DNA|BitTorrent DNA]] or '''BitTorrent Delivery Network Accelerator''', reportedly available since January 2005 operates in this fashion. This distribution technology has been especially interesting for games software houses, that have been moving their business to the Internet and adopting the business practice of subscription to services or content, in place of selling the ownership of a copy of the digital goods they create, or in a mix model. This will require a network connection to download extra content often protected by DRM, the number of transfers increases, in a way that it is not uncommon that during the update process or even the installation of the product the user's machine will be utilized to create a P2P network, sometimes even without the full knowledge of the consumer, to help the distribution of that paid content.

[[w:Blizzard|Blizzard]] for instance, uses BitTorrent and does inform  users that when downloading some contents the user will also  be sharing it across a P2P network.

Solid State Networks already offers a P2P-based delivery solution as does [[w:Akamai|Akamai]], that sells Netsession Interface to game publishers. There are also other tools that are used to the same effect (not exclusive to games) but as helpers to the distribution of large files, Pando Media Booster is an example.

There is however a problems about transparency over the utilization of the costumers' resources. Solid State Networks recently, and after several costumers reported issues regarding this new approach, that often degrades users systems security, stability and performance. Has started a campaign to establish an industry &quot;best practices&quot;, or most of this solutions will fall in the definition of malware, http://www.solidstatenetworks.com/index.php/about-us/p2p-best-practices/ ([http://www.solidstatenetworks.com/bestpractices/SSN-Best-Practices.pdf PDF]).

P2P is also used for digital art, for instance the [[w:Electric Sheep|Electric sheep]] project ( http://community.electricsheep.org ), a C++ open source based on libtorrent BitTorrent implementation, is a [[w:distributed computing|distributed computing]] project for animating and evolving [[w:fractal flame|fractal flame]]s, which are in turn distributed to the networked computers, which display them as a [[w:screensaver|screensaver]]. The process is transparent to the casual user, who can simply install the software as a screensaver.  Alternatively, the user may become more involved with the project, manually creating sheep (video files of animated fractal flames) for upload to the server.

==== Hardware ====
As P2P protocols become more mature and claims to have a good level of public adoption, that we will see more embedded devices supporting the P2P solutions. This is already beginning to happen:

*TonidoPlug ( http://www.tonidoplug.com ) a tiny, low-power, low-cost personal home server and NAS device. Tonido Torrent is a web-based torrent client based on the BitTorrent implementation in the Boost licensed libtorrent library.
*Excito ( http://excito.com ) offers also a range of servers, named &quot;Buba&quot; that supports the BitTorrent protocol by using the the Boost licensed libtorrent library.

===== Traffic Shapers =====

===== Set Top Boxes =====
P2P technologies can also be used to provide a means to at low cost distribute content in an automated way.

Using a peer to peer architecture directly connected to a broadband line, a set top box (a stripped down PC of sorts), with an operating software and some storage space can for instance provide a service similar to video on demand.

====== VUDU ======
VUDU ( http://www.vudulabs.com/ ), thousands of movies delivered directly to your TV, it doesn't require a PC and is independent of your cable or satellite TV service.

{{TODO|TiVo, WebTV, Openwave, 2Wire, Slim Devices, OpenTV, and Danger}}

==== Distributed File-systems ====
Distributed File-systems aren't new but pre-P2P system depended on a server (or the election of a server from a pool of known machines) and were prominently focused on LANs that provided increased stability to the network. New systems are more reliable facing the volatility of a network and implement the new technologies P2P relies on. Most implementation of a P2P distributed File-systems will have evolved based on the [[w:FreeNet|FreeNet]] model to some degree.     

===== [[w:Tahoe Least-Authority Filesystem|Tahoe Least-Authority Filesystem (Tahoe-LAFS)]] =====
Tahoe-LAFS (http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/wiki) a secure remote (distributed) filesystem, released under the GNU's General Public License (GPL), that shares with P2P the underlying network architecture and the principle of least authority, but it is not entirely decentralized. It requires a central node, called an Introducer, needed to connect new nodes. 

With the objective of creating a fault-tolerant storage pool across several peers (cloud storage) were everybody provides storage for each other. The files are distributed across the multiple nodes using AES encryption. A variation of Reed-Solomon error correction is used to permit peers to disconnect without affecting the integrity of the content.

Tahoe is free software: all of the source code is available under an open-source license. The home page is at http://allmydata.org . Tahoe is sponsored by allmydata.com, which uses it as the back-end for a commercial personal-data backup service.

===== [[w:Omemo|Omemo]] (http://www.omemo.com/) =====
[[w:Omemo|Omemo]] (http://www.omemo.com/) is a free and open source (Visual Basic) P2P application under the GPL, from [[w:Pablo Soto|Pablo Soto]] creator of the MANOLITO protocol and Blubster. Omemo takes a different approach and uses a ring-shaped DHT based on Chord. It is meant to support key based routing while keeping query source obscurity due to randomization. Available for Windows.

==== Mobile Peer-to-Peer Computing ====

===== PEPERS Project =====
The PEPERS project (http://www.pepers.org/) focus is to design, implement and validate a reliable platform with high-level support for the design, development and operational deployment of secure mobile peer-to-peer applications for future Ambient Intelligent (AmI) environments. The platform will greatly assist the work and benefit both mobile application and service providers and service users. The project will address issues related to security, privacy, trust and access control in mobile peer-to-peer (p2p) systems by proposing a relevant framework architecture. The framework will include support for policy-based security management for mobile systems. The specific thematic focus of the project (that reflects also in the selection of the pilot scenarios that will be implemented) is the collaboration among teams dispersed over a geographical area. The consortium partners come from 4 EU Member states (Greece, UK, Italy and Cyprus) and include key technology providers and industry players, and leading academic institutions, as well as users partners from diverse business domains (media and journalism, security services) with increased needs for secure collaboration through advanced technological solutions that bring significant expertise and knowledge in PEPERS related technologies as well as the underlying operating business models.

From a technical point of view the project will focus on:
* the definition of appropriate security services for mobile peer-to-peer applications over suitable protocols
* the analysis and design of possible platforms and interfaces in mobile devices that can provide security services to support peer-to-peer applications
* the definition of interfaces based on open standards that will allow secure mobile access to application servers

The secure use of mobile peer-to-peer applications based on the project technology will be validated in real-life pilot applications supporting collaborative work in two operational domains:

* media and journalism: reporters working on assignment need to be able to record, edit and exchange information in a way that will protect and monitor intellectual property rights and the interests of the organization that employs them. This is particularly relevant as it covers both general issues of a mobile workforce and more specific issues related to the media application domain.
* physical security: guards and mobile patrols need to be able to receive and transmit sensitive customer information in a dynamic environment when they are called to respond and co-operate in case of ad-hoc exceptional situations.

==== Digital Currency ====

===== Bit Coin =====
'''Bitcoin''' ( http://www.bitcoin.org ), a peer-to-peer network based digital currency system without a central server or trusted parties, no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Nodes of the network hold the crypto keys to their own money and 
transact directly with each other, with the help of the network to check for double-spending. 

The limited inflation of the Bitcoin system’s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network.

* Money transfers through the Internet, without middlemen.
* No third parties control over transactions.
* Transactions are practically free.
* No inherent instability caused by fractional reserve banking or policies of central banks.

{{:The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Building a P2P System/Developer}}

== The Peer ==
The Peer and the user running it, is the corner stone of all P2P systems, without peers you will not be able to create the Network, this seems obvious but it is very common to disregard the users needs and focus on the final objective, the Network itself, kind of looking to a forest and not seeing the trees.

{{TODO|...personal computer...}}

=== Building communities ===
There is a benefit in incorporating the social element into the software. Enabling people to come together not only to share content or services but around a common goal were cooperation for an optimal state should remain the final objective.
[[Image:Foaf.svg|80px||center]]

;A P2P application is a type of social software

Social software is defined as any software that promotes and enables social collaboration. This is of course part of what defines a modern p2p system, where the gatekeeper is no more and participants are free to interact on their own terms. The p2p applications becomes an enabling tool in this reality.  

The world can increasingly be defined as a network of networks, all things are interconnected at some level. As ubiquity of Internet becomes a reality it not only makes communications speed increase but also the volume of sources this creates a quality assurance problem.

Online collaboration, built around the shared goal of a functional peer to peer network will help not only to improve the system but to establish a relation of trust that is followed by the emergence of a reputation latter. Across the participants and in the network and software itself, this personalization will ultimately enable to extend this trust and reputation to the multitude of relations that are possible in a peer to peer network.

{{TODO|link to security and leeching behaviors}}  

==== Social Networks (person-to-person) ====
As communities emerge and aggregate, they increase the addressability not only of content as before but between producers and consumers that will self organize as to establishing of super and subgroups (many-to-many) based on personal preferences.

Enabling meaningful exchange of information and promoting increased collaboration also increases disponibility of rare or obscure content and the importance of microcontent, due to the removal for extraneous information, since content can 
consistently be directed to the right audience (pulled, not pushed).

Using a social software or any type of centralized social network permits the easy extraction of metrics on user actions this has been highly explored by corporations, that have for some time been waging war not only to get a share of the data such interactions generate but also for control of such information (ie: Google and Microsoft). Microsoft has a research project dedicated especially to this subject ([http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/EnterpriseSocComp/ Enterprise Social Computing]).

=== A user oriented GUI ===
As you start to project your P2P application the [[w:Graphical user interface|GUI]] is what the users will have to interact with to use your creation, you should attempt to define not only what [[w:Operating system|OS]] you will support but within what framework you can design the application to be used from a WEB browser or select a portable framework so you can port it to other systems.

;Become the user
Overwhelming a user with options is always a bad solution and will only be enticing to highly experienced users, even if it done based on what you like, you should keep in mind that you aren't creating it for your own use.

{{TODO|Complete}}

;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
Aside form the technical decisions the functionally you offer should also be considered, the best approach is to be consistent and offer similar options to existing implementations, other applications or even how it is normally done on the environment/OS you are using. There are several guidelines you may opt to follow for instance Apple provides a guideline for OSX ( http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/ ).

== P2P Networks Topology ==
The topology of a P2P network can be very diverse, it depends on the medium it is run (Hardware), the size of the network (LAN,WAN) or even on the software/protocol that can impose or enable a specific network organization to emerge.

Below we can see the most common used topologies (there can be mixed topologies or even layered on the same network), most if not all peer to peer networks are classified as [[w:Overlay network|overlay networks]], since they are created over an already existing network with its own topology.

[[Image:NetworkTopologies.png|center]]

'''[[w:Ring topology|Ring topology]]''' - '''[[w:Mesh network|Mesh]] topology''' - 
'''[[w:Star topology|Star topology]]''' - '''Total Mesh''' or '''Full [[w:Mesh network|Mesh]] - '''Line topology''' - '''[[w:Tree topology|Tree topology]]''' - 
'''[[w:Bus topology|Bus topology]]''' - '''[[w:hybrid|Hybrid]] topology'''

A fully connected P2P network is not feasible when there is a large numbers of peers participating.
* In network of several thousands or millions of participants (n = participants)
* Were a peer would have to handle O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) overall connections, it wouldn't scale. 

Since most P2P networks are also a type of overlay networks,  the resulting topology of a P2P system depends also on the protocol, the infrastructure (medium/base network) or by the interaction of peers. This &quot;variables&quot; add more layers to the complexity of the normal networks, were the basic characteristics are bandwidth, latency and robustness, making most P2P networks into self-organizing overlay networks. 

When performing studies of P2P networks the resulting topology (structural properties) is of primary importance, there are several papers on the optimization or characteristics of P2P networks.

The paper ''Effective networks for real-time distributed processing'' ( http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612134 ) by Gonzalo Travieso and  Luciano da Fontoura Costa, seems to indicate that  uniformly random interconnectivity scheme, is specific [[w:Erdős-Rényi model|Erdős-Rényi]] (ER) random network model with fixed number of edges, as being largely more efficient than the scale-free counterpart, the [[w:BA model|Barabási-Albert]](BA) scale-free model.

=== Self-Organizing Systems (SOS) ===
P2P systems fall by default in this category, taking in account that most try to remove the centralization or Control and Command (C&amp;C) structure that exists in most centralized systems/networks.

The study of self-organizing systems is relatively new, and it applies to a huge variety of systems or structures from organizations to natural occurring events). Mostly done with math and depending on models and simulations, its accuracy depends on the complexity of the structure, number of intervenients and initial options.

This book will not cover this aspect of the P2P systems in great detail but some references and structural characteristics do run in parallel with the SOS concepts. For more information on SOS check out the Self-Organizing Systems (SOS) FAQ for USENET Newsgroup comp.theory.self-org-sys (http://www.calresco.org/sos/sosfaq.htm).

'''Synergy'''&lt;br&gt;
One of the emerging characteristic of SOS is synergy, where members aggregate around a common goal each working to the benefit of all. This is also present in most P2P systems were peers work to optimally share resources and improve the network.  
 
'''Swarm'''&lt;br&gt;
The effect generated of participants in a SOS, to aggregate and do complementary work so to share knowledge and behavior in a way it improves coordination. This is observable in the natural world on flocks of birds or social insects. We will covert this aspect of P2P later on, but keep it in mind that it related to SOS.

=== Bootstrap ===
Most P2P systems don't have (or need) a central server, but need to know an entry point into the network. This is what is called bootstrapping the P2P application. It deals with the connectivity of peers, to be able find and connect other P2P peers (the network) even without having a concrete idea who and what is where.

This is not a new problem; it is shared across several network technologies, that avoid the central point of failure of requiring a central server to index all participants - a gatekeeper. 

One solution, [[w:Zero configuration networking|Zero Configuration Networking (zeroconf)]] (see http://www.zeroconf.org/),  compromises a series of techniques that automatically (without manual operator intervention or special configuration servers) creates a usable Internet Protocol (IP) network. These techniques are often used to help bootstrap, configure or open a path across routers and firewalls.

=== Hybrid vs real-Peer systems ===
One of the main objectives of the P2P system is to make sure no single part of it critical to the collective objective.  By introducing any type of centralization to a peer-to-peer Network one is creating points of failure, as some Peers will be more than others this can even lead to security or stability problems, as with the old server-client model, were a single user could crash the server and deny its use to others.

{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Availability ===
Due to the instability of a P2P network, where nodes are always joining and leaving, some efforts must be made to guarantee not only that the network is available and enabling new peers to join, but that the resources shared continue to be recognized or at least indexed while temporarily not available. 

{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Integrity ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

Due to the open nature of peer-to-peer networks, most are under constant attack by people with a variety of motives. Most attacks can be defeated or controlled by careful design of the peer-to-peer network and through the use of encryption. P2P network defense is in fact closely related to the &quot;[[w:Byzantine fault tolerance#The dilemma|Byzantine Generals Problem]]&quot;. However, almost any network will fail when the majority of the peers are trying to damage it, and many protocols may be rendered impotent by far fewer numbers.

=== Clustering ===
Computer science defines a '''[[w:Computer cluster|computer cluster]]''' in general terms as a group of tightly coupled [[computer]]s that work together closely so that in many respects they can be viewed as though they are a single computer.

The components of a cluster are commonly, connected to each other through fast networks and usually deployed to improve performance and/or availability over that provided by a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability.

As we have seen before, this concept if applied to distributed networks or WANs (in place of LANs), generates distributed computations, grids and other systems. All of those applications are part of the P2P concept.

We loosely define clusters as a physical, social or even economical/statistical event.  That is is defined by the aggregation of entities due to sharing a property in common, that property may be a shared purpose or a characteristic, or any other communality.

As we look at the topologies generated by P2P networks we can observe that most protocols generate some kind  of clustering around networks structures, resources and they can even emerge as a result of the status of network      conditions. Clustering is then an unsupervised learning problem, an automatic emerging event that results on the   
creation of ad hoc collection of unlabeled objects (data/items or events). For more information on clusters you may check ''A Tutorial on Clustering Algorithms'' ( http://home.dei.polimi.it//matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/ ).

A cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are “similar” between them and are “dissimilar” to the objects belonging to other clusters using the same set of characteristics.

This concept is very important on not only the form of P2P networks but has also implications on the social structure/relations that can be build upon the use of P2P applications.

==== Flashcrowds ====
Flashcrowd is a behavioral model in that participants will tend to aggregate/crowd around an event, in P2P terms this can be a scarce resource, for instance as we will see later BitTorrent promotes big files over small ones and new over old, this is a result of a connection to the network based on single items, the speeds on BitTorrent does depend uppermost on generating flashcrowds around files (more peers, more speed that will snow ball in more seeders).

This can also result in a DoS (Denial of Service) or flood. For instance, if a P2P system is poorly designed, attempting to connect a significant number of peers to the network may disturb the bootstrap method used. 

You should educate users, more connections doesn't equate to more speed, at most it will result in more responses to queries but that may depend on how the protocol is structured, but enabling them will cost bandwidth. On the other side more peers will result on more resources to be shared that will also result in overlapping of shares and so better speeds, as a P2P network gets bigger the better it can provide for its users.

==== Optimizations ====
There are simple optimizations that should be done in any P2P Protocol that could bring a benefit to both peers and the network in general. These are based on system metrics or profile like IP (ISP or range), content, physical location, share history, ratios, searches and many other variables.

Most of the logic/characteristics of P2P networks and topologies (in a WAN environment) will result in aggregation of peers and so this clusters will share the same properties of Distributed Behavioral Models, like Flocks, Herds and Schools this results in an easier to study environment and to establish correlation about the peers relations and  extrapolate ways to improve efficiency. 

*Alignment
:To get information/characteristics from the local system/environment in order to optimize the peer &quot;location&quot; on the network by selecting and optimize the separation and cohesion functions to improve the local neighborhood. 
*Separation
:To implement a way to avoid crowding with other peers based on unwanted alignment. 
*Cohesion
:To select peers based on their own alignment.

== P2P Networks Traffic ==
[[Image:Dhaka traffic.jpg|134px||right]]
The P2P traffic detected on the Internet due to the nature of the protocols and topology used some times can only be done by estimation based on the perceived use (users on-line, number of downloads of a given implementation) or by doing point checks on the networks itself. It is even possible to access the information if the implementation on the protocol or application was done with this objective in mind, several implementations of Gnutella a for example have that option and Bearshare did even reports some of the users system parameters, like type of firewall etc...

Examples of services that provide such traffic information over P2P networks are for instance 
Cachelogic ( http://www.cachelogic.com/research/2005_slide16.php# ).

;Communication
One of your most important considerations is how you project the way peers will communicate, even if we discard the use of central servers like SuperNodes and multiple distributed clients as Peer/Nodes there will be several questions to consider:

*Will communication need to go across firewalls and proxy servers?
*Is the network transmission speed important? Can it be configured  by the user?
*Will communications be synchronous or asynchronous? 
*Will it need/use only a single port? what port should we use?
*What resources will you need to support? Is there size limits? Should compression be used ?
*Will the data have to be encrypted?
*etc...

One must carefully consider your project's specific goals and requirements, this will help you evaluate the use of toolkits and frameworks. Try not to reinvent the wheel if you can't came up with a better solution or have the time,capacity or disposition to.  You can also use open standards (ie: use the HTTP protocol) to, but are also free to explore other approaches.

Today even small LANs will have at least a firewall and probably a router even if all components are under the user's control, some user will just lack the knowledge on how to set them properly. Another consideration is on the simple configuration requirements of the application, most users will have problems dealing with technical terms and dependencies, even new versions of the Windows OS will have a default enabled firewall, those may prove to be a unsurmountable barrier for users, thankfully there are some tools available to make life easier for all.

=== UPnP ===
[[Image:Firwall.png|400px||right|||Internet Firewall and LAN with port forwarding.]]
The [[w:Universal Plug and Play|Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)]] architecture consists in a set of open standards and technologies promulgated by the [[w:UPnP Forum|UPnP Forum]] ( http://www.upnp.org/ ), with the goal of extending the Plug and Play concept to support networks and peer-to-peer discovery (automatic discovered over the network. wired or wireless), configuration and control and so enable that appliances, PCs, and services be able to connect transparently. Permitting any UPnP device to dynamically join a network, obtain its IP address and synchronize capabilities (learn from and inform other devices). It can also be seen in general terms as similar to a distributed [[w:Simple Network Management Protocol|Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)]].

As UPnP is offered in most modern routers, network devices and it is also supported by Microsoft since Windows XP. While  supposedly aimed to address the problem for network programs users in accepting incoming connection from the Internet (&quot;port forwarding&quot; or &quot;NAT traversal&quot;), as it would remove the necessary step in configuring router to accept incoming connections and then route them to the LAN's local machine behind the router, something that is hard to explain and for the common user to understand.

All this makes it a necessity that a Windows P2P application should support this architecture programmatically so to avoid the requirements that users deal with the necessary changes when UPnP is enabled (by default is should be disable due to security risks). With the added necessity that if there is a firewall on the local machine that doesn't conform to UPnP, it must have its configuration changed so to enable the necessary TCP (port 2859) and UDP (port 1900) communications for UPnP.

Microsoft provides the UPnP Control Point API. It is available in Windows Me, CE .Net, XP and later in the system services “SSDP Discovery Service” (ssdpsrv) and “Universal Plug and Play Device Host” (upnphost) or by COM libraries. It can be used in C++ or Visual Basic applications or in scripts embedded in HTML pages.

=== Security Considerations ===
By using a P2P system users will broadcast their existence to others, this in contrast to a centralized service were they may interact with others but their anonymity can be protected.

Violating the security of a network can be a crime, for instance the [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-9997273-46.html 2008 case of the research project from University of Colorado and University of Washington], the researchers engaged in the motorization of users across the Tor anonymous proxy network and could have faced legal risks for the snooping. 

This vulnerability of distributed communications can result in identity attacks (e.g. tracking down the users of the network and harassing or legally attacking them), DoS, Spamming, eavedropping and other threats or abuses.  All this actions are generally targeted to a single user and some may even be automated, there are several actions the creator can take to make it more difficult but ultimately they can't be stopped and should be expected and dealt with, one of the first steps is to provide information to the user so they can locally implement hardware or software actions and even a social behavior to counteract this abuse.

==== DoS (denial of service), Spamming ====
Since each user is a &quot;server&quot; they are also prone to [[w:Denial-of-service attack|denial of service]] attacks (attacks that may, if optimized, make the network run very slowly or break completely), the result may depend on the attacker resources and how the decentralized is the P2P protocol on the other hand to be the target of [[w:spamming|spamm]] (e.g. sending unsolicited information across the network- not necessarily as a denial of service attack) does only depend how visible and contactable you are, if for instance other users can send messages to you. Most P2P applications support some kind of chat system and this type of abuse is very hold on such system, they can address the problem but will complete solve it, what can lead to social engineering attacks were users can be lead to perform actions that will compromise them or their system, on this last point only giving information to users that enables them to be aware of the risk will work.

==== ARP Attack ====
{{TODO|Complete this section}}

==== Eavesdropping ====

=== Hardware traffic control ===

{{TODO| ISPs and Net Neutrality, filtering (network operators may attempt to prevent peer-to-peer network data from being carried)}}

=== Software traffic control ===
Since most Network applications and in specific P2P tools are prone to be a source of security problems (they will bypass some of the default security measures from inside), when using or creating such a tool one must take care on granting the possibility or configuring the system to be as safe as possible.

==== Tools for security ====
There are several tools and options that can be used for this effect, be it configuring a firewall, adding a IP blocker or making sure some restrictions are turned on by default as you deploy your application.

*PeerGuardian 2 ( http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/ ) a OpenSource tool produced by Phoenix Labs’, consisting in a IP blocker for Windows OS that supports multiple lists, list editing, automatic updates, and blocking all of IPv4 (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc)
*PeerGuardian Lite ( http://phoenixlabs.org/pglite/ ) a version of the PeerGuardian 2 that is aimed at having a low system footprint.

===== Blocklists =====
Blocklists are text files containing the IP addresses of organizations opposed and actively working against file-sharing (such as the RIAA), any enterprise that mines the networks or attempts to use resources without participating in the actual sharing of files. It is basically a spam filter like the ones that exist for eMail systems.

{{TODO| Add examples and resources}}

=== Firewalls ===
As computers attempt to be more secure for the user, todays OS will provide by default some form of external communication restriction that will permit the user to define different levels of trust, this is  called a [[w:Firewall (networking)|Firewall]]. A Firewall may have [[w:hardware|hardware]] or [[w:software|software]] implementation and is configured to permit, deny, or [[w:Proxy server|proxy]] [[w:data|data]] through a [[w:computer network|computer network]]. Most recent OSs will come with a software implementation running, since a connection to the Internet are becoming common and the lack or even the default configuration of the Firewall can cause some difficulties to the use of P2P applications.

{{TODO|Complete}}

==== on Windows ====
Microsoft in the last OS releases has taken the option for the security of user but without his intervention to include and enabling by default a simple firewall solution since Windows XP SP2. This  blocks any incoming (HTTP over port 80 or mail over ports 110 or 25), the classification of &quot;unsolicited messages&quot; is a bit over empathized since the messages can well be part of a P2P (or any other type of distributed) network. This can also have implications on blocking UPnP capabilities on the local machine.

===== NAT Traversal =====
Users behind NAT should be able to connect with each other, there are some solutions available that try to enable it.

====== STUN ======
''STUN'' (''Simple Traversal of UDP over NATs'') is a [[w:network protocol|network protocol]] which helps many types of software and hardware receive [[w:User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] data properly through home broadband [[w:router|router]]s that use ''NAT'' ).

Quoted from its standard document, [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3489.html RFC 3489]:

:''&quot;Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs) (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that allows applications to discover the presence and types of NATs and [[w:firewall (networking)|firewalls]] between them and the public [[w:Internet|Internet]].'' 

:It also provides the ability for applications to determine the public [[w:IP address|IP address]] allocated to them by the ''NAT''. 

:''&quot;STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them. As a result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT infrastructure.&quot;''

As ''STUN'' RFC states this protocol is not a cure-all for the problems associated with ''NAT'' but it is particularly helpful for getting voice over IP working through home routers. [[w:VoIP|VoIP]] signaling protocols like [[w:SIP|SIP]] use UDP packets for the transfer of sound data over the Internet, but these UDP packets often have trouble getting through ''NATs'' in home routers. 

''STUN'' is a [[w:client-server|client-server]] protocol. A VoIP phone or software package may include a ''STUN'' client, which will send a request to a STUN server. The server then reports back to the STUN client what the public IP address of the ''NAT'' router is, and what port was opened by the ''NAT'' to allow incoming traffic back in to the network. 

The response also allows the ''STUN'' client to determine what type of ''NAT'' is in use, as different types of ''NATs'' handle incoming UDP packets differently. It will work with three of four main types: [[w:full cone NAT|full cone NAT]], [[w:restricted cone NAT|restricted cone NAT]], and [[w:port restricted cone NAT|port restricted cone NAT]]. It will not work with [[w:symmetric NAT|symmetric NAT]] (also known as bi-directional ''NAT'') which is often found in the networks of large companies.

[[Image:STUN Algorithm3.svg|800px||center|||Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs)) algorithm.]]

==== Port Forwarding ====
If a peer is behind a router or firewall (using NAT) it may be necessary to configure it by hand, as to allow the P2P programs to function properly, this can be a daunting task for those technically challenged and can even have an impact in the adoption of the P2P application. This can be resolved automatically using some solutions like UPnP. 

[[Image:Ssh-port-forwarding.png|thumb|left|450px|Example of port forwarding across a remote secure shell server.]]
[[w:Port forwarding|Port forwarding]] or port mapping, as it is sometimes referred, is the act of forwarding a network port from one network node to another, virtually creating a path across the network, in the case at hand, from the Internet side that is connected to the router or firewall to a computer inside the LAN permuting an external user to reach a port on a private IP address (inside a LAN) from the outside. Otherwise the computer inside the LAN couldn't be accessible and P2P wouldn't be able to fully work (it could contact outside machines but it wouldn't be fully visible from the outside).
{{clear}}
Due to the great variety of different implementations of GUIs that ultimately permits the same functionality, making the needed changes isn't a trivial process and one solution will not fit all instances. 

The first fact that one should be aware of is that routers or the computer that is connected to the Internet will have a distinct IP addresses, one is provided by your ISP and is visible from the Internet the other will be visible only inside the LAN, this one can be assigned by the user or will default to a factory or Operative System factory setting.

To perform any changes to the configuration of the router you will need to know the IP that you can access its configuration page and login into it, if using a computer this same task can be done locally or remotely if the software allows it. Some minimum knowledge on how IPs and ports, even protocols (some configurations permit to distinguish between TCP and UDP packets) are used is required from the user to perform those tasks, as such this can become complicated to the normal user.

== Unique ID ==
Numbers control your life. Over time anyone identified by multitude of numbers. Like a phone number, your credit card numbers, the driver's license number, the social security number, even zip codes or your car license plate. They way this unique numbers are created, attributed and verified is fascinating. The Unique ID site (http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/) by Alan De Smet provides information on the general subject. To our particular subject what is relevant is the algorithms behind it all. How to establish a unique identifiers for users and resources. 

=== Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) / Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) ===

For a P2P protocol/application to be able to manage user identification, authentication, build a routing protocol, identify resources etc... there is a need for (a set of) Unique Identifiers. While a true peer to peer protocol doesn't intend to establish a centralized service, it can frequently make use of an already established such service. So for instance, Usenet makes use of domain names to create globally unique identifier for articles. If the protocol refrains from even make use of such a service then uniqueness can only be based on random numbers and mathematical probabilities.

The problem of generating unique IDs can be broken down as uniqueness over space and uniqueness over time which, when combined, aim to produce a globally unique sequence. This leads to a problem detected over some P2P networks using Open Protocols/Multiple ''vendors'' implementations, due to the use of different algorithms on the generation of the '''GUIDs''' the uniqueness over space is broken leading to sporadic collisions. 

UUIDs are officially and specifically defined as part of the ISO-11578 standard  other specifications also exist, like [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt RFC 4122], [http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html ITU-T Rec. X.667].  

''Examples of uses''

#Usenet article IDs.
#In Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) morass, an object oriented programming model that incorporates MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), OLE (Object Linking Embedding), ActiveX, ActiveMovie and everything else Microsoft is hawking lately, a GUID is a 16 byte or 128 bit number used to uniquely identify objects, data formats, everything.
#The identifiers in the windows registry.
#The identifiers used in used in RPC (remote procedure calls).
#Within ActiveMovie, there are GUID's for video formats, corresponding to the FOURCC's or Four Character Codes used in Video for Windows. These are specified in the file uuids.h in the Active Movie Software Developer Kit (SDK). ActiveMovie needs to pass around GUID's that correspond to the FOURCC for the video in an AVI file.

'''Security'''
There is a know fragility on UUIDs of version 1 (time and node based), as they broadcast the node's ID.

==== Software implementation ====
Programmers needing to implement UUID could take a look on these examples:

*OSSP uuid ( http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/ ) is an API for ISO C, ISO C++, Perl and PHP and a corresponding CLI for the generation of DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996, and RFC4122 compliant Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node based), version 3 (name based, MD5), version 4 (random number based), and version 5 (name based, SHA-1). UUIDs are 128-bit numbers that are intended to have a high likelihood of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult to guess. They are globally unique identifiers that can be locally generated without contacting a global registration authority. It is Open Sourced under the MIT/X Consortium License.

== Hashes, Cryptography and Compression ==
Most P2P systems have to implement at least one algorithms for Hashing, D/Encryption and De/Compression, this section will try to provide some ideas of this actions in relation to the P2P subject as we will address this issues later in other sections.

Detailed information on the subject can be found on the [[Cryptography]] Wikibook ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cryptography ). 

One way of creating structured P2P networks is by maintaining a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), that will server as a distributed index of the resources on the network.

Another need for cryptography is in the protection of the integrity of the distributed resources themselves, to make them able to survive an attack most implementations of P2P some kind of Hash function (MD5, SHA1) and may even implement a Hash tree designed to detect corruption of the resource content as a hole or of the parts a user gets (for instance using Tiger Tree Hash).

=== Hash function ===
A '''[[w:Hash function|hash function]]''' is a reproducible method of turning some kind of [[w:data|data]] into a (relatively) small number that may serve as a digital &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the data. The [[w:algorithm|algorithm]] substitutes or transposes the data to create such fingerprints. The fingerprints are called '''hash sums''', '''hash values''', '''hash codes''' or simply '''hashes'''. When you referring to hash or hashes some attention must be given since it can also mean the hash functions.

A group of hashes (the result of applying an hash function to data) will sometimes be referred as a [[w:Bucket (computing)|bucked]] or more properly a hash bucket. Most hash buckets if generated by a non colliding hash function will generate distinct hashes for a give data input, there are other characteristics that should be considered when selecting an hash function but it goes beyond the scope of this book, just remember to check if the hash function/algorithm you are implementing satisfies your requirements. Wikibooks has several books that covers hashes in some way, you can check more about the subject in [[Algorithm implementation/Hashing|Algorithm implementation]] or [[Cryptography/Hashes|Cryptography]] 

[[Image:Hash_function.svg|280px|center|A typical hash function at work]]

Hash sums are commonly used as indices into [[w:hash table|hash table]]s or [[w:hash file|hash file]]s.  [[w:Cryptographic hash function|Cryptographic hash function]]s are used for various purposes in [[w:information security|information security]] applications.

;Choosing a good hash function
A good hash function is essential for good hash table performance. A poor choice of a hash function is likely to lead to clustering, in which probability of keys mapping to the same hash bucket (i.e. a collision) is significantly greater than would be expected from a random function. A nonzero collision probability is inevitable in any hash implementation, but usually the number of operations required to resolve a collision scales linearly with the number of keys mapping to the same bucket, so excess collisions will degrade performance significantly. In addition, some hash functions are computationally expensive, so the amount of time (and, in some cases, memory) taken to compute the hash may be burdensome.

One of the first hash algorithms used to verify the integrity of files in p2p systems (and in file transfers in general) was the [[Cryptography/MD5|MD5]] created in 1992 (see [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321 rfc1321] '''The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm'''). But as all hash most algorithms after some time some weaknesses where found, this sequence was repeated with the SHA1 algorithm and there is a high probability that others will fallow. Selecting the right tool for the job isn't enough, the programmer must continuously examine how the security of his choice is holding on in regards to the requirements placed on the selected hash algorithm.

Simplicity and speed are readily measured objectively (by number of lines of code and CPU benchmarks, for example), but strength is a more slippery concept. Obviously, a [[w:cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash function]] such as [[w:SHA hash functions|SHA-1]] (see [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm Secure Hash Standard FIPS 180-1]) would satisfy the relatively lax strength requirements needed for hash tables, but their slowness and complexity makes them unappealing. However, using cryptographic hash functions can protect against collision attacks when the hash table modulus and its factors can be kept secret from the attacker, or alternatively, by applying a secret [[w:salt (cryptography)|salt]]. However, for these specialized cases, a [[w:universal hash function|universal hash function]] can be used instead of one static hash.

In the absence of a standard measure for hash function strength, the current state of the art is to employ a battery of [[w:Statistics|statistical]] tests to measure whether the hash function can be readily distinguished from a random function. Arguably the most important test is to determine whether the hash function displays the [[w:avalanche effect|avalanche effect]], which essentially states that any single-bit change in the input key should affect on average half the bits in the output. Bret Mulvey advocates testing the ''strict avalanche condition'' in particular, which states that, for any single-bit change, each of the output bits should change with probability one-half, independent of the other bits in the key. Purely additive hash functions such as [[w:Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] fail this stronger condition miserably.

{{NOTE|CRC is often used to denote either the function or the function's output. A CRC can be used in the same way as a
[[w:checksum|checksum]] to detect accidental alteration of data during transmission or storage. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary [[w:Computer hardware|hardware]], are easy to analyze mathematically, and are particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels. Historically CRCs have been given an ample used as an error detection/correction in telecommunications.}}

==== Collision avoidance ====

{{TODO|Complete}}

==== Implementing a Hash algorithm ====
Most [[Algorithm Implementation/Hashing|hash algorithms]] have an high degree of complexity and are designed for a specific target (hashing function) that may not apply, with the same level of guarantees, in other tasks. These algorithms (or raw descriptions of tem) are freely accessible, you can implement your own version or select to use an already existing and tested implementation (with a note for security concerns). Some examples of publicly available implementations are available at the [[Cryptography/Open Source Cryptography|Cryptography]] Wikibook.

{{NOTE|Keep in mind that some Hash functions may be subject to export restrictions.}}

There is a need for consistent results and repeatability, as you select and implement your hash algorithm, remember to run it over a batch of test vectors. If you are using a [[w:List of unit testing frameworks|test framework]] this should be added to your tests.

==== Hash tree (Merkle trees) ====
In [[w:cryptography|cryptography]], '''hash trees''' (also known as '''Merkle trees'', invented in 1979 by [[w:Ralph Merkle|Ralph Merkle]]) are an extension of the simpler concept of [[w:hash list|hash list]], which in turn is an extension of the old concept of [[w:hash function|hash]]ing. It is a hash construct that exhibits desirable properties for verifying the integrity of files and file subranges in an incremental or out-of-order fashion.

Hash trees where the underlying hash function is [[w:Tiger (hash)|Tiger]] ( http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/ ) are often called '''Tiger trees''' or '''Tiger tree hashes'''.

The main use of hash trees is to make sure that data blocks received from other peers in a [[w:Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer network]] are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not send adulterated blocks of data. This will optimize the use of the Network and permit to quickly exclude adulterated content in place of waiting for the download of the hole file to complete to check with a single hash, an partial or complete hash tree can be downloaded and the integrity of each branch can be checked immediately (since they consist in &quot;hashed&quot; blocks or  leaves of the Hash tree), even though the whole tree/content is not available yet, making also possible for the downloading peer to upload blocks of an unfinished files. 

Usually, a [[w:cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash function]] such as [[w:SHA hash functions|SHA-1]], [[w:Whirlpool (hash)|Whirlpool]], or [[w:Tiger (hash)|Tiger]] is used for the hashing. If the hash tree only needs to protect against unintentional damage, the much less secure [[w:checksum|checksum]]s such as [[w:Cyclic redundancy check|CRCs]] can be used.

In the top of a hash tree there is a ''top hash'' (or ''root hash'' or ''master hash''). Before downloading a file on a P2P network, in most cases the top hash is acquired from a trusted source (a Peer or a central server that has elevated trust ratio). When the top hash is available, the hash tree can then be received from any source. The received hash tree is then checked against the trusted top hash, and if the hash tree is damaged or corrupted, another hash tree from another source will be tried until the program finds one that matches the top hash.

This requires several considerations:
#What is a trusted source for the root hash.
#A consistent implementation of the hashing algorithm (for example the size of the blocks to be transfered must be known  and constant on every file transfer).

===== Tiger Tree Hash (TTH) =====
The Tiger tree hash is one of most useful form of hash tree on P2P Networks. Based on the cryptographic hash 
[[w:Tiger (cryptography)|Tiger]] created in 1995 by Eli Biham and Ross Anderson (see http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/ for the creator's info and C source example). The hash algorithm was designed with modern CPU in mind, in particular when dealing with working in 64-bit, it is one of the fastest and secure hashes on 32-bit machines.

The TTH uses a form of binary hash tree, usually has a data block size of 1024-[[w:byte|byte]]s and uses the cryptographically secure [[w:Tiger (hash)|Tiger hash]].

Tiger hash is used because it's fast (and the tree requires the computations of a lot of hashes), with recent implementations and architectures, TTH is as fast as SHA1, with more optimization and the use of 64-bit processors, it will become faster, even though it generates larger hash values (192 bits vs. 160 for SHA1).

Tiger tree hashes are used in the [[w:Gnutella|Gnutella]], [[w:Gnutella2|Gnutella2]], and [[w:Direct Connect (file sharing)|Direct Connect]] and many other [[w:Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file sharing protocols and in [[w:file sharing|file sharing]] in general.

A step by step introduction to the uses of the TTH was available as part of the Tree Hash Exchange (THEX) format ( [http://web.archive.org/web/20060409093503/www.open-content.net/specs/draft-jchapweske-thex-02.html see  page at the WEB Archive] ).

==== Hash table ====
In [[w:computer science|computer science]], a '''[[w:Hash table|hash table]]''', or a '''hash map''', is a [[w:data structure|data structure]] that associates ''keys'' with ''values''. The primary operation it supports efficiently is a ''lookup'': given a key, find the corresponding value. It works by transforming the key using a [[w:hash function|hash function]] into a ''hash'', a number that is used to index into an array to locate the desired location (&quot;bucket&quot;) where the values should be.

[[Image:HASHTB08.svg|320px|right|A small phone book as a hash table.]]&lt;br&gt;

Hash tables support the efficient addition of new entries, and the time spent searching for the required data is independent of the number of items stored (i.e. [[w:Big-O notation|O(1)]].)

In P2P system Hash tables are used locally on every client/server application to perform the routing of data or the local indexing of files, this concept is taken further as we try to use the same system in a distributed way, in that case distributed hash tables are used to solve the problem.

===== Distributed Hash Table (DHT) =====
The [[w:Distributed hash table|Distributed hash tables (DHTs)]] concept was made public in 2001 but very few did publicly-release robust implementations.

====== Protocols ======
*'''[[w:Content addressable network|Content addressable network (CAN)]]'''
*'''[[w:Chord (DHT)|Chord]]''' ( http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/chord/ ) - aims to build scalable, robust distributed systems using peer-to-peer ideas. It is completely decentralized and symmetric, and can find data using only log(N) messages, where N is the number of nodes in the system. Chord's lookup mechanism is provably robust in the face of frequent node failures and re-joins. A single research implementation is available in C but there are other implementations in C++, Java and Python. 
*Tulip
*'''[[w:Tapestry (DHT)|Tapestry]]'''
*'''[[w:Pastry (DHT)|Pastry]]'''
**'''Bamboo''' (http://bamboo-dht.org/) - based on Pastry, a re-engineering of the Pastry protocols written in Java and licensed under the BSD license.

{{TODO|Tulip seems to have a C++ implementation couldn't find info about it...}}

=== Encryption ===
A part of the security of any P2P Network, encryption is needed to make make sure only the &quot;allowed&quot; parties have access to sensitive data. Examples are the encryption of the data on a server/client setup (even on P2P) were clients could share data without fear of it being accessed on the server (a mix of this is if the Network would in itself enable a distributed cache mechanism for transfers, server-less), encryption of transfers, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, or monitor of data (see [[w:FreeNet|FreeNet]]) and many other applications with the intent of protecting the privacy and enable an extended level of security to Networks.

There are several algorithm that can be used to implement encryption most used by P2P project include: [[w:Blowfish (cipher)|BlowFish]].

{{TODO|Complete}}

== Resources (Content, other) ==
P2P applications can be used to share any type of digital assets in the form of packed information that can be uniquely identified. P2P applications are well know for sharing files, this raises several issues and possibilities.

=== Metadata ===
[[w:Metadata|Metadata]] (meta-data, or sometimes meta-information) is &quot;data about data&quot;. An item of metadata may describe an individual [[w:datum|datum]], or content item, or a collection of data including multiple content items and hierarchical levels, for example a database schema.

[[w:Data|Data]] is the lowest level of abstraction for knowledge, information is the next, and finally, we have knowledge highest level among all three. Metadata consists on direct and indirect data that help define the knowledge about the target item.

The hierarchy of metadata descriptions can go on forever, but usually context or semantic understanding makes extensively detailed explanations unnecessary.

The role played by any particular [[w:datum|datum]] depends on the context. For example, when considering the geography of London, &quot;E83BJ&quot; would be a datum and &quot;Post Code&quot; would be metadatum. But, when considering the data management of an automated system that manages geographical data, &quot;Post Code&quot; might be a datum and then &quot;data item name&quot; and &quot;5 characters, starting with A – Z&quot; would be metadata.

In any particular context, metadata characterizes the data it describes, not the entity described by that data. So, in relation to &quot;E83BJ&quot;, the datum &quot;is in London&quot; is a further description of the place in the real world which has the post code &quot;E83BJ&quot;, not of the code itself. Therefore, although it is providing information connected to &quot;E83BJ&quot; (telling us that this is the post code of a place in London), this would not normally be considered metadata, as it is describing &quot;E83BJ&quot; ''qua'' place in the real world and not ''qua'' data.

;Difference between data and metadata

Usually it is not possible to distinguish between (plain) data and metadata because:

*Something can be data and metadata at the same time. The headline of an article is both its title (metadata) and part of its text (data).
* Data and metadata can change their roles. A poem, as such, would be regarded as data, but if there were a song that used it as lyrics, the whole poem could be attached to an audio file of the song as metadata. Thus, the labeling depends on the point of view.

These considerations apply no matter which of the above definitions is considered, except where explicit markup is used to denote what is data and what is metadata.

;Hierarchies of metadata

When structured into a hierarchical arrangement, metadata is more properly called an [[w:Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] or [[w:schema|schema]]. Both terms describe &quot;what exists&quot; for some purpose or to enable some action. For instance, the arrangement of subject headings in a library catalog serves not only as a guide to finding books on a particular subject in the stacks, but also as a guide to what subjects &quot;exist&quot; in the library's own ontology and how more specialized topics are related to or derived from the more general subject headings.

Metadata is frequently stored in a central location and used to help organizations standardize their data. This information is typically stored in a [[w:metadata registry|Metadata registry]].

;Schema examples

A good example on work being done on Metadata and how to make it accessible and useful can be examined in the [[w:World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]'s old page Metadata Activity Statement (http://www.w3.org/Metadata/Activity.html) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF), that by the use of a declarative language, provides a standard way for using XML to represent metadata in the form of statements about properties and relationships of items on the Web. The RDF has it's own and more up to data page at http://www.w3.org/RDF/.

==== Metadata registries ====

;Free Services
* '''[[w:MusicBrainz|MusicBrainz]]''' ( http://musicbrainz.org/ ) is a community music metadatabase (nonprofit service) that attempts to create a comprehensive music information site. You can use the MusicBrainz data either by browsing this web site, or you can access the data from a client program — for example, a CD player program can use MusicBrainz to identify CDs and provide information about the CD, about the artist or about related information. MusicBrainz is also supporting MusicIP's Open FingerprintTM Architecture, which identifies the sounds in an audio file, regardless of variations in the digital-file details. The community provides a REST styled XML based Web Service.

=== Database &amp; Index ===

{{TODO|...type... ...location... ...route... ...tracking... ...scalable... ...flexible...}}

=== Files ===
Users of a P2P application may select files as the resource to be shared across the network. The simplest and secure method is to just share the content of files in a immutable way, most P2P applications cover this need, in any case other simultaneous models can be build around the file resource and the number of possible state of those files, being the most complex the implementation of a distributed filesystem.

==== Sharing Files ====
Sharing Files on a P2P network consists in managing (indexing, enable searches and transfer) two distinct resources, the local files and the remote files.

===== Local Files =====
If the a P2P application has support for file sharing. The most common method for sharing of files is to enable the user to select one or more directories of the local file system volumes. This includes providing, in the application preferences, the capability to select the path(s) to the files to be shared and to where to put the downloaded files.

It is also common practice to automatically add the download directory to the list of shared paths, or the downloaded files, so that the peer will immediately contribute to the replication of the downloaded resources. 

{{NOTE|It should be a concern to the implementor to stress to the user the importance about security and legal matters regarding the [[w:File sharing|sharing of files on the network]].}}

====== Monitor for Changes ======
After having the resources determined by the user, it is up to the application to as it is running verify any deletion, renaming or write action in general to any of the shared files since this could constitute a change to the file status (content change) or any addition of files, or alterations to the shared resources in general. This would could invalidate previously generated hashes or indexes. This problem can be addressed by generating an hash for the file content and use the OS control over the file-system to monitor changes as they happen (for instance on Windows one could use the Win32 API ReadDirectoryChangesW).

Depending on the requirements of the implementation, it may be beneficial to use multiple content hashes, a stronger to be used across the network and s faster and lower quality just to monitor local changes.

;Detected shared files and changes to them
Since the application is not expected to be running all the time, and able to consistently monitor any changes done to the resources one must take steps to maintain further integrity. Because if the application is closed it will have no way to continue to monitor for changes and it will be up to the OS to permit some kind of API to detect file changes, like the last write access timestamp. So the steps needed to guarantee integrity each time the application is run is:

# Verify that the resources (know files and shared paths) remain valid (they still exist and are unaltered).
# Update the local index to reflect what was found in the above step (remove any invalid directories or volumes from the shared list). One can even prompt the user for corrective actions, as some my be removable media (DVDs etc...)
# Start monitoring new changes. 
# Check all the resources content for changes since the last time the application exited, this may mean that each file must be checked individually for the last write date (most modern OS permit this). Depending on how it is implemented the next to steps can be included so to reduce duplication of work.
# Verify that all previous indexed files are still present.
# Verify for the existence of new files.

;Local paths of significance
There are at least two paths with an higher degree of usefulness for the P2P application. The path were the application resides, since it can be needed for updating or for any required security checks and even possibly to serve as the base to locate the application preferences (if not using another setup, like the system registry on the Windows OS) and/or the download directory, a write enabled directory, where all downloads will be put.

{{NOTE|The download directory should be monitored for the available free space, and if the content is automatically shared it should be a security concern as it will be prime vector for attacks, more than any other shared paths were a usurpation from an external source could not only make unwanted content available to the outside but enable external entities to upload into the local machine dangerous content.}}

===== External Files =====
This are the files that aren't directly under the local user control.

{{TODO|to extend...}}

====== File Filtering ======
Most P2P application do not enable selecting single files for sharing but do it in bulk by enabling the selection of specific directories, there is a need to provide a mechanism to exclude specific files from being shared, by the will of the user, the specific of the network or even to reduce the pollution or the filesharing system  burden in handling unwanted files. Be it by size, extension or even the intrinsic content of the file having the ability to weed them out is useful.

=== Indexing ===
Indexing, the task of indexing resources, like shared file, has the objective of enabling the application to know what resources are available to be shared on the network.

Indexing occurs each time the application is run, since the resources can only be monitored for changes while the application runs and when a change to the shared resources preferences is performed. This also makes it a necessary  to have during the application run-time a function that monitors changes to resources. 

Most P2P application also support the exclusion or filtering of shared resources, for instance if a directory is selected to be shared but some of the content needs to be excluded.

=== Leechers ===
In Nature, cooperation is widespread but so too are leechers (cheats, mutants). In evolutionary terms, cheats should indeed prosper, since they don´t contribute to the collective good but simply reap the benefits of others’ cooperative efforts, but they don't. Both compete for the same goal using different strategies, cooperation is the path of less cost to all (even for leechers on the long run), cooperation provides stability and previsibility and on the other hand if cheats are not kept in some sort of equilibrium they generate a degradation of the system that can lead to its global failure.

In computer science and especially on the Internet, being a leech or leecher refers to the practice of benefiting, usually deliberately, from others' information or effort but not offering anything in return, or only token offerings in an attempt to avoid being called a leech. They are universally derided.

The name derives from the leech, an animal which sucks blood and then tries to leave unnoticed. Other terms are used, such as freeloader, but leech is the most common.

Examples

* On peer to peer networks, a leecher shares nothing (or very little of little worth) for upload. Many applications have options for dealing with leeches, such as uploading at reduced rates to those who share nothing, or simply not allowing uploads to them at all. Some file-sharing forums have an anti-leech policy to protect the download content, where it will require users to expend more energy or patience than most leechers are willing to before they can access the &quot;download area&quot;.

* Most BitTorrent sites refer to leeches as clients who are downloading a file, but can't seed it because they don't have a complete copy of it. They are by default configured to allow a certain client to download more when they upload more.

* When on a shared network (Such as a school or office LAN), any deliberate overuse of bandwidth (To the point at which normal use of the network would be noticeably degraded) can be called leeching.

* In online computer games (especially role-playing games), leeching refers to the practice of a player joining a group for the explicit purpose of gaining rewards without contributing anything to the efforts necessary to acquire those rewards. Sometimes this is allowed in an effort to power-level a player. Usually it is considered poor behavior to do this without permission from the group. In first person shooters the term refers to a person who benefits by having his team mates carry him to a win.

* Direct linking is a form of bandwidth leeching that occurs when placing an unauthorized linked object, often an image, from one site in a web page belonging to a second site (the leech). This constitutes an unauthorized use of the host site's bandwidth and content.

In some cases, leeching is used synonymously with freeloading rather than being restricted to computer contexts.

==== Possible solutions ====

===== Trust &amp; Reputation =====
Due the volatility and modularity of peer to peer networks, peer trust (mentioned in the reference to building communities)  and user participation is one of the few motivations or lubricant for online transactions of services or resources that falls ultimately to the creator. Having an average good reputation in participants will also boost the trust on the network and the systems built upon it.

{{TODO|Complete}}

=== File sharing ===
[[Image:Weblogo Freightworx.png|80px||right|||Sharing.]]
Traditionally, file transfers involve two computers, often designated as a client and a server and most operations are for the copying files from one machine to another.

Most WEB and FTP servers are punished for being popular. Since all uploading is done from one central place, a popular site needs more resources (CPU and bandwidth) to be able to cope. With the use of P2P, the clients automatically mirror the files they download, easing the publisher's burden.

One limitation of most P2P protocols is that they don't provide a complex file-system emulation or a user-right system (permissions), so complex file operations like NFS or FTP protocols provide are very rare, this also has a reason to be, since the networks is decentralized a system for the authentication of users is hard to implement and most are easy to break.

Another concept about P2P transfers is the use of bandwidth, things will not be linear, transfers will depend on the availability of the resource, the load of the seeding peers, size of the network and the local user connection and load on its bandwidth.

As seen before, Downloading files with a restrictive copyright, license or under a given country law, may increase the risk of being sued. Some of the files available on these networks may be copyrighted or protected under the law. You must be aware that there is a risk involved.

==== Receiving ====
{{TODO|...authentication...  ...digital signature...}}

==== from multiple sources (segmented downloading, swarm) ====
'''Multiple source download''', (segmented download, swarming download), can be a more efficient way of [[w:downloading|downloading]] [[w:file|files]] from many peers at once.  The one single file is downloaded, in parallel, from several distinct sources or uploaders of the file.  This can help a group of users with [[w:asymmetric|asymmetric]] connections, such as [[w:ADSL|ADSL]] to provide a high total [[w:bandwidth|bandwidth]] to one downloader, and to handle peaks in download demand. All swarm transfers depends on at least the existence of one full complete copy of the wanted file (a possible evolution could include adding some sort of [[w:Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon (RS) Algorithm]] into the mix) and it is mostly useful for large files (size depending on the available bandwidth, since the trade off includes a higher cost in CPU and extraneous data transfers to make the system work. 

This technique can not magically solve the problem, in a group of users that has insufficient upload-bandwidth, with [[w:demand|demand]] higher than [[w:supply|supply]].  It can however very nicely handle peaks, and it can also to some degree let uploaders upload &quot;more often&quot; to better utilize their connection.  However, naive implementations can often result in file corruption, as there is no way of knowing if all sources are actually uploading segments of the same file.  This has led to most programs using segmented downloading using some sort of [[w:checksum|checksum]] or [[w:hash algorithm|hash algorithm]] to ensure file integrity.

==== Resuming ====

==== Preview while Downloading ====
Is may help to let users preview files before the downloading process finishes and as soon as possible, this will improve the quality of shares on the network increasing users confidence and reducing lost time and bandwidth.

==== Security ====
{{TODO|Complete}}

===== Poisioning and Pollution =====
Examples include:
* poisoning attacks (e.g. providing files whose contents are different from the description)
* polluting attacks (e.g. inserting &quot;bad&quot; chunks/packets into an otherwise valid file on the network)
* insertion of:
**viruses to carried data (e.g. downloaded or carried files may be infected with viruses or other malware)
**[[w:malware|malware]] in the peer-to-peer network software itself (e.g. distributed software may contain spyware)

===== Rights Protection =====
Protecting the copyrights over content shouldn't be imposed on the public, even if most copyrights policies today have removed the need to state that a work has reserved rights, there shouldn't be any expectation that the general public would have to go out of way to protect the benefits of a minority even more if they aren't clearly stated. It is expected that the works in the public domain will today outnumber works that have valid copyrights.

Given the actual situation, any p2p application will have the moral duty to inform users of the issues risen due to this very confusing situation. Some solutions to ease the problem and help copyright holders to protect their works have over time came forward but no interest seems to have been raised by those that should care about the issue. This section will try to show the possibilities available.

A simple solution to this issue would be to clearly put the responsibility of identifying work under copyright to the right owners, to implement this solution a database needs to be freely available to p2p applications so content can be declared as copyrighted or a standard must be created to clearly identify those works. In response to this problem several solution were discussed and proposed but in July 2003, a solution by the name of BluFilter was put forward by the Kokopelli Network Inc. (co-founded by Alex Sauriol), that would permit to identify the copyright status, by comparing the waveforms that are stored within the mp3 (see [http://web.archive.org/web/20041130222253/kokopellinetworks.com/ kokopellinetworks.com @  web.archive.org]), this approach seemed viable but no adoption of a similar technology seems to be openly used to inform users but rumors have appeared that similar approaches have been used as a base legal litigations.

=== Priority settings ===
Enabling the dynamic set of priorities on transfers will not only keep users happy but provide an easy way to boost transfers on highly sicked content increasing the speed of replication of the same on the network.

One can even go a step further and permit a by resource configuration, enabling the removal or configuration access rights to each resource, like on a file system or even enable a way to permit a market for free trading of data letting users set a specific ratio for that resource.

=== Bandwidth Scheduler ===
Managing local resources is important not only to the local user but to the global network.  Managing and enabling control of the application use of bandwidth will serve as incentive for users to improve how they manage that resource (what and how it is being used) and if taken in consideration by the application as a dynamic resource it can have positive effects on the global network by reducing wasting.

Many of the actual P2P applications enable users such control of their bandwidth, but not only P2P benefits from this strategy, today with a significant part of most computers connected to the Internet, managing this scarce resource is of top most importance.  One example is Microsoft's [[w:Background Intelligent Transfer Service|Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)]] aimed at enabling system updates or even the MS IM service to transfer data whenever there is bandwidth which is not being used by other applications, of note is also the ability to use the BITS technology since it is exposed through [[w:Component Object Model|Component Object Model]] (COM).</text>

'''Beautyberry''' ('''''Callicarpa''''') is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the family Verbenaceae; between 40-150 species are accepted by different botanists. They are native to east and southeast Asia (where the majority of the species occur), Australia, southeast North America and Central America.

==Description==
The temperate species are deciduous, the tropical species evergreen. The leaves are simple, opposite, and 5-25 cm long. The flowers are in clusters, white to pinkish. The fruit is a berry, 2-5 mm diameter and pink to red-purple with a highly distinctive metallic lustre, are very conspicuous in clusters on the bare branches after the leaves fall. The berries last well into the winter or dry season and are an important survival food for birds and other animals, though they will not eat them until other sources are depleted. The berries are highly astringent, and considered unfit for human use.

==Growing Conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
[[Image:Beautyberry.jpg|left|thumb|''Callicarpa americana'' (American Beautyberry)]]
'''American Beautyberry''' ''[[../Callicarpa americana/]]'' is native to the southeastern United States. It can typically reach 1-2 m in height.

'''Bodinier's Beautyberry''' ''[[../Callicarpa bodinieri/]]'', native to west-central China (Sichuan, Hubei, Shaanxi) is more cold-tolerant than  ''C. americana'', and is the species most widely cultivated in northern areas like the British Isles. It can reach 3 m tall.

'''Japanese Beautyberry''' ''[[../Callicarpa japonica/]]'', native to Japan, is also cultivated in gardens. It is called ''Murasakishikibu'' in Japanese, in honor of Murasaki Shikibu.

Other species include:
*''[[../Callicarpa cathayana/]]'' (China)
*''[[../Callicarpa dichotoma/]]'' (China, Japan)
*''[[../Callicarpa formosana/]]'' (Taiwan)
*''[[../Callicarpa kwangtungensis/]]'' (southern China)
*''[[../Callicarpa longifolia/]]'' (China)
*''[[../Callicarpa macrophylla/]]'' (India to Malaysia)
*''[[../Callicarpa mollis/]]'' (Japan, Korea)
*''[[../Callicarpa nudiflora/]]'' (southern China, southeast Asia; a small tree to 10 m tall)
*''[[../Callicarpa pedunculata/]]'' (northern Australia)
*''[[../Callicarpa rubella/]]'' (southeast Asia)
*''[[../Callicarpa shikokiana/]]'' (southern Japan)

==Uses==
'''American beautyberry''' (''Callicarpa americana'') has been found to be a natural insect repellant. Three chemicals have been isolated that appear to be the active ingredients; callicarpenal, intermedeol, and spathulenol. It has found to be repellant to the mosquitoes which carry yellow fever and malaria. The discovery and use of callicarpenal has been patented by the United States Department of Agriculture Agriculture Research Service.

==Maintenance==
Pollard in early spring to keep the shrub tidy.

The '''cranesbills''' or &quot;Hardy Geraniums&quot; make up the genus '''''Geranium''''' 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, but mostly in the eastern part of the Mediterranean. 

Confusingly, &quot;geranium&quot; is also the common name of members of the genus ''[[../Pelargonium/]]'', which were formerly classified in the cranesbill genus. In the United States, true Geraniums are frequently distinguished from the less hardy Pelargoniums as (rather redundantly) &quot;hardy geraniums&quot; by gardeners and in the horticultural trade. One can make the distinction between the two by looking at the flowers : ''Geranium'' has symmetrical flowers, while ''Pelargonium'' has irregular or maculate petals. Other former members of the genus are now classified in genus ''[[../Erodium/]]'', including the plants known as filarees in North America.

One species of ''Geranium'', ''Geranium viscosissimum'' is considered to be protocarnivorous.

==Description==
The name &quot;cranesbill&quot; derives from the appearance of the seed-heads, which have the same shape as the bill of a Crane. The genus name is derived from the Greek word ''geranos'', meaning 'crane'. The long, palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. Their rose, pink to blue or white flowers have 5 petals.

==Growing conditions==
Well drained soils, light requirements vary by species.

==Varieties==
[[w:List of cranesbill species]]

==Uses==
Most ''Geraniums'' are grown as ground covers, or as fillers in herbaceous and mixed borders.

==Maintenance==
Deadhead both to encourage rebloom and prevent self-seeding (many species can become quite weedy). 

==Propagation==
Propagation is by semi-ripe cuttings in summer, by seed or by division in autumn or spring.

==Pests and diseases==

'''''Buddleia''''', also often spelled ''Buddleja'', is a genus of flowering plants. It is now included in the Scrophulariaceae, though in the past was previously classified in either the Loganiaceae or in a family of its own, the Buddlejaceae. The plant was named after the Reverend Adam Buddle who was a botanist and a rector in Essex, England. The name has been the source of some confusion. By the usual practice of botanical Latin, the spelling of a genus name made from &quot;Buddle&quot; would be &quot;Buddleia&quot;. However, Linnaeus wrote it down as &quot;Buddleja&quot;, and never changed it, so by the rule of naming priority, &quot;Buddleja&quot; should be preferred, though the i/j interchange could be modernized as an orthographical variant. Even so, the usage is confused, and inconsistencies are common, even within single texts

The roughly 100 species are mostly shrubs, a few being trees; the largest species reach 30 m (100 ft) tall, but most species rarely exceed 5 m tall. Both evergreen and deciduous species occur. They are native throughout the warmer parts of the New World from the southern United States south to Chile, and widely in the Old World in Africa and the warmer parts of Asia, but absent as natives from Europe and Australasia. The species are divided into two groups based on their floral type, those in the New World being dioecious, and those in the Old World being monoecious.

==Description==
The leaves are lanceolate in most species, and arranged in opposite pairs on the stems (alternate in one species, ''B. alternifolia''); they range from 1-30 cm long. The flowers are produced in dense panicles 10-50 cm long; each individual flower is tubular, about 1 cm long, with the corolla divided into four spreading lobes (petals), about 3-4 mm across. Flower colour varies widely, with white, pink, red, purple, orange or yellow flowers produced by different species and cultivars; they are rich in nectar and often strongly scented. The fruit is a small capsule about 1 cm long and 1-2 mm diameter, containing numerous small seeds; in a few species (previously classified in the separate genus ''Nicodemia'') the capsule is soft and fleshy, forming a berry.

==Growing Conditions==
Well-drained soils in sun.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
[[image:Buddleiabutterflies.JPG|thumb|250px|left|''Buddleja davidii'' flowers with [[w:Painted Lady]], [[w:Peacock (butterfly)|Peacock]] and (underneath) [[w:Small Tortoiseshell]] butterflies]]
Several species are popular garden plants, The species are commonly known as '''Butterfly Bush''' due to their attractiveness to butterflies; they are also attractive to bees, and the species with red flowers, to hummingbirds.

The most popular cultivated species is ''Buddleja davidii''from central China, named after the French naturalist Père Armand David. Other common garden species include ''Buddleja globosa'' from southern Chile, grown for its strongly honey-scented orange globular flower-heads, and ''Buddleja alternifolia'' with lilac coloured flowers. Several interspecific hybrids can also be found, including ''B. x weyeriana'' (B. globosa x B. davidii). 

Some species are commonly found as escapees from the garden.  ''B. davidii'' in particular is a great coloniser of dry open ground; in towns in Britain, it often self-sows on waste ground, where it grows into a dense thicket, and it is listed as an invasive species in many areas. It is frequently seen beside railway lines and on derelict factory sites, although it is not able to survive the harsh winters of northern continental climates, being killed by temperatures below about -15°C to -20°C.

==Maintenance==
For hardy shrub species, pollard or coppice in early spring, as the wood is weak and splitting frequently occurs under the weight of the flowers.

==Propagation==
By seed or cuttings, may self-seed freely.

==Pests and diseases==

The genus '''Helianthus''' comprises 67 species and several subspecies in the Asteraceae family, all of which are native to North America, with some species (particularly ''[[../Helianthus annuus/]]'' (sunflower) and ''[[../Helianthus tuberosus/]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke)) cultivated in Europe and other parts of the world as food crops and ornamental plants.

==Description==
These are usually tall, annual or perennial plants, growing to a height of 60-390 cm. The rough and hairy stem is branched in the upper part. The petiolate leaves are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, ovate or often heart-shaped. The upper leaves are alternate and narrower.

They bear several to many wide, terminal capitula (flower heads), with bright yellow ray florets at the outside and maroon disc florets inside. The flower heads face in the direction of the sun, moving from east to west during the day.

      <comment>Wyatt Mangum's primary design puts the entrances at the ends.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Kenyan [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]] is a trough-shaped hive that originated in [[w:Kenya| Kenya]] under the direction of Canadian bee researcher Dr.Maurice V. Smith, sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency under an initial four year project begun in 1971.  The Kenyan TBH is differentiated from the other common design, the [[Beekeeping/Tanzania Top Bar Hives| Tanzania Top Bar Hive]], by having sloped sides (intended to minimize attachment of the comb). Reports vary as to how well this end is achieved in practice, but it is worth noting that this design appears to be preferred among top bar hive builders and designers in the USA and Europe, including Les Crowder, Marty Hardiman, Michael Bush and Phil Chandler and Wyatt A Mangum. The degree of slope varies, but 30 to 40 degrees from the vertical seems to be most common.

Because of its sloping sides, the Kenyan hive conforms more closely than the Tanzanian in its trapezoidal cross section to the shape that bees will build their comb in an unrestricted space, i.e. a catenary curve. This, it is claimed, makes for better use of space and more efficient warming of air in winter than is the case with a rectangular cross section.

Entrances may be arranged at the ends (Hardiman, Bush, Mangum) or the sides (Crowder, Chandler). Like all things in beekeeping, there are and always will be arguments for and against, but bees are adaptable and will make use of whatever is provided.

Top bars are wooden, usually 1 3/8&quot; (35mm) wide and anything from about 15&quot; to as much as 24&quot; long, although the average is 17&quot; - 19&quot;. Some form of guide is usually provided to encourage bees to build straight combs - a big help to the beekeeper, but not necessarily the first choice of the bees. This can be a simple groove cut in the underside of the bar and filled with wax, or a thin strip of wood fixed to the bar. Some beekeepers incorporate vertical guides to help support comb, although this is more common in the Tanzanian pattern, where a wide, rectangular slab of comb would otherwise be unstable. Mangum cuts a groove in the top bar and glues with beeswax a 1.5 inch strip of foundation as a guide or uses some old comb

==Sloped Side==
Left to their own devices, bees tend to build comb in a series of catenary curves, similar to the shape made by a heavy rope or chain, which is suspended by its ends. Because of this, the 'V' shape of the Kenyan hive is a better approximation to the shape of natural comb than a simple, vertical-sided box. Hence the Kenyan hive enables bees to build in a way that is close to their natural preference and reduces their need to build 'spurs' to attach the comb to the sides of the box. 

There exist several arguments for differing angles of the slope that the side of the hive follows.
===30&amp;deg; Slope===
The argument for 30&amp;deg; follows that in a perfectly formed hive, the comb cells will be built parallel to the bottoms of the [[Beekeeping/Top Bar| Top Bars]]. It can be observed that each side following build out of the top bar would be 30&amp;deg;. More specifically, a two dimensional 360&amp;deg; geometric object is divided into 6 equal angles (360&amp;deg; / 6&lt;sub&gt;sides&lt;/sub&gt; = 60&amp;deg;), because a flat surface of the cell is parallel to the top bar, by dividing that angle equally for each side of the comb would dictate 30&amp;deg; on either side of the buildup. Therefore if the walls are built at 30&amp;deg; (or slightly less), when the bees are building comb, the bees will tend to keep the edge of cell walls straight and not attach them to the sides of the hive.

===90&amp;deg; Slope===
A slope of 90&amp;deg; would actually be a [[Beekeeping/Tanzania Top Bar Hives| Tanzania Top Bar Hive]].

===Other Angles===
Some beekeepers who use Top Bar Hives claim that they see no real difference in the functionality of the angle of the side walls of the hive. All that is important is that the opening of the top bar hive in relation to the trough is not convex.

Hi Lwan98,

Nice finishing touch on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science/Basic Rescue|Basic Rescue]].  I marked it as complete.  It's been waiting for those illustrations for almost two years.  

BTW, tomorrow (Oct 8) is AYHAB's 3-year anniversary.  In that time, we have finished 211 out of 354 honors.  If we continue at this pace, we should finish in about two more years.

Hi Lester,

Nice job finding the requirements to the new honors.  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:17, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
: Just can't find those last two. Grrr! ~Lester 04:20, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

== Balloon ==

Hi Lester,

Nice to see you back again, and nice job on the balloon panel diagram.  I think this honor could use even more diagrams, as I can't figure out where to cut flaps.  I often have difficulty with that sort of thing until I try it.  With the pieces laid out in front of me, it's usually ''possible'' to figure this sort of thing out.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:22, 12 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

Anyone know what type (shape, dimensions) of pan this is meant to be cooked in? The recipe doesn't specify, and using the wrong sort could completely screw up the end product. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 14:27, 2 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Meat masala''' is a spice mix used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Keralan cuisine]], typically as a [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinade]] for various types of [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], especially [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]].

Meat masala can either be rubbed onto pieces of meat as a dry powder mix, or combined with [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to make a paste that more easily coats the meat. Once coated, the meat should be left to marinate for at least 20 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours, before cooking.

==Ingredients==
* 50g whole dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]]
* 100g [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seed]]
* 2 Tbs [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorn]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seed]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seed]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 12 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* ¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom seed]]
* 2 short pieces of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

==Procedure==
# Roast the chillies, coriander, peppercorn, cumin, and mustard in a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]].
# Grind all ingredients to a powder.
# Store in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.

      <comment>Restoring current version.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a textbook created and edited as part of an education course, [http://www.odu.edu/educ/dwallen/eci301new/eci301c.htm ECI 301], at [http://www.odu.edu Old Dominion University] in Norfolk, VA.  The book's primary contributors have been undergraduate, pre-service teachers.

Our goals for this project are manifold, but I would like to take a minute to highlight some of those that we consider most important.  First, we want to prove that a student-authored textbook can be of a quality equal to that of a traditional textbook.  After all, it seems counter-intuitive to imagine that students could learn from a textbook that is too sophisticated for them to have written themselves.  Furthermore, this text should serve as proof that, due to the vast availability of information via the [[The Internet|Internet]], traditional textbooks written by intellectual elites are no longer necessary to the same degree they were before the Information Age.  Next, the process of creating this text will serve to empower pre-service teachers with knowledge of technology and other skills such as effective communication and self-/peer-editing that will serve them well when they enter the classroom later, as teachers.

If you have stumbled onto this book by mistake, we encourage you to take a few minutes and read a chapter or two.  After reading, feel free to click the blue rating buttons at the bottom of each page.  This will help us identify the highest- and lowest-quality sections.  

Each section of each chapter of this book was researched and developed by the students.  Several versions of the articles were developed by different individuals, both within the same class and over several semesters.  The students evaluated their peers' articles to determine which ones were the most useful and those versions are the ones seen linked from the contents page of each chapter.

One note about your work in the Muggle's Guide, specifically on Albus Dumbledore and the questions. Questions are meant to be left unanswered, to inspire thought in the reader. Providing answers is fine, but if so, it's best to do so as part of the Greater Picture section. In some cases, also, it's best to present answers as opinions, because there will be people who read or work on this book who have other opinions as well.

{{Wikipedia|The Brothers Karamazov}}

Here we are going to briefly explain some of the plot of this book. Parts that bear no strong influence on the three chapters we will be annotating will be omited.

== History ==

Fyodor Karamazov, the father of the house, is a crude character. He is married twice, and pays little in the way of love or respect to either wife. From his first marriage, he has a child named Dimitri. From his second wife he has two children, Ivan (the older), and Alyosha (the younger). 

Fyodor pays little attention to any of his children. After his wives die, the children are brought up by the servant Grigory and his wife Marfa. The children are then separated, and sent out to live with relatives of their respective mothers.

Fyodor, on a bet, makes love to a retarded girl in town, named Stinking Lizaveta. Lizaveta bears a child named Smerdyakov, and dies during the birth. Smerdyakov is also raised by Grigory, and eventually grows up to become a servant of Fyodor. It is assumed by many that Smerdyakov is the biological son of Fyodor, but this fact is never proven. As with his other children, Fyodor largely ignores Smerdyakov, and does not treat him like a son. 

Through a series of events, all three brothers return to the house of their father. Dimitri and Fyodor have been quarreling over Dimitri's inheritance (of which Fyodor claims there is none left).

== Religion ==

Alyosha is a monk in training at the local monastery, while Ivan is a well-educated and influential atheist. Despite their strong differences in the area of religion, the two brothers seem to get along fine and respect each other. The two brothers have not seen each other much before arriving at Fyodor's house, so they spend time talking at a local bar. Their conversation, which inevitably turns to the topic of religion, is recounted in the chapter on ''Rebellion''. After this conversation, Ivan relates to Alyosha a &quot;poem&quot; he has been working on, known as ''The Grand Inquisitor''.

== Love ==

Dimitri, a military service man, has captured the heart of a young woman, Katerina Ivanova, the daughter of a military commander. Katerina feels some amount of love and loyalty to Dimitri, but Dimitri does not return the feelings. While on duty in the military, Dimitri learns that Katerina's father is in debt and is at risk of losing his rank and doing time in jail for it. Dimitri gives the money to Katerina, and asks nothing from Katerina in return. It is because of this event that Katerina feels bound to Dimitri, and constantly refers to herself as being in his debt.

While Katarina feels hopelessly bound to Dimitri, who does not return her affections, Ivan has fallen for Katerina. Katerina has fallen for Ivan as well, but because of her debt to Dimitri she does not allow a relationship to form between them. The conflict between his love for Katerina and his loyalty to his brother is a major stressor for Ivan.

Dimitri is not in love with Katerina primarily because he is in love with another woman, Grushenka. Fyodor also has a romantic interest in Grushenka so father and son begin competing for her attention. Combined with the financial problems between them, the fight over Grushenka is a a major source of contention.

== Murder ==

Ivan, upset about his own relationship with his father, and also upset about his relationship with Katerina, decides to leave town for Moscow. Smerdyakov says a few surprising things that catch Ivan off guard. First Smerdyakov says that without Ivan around, there were no strong men in the house to protect the father from Dimitri. Smerdyakov has told Dimitri the secret code of knocks that will cause Fyodor to open the lock on his bedroom door at night. Also, Smerdyakov mentions that he is planning to &quot;have a seizure&quot; the following night when Ivan is absent, thus leaving the entire house empty, except for Fyodor.

Ivan, not understanding the correlation between all these facts, or making some conscious effort to ignore them, leaves for Moscow the next morning. Predictably, things go the way Smerdyakov had anticipated: He had a seizure the following night, Dimitri used the secret signal to gain entry to Fyodor's bedroom, and Fyodor is found murdered the next day. Ivan, having been summoned to attend the funeral and the trial, questions Smerdyakov about the strange things he said in their last conversation. Smerdyakov admits to killing Fyodor, and framing Dimitri for the crime. More troubling then this, is the fact that Smerdyakov blames Ivan for the whole event. Smerdyakov told Ivan the plan, albeit in a circuitous way, and made it clear that if Ivan leaves for Moscow, Fyodor will get murdered. Ivan did go to Moscow, and therefore Smerdyakov took this as permission to murder Fyodor.

Ivan, upset about this new revelation, and desperate to save Dimitri from being wrongly punished for the murder develops a brain fever and begins having hallucinations.

== Fyodor Karamazov ==

== Dimitri and Alyosha ==

== Grushenka ==

The problems between Dimitri and Fyodor escalate when they both fall in love with the same woman: Grushenka. The quarrel becomes physical, and Dimitri storms out of the house. Ivan asks to meet Alyosha at a local bar to talk. They talk briefly about Dimitri (which is what Alyosha is concerned about), but then Ivan recites the &quot;poem&quot; that he has written, &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot;.

== Smerdyakov and Ivan ==

Ivan is a respected intellectual, but Smerdyakov is revealed to be highly intellegent in his own right. Smerdyakov has a high amount of respect for Ivan, although that respect is rarely returned. Smerdyakov is an epileptic, and is prone to occasional, debilitating seizures which can last for long periods of time. He also hints occasionally that he is capable of pretending to have such a seizure, and is very convincing at it.</text>

== Rebellion ==

In this chapter, Ivan relates several news stories that he has collected over the years. Each story is about a child that has been abused, or murdered, or otherwise made to suffer. Ivan claims that if god allows these children to suffer, Ivan will not accept any invitation into God's kingdom. After this, Alyosha says &quot;That's rebellion!&quot;.

== Part 1 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I MUST make one confession&quot; Ivan began. &quot;I could never understand how one can love one's neighbours. It's just one's neighbours, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might love those at a distance. I once read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and began breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease. I am convinced that he did that from 'self-laceration,' from the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed by duty, as a penance laid on him. For anyone to love a man, he must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; }}

Ivan here is referring to a passage from the book of Matthew, 22:35:

:''Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great commandment.  And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.''

Jesus claimed that &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; was the second most important law of god. It is by claiming to not be able to follow this law (and providing some justification against it) that Ivan starts this discussion.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,&quot; observed Alyosha; &quot;he, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practised in love, from loving him. But yet there's a great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Father Zossima is Alyosha's mentor at the monestary, and a well-respected local figure. 

{{-}}

== Part 2 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether that's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's inherent in their nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely. Another can never know how much I suffer, because he is another and not I. And what's more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's suffering (as though it were a distinction). Why won't he admit it, do you think? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me- hunger, for instance- my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher suffering- for an idea, for instance- he will very rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of his favour, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can love one's neighbours in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at close quarters it's almost impossible. If it were as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them.&quot;}}

When Ivan says &quot;Christ-like love&quot; he is referring to unconditional love towards your neightbors and your enemies. Ivan here is claiming that people in general are incapable of this kind of love by their nature, and are therefore incapable of following the laws of Jesus. 

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;But enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be. Still we'd better keep to the children, though it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when they are ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second reason why I won't speak of grown-up people is that, besides being disgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation- they've eaten the apple and know good and evil, and they have become 'like gods.' They go on eating it still. But the children haven't eaten anything, and are so far innocent. &quot;}}

This is an important point in the narrative. Here, Ivan turns the focus of the conversation squarely onto the issue of children, and not on man-kind in general. He does this for two reasons: he says that restricting his conversation to children will limit his argument, but also because people are compassionate towards children.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and you will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, suffer horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers' sins, they must be punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on earth. The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and especially such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond of children, too. And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while they are quite little- up to seven, for instance- are so remote from grown-up people they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar, murdered whole families, including several children. But when he was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time at his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends with him.... You don't know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My head aches and I am sad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

&quot;the apple&quot; here refers to the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, from the garden of eden. When Adam and Eve ate the fruit (which later came to be identified with an apple) they committed what is now known as &quot;original sin&quot;. Saint Augustine first wrote about the concept of original sin, a fallen state of humanity that is inherited by children from their parents. 

Ivan starts by saying that it is &quot;incomprehensible&quot; that children should be made to suffer because of their original sin. If an innocent person should not suffer for the sins of another person, then children should not suffer for the sins of their ancestors. 

Ivan goes on to talk about how even the most cruel and evil people still love children. He justifies this by saying that children are so small in stature that they are essentially different creatures from regular adult humans. When Ivan is talking about the affection or love that adults generally feel towards children, he is talking about a patronly love, not a sexual or romantic kind.

{{-}}

== Part 2 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You speak with a strange air,&quot; observed Alyosha uneasily, &quot;as though you were not quite yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,&quot; Ivan went on, seeming not to hear his brother's words, &quot;told me about the crimes committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning they hang them- all sorts of things you can't imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, -too; cutting the unborn child from the mothers womb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their mothers' eyes. Doing it before the mothers' eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They've planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with glee, holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the baby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn't it? By the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Here Ivan mentions, almost without explanation stories he has heard of cruelties commited by the Turks against the Bulgarians. He uses these stories to illustrate the fact that men can be much more cruel then any animal can be, thus elliminating a possible model for the devil. If the devil was an invention, he must have been based off other men, and not off some cruel animal. 

{{-}}

== Part 3 ==
{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Brother, what are you driving at?&quot; asked Alyosha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he has created him in his own image and likeness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Just as he did God, then?&quot; observed Alyosha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'It's wonderful how you can turn words,' as Polonius says in Hamlet,&quot; laughed Ivan. &quot;You turn my words against me. Well, I am glad.
Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him in his image and
likeness. You asked just now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond
of collecting certain facts, and, would you believe, I even copy
anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books, and I've
already got a fine collection.&quot;}}

Driving to the heart of the matter, Ivan says that man has created the Devil &quot;in his own image and likeness.&quot; Alyosha immediately likens this to the theory that man has created God in a similar fashion.

It's at this point that Ivan first mentions his &quot;collection&quot; of stories. These stories, as we shall see, have a particular focus that has Ivan very troubled.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;The Turks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have specimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know we prefer beating-rods and scourges- that's our national institution. Nailing ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us. Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or laws have been passed, so that they don't dare to flog men now. But they make up for it in another way just as national as ours. And so national that it would be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy.&quot;}}

This passage is a little bit obscure, and it is difficult to understand all of Ivan's context-sensitive references. However, the point of this passage is quite clear: every society has manners of harming other people. Also, the ways that one society hurt people may seem to be barbaric to other societies, but all the methods are essentially equivalent.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;I have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how, quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed- a young man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to the Christian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds on the Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for them. He grew up like a little wild beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and scarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity of feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given to the pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn't even give that, and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was how he spent all his childhood and his youth, till he grew up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief. The savage began to earn his living as a day labourer in Geneva. He drank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by killing and robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to death. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was immediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods, philanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked upon him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed his crime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was a monster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown grace. All Geneva was in excitement about him- all philanthropic and religious Geneva. All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to the prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; 'You are our brother, you have found grace.' And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, 'Yes, I've found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigs' food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.' 'Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. Though it's not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigs' food and were beaten for stealing it (which was very wrong of you, for stealing is forbidden); but you've shed blood and you must die.'And on the last day, Richard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute: 'This is my happiest day. I am going to the Lord.' 'Yes,' cry the pastors and the judges and philanthropic ladies. 'This is the happiest day of your life, for you are going to the Lord!' They all walk or drive to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold they call to Richard: 'Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!' And so, covered with his brothers' kisses, Richard is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to the guillotine. And they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion, because he had found grace. Yes, that's characteristic. That pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed gratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard is interesting because it's national. Though to us it's absurd to cut off a man's
head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet we have our own speciality, which is all but worse.&quot;}} 

Here Ivan recounts the story of a man named Richard, who was raised as an animal, and grew up to become a thief and a murderer. In prison, awaiting death, Richard is converted into a christian and educated in reading and writing. On the day of his execution, Richard is actually celebrating his own death as a holy act.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;Our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, 'on its meek eyes,' everyone must have seen it. It's peculiarly Russian. He describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over and over again. 'However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.' The nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenceless creature on its weeping, on its 'meek eyes.' The frantic beast tugs and draws the load, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort of unnatural spasmodic action- it's awful in Nekrassov. But that only a horse, and God has horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it.&quot;}}

Here, Ivan discusses the story of a master and a horse. The horse is tired from pulling &quot;too heavy a load&quot;, and stops pulling. The master, in a rage, lashes the horse and beats it repeatedly and for some time. Finally, having no untouched skin left to beat, the master lashes the horse on it's eyes. This finally motivated the horse to pull the load.

Ivan uses this story as an example that people experience satisfaction from inflicting pain, thus reinforcing his thesis that the Devil was created in the image of evil men.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;But men, too, can be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it. The papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. 'It stings more,' said he, and so be began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact there are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict. They beat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps, 'Daddy daddy!' By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called a barrister 'a conscience for hire.' The counsel protests in his client's defence. 'It's such a simple thing,' he says, 'an everyday domestic event. A father corrects his child. To our shame be it said, it is brought into court.' The jury, convinced by him, give a favourable verdict. The public roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn't there! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honour! Charming pictures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

In the same vein of the previous story, Ivan recounts now the story of a man and his wife beat their seven-year-old daughter with a birch rod. The beating lasted for more then 10 minutes, and grew harder and more savage as time went on. 

When brought to court, instead of being punished for abusing their daughter, the couple is praised for properly correcting their child. As we shall see later, Ivan has a special place in his heart for abused children, and the stories he relates later focus more on them.</text>

== The Grand Inquisitor ==

''The Grand Inquisitor'' is Ivan's &quot;poem&quot;, which he recites after '''Rebellion'''. In part, the discussion from ''Rebellion'' is Ivan's way of judging whether Alyosha is ready to hear the poem. Ivan determines that Alyosha is ready to hear it, and so tells the story, with occasional questions from Alyosha to break the narrative. It is important to note that while Ivan refers to it as a &quot;poem&quot;, that the tale itself is prose.

In the story, Jesus (referred to by Ivan only as &quot;He&quot;, or &quot;Him&quot;, with a capital H) returns to earth during the Spanish Inquisition. He brings a dead girl back to life, and performs other miracles among the wounded, sick, and dying people in town. The Grand Inquisitor, riding through town with his procession, sees Him, and has Him arrested. The remainder of the story involves the &quot;conversation&quot; that the Grand Inquisitor has with Jesus. The word &quot;conversation&quot; in the previous sentence is a bit of a misnomer, because throughout the rest of the story, The Grand Inquisitor speaks to Him, and He listens silently.

He never speaks, but his silence is applauded by the Inquisitor, who says &quot;Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old.&quot; Aloysha asks whether He is completely silent throughout the conversation, to which Ivan replies:

:''&quot;That's inevitable in any case, the old man has told Him He hasn't the right to add anything to what He has said of old. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. 'All has been given by The to the Pope,' they say, 'and all, therefore, is still in the Pope's hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all.&quot;''

Another point that the Inquisitor makes frequently is that He has given humanity a certain amount of freedom, and that any additional messages from Him would encroach upon that freedom. Also, continues the Inquisitor, that freedom that was given to humanity by Jesus' original message was actually a penalty, and that the church has needed to remove those freedoms from the people.

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;EVEN this must have a preface- that is, a literary preface,&quot; laughed Ivan, &quot;and I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God Himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the Hotel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI in honour of the birth of the dauphin. It was called Le bon jugement de la tres sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her bon jugement. Similar plays, chiefly from the Old Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times of Peter the Great. But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when required. In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing such poems- and even under the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of course, from the Greek), The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell, with descriptions as bold as Dante's. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners and their punishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they can't swim out, and 'these God forgets'- an expression of extraordinary depth and force. And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hell- for all she has seen there, indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is immensely interesting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God points to the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, 'How can I forgive His tormentors?' she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all the angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all without distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, 'Thou art just, O Lord, in this judgment.' Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time. He comes on the scene in my poem, but He says nothing, only appears and passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed since He promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet wrote, 'Behold, I come quickly'; 'Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither the Son, but the Father,' as He Himself predicted on earth. But humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. Oh, with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from heaven. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               No signs from heaven come to-day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               To add to what the heart doth say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true there were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. 'A huge star like to a torch' (that is, to a church) 'fell on the sources of the waters and they became bitter.' These heretics began blasphemously denying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent in their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before, awaited His coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to suffer and die for Him as before. And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervour, 'O Lord our God, hasten Thy coming'; so many ages called upon Him, that in His infinite mercy He deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He had come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs, and hermits, as is written in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the truth of his words, bore witness that &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               Weary and worn, the Heavenly King&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               Our mother, Russia, came to bless,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;               And through our land went wandering.

And that certainly was so, I assure you.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to the tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him like children. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible time of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God, and 'in the splendid auto da fe the wicked heretics were burnt.' Oh, of course, this was not the coming in which He will appear, according to His promise, at the end of time in all His heavenly glory, and which will be sudden 'as lightning flashing from east to west.' No, He visited His children only for a moment, and there where the flames were crackling round the heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in that human shape in which He walked among men for thirty-three years fifteen centuries ago. He came down to the 'hot pavements' of the southern town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, ad majorem gloriam Dei, been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent auto da fe, in the presence of the king, the court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming ladies of the court, and the whole population of Seville.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &quot;He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, everyone recognised Him. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why they recognised Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!' and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. 'It is He- it is He!' repeat. 'It must be He, it can be no one but Him!' He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. 'He will raise your child,' the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. 'If it is Thou, raise my child!' she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, 'Maiden, arise!' and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with wide-open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 3 == 

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church- at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old, monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and the 'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick grey brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on' The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison- in the ancient palace of the Holy, inquisition and shut him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, 'breathless' night of Seville. The air is 'fragrant with laurel and lemon.' In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'Is it Thou? Thou?' but receiving no answer, he adds at once. 'Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost thou know what will be to-morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,' he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 4 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?&quot; Alyosha, who had been listening in silence, said with a smile. &quot;Is it simply a wild fantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man- some impossible quid pro quo?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Take it as the last,&quot; said Ivan, laughing, &quot;if you are so corrupted by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic. If you like it to be a case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,&quot; he went on, laughing, &quot;the old man was ninety, and he might well be crazy over his set idea. He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner. It might, in fact, be simply his ravings, the delusion of an old man of ninety, over-excited by the auto da fe of a hundred heretics the day before. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy? All that matters is that the old man should speak out, that he should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for ninety years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say a word?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;That's inevitable in any case,&quot; Ivan laughed again. &quot;The old man has told Him He hasn't the right to add anything to what He has said of old. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. 'All has been given by Thee to the Pope,' they say, 'and all, therefore, is still in the Pope's hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all. Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.' That's how they speak and write too- the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read it myself in the works of their theologians. 'Hast Thou the right to reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come?' my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. 'No, Thou hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old, and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wast on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on men's freedom of faith; for it will be manifest as a miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago. Didst Thou not often say then, &quot;I will make you free&quot;? But now Thou hast seen these &quot;free&quot; men,' the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile. 'Yes, we've paid dearly for it,' he goes on, looking sternly at Him, 'but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended and over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over for good? Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But let me tell Thee that now, to-day, people are more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst? Was this Thy freedom?'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I don't understand again.&quot; Alyosha broke in. &quot;Is he ironical, is he jesting?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy. 'For now' (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of course) 'for the first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men. Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast warned,' he says to Him. 'Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst not listen to those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men might be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on the work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word, Thou hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of course, Thou canst not think of taking it away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder us?'&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And what's the meaning of 'no lack of admonitions and warnings'?&quot; asked Alyosha.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say.&lt;/p&gt; }}

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and non-existence,' the old man goes on, great spirit talked with Thee in the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he &quot;tempted&quot; Thee. Is that so? And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books is called &quot;the temptation&quot;? And yet if there has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the three temptations. The statement of those three questions was itself the miracle. If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to do so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth- rulers, chief priests, learned men, philosophers, poets- and had set them the task to invent three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history of the world and of humanity- dost Thou believe that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness? From those questions alone, from the miracle of their statement, we can see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal. For in those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature. At the time it could not be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that fifteen hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.&lt;/p&gt;}}

The &quot;temptations&quot; the Inquisitor is referring to here are the three temptations of Jesus, described in [[wikisource:Bible_%28King_James%29/Matthew|Matthew chapter 4]] in the Bible:

''And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.''

The same passage is described in [[wikisource:Bible_%28King_James%29/Luke#Chapter 4|Luke chapter 4]]:

''And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.''

Even though the two accounts differ in the ordering, the same three temptations are given by the devil to Jesus:
#Turn stones to bread.
#Worship the Devil in exchange for worldly power.
#Attempt to hurt yourself, to prove that you are protected by God.

The Inquisitor goes on to say that these three temptations are profound, which he will describe later.

== Part 6 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Judge Thyself who was right- Thou or he who questioned Thee then? Remember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this: &quot;Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dread- for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom. But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness? Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.&quot; But Thou wouldst not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is that freedom worth if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will follow him, crying, &quot;Who can compare with this beast? He has given us fire from heaven!&quot; Dost Thou know that the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only hunger? &quot;Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!&quot; that's what they'll write on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and with which they will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building; the terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and though, like the one of old, it will not be finished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower. They will seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to us, &quot;Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't given it!&quot; And then we shall finish building their tower, for he finishes the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never, never can they feed themselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as they remain free. In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and say to us, &quot;Make us your slaves, but feed us.&quot; They will understand themselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to share between them! They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free, for they are weak, vicious, worthless, and rebellious. Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the great and strong, while the millions, numerous as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great and strong? No, we care for the weak too. They are sinful and rebellious, but in the end they too will become obedient. They will marvel at us and look on us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful and to rule over them- so awful it will seem to them to be free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to us again. That deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced to lie.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{-}} 

== Part 7 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness, and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thou hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies hid the great secret of this world. Choosing &quot;bread,&quot; Thou wouldst have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity- to find someone to worship. So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship. But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worship it. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship, but to find community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake of common worship they've slain each other with the sword. They have set up gods and challenged one another, &quot;Put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!&quot; And so it will be to the end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but have known, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject the one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow down to Thee alone- the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou didst further. And all again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is born. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their freedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread, and man will worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if someone else gains possession of his conscience- Oh! then he will cast away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience. In that Thou wast right. For the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance. That is true. But what happened? Instead of taking men's freedom from them, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man prefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold, instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional, vague and enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men, acting as though Thou didst not love them at all- Thou who didst come to give Thy life for them! Instead of taking possession of men's freedom, Thou didst increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever. Thou didst desire man's free love, that he should follow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the rigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even Thy image and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of free choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee, for they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou hast caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.&lt;/p&gt;}}</text>

== Part 1: Ivan's Condition ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I AM NOT a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan's illness. Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible effort of will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of course, to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching crisis in his life, when he needed to have all his wits about him, to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and &quot;to justify himself to himself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's to which I have referred already. After listening to him and examining him the doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him. &quot;Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,&quot; the doctor opined, 'though it would be better to verify them... you must take steps at once, without a moment's delay, or things will go badly with you.&quot; But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to his bed to be nursed. &quot;I am walking about, so I am strong enough, if I drop, it'll be different then, anyone may nurse me who likes,&quot; he decided, dismissing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;}}

The person narrating the story is a man from the town who speaks of all the events from '''The Brothers Karamazov''' with a certain amount of omniscience. For instance, the narrator is able to recount this story although it is obvious that Ivan is alone. However in other situations, the narrator does not know everything, especially concerning the murder of Fyodor Karamazov. the opening line of this chapter is illustrative of this point:

:''I AM NOT a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan's illness.''

The narrator admits a certain shortcoming in his literary omniscience, but yet he is able to speak frankly about events that he did not witness.

== Part 2: Ivan's Guest ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and, as I have said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa against the opposite wall. Someone appeared to be sitting there, though goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not been
in the room when Ivan came into it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young, qui faisait la cinquantaine, as the French say, with rather long, still thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with grey and a small pointed beard. He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old, that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection his linen was not overclean and his wide scarf was very threadbare. The visitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but were too light in colour and too tight for the present fashion. His soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means. It looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could be asked to sit down with anyone, though, of course, not in a place of honour. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion for
any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at some aunt's, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children altogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and sometimes even answer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured, as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a black ribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation.}}

;qui faisait la cinquantaine: Fiftyish (french)}}

While sitting and staring at the far wall, a person simply &quot;appeared to be sitting there&quot;. Notice that the narrator does not claim the stranger appeared from thin air, but almost says that the person had been there all along, unnoticed. Notice again the absurdity of the narrator: he can recount the events of this night, although even he seems to be somewhat confused by the presence of this new man in the room. Ivan also does not appear to be alarmed or startled by this person. He never inquires where the visitor came from, and does not greet him the way a proper gentleman would have greeted a new visitor.

The passage starts out with the words ''And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium'', again pointing out that Ivan was somehow expecting to have a problem with &quot;brain fever&quot;. Multiple stresses had been piling up: the murder of his father, the imprisonment of his brother, and the fact that he has been pursuing Katerina Ivanova, who was desperately in love with Dimitri (love only strengthened because Dimitri was wrongfully accused and in jail).

The stranger in the room is described in a particular way, as a Russian gentlemen who was reasonably fashionable although dated. His clothing is described as being nice but old and generally &quot;shabby&quot;. The first line of the second paragraph pushes the idea home, that the man had ''every appearance of gentility on straitened means''. At the time of writing '''The Brothers Karamazov''', Russia had only recently abolished serfdom, and it is in the terms of the feudal system that the visitor is described. Notice the following descriptions, specifically:

:''He had unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could be asked to sit down with anyone, though, of course, not in a place of honour''

Look at this description as a metaphore for the devil: The rise of atheism or agnosticism among the educated creates a poorness for supernatural beings, where the dark ages only years before had been a boon. He is also being described as having &quot;good connections&quot; which have been preserved, and that he could sit down with anybody. The devil, representative of sin, certainly is nobody's stranger.

== Part 3: Truth ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly silent, seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host should begin it. All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I say,&quot; he began to Ivan, &quot;excuse me, I only mention it to remind you. You went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you came away without finding out anything about her, you probably forgot-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah, yes.&quot; broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness. &quot;Yes, I'd forgotten... but it doesn't matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;and you,&quot; he added, addressing his visitor, &quot;I should have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me, and that I didn't remember it of myself?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Don't believe it then,&quot; said the gentleman, smiling amicably, &quot;what's the good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are no help to believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he saw Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look at the spiritualists, for instance.... I am very fond of them... only fancy, they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion, because the devils show them their horns from the other world. That, they say, is a material proof, so to speak, of the existence of another world. The other world and material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does proving there's a devil prove that there's a God? I want to join an idealist society, I'll lead the opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist, but not a materialist, he he!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

The visitor is now described in terms of being a personal relation, where previously he was described as being everybody's acquaintance. 

Ivan had gone to Smerdyakov's house to inquire about Katerina Ivanova. However the two talked about Fyodor almost exclusively, and forgot entirely about Katerina. This passage, presented two chapters before '''The Devil''' explains the situation:

:''When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha's presence: &quot;It was you, you, persuaded me of his&quot; (that is, Mitya's) &quot;guilt!&quot; Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was she, she, who had produced that &quot;document&quot; and proved his brother's guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: &quot;I've been at Smerdyakov's myself!&quot; When had she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya's guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could not understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those words pass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and rushed off to Smerdyakov. &quot;I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,&quot; he thought on the way.''

Katerina claims that she has been convinced by Ivan that Dimitri is guilty of the crime. However, Katerina also went to see Smerdyakov about the issue, which indicated to Ivan that perhaps Katerina was not convinced about Dimitri at all. Ivan went to Smerdyakov's apartment to ask about why Katerina had gone to see Smerdyakov, and what she had said to him. However, during the meeting, Smerdyakov admitted to killing Fyodor, with the statement:

:''&quot;Aren't you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what's the use of going on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to throw it all on me, to my face? You murdered him; you are the real murderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following your words I did it.&quot;''

Notice how even though Smerdyakov admits to killing Fyodor, he still blames Ivan for the murder. Smerdyakov claims he was only acting as Ivan's &quot;instrument&quot;. The guilt that he had convinced Katerina against Dimitri, and the guilt that somehow he had persuaded Smerdyakov to murder Fyodor are weighing on Ivan, and it is because of this weight that he could not remember about Katerina. However, there was the persistant feeling that he had forgotten something, that even though he had gone to see Smerdyakov, and did get answers to some of his questions, he still hadn't concluded all his business. 

It is the man across the room who reminds Ivan about the contents of his subconscious. This man knows that Ivan is trying to remember what precisely he was forgetting, and he also knows precisely what was forgot. And when he brings it up, Ivan has a most unusual response:

:''&quot;Ah, yes.&quot; broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness. &quot;Yes, I'd forgotten... but it doesn't matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;and you,&quot; he added, addressing his visitor, &quot;I should have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me, and that I didn't remember it of myself?&quot;''

There is almost some measure of familiarity between Ivan and his guest, which prompts the question whether Ivan has seen this man before, and if not, was Ivan expecting him.

== Part 4: Ivan's Realization ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Listen,&quot; Ivan suddenly got up from the table. &quot;I seem to be delirious... I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I don't care! You won't drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I feel somehow ashamed... I want to walk about the room.... I sometimes don't see you and don't even hear your voice as I did last time, but I always guess what you are prating, for it's I, I myself speaking, not you. Only I don't know whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I'll wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with a wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,&quot; the visitor began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Fool,&quot; laughed Ivan, &quot;do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you? I am in good spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead... and in the top of my head... only please don't talk philosophy, as you did last time. If you can't take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talk gossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip. What a nightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I'll get the better of you. I won't be taken to a mad-house!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;C'est charmant, poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For what am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for something real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in declaring last time-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,&quot; Ivan cried with a sort of fury. &quot;You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom. It's only that I don't know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a time. You are my hallucination. You are the
incarnation of myself, but only of one side of me... of my thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be of interest to me, if only I had time to waste on you-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Ivan is aware of his own delirium, and also seems to be aware that the person in the room is a figment. Ivan also refers to &quot;last time&quot;, when the stranger put Ivan into a &quot;fury&quot;. This is clearly not Ivan's first encounter with this stranger, which helps to explain the ease with which Ivan speaks to him. 

{{-}}

== Part 5: Aloysha ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Excuse me, excuse me, I'll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha under the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him, 'You learnt it from him! How do you know that he visits me?' You were thinking of me then. So for one brief moment you did believe that I really exist,&quot; the gentleman laughed blandly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Yes, that was a moment of weakness... but I couldn't believe in you. I don't know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn't see you really at all-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; I've treated him badly over Father Zossima.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!&quot; Ivan laughed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You scold me, but you laugh- that's a good sign. But you are ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolution of yours-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Don't speak of my resolution,&quot; cried Ivan, savagely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I understand, I understand, c'est noble, c'est charmant, you are going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself... C'est chevaleresque.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

The stranger is referring to a conversation several chapters previously, where Alyosha confronts Ivan in the street at night. With Aloysha speaking first:

:''&quot;No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are the murderer.&quot;''
:''&quot;When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?&quot; Ivan faltered helplessly.''
:''&quot;You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone during these two dreadful months,&quot; Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as before.''

Ivan has been blaming himself, although he does not quite know why. There has only been one time when Ivan ever mentioned it out loud, and refers to that incident next:

:''&quot;You've been in my room!&quot; he whispered hoarsely. &quot;You've been there at night, when he came.... Confess... have you seen him, have you seen him?&quot;''
:''&quot;Whom do you mean- Mitya?&quot; Alyosha asked, bewildered.''
:''&quot;Not him, damn the monster!&quot; Ivan shouted, in a frenzy, &quot;Do you know that he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!&quot;''
:''&quot;Who is he? I don't know whom you are talking about,&quot; Alyosha faltered, beginning to be alarmed.''
:''&quot;Yes, you do know. or how could you- ? It's impossible that you don't know.&quot;''

Ivan is talking about previous meetings with this stranger, and assumes that Alyosha must be aware of it because Alyosha is a monk in training, a holy man. 

When the stranger mentions Alyosha again, Ivan becomes petulant. It's interesting to note how Ivan is both aware that this stranger is a delusion, but also treats him as a separate entity. His insults, referring to the visitor as a &quot;flunky&quot;, are self-deprecating because this visitor his really Ivan.


{{-}}

== Part 6: One and the Same ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Hold your tongue, I'll kick you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object will be
attained. If you kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people
don't kick ghosts. Joking apart, it doesn't matter to me, scold if you
like, though it's better to be a trifle more polite even to me. 'Fool,
flunkey!' what words!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Scolding you, I scold myself,&quot; Ivan laughed again, &quot;you are
myself, myself, only with a different face. You just say what I am
thinking... and are incapable of saying anything new!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;If I am like you in my way of thinking, it's all to my credit,&quot;
the gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what's more, the
stupid ones. You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No,
I can't put up with you! What am I to do, what am I to do?&quot; Ivan
said through his clenched teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a
gentleman and to be recognised as such,&quot; the visitor began in an
access of deprecating and simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor
relation. &quot;I am poor, but... I won't say very honest, but... it's an
axiom generally accepted in society that I am a fallen angel. I
certainly can't conceive how I can ever have been an angel. If I
ever was, it must have been so long ago that there's no harm in
forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a
gentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable.
I love men genuinely, I've been greatly calumniated! Here when I
stay with you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality and
that's what I like most of all. You see, like you, I suffer from the
fantastic and so I love the realism of earth. Here, with you,
everything is circumscribed, here all is formulated and geometrical,
while we have nothing but indeterminate equations! I wander about here
dreaming. I like dreaming. Besides, on earth I become superstitious.
Please don't laugh, that's just what I like, to become
superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I've grown fond of
going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go and steam
myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is becoming
incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some
merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she
believes. My ideal is to go to church and offer a candle in
simple-hearted faith, upon my word it is. Then there would be an end
to my sufferings. I like being doctored too; in the spring there was
an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was vaccinated in a foundling
hospital- if only you knew how I enjoyed myself that day. I subscribed
ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But you are not listening.
Do you know, you are not at all well this evening? I know you went
yesterday to that doctor... well, what about your health? What did the
doctor say?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Fool!&quot; Ivan snapped out.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{-}}

== Part 7: The Two are Different ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn't
ask out of sympathy. You needn't answer. Now rheumatism has come in
again-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Fool!&quot; repeated Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of
rheumatism last year that I remember it to this day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;The devil have rheumatism!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly
form and I take the consequences. Satan sum et nihil humanum a me
alienum puto.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;What, what, Satan sum et nihil humanum... that's not bad for
the devil!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I am glad I've pleased you at last.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;But you didn't get that from me.&quot; Ivan stopped suddenly,
seeming struck. &quot;That never entered my head, that's strange.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;C'est du nouveau, n'est-ce pas?&quot; This time I'll act honestly and
explain to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from
indigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions,
such complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world of
events, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from
the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear
Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not
by writers, but by the most ordinary people, officials, journalists,
priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A statesman confessed to
me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him when he was asleep.
Well, that's how it is now, though I am your hallucination, yet just
as in a nightmare, I say original things which had not entered your
head before. So I don't repeat your ideas, yet I am only your
nightmare, nothing more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are
not my nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

case 1a: &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;x \in A \subset A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x \in A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;

case 1b: &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can't actually say anything we want to with just this, so we have to also add in &lt;math&gt;x \in A\cup C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;case 2a: &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; : SEE CASE 1a&lt;br&gt;case 2b: &lt;math&gt;x \in C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;We now have &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in C&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x \in B\cap C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, since &lt;math&gt;x \in B\cap C \subset A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;x \in A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Since both cases 2a and 2b yield &lt;math&gt;x \in A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;, we know that it follows from 1b.

Since in both cases 1a and 1b, &lt;math&gt;x \in A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;, we know that &lt;math&gt;(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C) \subset A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since both &lt;math&gt;A\cup(B\cap C) \subset (A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C) \subset A\cup(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;, it follows (finally) that &lt;math&gt;A\cup(B\cap C) = (A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)&lt;/math&gt;.

==A Common Format for Units and Equations==
Equations and units are an integral part of teaching most technical subjects.  To help general readability there are common editorial guidelines in technical literature.  The goal of a textbook is to introduce a student to a new topic and allow him or her to engage in intelligent discourse and part of intelligent discourse is written communication.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Transformations of functions ==

== Sequences and series ==
=== Notation ===
&lt;math&gt; u_n \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the general term of a sequence; the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; term


&lt;math&gt; a \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the first term of a sequence


&lt;math&gt; l \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the last term of a sequence


&lt;math&gt; d \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the common difference of an arithmetic progression


&lt;math&gt; r \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the common ratio of a geometric progression


&lt;math&gt; S_n \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the sum to ''n'' terms: &lt;math&gt; S_n = u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + \ldots + u_n \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \sum \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the sum of


&lt;math&gt; \infty \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — infinity (which is a concept, not a number)


&lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — ''n'' tends towards infinity (''n'' gets bigger and bigger)


&lt;math&gt; |x| \,\!&lt;/math&gt; — the modulus of ''x'' (the value of ''x'', ignoring any minus signs)

=== Convergent, divergent and periodic sequences ===
==== Convergent sequences ====
A sequence is convergent if its ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; term gets closer to a finite number, ''L'', as ''n'' approaches infinity. ''L'' is called the limit of the sequence:

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{As } n \to \infty \mbox{, } u_n \to L \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Another way of denoting the same thing is:

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty}u_n = L \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Definition of the limit of a convergent sequence ====
Generally, the limit &lt;math&gt; L \,\!&lt;/math&gt; of a sequence defined by &lt;math&gt; u_{n+1} = f(u_n) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt; L = f(L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Divergent sequences ====
Sequences that do not tend to a limit as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases are described as divergent.
eg: 1, -1 , 1 -1

==== Periodic sequences ====
Sequences that move through a regular cycle (oscillate) are described as periodic.

=== Series ===
A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence.  Those series with a countable number of terms are called finite series and those with an infinite number of terms are called infinite series.

=== Arithmetic progressions ===
An arithmetic progression, or AP, is a sequence in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant called the common difference.  To get from one term to the next, you simply add the common difference:

&lt;math&gt; u_{n+1} = u_n + d \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Expression for the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; term of an AP ====
&lt;math&gt; u_n = a + (n-1)d \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Formulae for the sum of the first n terms of an AP ====
The sum of an arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series.

&lt;math&gt; S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left \lbrack 2a + (n-1)d \right \rbrack \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a+l) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Formulae for the sum of the first n natural numbers ====
The natural numbers are the positive integers, i.e. 1, 2, 3…

&lt;math&gt; S_n = \frac{n}{2} (n+1) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Geometric progressions ===
An geometric progression, or GP, is a sequence in which the ratio between any two consecutive terms is a constant called the common ratio.  To get from one term to the next, you simply multiply by the common ratio:

&lt;math&gt; u_{n+1} = ru_n \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
 
==== Expression for the nth term of an GP ====
&lt;math&gt; u_n = ar^{n-1} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Formula for the sum of the first n terms of a GP ====
&lt;math&gt; S_n = a \left ( \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; S_n = a \left ( \frac{r^n-1}{r-1} \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== Formula for the sum to infinity of a GP ====
 
&lt;math&gt; S_\infty = \sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1} = \frac{a}{1-r} \qquad \mbox{where } -1 &lt; r &lt; 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Binomial theorem ===
The binomial theorem is a formula that provides a quick and effective method for expanding '''powers of sums''', which have the general form &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Binomial coefficients ====
The general expression for the coefficient of the &lt;math&gt;(r+1)^{th}&lt;/math&gt; term in the expansion of &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;{}^n\!C_r = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; is called ''n'' factorial.  By definition, &lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Binomial expansion of (1+x)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ====
&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n=1+\binom{n}{1}x+\binom{n}{2}x^2+\binom{n}{3}x^3+\ldots+x^n&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n=1+nx+\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}+\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}+\ldots+x^n&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n=\sum_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}x^r&lt;/math&gt;

== Trigonometry ==
=== Arc length ===
&lt;math&gt;l = r \theta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sector area ===
&lt;math&gt;A = \tfrac{1}{2} r^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

=== Trigonometric identities ===
&lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} \equiv \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\sin^2{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} \equiv 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Indices and logarithms ==
=== Laws of indices ===
&lt;math&gt; x^m \times x^n = x^{m+n} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; x^m \div x^n = x^{m-n} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \left ( x^m \right )^n = x^{mn} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; x^0 = 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for x ≠ 0)


&lt;math&gt; x^{-m} = \frac{1}{x^m} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; x^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; x^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x^m} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Logarithms ===
&lt;math&gt;10^2 = 100 \Leftrightarrow \log_{10}{100} = 2 &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;10^3 = 1000 \Leftrightarrow \log_{10}{1000} = 3 &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;2^5 = 32 \Leftrightarrow \log_{2}{32} = 5 &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\log_a{b} = c \Leftrightarrow a^c = b &lt;/math&gt;

=== Laws of logarithms ===
The sum of the logs is the log of the product.

&lt;math&gt;\log{x} + \log{y} = \log{xy} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The difference of the logs is the log of the quotient.

&lt;math&gt;\log{x} - \log{y} = \log{\left ( \frac{x}{y} \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

The index comes out of the log of the power.

&lt;math&gt;k\log{x} = \log{\left ( x^k \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

== Differentiation ==
=== Differentiating the sum or difference of two functions ===
&lt;math&gt; y = f(x) \pm g(x) \quad \therefore \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) \pm g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

== Integration ==
=== Integrating ax&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ===

&lt;math&gt; \int ax^n \, dx = \frac{ ax^{n+1} }{ n+1 } + c \qquad \mbox{ for } n \neq -1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Area under a curve ===
The area under the curve &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt; between the limits &lt;math&gt; x = a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = b &lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt; A = \int_a^b y \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">With the explosion of multisensory multimedia, one cannot help but consider the obstacles faced by those with sensory handicaps. Imagine not being able to see the cinematography in your favorite film. Imagine not being able hear the music created by your favorite artist. Many people do not have to imagine, for this is their reality. This is quite a disposition to be in considering the current trends in technology. Now imagine a world where you can see with your tongue. To many this sounds like a work of science fiction created by a bunch of aged hippies having a recurring acid trip.



Researchers across the globe are exploring new means of interfacing technology with the human brain to create a sensory experience. The human brain is so complex that even cutting edge neuroscience does not come close to explaining its inner workings. So how can the power of modern technology be harnessed to empower the blind with sight? Unlike Geordi La Forge in Star Trek, the problem that is encountered is enabling the brain to process the signal that is received from the technology. Although advanced technologies may exist that emulate existing senses, it is just not possible to “plug” these devices directly into the brain. The workaround is to encode the signal and use an existing channel to get to the brain.  The brain is a very flexible organ and can adapt extremely well. Blind people are known for having acute senses of hearing. A prime example is the experiment by Austrian researcher, Ivo Kohler, where people wore goggles with prisms that flipped the images upside down before they reached the eyes. Within several weeks the brain adjusted to the difference and the images were seen right side up. When the goggles were removed the images were then upside down until the brain corrected itself again.



There are several researchers experimenting with sensory prosthetics, and one experiment aims at prosthetics for people with damaged inner ears. The inner ear is the part of the body responsible for controlling balance, so one can understand its importance. The success of those experiments led the researchers to trying to use the tongue as an input channel for visual information. In the prototype the user wears a pair of blacked-out glasses with a camera mounted on them. The camera is connected to a laptop, which is connected to a mouthpiece that the user wears. The mouthpiece applies voltage to the tongue. 


This is such a hard concept to grasp that it is best understand by hearing it explained from someone who has experienced it firsthand. 


I could see it. Feel it. Whatever — I could tell where the foam was. With Arnold Ussen behind me carrying the laptop, I walked around the Wicab offices. I managed to avoid most walls and desks, scanning my head from side to side slowly to give myself a wider field of view, like radar. Thinking back on it, I don't remember the feeling of the electrodes on my tongue at all during my walkabout. What I remember are pictures: high-contrast images of cubicle walls and office doors, as though I'd seen them with my eyes.” With all the advancements occurring at such a rapid pace, sensory prosthetics are sure to become a reality of the near future.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page, and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:52, 2 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

==1. Explain the following:== 
===a. The principles of digital camera construction and how a digital camera works. ===
[[Image:Pinhole-camera.svg|thumb|right|200px|Principle of a pinhole camera. Light rays from an object pass through a small hole to form an image.]]
Cameras work with the light of the visible spectrum. A camera generally consists of some kind of enclosed hollow, with an opening or aperture at one end for light to enter, and a recording or viewing surface for capturing the light at the other end. Most cameras have a lens positioned in front of the camera's opening to gather the incoming light and to focus the image (or part of the image), on the recording surface. The diameter of the aperture is often controlled by a diaphragm mechanism, but some cameras have a fixed-size aperture.

[[W:Digital_camera|Digital cameras]] use electronics, usually a charge coupled device ([[w:Charge-coupled_device|CCD]]) or sometimes a Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor ([[w:CMOS|CMOS]]) sensor to capture images which can be transferred or stored in computer memory inside the camera for later playback or processing.

Here are [[w:Digital_camera#Methods_of_image_capture|more technical details]] on how the image is captured.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===b. The effect of light on an image sensor. ===
[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|200px|The Bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor]]
[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor profile.svg|thumb|200px|Profile/cross-section of sensor]]
''Also look at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor''

An ''image sensor'' is a device that converts a visual image to an electric signal. It is used in digital cameras (as well as other imaging devices). It is usually an array of charge-coupled devices (CCD) or CMOS sensors such as active pixel sensors.

There are several main types of color image sensors, differing by the means of the color separation mechanism:

* Bayer sensor, low-cost and most common, using a Bayer filter that passes red, green, or blue light to selected pixels, forming interlaced grids sensitive to red, green, and blue. The image is then interpolated using a demosaicing algorithm.

* Foveon X3 sensor, using an array of layered sensors where every pixel contains three stacked sensors sensitive to the individual colors.

* 3CCD, using three discrete image sensors, with the color separation done by a dichroic prism. Considered the best quality, and generally more expensive than single-CCD sensors.

====[[W:Bayer_filter|Bayer Filter]]====
A '''Bayer filter''' mosaic is a color filter array (CFA) for arranging RGB color filters on a square grid of photosensors. The word comes from the name of its inventor, '''Dr. Bryce E. Bayer''' of Eastman Kodak, and describes an arrangement of color filters used in most single-chip digital image sensors used in digital cameras, camcorders, and scanners to create a color image. The filter pattern is 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue, and is also called '''RGBG''' or '''GRGB'''.

Bryce Bayer's patent called the green photosensors ''luminance-sensitive elements'' and the red and blue ones ''chrominance-sensitive elements''.  He used twice as many green elements as red or blue to mimic the human eye's greater resolving power with green light.  These elements are referred to as ''sensor elements'', ''pixel sensors'', or simply ''pixels''.

The raw output of Bayer-filter cameras is referred to as a ''Bayer pattern'' image. Since each pixel is filtered to record only one of three colors, two-thirds of the color data is missing from each. To obtain a full-color image, the red, green, and blue values are combined for each point.

Different algorithms for combining the three colors require various amounts of computing power and result in varying-quality final images.  This can be done in-camera, producing a JPEG or TIFF image, or outside the camera using the raw data directly from the sensor.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
And became these:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades bayer r.png|Red
Image:Shades bayer g.png|Green
Image:Shades bayer b.png|Blue
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===c. How color images are created from the BW image the sensor captures. ===
To reconstruct a color image from the data collected by the color filtering array, you need to fill in the blanks. The mathematics here is subject to individual implementation, and is called [[W:Demosaicing|demosaicing]]. If you have a RAW image, you can use different [[W:Demosaicing|demosaicing]] than what is built into the camera, often yielding higher quality.


A digital camera has certain circuits to reconstruct the whole image using above information. It takes these:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades bayer r.png|Red
Image:Shades bayer g.png|Green
Image:Shades bayer b.png|Blue
&lt;/gallery&gt;
and makes this:
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Shades_framed_aa.jpg|''Notice it is not quite the same as this Original''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===d. What the camera lens does; what focal length means. ===
[[Image:Lens Nikkor 18-70mm.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camera Lens]]
====Camera Lens====
A [[W:Camera_lens|camera lens]] usually has an aperture adjustment mechanism to control the amount of light that may pass. It also has a shutter, to control the length of time during which light may pass through the lens.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
====Focal Length====
[[Image:Focal-length.png|thumb|right|100px|Focal Length]]
The focal length is a measure of how strongly it converges (focuses) or diverges light. A shorter focal length has greater optical power than one with a long focal length.

In the photos below, the camera did not move, but the camera lens was changed as noted.

* When a lens with a shorter focal length is used, there is a wider [[W:Angle_of_view|angle of view]].
* When a lens with a longer focal length is used, there is a narrower [[W:Angle_of_view|angle of view]].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==2. How are lens aperture and depth of field related? ==
[[Image:DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of Depth of Field]]
The [[W:aperture|aperture]] stop is an extremely important element in most optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the amount of light that can reach the image plane. This can either be undesired, as in a telescope where one wants to collect as much light as possible; or deliberate, to prevent saturation of a detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the aperture stop is constrained by things other than the amount of light admitted, however:
*The size of the stop is one factor that affects [[W:depth of field|depth of field]]. Smaller stops produce a longer depth of field, allowing objects at a wide range of distances to all be in focus at the same time.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==3. Describe pixels, image resolution, and image size. ==
[[Image:ReconstructionsFromPixels.png|right|frame|A pixel is not a little square.  This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering.]]

A pixel is generally thought of as the smallest complete sample of an image. The definition is highly context sensitive; for example, we can speak of printed pixels in a page, or pixels carried by electronic signals, or represented by digital values, or pixels on a display device, or pixels in a digital camera (photosensor elements). This list is not exhaustive, and depending on context there are several synonyms that are accurate in particular contexts, e.g. pel, sample, byte, bit, dot, spot, etc. We can also speak of pixels in the abstract, or as a unit of measure, in particular when using pixels as a measure of resolution, e.g. 2400 pixels per inch, 640 pixels per line, or spaced 10 pixels apart. 

The measures [[W:dots per inch|dots per inch]] (dpi) and [[W:pixels per inch|pixels per inch]] (ppi) are sometimes used interchangeably, but have distinct meanings especially in the printer field, where dpi is a measure of the printer's resolution of dot printing (e.g. ink droplet density).  For example, a high-quality inkjet image may be printed with 200 ppi on a 720 dpi printer.

The more pixels used to represent an image, the closer the result can resemble the original.  The number of pixels in an image is sometimes called the [[W:image resolution|resolution]], though resolution has a more specific definition.  Pixel counts can be expressed as a single number, as in a &quot;three-megapixel&quot; [[W:digital camera|digital camera]], which has a nominal three million pixels, or as a pair of numbers, as in a &quot;640 by 480 display&quot;, which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to bottom (as in a [[W:VGA|VGA]] display), and therefore has a total number of 640 × 480 = 307,200 pixels or 0.3 megapixels.  

The pixels, or color samples, that form a digitized image (such as a [[W:JPEG|JPEG]] file used on a web page) may or may not be in one-to-one correspondence with [[W:screen pixesl|screen pixel]]s, depending on how a computer displays an image. 

In computing, an image composed of pixels is known as a ''[[W:bitmap|bitmapped image]]'' or a ''[[W:raster graphics|raster image]]''.  The word ''raster'' originates from [[W:halftone|halftone]] printing technology, and has been widely used to describe [[W:raster scan|television scanning]] patterns.

==4. What are the two types of image compression? ==
There are many image compression algorithms, but they can all be neatly divided into one of two types: '''lossless''' and '''lossy'''.  
===Lossless Compression===
In lossless compression, when the image is restored from the compressed format, it is an ''exact binary match'' to the original.  Every bit is exactly the same as in the original.  Examples of lossless image compression file formats include:

*[[w:Adaptive Binary Optimization|ABO]] - Adaptive Binary Optimization
*[[W:GIF|GIF]] - (lossless, but contains a very limited number color range)
*[[W:JBIG2|JBIG2]] - (lossless or lossy compression of B&amp;W images)
*[[W:JPEG-LS|JPEG-LS]] - (lossless/near-lossless compression standard)
*[[W:JPEG 2000|JPEG 2000]] - (includes lossless compression method, as proven by Sunil Kumar, Prof San Diego State University)
*[[W:PNG|PNG]] - Portable Network Graphics
*[[W:TIFF|TIFF]] - Tagged Image File Format
*[[W:WMPhoto|WMPhoto]] - (includes lossless compression method)

===Lossy Compression===
With lossy compression, the uncompressed image is ''not'' exactly the same, but it can be very difficult to tell the difference with the naked eye.  By permanently throwing away some of the information in the image, the file can be made much smaller.

* [[W:Fractal compression|Fractal compression]]
* [[W:JPEG|JPEG]] &lt;u&gt;J&lt;/u&gt;oint &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;hotographics &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;xpert &lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt;roup
* [[W:JPEG 2000|JPEG 2000]], JPEG's successor format that uses wavelets.
* [[w:Wavelet compression|Wavelet compression]]
* [[w:JBIG2|JBIG2]]
* [[w:Cartesian Perceptual Compression|Cartesian Perceptual Compression]]: Also known as CPC
* [[w:DjVu|DjVu]]
* [[w:ICER|ICER]], used by the Mars Rovers: related to [[w:JPEG 2000|JPEG 2000]] in its use of wavelets
* [[W:Hold-and-Modify|HAM]], hardware compression of color information used in [[W:Amiga|Amiga]] computers

==5. Name and describe three types of image formats. ==

=== Major graphic file formats ===

There are many graphic file formats, if we include the proprietary types. The PNG, JPEG, and GIF formats are most often used to display images on the Internet.  These graphic formats are listed and briefly described below, separated into the two main families of graphics: raster and vector.

=== Raster formats ===

For a description of the technology aside from the format, see [[W:Raster graphics|Raster graphics]]. 

===== JPEG =====
'''The [[W:JPEG|JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group)''' image files are a  lossy format. The [[W:DOS|DOS]] [[W:filename extension|filename extension]] is ''JPG'', although other [[W:operating system|operating system]]s may use ''JPEG''.  Nearly all digital cameras have the option to save images in JPEG format. The JPEG format supports 8-bit per color - red, green, and blue, for 24-bit total - and produces relatively small file sizes.  Fortunately, the compression in most cases does not detract noticeably from the image.  But JPEG files do suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved.  Photographic images are best stored in a lossless non-JPEG format if they will be re-edited in future, or if the presence of small &quot;artifacts&quot; (blemishes), due to the nature of the JPEG compression algorithm, is unacceptable. JPEG is also used as the image compression algorithm in many Adobe PDF files.

===== TIFF =====
'''The [[W:TIFF|TIFF]] (Tagged Image File Format)''' is a flexible image format that normally saves 16-bit per color - red, green and blue for a total of 48-bits - or 8-bit per color - red, green and blue for a total of 24-bits - and uses a filename extension of ''TIFF'' or ''TIF''. TIFF's flexibility is both a feature and a curse, with no single reader capable of handling all the different varieties of TIFF files. TIFF can be lossy or lossless. Some types of TIFF offer relatively good lossless compression for [[W:bi-level image|bi-level (black and white, no grey) images]]. Some high-end digital cameras have the option to save images in the TIFF format, using the [[W:LZW|LZW]] compression algorithm for lossless storage. The TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browsers, and should not be used on the World Wide Web. TIFF is still widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the  printing industry. TIFF is capable of handling device-specific color spaces, such as the CMYK defined by a particular set of printing press inks.

===== RAW =====
'''The [[W:RAW image format|RAW image format]]''' is a file option available on some digital cameras.  It usually uses a lossless compression and produces file sizes much smaller than the TIFF format. Unfortunately, the RAW format is not standard among all camera manufacturers and some graphic programs and image editors may not accept the RAW format.  The better graphic editors can read some manufacturer's RAW formats, and some (mostly higher-end) digital cameras also support saving images in the TIFF format directly.  
Adobe's [[W:Digital Negative (file format)|Digital Negative Specification]] is a recent (September 2004) attempt at standardizing the various &quot;raw&quot; file formats used by digital cameras.

===== PNG =====
'''The [[W:PNG|PNG]] (Portable Network Graphics)''' file format is regarded, and was made as, the free and open-source successor to the GIF file format. The PNG file format supports true color (16 million colors) whereas the GIF file format only allows 256 colors. PNG excels when the image has large areas of uniform color. The lossless PNG format is best suited for editing pictures, and the lossy formats like JPG are best for final distribution of photographic-type images because of smaller file size. [[W:Comparison of web browsers#Image format support|Many older browsers]] do not yet support the PNG file format, however with the release of [[W:Internet Explorer 7|Internet Explorer 7]] all popular modern browsers fully support PNG. The [[W:Adam7 algorithm|Adam7]]-interlacing allows an early preview even when only a small percentage of the data of the image has been transmitted.

===== GIF =====
'''[[W:GIF|GIF]] (Graphic Interchange Format) ''' is limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors. This makes the GIF format suitable for storing graphics with relatively few colors such as simple diagrams, shapes and cartoon style images. The GIF format supports animation and is still widely used to provide image animation effects.  It also uses a lossless compression that is more effective when large areas have a single color, and ineffective for detailed images or [[W:dither|dither]]ed images.

===== BMP =====
'''The [[W:Windows bitmap|BMP]] (bit mapped) format'''  is used internally in the [[W:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] operating system to handle graphics images. These files are typically not compressed resulting in large files. The main advantage of BMP files is their wide acceptance, simplicity, and use in Windows programs.  However, they may pose problems for users of other operating systems.  Commonly, BMP files are used for Microsoft's Paint program.  Since most BMP files are uncompressed, and BMP's RLE compression has serious limits, the large size of BMP files makes them unsuitable for file transfer. However, Bit Map images are suitable for background images and wallpapers. This is especially true for screen shots. In addition, images from scanners are usually stored in BMP files.

===== HDP =====
'''The [[W:Windows Media Photo|HDP]] format''' ''(formally known as '''WDP''')'' is the newly introduced image format by Microsoft for media print quality, lossless image compression.  This image standard has a specific applicability to mostly print media due to its size although it is rumored to be the standard for Microsoft Office 2007 and the brand new Windows Vista operating system.  This format is very similar to the TIFF format, but can handle a much larger range of image types and qualities such as 8, 16, and 32 bits per channel processing, N-Channel support, and embedded tiling.

===== XPM =====
'''The [[W:XPM (image format)|XPM]] format''' is the default [[W:X Window System|X Window System]] picture format (very popular in the Linux world).  Its structure is based on the string format of the [[W:C Programming Language|C programming language]].  Because XPM was designed to be human-readable, and is stored as uncompressed plain-text, the file size of these pictures can be more than twice as large as uncompressed binary bitmap files (such as BMP, uncompressed TIFF, MacOS-PICT, or Irix-RGB formats). This format is unsupported by most non-Unix software and operating systems (though many web-browsers retain display support for the [[W:XBM|XBM]] subset, which was the minimal image format in the early days of the WWW).

===== MrSID =====
'''The [[W:MrSID|MrSID]] (Multiresolution Seamless Image Database) format''' is a [[W:wavelet compression|wavelet compression]] format used mostly by [[W:Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] to store massive [[W:satellite imagery|satellite imagery]] for map software.

=== Vector formats ===
{{see also |W:Encapsulated PostScript|PDF|SWF|Windows Metafile|AutoCAD DXF|CorelDRAW CDR}}

As opposed to the [[W:raster|raster]] image formats above (where the data describes the characteristics of each individual pixel), [[W:vector graphics|vector]] image formats contain a geometric description which can be rendered smoothly at any desired display size.

Vector file formats can contain bitmap data as well. [[W:3D graphics|3D graphic]] file formats are technically vector formats with pixel data [[W:texture mapping|texture mapping]] on the surface of a vector virtual object, warped to match the angle of the viewing perspective.

At some point, all vector graphics must be rasterized in order to be displayed on digital monitors. However vector images can be displayed with analog [[W:Cathode ray tube|CRT]] technology such as that used in some [[W:electronic test equipment|electronic test equipment]], [[W:medical monitors|medical monitors]], [[W:radar|radar]] displays, [[W:Laser light show|laser shows]] and [[W:Spacewar!|early video games]]. [[W:Plotters|Plotters]] are printers that use vector data rather than pixel data to draw graphics.

===== SVG =====
'''[[W:Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics)''' is an [[W:open standard|open standard]] created and developed by the [[W:World Wide Web Consortium|World Wide Web Consortium]] to address the need (and attempts of several corporations) for a versatile, [[W:DOM scripting|scriptable]] and all-purpose vector format for the web and otherwise. The SVG format does not have a compression scheme of its own, but due to the textual nature of [[W:XM:|XML]], an SVG graphic can be compressed using a program&lt;!--/algorithm/scheme?--&gt; such as [[W:gzip|gzip]]. Because of its scripting potential, SVG is a key component in [[W:web application|web application]]s: interactive web pages that look and act like applications.

==6. Give the principal uses of photography: ==

Photography is used primarily for the following purposes:
Recording events -- whether a campout, a family picnic, or other event, photography allows us to record the people and events involved.  Later, we can &quot;remember&quot; by viewing the images/pictures.

Art appreciation -- Landscape, macro (close-up) photography, and other artistic photography allows a photographer to share their impressions of the world with friends and associates


The definition of Photography is as follows:
'''Photography'''  {{IPA|}} [fә'tɑgrәfi:],[foʊ'tɑgrәfi:]
is the process of recording pictures by means of capturing light on a light-sensitive medium, such as a film or sensor. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects expose a sensitive chemical or electronic medium during a timed exposure, usually through a photographic lens in a device known as a camera that also stores the resulting information chemically or electronically.

The word comes from the Greek words φως ''phos'' (&quot;light&quot;), and γραφίς ''graphis'' (&quot;stylus&quot;, &quot;paintbrush&quot;) or γραφή ''graphê'' (&quot;representation by means of lines&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot;), together meaning &quot;drawing with light.&quot; Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a ''photograph'', commonly shortened to ''photo''.

Photography gained the interest of  many scientists and artists from its inception. Scientists have used photography to record and study movements, such as [[W:Eadweard Muybridge|Eadweard Muybridge]]'s study of human and animal locomotion in 1887. Artists are equally interested by these aspects but also try to explore avenues other than the photo-mechanical representation of reality, such as the [[W:pictorialist|pictorialist]] movement. Military, police and security forces use photography for surveillance, recognition and data storage. Photography is used to preserve memories of favorites and as a source of entertainment.

==7. Take pictures illustrating at least eight of the following techniques. Use comparison pictures for illustration: ==
''(some of these details are copied from the Photography honor)''

===a. Framing. ===
When we use our eyes, we see the world in three dimensions. The biggest reason for this is because we have two eyes about 1 1/2&quot; apart that give us &quot;two photos&quot; that our brain then interprets as being three-dimensional--big objects are closer than small objects.

However, cameras only have one &quot;eye&quot; the lens, so we have to intentionally take pictures that are &quot;extra&quot; 3-dimensional. One way we can do this by Framing.

Framing uses some element in the photograph to act as a foreground or middle-distance frame which overlaps or highlights the main subject of your photo.

For example, if you're taking a picture of rolling hills, give your picture &quot;depth&quot; by putting a tree or fence post that is closer to you on the right or left hand side of the photograph.

Other examples of Frames include: a tree branch, rocks on a seashore, a friend or an archway.

===b. Camera Steadiness. ===
[[Image:Notsteady.png|thumb|right|200px|Notice that almost nothing is sharp because the camera was not steady when the photo was taken]]

Have you ever gotten pictures developed and all you see is a &quot;blur&quot; that was supposed to be a family member? Maybe you've taken a picture through the window of a car while its been moving. This is called camera blur and is most often caused when you're using a &quot;fancy&quot; SLR camera where the exposure setting is 1/125th of a second or slower. However, it can also happen when you don't practice good &quot;camera posture&quot; when composing your photograph.


When you're taking pictures, is very important that the camera doesn't wiggle as you take the picture! Some helpful hints for keeping this from happening are:
* Use both hands to steady the camera. One-handed picture taking is hazardous to your photographic health!
* If you're using a fancy SLR camera, be sure your exposure time is set equal to or greater than your film speed (ex. If you're using 200 speed film, have it set to 1/250, 1/500, or 1/1000). Otherwise use a table, wall or something else steady to steady yourself as you take the photo.
*Most point-and-shoot cameras have this film/exposure time ratio &quot;built-in&quot; to their cameras.
* The best way to hold a camera in a comfortable position but rigidly is to form an imaginary tripod with the camera pressed against your forehead and your elbows against your body. Take a breath, partially exhale, and gently press the shutter button.
* Be careful not to get any of your fingers or the camera cord in front of the flash or the lens!!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===c. Direction of lighting - front, side, or backlighting. ===
[[Image:Suninfront.png|thumb|right|200px|Example of sun glaring into the camera]]
Direction of lighting,
Quality of Lighting, &amp; Rule of Thirds
Quiz question (not really. . .) Should the sun be behind the subject you're photographing, beside the subject, or shining on the subject?
	
People used to think that you could only take good pictures if the sun was behind the photographer (YOU!) shining on the subject they were taking a picture. But that's not true.

For instance, if you want to take a sunset picture and want your framing subject (such as a person walking down the beach) to be a silhouette, the sun should be behind him, shining toward you (back lighting).

'''Lighting:'''

'''''Front lighting''''' is best when you want to see the details, like if you're taking a close-up of someone's face. A downfall is, that if the lights too bright, such as in the middle of the day, there might be &quot;glare&quot; in your subject.

'''''Side lighting''''' is great for bringing out shapes and textures, such as a rocky mountain cliff or tree bark.

'''''Back lighting''''' is lighting from behind the subject, tends to hide the subject, forming a silhouette. Some good places to use back lighting are a camporee flagpole at sunset, a cow/horse grazing at sunset, or a playground after everyone has gone home for the evening.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===d. Quality of light - shade, sunlight, and time of day. ===
*The best light conditions are 1 1/2 hours before sunset or the first hour after sunrise. The reason is that the light isn't SO BRIGHT that it washes out the colors in your picture, but at the same time the shadows are long (which makes side lighting pictures look extra special). Also, the sunset or sunrise gives off a kind of &quot;pink&quot; or &quot;orange&quot; light, which makes many nature pictures look very friendly &amp; special. If you want to know when sunrise and sunset are going to be, check out www.adventist.org's sunset calendar!
*Be careful of evening shadows when photographing people. long shadows on faces hide features and expressions!
*Pictures taken during the middle of the day will be &quot;stark&quot; with hard lines and minimal shadows. Buildings &amp; some landscapes such as mountains look especially regal or majestic during the middle of the day. Just remember that if you take a picture during the middle of the day, shade the top of the lens of your camera by placing one of your hands or a piece of paper horizontal about 2&quot; above the lens to form a &quot;shade for the lens. This will keep pink &amp; blue &quot;sparks&quot; from showing up on your photos.
*When there is no sunshine (on a rainy day) don't give up on taking pictures! Zoom in close on flowers and other colorful objects. The color will be extra deep since its not being &quot;washed out&quot; by the sun. Fog which often accompanies soft rain also makes a very nice soft hazy look. Just be sure to protect you lens from specks of rain!

===e. Rule of thirds. ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Meraner Berge.jpg|A photo divided into thirds
Image:PicoParana2006-3.jpg|Sky taking top two-thirds
Image:PicoParana2006-2.jpg|Sky taking top one-third
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A Picture looks best when you imagine a tic-tac-toe board on top of your picture you're going to take. Remember that we're wanting a photo to look 3 dimensional! Part of that is arranging it in combination with &quot;Framing&quot; and &quot;Leading Lines&quot; techniques, but putting objects in &quot;3rds&quot; on the photo.
	
For example: In a mountain scene the landscape in the bottom screen--maybe even a tree or rock to help it look &quot;more 3-D&quot;-- the mountains in the middle 3rd, and the sky in the top third.

Another Illustration: If you're taking a picture of a landscape with puffy clouds, take one picture where 2/3 of the picture is composed of the clouds and the landscape fills the bottom 1/3. Then try with 1/3 clouds and 2/3 landscape. Notice how different this same landscape looks with the &quot;3rds&quot; changed from top to bottom!

===f. Angle - eye level, high, and low level. ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:WashingtonDC Obelisk.jpg|Eye level example
Image:WashMonument WhiteHouse.jpg|High level example (looking down)
Image:98050934 Frankfurt Low Level.jpg|Low level example (looking up)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Subjects look different depending on where you are in relation to them when you take the picture.

You'll need three photos for this requirement, though they don't have to be of the same object. A High-angle, Mid-angle, and Low-angle photograph.

'''''High angle means:''''' looking down on your subject

'''''Mid-angle means:''''' looking at your subject straight on.

'''''Low-angle means:''''' looking up at your subject

For this requirement, take a subject, such as some tall straight trees, and take a picture looking straight at them, then another one by laying on the ground looking up through the trees. Did the angle make a difference?

===g. Level horizon. ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:CaiMonVillage.jpg|Example of not level horizon
Image:CaiMonVillage-autolevel.jpg|Example of level horizon
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===h. Distance from subject - fill the frame. ===
Have you ever taken a picture of a beautiful flower or some animals but when the photo came back, you had to explain to friends &quot;that dot is a pretty rose,&quot; and &quot;that dot over there is a buffalo.&quot;?


Filling the frame is all about making your subject (what you're taking a picture of) fill up most of the picture frame. This means standing closer to the subject than you're ordinarily used to doing and making sure there's not a lot of &quot;green space&quot; around your subject. 	


'''Some ideas for Pathfinders:'''
*Take a picture of your whole youth group. Be sure there are some standing and some standing/sitting in front of them. Then, get close enough so that there is almost NO &quot;background green space&quot; around them. You'll be impressed with how nice it is to have a photo that shows the expressions on everybody's face.

*Take a picture of your best friend while they're eating at a campout or lockin. Don't try to take a picture of the whole room, but zoom in on their upper body and the top of the table with the plate of food. You'll both laugh when you see the photo that shows how shocked your friend was at your &quot;surprise&quot; picture.

===i. Use of leading lines. ===
[[Image:Washington March15 2003-01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The path leads you to the monument]]
Leading lines are anything in a photograph that will help lead your eyes towards the main subject. For example, do you want people eyes to travel &quot;down the road into the sunset, just like the bus is doing? Or, do you want people to see the big cafeteria on the hill where you and your fellow pathfinders ate all weekend?

Leading Lines also help your photograph's &quot;depth.&quot; If your eyes are able to wander into the picture, then your brain will think the picture looks more real, like the real 3-D world we live in.

'''Ideas for Pathfinders:'''

* Roads: take a picture of a windy road that leads to nowwhere; The road that leads to camporee or the road into the campsite you're staying at this weekend may also be a good leading line.
* Trails
* Fence Posts / Fence lines
* Tall buildings or tall trees. Take pictures straight up, and use those tall lines to guide your eyes to a Mountain peak, or to the sun / moon shining overhead.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===j. Correct exposure - underexposed, overexposed, and correctly exposed. ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Underexposed.png|Example of Underexposed photo
Image:Sizilien Autobahn A29DIR.jpg|Example of Overexposed photo
Image:798px-Sizilien Autobahn A29DIR-autofixed.jpg|Autofixed photo
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===k. Use of flash - proper distance and reflective objects. ===
[[Image:Hanimd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Example of how the reflection of the flash can disrupt the photo]]
Most flashes should be used no closer to a subject than 6 feet. and more than 20 feet away. Any closer and it will &quot;wash out&quot; your subject, (depending on flash), and any farther away, the light won't even reach.  For example: Have you ever seen people use a flash at a football game, or in a large stadium in hopes of getting photos of the people on the field? The flash won't help because its too far away!

Don't try to use a flash when there is a reflective object directly in front of the lens. For example, a mirror or window behind your friends, or the fishtank glass between you and that shark at SeaWorld. Move off to the side diagonally a little, so that the light, when it flashes off the reflective object, won't bounce directly back to your lens, but instead will bounce into empty space beside you!

Use the flash to fill in shadows. If your subject has side-lighting erasing the features on its face that you want to capture on film, use the flash to erase the shadows. BE SURE you're far enough away, or the whol picture will be blotted out!

'''Some ideas for Pathfinders:'''

*  Try using a flash when your friends are in a dark cave or room. Arrange them 6 feet away from your camera, then take 2 pictures. One with a flash and one without. Notice the difference. Now take one with your friend(s) only 3 feet away. What happened?

*  At your next campout, just before sunset grab some friends and have them stand in front of camp, with the sunlight coming from one side, casting shadows on their faces. Take 2 pictures. One with fill-in flash, and one without. What was the difference?
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==8. Learn how to place photos in PowerPoint. Create a PowerPoint presentation showing the pictures you took using the above techniques. ==

Generally speaking, depending on your version of the presentation software, you follow the menu path: ''Insert'' -&gt; ''Picture'' -&gt; ''From File'', and navigate to the picture you want to place. After that, you can right click on the picture, and select ''Format Picture'' and do some changes.

Do not feel constrained to using PowerPoint.  You can download OpenOffice for free from http://www.openoffice.org and use the ''Impress'' package that comes with it.  ''Impress'' can generate slides that PowerPoint can read.  OpenOffice is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and other operating systems.

==9. Using a photo editing program on a computer, show ability to crop, color correct, sharpen, and adjust brightness/contrast to photos. ==
Most modern photo editing software allows you to accomplish these tasks simply and quickly.  Adobe's Photoshop is probably the best known photo editing package, but you may wish to experiment with [http://gimp.org The Gimp].  It can be downloaded for free and runs under Windows, Mac, and Linux.

==10. Complete at least three creative photographic projects in a photo editing program; such as a CD cover, a photo scrapbook page, a collage, etc. ==
==11. Have a basic understanding of file organization techniques. ==
[[W:file|File]] - A '''computer file''' is a block of arbitrary information, or resource for storing information, tdkasfljd;sankejvwinoeutnakjf;eniowvaupondjirnejakvdlsjadm,nejioawjnvdkja;fkjdaases just a sequence of binary digits. At a higher level, where the content of the file is being considered, these binary digits may represent [[integer]] values or [[Character (computing)|text character]]s, or anything else. It is up to the program using the file to understand the meaning and internal layout of information in the file and present it to a user as a document, image, song, or program.

[[W:organization|Organization]] - An '''organization''' is a social arrangement which pursues collective goals, which controls its own performance, and which has a boundary separating it from its environment.  The word itself is derived from the Greek word ''ὄργανον'' (organon) meaning ''tool''. The term is used in both daily and scientific English in multiple ways.

Put together, '''file organization''' asks that you understand how to organize files on your computer, on the bookshelf, etc. Do you place the files in some sort of established order? Alphabetically, by date? by subject?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Notes ==
The Digital Photography honor was introduced by the NAD in 2006. (See http://www.pathfindersonline.org/html/honors/new_honors.htm )  The requirements first appeared on AdventSource at http://adventsource.org/efile.aspx?ID=35141 - but the PDF indicates three things that are either incorrect or at least suspicious:
# That it's a GC honor (it's from the NAD - though the GC may have adopted it).
# That it is part of the 2001 edition (it's 2006)
# That it belongs in the Vocational series.  

Because the first two items are almost certainly wrong, I am suspicious of the third.  For now I don't mind letting the header say that it's vocational, but I do not want to move the honor there until we have better information (such as the color of the patch - red = Vocational, light blue = Arts and Crafts).

-- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 03:49, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

:The link at http://www.pathfindersonline.org/html/honors/new_honors.htm indicates that this honor  is skill level 2 and that it is indeed in the Arts and Crafts category.  I tend to believe that more than the PDF at AdventSource, so I'm going with it.

: -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 04:05, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

== Requirement Numbering ==

Ugh!  http://www.pathfindersonline.org/pdf/ayhonors/international/digital_photography.pdf and the PDF at AdventSource number the requirements differently.  I have changed them to reflect the former's method, since I believe it to be more accurate. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 04:23, 3 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This step intends to separate the objects to track from the background. The background will become black, while the objects to track will appear in white. Most of the time, this step follows a preprocessing method like background subtraction.

== Input ==
[[File:SwisTrack BackgroundSubtractionGray.jpg]]

A grayscale image.

== Output ==
[[File:SwisTrack Threshold.png]]

A binary (black and white) image.

== Parameters ==

=== Threshold ===
A threshold value (between 0 and 256). If the objects to track don't appear in the image, try to reduce the value. If parts of the background become white, the value need to be increased.

=== Invert threshold ===
Whether the threshold must be inverted or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Nubian goat''' is of African and Asian origin. They are most commonly known for their 'Roman nose'. They have pendulous ears, have very high butterfat in their milk, and are the 'talkative' breed of all other breeds of goats. There are currently 7 dairy goat breeds. [[../Alpine/]], [[../LaMancha/]], [[../Nigerian Dwarf/]], Nubian, [[../Oberhasli/]], [[../Saanen/]] and [[../Toggenburg/]]. These are the dairy breeds - bred for milking. Boers are meat goats -  bred for meat.

==Anglo-Nubian==
[[Image:Nubiangoat.png|right|thumb|2 week old Nubian kid.]]
[[Image:Collingwood Children's Farm - goats.JPG|thumb|right|Adult goats at a children's farm.]]
The Anglo-Nubian breed originated in England as a cross between the Old English Milch Goat and the Zariby and Nubian bucks imported from India, Russia, and Egypt. They have been exported to most countries from England and are sometimes referred to as &quot;Nubians&quot; instead of the proper title of &quot;Anglo-Nubian&quot;

===History===
The '''Anglo-Nubian goat''' is a goat that originated in England.

===Breed characteristics===
It is large in size and carries more flesh than other dairy breeds. The Nubian breed standard specifies large size, markings can be any color, the ears are long, pendulous, and the nose is Roman. The Nubian temperament is sociable, outgoing, and vocal. Because of its elongated ears and sleek body, the Nubian is occasionally nicknamed the &quot;Lop-Eared Goat&quot; or &quot;Greyhound Goat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowinghillsfarm.com/nubiangoats.htm] Crowing Hill Farm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===
The Nubian's size makes it a very useful dual purpose animal. The Nubian breed leads the way for the dairy breeds in butterfat production: it produces on average, 5% or more butterfat content. This is surpassed only by the [[../Nigerian Dwarf/]], [[../Pygmy goat/]] and [[../Boer goat/]] breeds, which are less likely to be used for large scale milk production, as for a dairy or cheese making. Because of the higher fat content, the Nubian milk has a better flavor than lower fat milks. Milk production is lower than the [[../Saanen/]] and [[../Alpine/]] breeds. i edited it and i love cholchate dklsjfkldsjfkldsjfklasdklfsdklfsdkluklsdjfweriotjertueriotldfk,.xcmb,.cvbm,nfm,gnerkjto34iu5iowetklg,.cvbcv,.dfkljtutoiru6oiu6o5u6iou6io6u56iou75689795-03495-0485rkljlkjkkkkfdkljlreuito4u69058690348554u65jltyjuylfgjhlgjhu5690786kltjyklfghfg jfdsklfjdsklfjklufl;sjfksdjfklsdjfdklsfjdlksfjweiojweiortjweoruo &lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♀♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂±±±±±±±±±±♂±♀≡♂&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

==Nubian (Americas)==
Nubians are the most popular breed in the United States.

===History===

===Breed standard===

The [http://www.ADGA.org American Dairy Goat Association] calls for the Nubian goat breed standards to as:

The Nubian is a relatively large, proud, and graceful dairy goat of mixed Asian, African, and European origin, known for high quality, high butterfat, milk production.

The head is the distinctive breed characteristic, with the facial profile between the eyes and the muzzle being strongly convex (Roman nose). The ears are long (extending at least one inch (2.54 cm) beyond the muzzle when held flat along the face), wide and pendulous. They lie close to the head at the temple and flare slightly out and well forward at the rounded tip, forming a &quot;bell&quot; shape. The ears are not thick, with the cartilage well defined. The hair is short, fine and glossy.

Any color or colors, solid or patterned, is acceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This component subtracts a background image from the input image. If the camera is fixed, only the objects added to the scene remain after this subtraction. However, lighting condition variations or camera noise can also produce differences between the two images. Subtracting average intensities of the two images makes the system more robust towards changing lighting conditions.

Most of the time, a [[SwisTrack/Components/ThresholdColorCommon|threshold]] is applied after this method, to separate the background from the tracked objects.

A color image.

== Parameters ==
=== Correct Mean ===
Specify whether to correct the average intensity value of the input image with the average intensity value of the background image. This option makes the tracking less sensible to lighting conditions variations.

=== Background Image===
Path to the background color image file. The background image must be a picture of the arena without the object to track.

{{SideBox|For more information about FPGAs, Verilog and VHDL, see [[Programmable Logic]].}}

'''Field-Programmable Gate Arrays''' (FPGA) are programmable logic elements. FPGAs can be designed using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL, and that design can be mapped to a hardware design by the HDL synthesizer. FPGAs are the successors of their previous similar components, PLAs and PALs, used at the first steps of the programmable logic era.

FPGAs are quick to design, and because they are reprogrammable, troubleshooting is quick and easy. 

FPGAs are useful for designing microcontrollers, which is why we have discussed HDL implementations of various components in the text of this book. In this chapter we will will discuss the implementation of a microcontroller in HDL, and some of the consequences of that implementation.

Dozens of FPGA CPU designs are available for download and tinkering.
An appendix to this book, [[Microprocessor Design/Resources]], lists details on how to get them.</text>

== Description ==
This component subtracts a background image from the input image. If the camera is fixed, only the objects added to the scene remain after this subtraction. However, light condition varations or the camera noise can also produce differences between the two images. Subtracting the average intensity of the two images makes the system more robust to changing light conditions.

Most of the time, a threshold is applied after this method.

== Input ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_GrayImage.jpg]]

A grayscale image.

== Output ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_BackgroundSubtractionGray.jpg]]

A grayscale image.

== Parameters ==

=== Background Image ===
Path to the background image file (grayscale). The background image must be a picture of the arena without the object to track.

[[Image:SwisTrack_GrayBackground.jpg]]

=== Mode ===
The subtraction mode:
* &lt;i&gt;Abs(I - B)&lt;/i&gt; calculates the absolute difference between the input image and the background image. If an object has moved between the background image and the input image, this object will appear twice (indistinguishable) on the resulting image.
* &lt;i&gt;Truncate(I - B, 0..255)&lt;/i&gt; subtracts the background image from the input image and sets all negative values to zero. Hence, objects that have moved between the background image and the input image will only appear once.
* &lt;i&gt;Truncate(B - I, 0..255)&lt;/i&gt; is similar, but subtracts the input image from the background.

=== Correct Mean ===
Specifies whether to correct the average intensity value of the input image with the average intensity value of the background image. This option makes the tracking less sensitive to varying light conditions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This component subtract the background image from the input image. If the camera is fixed, only the objects added to the scene remain after this subtraction. However, lighting condition variations or the camera noise can also produce a difference between the two images. Subtracting average intensity of the two images makes the system less sensible to lighting conditions.

Method doesn't need a background image as it approximate the background from the prior frames. However the moving objects tend to let a trail behind them.

Most of the time, a threshold is applied after this method, to separate the background from the tracked objects.

== Input ==
[[File:SwisTrack ColorImage.jpg]]

A color image.

== Output ==
[[File:Swistrack AdaptiveBackgroundSubtractionColor.jpg]]

A color image.

== Parameters ==

=== Correct mean ===
Specify whether to correct the average intensity value of the input image with the average intensity value of the background image. This option makes the tracking less sensible to lighting conditions variations.

=== Update proportion ===
The background image is continuously update with the update image following the following equation:
 
&lt;math&gt;backgroundImage_{t}=backgroundImage_{t-1} \cdot (1-updateProportion) + inputImage_t \cdot updateProportion&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, increasing the proportion makes the update of the background more reactive, but will remove object moving slowly.

This component subtracts a background image from the input image. If the camera is fixed, only the objects added to the scene remain after this subtraction. However, changing light condition or camera noise can also produce a difference between the two images. Subtracting the average intensity of the two images makes the system more robust towards changing light conditions.

This method doesn't need a background image file, as it approximates the background from the prior frames. However, depending on the configuration, moving objects tend to leave a trail behind them, or disappear if they stay too long at the same place.

Optionally, this component allows you to take the current image as background image, simply by clicking on a button. This comes in handy if you are changing your experimental setup in an ad hoc fashion (but not during one experiment), and avoid the overhead of saving the background image to a file. In this case, it is advised to set the update rate to zero.

Most of the time, a threshold is applied after this method, to separate the background from the tracked objects.

== Input ==
[[File:SwisTrack GrayImage.jpg]]

A grayscale image.

== Output ==
[[File:SwisTrack AdaptiveBackgroundSubtractionGray.jpg]]

A grayscale image.

== Parameters ==

=== Correct mean ===
Specifies whether to correct the average intensity value of the input image with the average intensity value of the background image. This option makes the tracking less sensitive to varying light conditions.

=== Mode ===
The subtraction mode:
* &lt;i&gt;Abs(I - B)&lt;/i&gt; calculates the absolute difference between the input image and the background image. This will cause moving objects to leave a trail behind them.
* &lt;i&gt;Truncate(I - B, 0..255)&lt;/i&gt; subtracts the background image from the input image and sets all negative values to zero. This will cause bright moving objects to slightly fade out towards where they are coming from. Dark moving objects will not be visible, but their trail will.
* &lt;i&gt;Truncate(B - I, 0..255)&lt;/i&gt; is similar, but subtracts the input image from the background. This inverts the behavior for bright and dark moving objects.

=== Update rate ===
The background image is continuously updated with the update image following the following equation:
 
&lt;math&gt;backgroundImage_t=backgroundImage_{t-1} \cdot (1-updateRate) + inputImage_t \cdot updateRate&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, increasing the proportion makes the update of the background more reactive, but will remove object moving slowly.

=== Reset background image ===
Takes the next frame as background image, i.e.

&lt;math&gt;backgroundImage_t=inputImage_t&lt;/math&gt;

instead of updating it. This is useful if you changed the environment significantly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This component subtracts the background image from the input image. However, this subtraction is done in the [[w:HSV color space|HSV]] space, using only the first channel (Hue).

If the camera is fixed, only the objects added to the scene remain after this subtraction. However, lighting condition variations or the camera noise can also produce a difference between the two images. As we do the subtraction in the Hue channel, light intensity has nearly no influence on the result as we are comparing the color. However, if there is color like white, gray or black, the tracking is really bad as those color are not well defined in the hue band. A small change can make them go from the pure red to the pure blue. Moreover, destructive data compression like DivX modify the color on the border of the object a lot, as we can see in the example image used here.

Most of the time, a threshold is applied after this method, to separate the background from the tracked objects.

== Input ==
[[File:SwisTrack HSVColor.jpg]]

A color image.

== Output ==
[[File:SwisTrack HSVGray.jpg]]

A grayscale image.

== Parameters ==

=== Background Image ===
Path to the background image file (color). The background image must be a picture of the arena without the object to track.

&lt;!-- Used so that each section doesn't have an edit link, only for completed chapters --&gt;
==What are Variables?==
TI-Basic is unusual among programming languages in that it does not support actual variables. Instead, all data are treated like files; there is no distinction between an ordinary number and an image, for example. TI refers to all files as &quot;variables;&quot; henceforth &quot;variable&quot; will refer to a file usable by a program.
&quot;Variables&quot; are the meat of any programming language - they are used to store and work with data. With variables, the outcomes of programs can differ depending on the user's input or the purpose of the program.  Variables in the TI calculators can store different types of data, whether it be numbers, lists of numbers, strings, mathematical functions, etc.  However, each data type has its own type of variable that it can be stored in and the rules must be followed fairly strictly.

==Storing and Recalling Variables==
Variables can be stored and recalled at the Homescreen (the startup screen), or within a program by simply using that variables name.  For example, to recall the variable X at the Homescreen, one would simply type X and hit enter (which would display 10 if X was ten):
{{bcode:FOutput|
X
              10
}}
or to recall Str1:
{{bcode:FOutput|
Str1
HELLO WORLD
}}
The format to recall any variable is the same.

To store a value to a variable, you simply state the value you are trying to store, hit the store key (the little arrow), then the variable you are storing to, and then hit enter.  For example, making X equal to 52.5 would be as follows:

{{bcode:FOutput|
52.5→X
            52.5
}}

It should be noted that 52.5 was displayed after hitting enter on the homescreen.  This is because it also recalled the value of the variable after storing it.  In programming, the variable isn't actually recalled, but rather the variable in used in some sort of equation.  See the individual examples for more help.

==Types of Basic Variables==
There are many types of variables, but in this chapter, only the most common ones will be dealt with.  The [[Programming:TI-Basic:Advanced Variables|Advanced Variables]] section, will deal with the more complex variable types and uses.  The following sections will deal with:
*Real Numbers (i.e. 52.5)
*Lists (1,2,3,4,5)
*Strings (&quot;APPLES&quot;)

----
===Real Numbers===
For convenience in this section/chapter, it should be noted that the variables 'A' through 'Z' and the variable theta are considered to be Real Number Variables.

Real number variables store both an integer and decimal part of a number.  Examples of real numbers are 0, 2.1, 5, 7.212 or 3.1415926.  Reals are accurate up to eight significant digits and can be in the range of -9e99 to 9e99 (that is 9^99).  If an attempt is tried to exceed this limit the calculator returns an error.
====Syntax====
To store a number to a Real Variable, the syntax is as follows:
{{bcode:Syntax|
''value''→''variable''
|
*Where ''value'' is a literal value, a variable, or an expression and
*Where ''variable'' is the variable to store ''value'' to
**Can be 'A' through 'Z' or theta.
***The variables are accessed by pressing the green ALPHA key, then finding the corresponding green character key on the keypad.
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
5.32→X
}}
====Ex: Variable====
{{bcode:Example|
A→X
}}
====Ex: Equation====
{{bcode:Example|
10/2+36+89/A→X
}}&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note:  In this example, if A was 89, X would be 42, not the actual equation.  Only the result of an equation is stored to X (the equation is 5+36+89/89 = 42, so X is 42)&lt;/small&gt;
----

===Lists===
For convenience in this section/chapter, all lists will be considered as Real Number Lists.

Lists are basically what they sound like - lists of numbers.  They are considered by some to be the same as an array.  They store a series of numbers which are the same datatype (for this section we will assume that it is a Real Number List).  The individual numbers of a list are named elements.

====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
{''value1'',''value2'',...,''valueN''}→''listName''
|
*Where ''value1'',''value2'' through ''valueN' are real number elements
**The number of elements (values) in a list is only limited by the memory of the calculator
**The minimum number of elements a list can contain is 0.
*Where ''listName'' is the name of a list.  This can be one of two types:
**Calculator defined:  L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6
**User defined:  a small 'L' (found via the list menu) followed by up to five characters denoting the name
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
{15,20,30}→L1
}}

====Ex: Custom Named list====
{{bcode:Example|
{1,2,3,4,5}→&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;LIST1
}}

====Ex: List to List====
{{bcode:Example|
L1→L2
}}
====Ex: Equations====
{{bcode:Example|
{15,20,30}+5→L1
}}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*Note:&lt;/nowiki&gt;  In this example, L1 would consist of {20,25,35} because each element was increased by five then stored to L1&lt;/small&gt;

----

===Strings===

====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
''string''→''strN''
|
*Where ''string'' is the string literal, or some other form of string to store to ''strN'' and
*Where ''strN'' is one of the predefined strings for the calculator.  These are Str1, Str2, Str3, Str4, Str5, Str6, Str7, Str8, Str9 and Str0
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
&quot;MY NAME IS BOB&quot;→Str1
}}
====Ex: Str to Str====
{{bcode:Example|
Str1→Str2
}}
====Ex: Combination====
{{bcode:Example|
&quot;MY NAME IS &quot;+Str1+&quot; AND YOU KNOW IT!&quot;→Str2
}}

== Description ==
This component subtracts a specific color from the input image. In the example, we were tracking the color of the shelters (red). The tracked objects in the resulting image will be black, and you can use an inverted threshold to highlight them.

To make the system more robust to varying light conditions, the average intensity value of the first input image (or the image of selection) can be subtracted from the subsequent images.

== Input ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_ColorImage.jpg]]

A color image.

== Output ==
[[Image:SwisTrack SpecificColorSubtraction.jpg]]

A color image.

== Parameters ==

=== Blue channel ===
Value of the blue channel of the color to track (0..256)

=== Green channel ===
Value of the green channel of the color to track (0..256)

=== Red channel ===
Value of the red channel of the color to track (0..256)

=== Correct Mean ===
Specify whether to correct the average intensity value of the input image with the average intensity value of the background image. This option makes the tracking less sensible to lighting conditions variations.

=== Specify the color on an image ===
Specify wheter SwisTrack open a window to select the color on the input image, or use the color defined by the three parameters above.</text>

      <comment>/* Syntax: Disp */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Disp==
{{bCommand|Disp|PRGM:I/O:3}} is a command which will display a number, string, equation or other type of variable/literal given as arguments.  &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; can accept an unlimited number of arguments seperated by commas (although it recommended to keep the number of arguments under 7 because after seven, for each consecutive argument the screen pushes everything else up passed the top of the screen), and will display each argument following the previous line.

===Syntax: Disp===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Disp [''arg''][,''arg2''][,''arg3''][,''arg4''][,…''argN'']
|
*Where ''arg'',''arg2'',''arg3'',''arg4'' and all other arguments through ''argN'' are optional parameters.  The number of arguments is only limited by the calculator memory.  The arguments can be either a literal or variable of any type, except for Pic0-Pic9 and GDB0-GDB9.
*For each argument, &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; displays the argument on the next line, starting from where the the cursor initially was located.  If the display reaches the seventh line, the display will 'scroll' the rest of the screen up so that the argument can be displayed.
**If an argument is a number, &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; displays it right-aligned 
**If an argument is a string:
***it will display it left-aligned
***if the string contains more than 16 characters string will be truncated and will display &quot;...&quot; at the end of the string
**If an argument is too long to be displayed, the argument will be truncated and three dots will be placed at the end indicating such
*If no argument is specified, the command just displays the home screen
}}

===Ex: Display Lines===
Assuming you have a homescreen like this,
{{bcode:FOutput|
5→X
               5
X+1
               6
}}
and you executed this program,
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;,52,X+1
}}
you would have the following:
{{bcode:FOutput|
               5
X+1
               6
pgrmTEMP
HELLO WORLD
              52
               6
            Done
}}
===Ex: Empty Lines===
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
}}
{{bcode:Output|


HELLO WORLD
}}
===Ex: Truncated===
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;THIS LINE IS TOO LONG FOR ONE LINE&quot;
}}
{{bcode:Output|
THIS LINE IS TO…
}}

==Pause==
{{bCommand|Pause|PRGM:8}} displays an argument, then pauses execution afterwards.
===Syntax: Pause===

{{bcode:Syntax|
:Pause [''arg'']
|
*Where ''arg'' is either a literal or variable type of any {unverified} which &lt;tt&gt;Pause&lt;/tt&gt; will display then pause execution until the enter key is pressed
**&lt;tt&gt;Pause&lt;/tt&gt; will display ''arg'' on the next line, starting from where the the cursor initially was located.  If the display reaches the seventh line, the display will 'scroll' the rest of the screen up so that the argument can be displayed
**If ''arg'' is a number, &lt;tt&gt;Pause&lt;/tt&gt; displays it right-aligned 
**If ''arg'' is a string it will display it left-aligned
**If an argument is too long to be displayed, the argument will be trunacated and three dots ('…') will be placed at the end indicating that the user can scroll left or right to view the entire argument
*If no argument is specified, the command merely pauses the execution until enter is pressed without displaying anything}}

===Ex: Hello===
{{bcode:Example|
:Pause &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
|It should be noted that the program execution would pause until enter is pressed.
}}

===Ex: Pause===
{{bcode:Example|
:Pause
|It should be noted that the program execution would pause until enter is pressed.
}}

==Output==
{{bCommand|Output|PGRM:I/O:6}} allows the display of an argument in a location other than the next line.  The item to be displayed is outputed to the specified cordinates supplied to the function.  It is useful for formatted display and it can also be used, if it is the last command of a program, to stop &quot;DONE&quot; from displaying.

===Syntax: Output()===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Output(''row'',''col'',''arg'')
|
*Where ''row'' is a number between 1 and 8 which determines the row location(vertically) ''arg'' is to be displayed.
*Where ''col'' is a number between 1 and 16 which determines the column location (horizontially) ''arg'' is to be displayed
*Where ''arg'' is the argument to be displayed.  This can be a number, string or list.
**''arg'' is displayed from left to right
**if ''arg'' is too long to fit on one line, the argument will carry over to the next, starting line at row+1,1.
***if ''arg'' continues past the last line of the calculator (row 8), ''arg'' only displays the portion that fits into the screen
}}

===Ex: Basic===
{{bcode:Example|
:Output(2,3,&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;)
}}
{{bcode:Output|

  HELLO WORLD
|HELLO WORLD is moved down one row (making it in the 2nd row) and moved right 2 times (making it in the 3rd column)
}}

===Ex: Too Long===
{{TIB:Program|TOOLONG|
:Output(1,1,&quot;THIS STRING IS TOO LONG&quot;)
|
THIS STRING IS T
OO LONG
}}

==Text()==
{{bCommand|Text|2nd:DRAW(PGRM):0}} is a command very similar to Output, except that the arguments are displayed on the graph screen rather than on the homescreen which allows a more precise location of text.  In addition, ''Text'' can accept multiple arguments and will display them one after another.  It also allows both the smaller font (by default) and the larger font (if -1 is the first argument) to display the arguments.

===Syntax: Text() Small===
This form displays the arguments in the calculator's smaller font.

{{bcode:Syntax|
Text(''row'',''col'',''arg''[,''arg2''][,''arg3''][,''arg4''][,…''argN'']
|
*Where ''row'' is the vertical displacement of the arguments
**''row'' is a number between 0 and 61, where 0 is the top of the screen, and 61 is the bottom
*Where ''col'' the horizontially displacement of the arguments
**''col'' is a number between 0 and 92, where 0 is the very left of the screen, and 92 is the right side of the screen minus one pixel (for the run cursor)
}}

===Syntax: Text() Large===
This form displays the arguments in the calculator's larger font.

{{bcode:Syntax|
Text(-1,''row'',''col'',''arg''[,''arg2''][,''arg3''][,''arg4''][,…''argN'']
|
*Where ''row'' is the vertical displacement of the arguments
**''row'' is a number between 0 and 61, where 0 is the top of the screen, and 61 is the bottom
*Where ''col'' the horizontially displacement of the arguments
**''col'' is a number between 0 and 92, where 0 is the very left of the screen, and 92 is the right side of the screen minus one pixel (for the run cursor)
}}

== Re:Lost Content ==

If I may ask, how much content was on that page that was lost? Unfortunately, because of software issues, i think that the content may be lost forever.

Wikiversity used to be a part of wikibooks. However, they spun off and became their own project at [[Wikiversity]]. All the pages that were created using &quot;Wikiversity:Page name&quot; were moved to the new server, and then they were lost on this server.

It's all a little complicated, and I can keep searching for this stuff if you want me to. I will post some messages around to see if other people may have made a copy of your material somewhere. However, and i'm sorry to have to say this, it might be faster and easier to start creating your material again from scratch. I'll look around and i'll let you know what I can find. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:23, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Okay, we have some good news. Sorry it took so long, but I dont have any control over the softare developers. All the pages with the &quot;Wikiversity:&quot; prefix have been moved so that they have the &quot;Wikiversity-&quot; prefix. I have updated the link at [[Describing Free Knowledge Communities]] to point to the correct place. I will work on updating all the other links too, if i can find them all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the effects of the home environment on learning?}}

In a recent population survey, 7.1 million students under the age of 18 lived in a neighborhood with a poverty rate of 30 percent or more [1].  This high incidence of poverty places these children at a higher rate of becoming ill, not having proper health care, becoming parents before finishing school, using illegal drugs, being exposed to or involved in violence, and going to jail before they are even old enough to vote. Children living in below average neighborhoods should be given the same opportunities as children living in average and above average housing. 

==Disadvantages Faced by Poverty-stricken Students==
A major disadvantage to students produced from living in poverty stricken neighborhoods is the possibility of growing up not able to succeed in life because they were not properly trained as children. “They are unable to work, parent, or excel in society. [1]” It is the responsibility of the authoritarians, policymakers, parents, schools, and teachers to make sure each student, despite their living arrangements, is given an equal opportunity to succeed. 

Statistics have shown that students who live in poor neighborhoods usually test lower on standardized test. The students also tend to learn less than students in average schools. In the book, “The Good--and the Not-So-Good--News About American Schools,” 13-year-old students were not on the appropriate grade level in math. These students were doing math problem on a 9-year-old’s level. 

Many other disadvantages play a part in the lack of success in children who live in low-income neighborhoods. Education is not a key factor that is stressed in the home as evidenced by the low rate of parental involvement.  In addition, children living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods have few role models to show them ways to improve their lives and break the cycle of poverty.

==Aspects for Properly Preparing Students Living in Poor Neighborhoods==
In order to make sure students living in low income neighborhoods are well prepared for life as adults, certain things are required. Basic aspects include: “greater access to supports that all families need to raise kids successfully--employment opportunities for parents, quality health care, formal and informal networks of adults who can assist in times of crisis, vibrant religious institutions, organized recreation, and safe streets. [1]” Parental opportunities, good health care, religious groups, and fun activities all make for a well rounded student, but these children need a quality education. “Education has been the vehicle for advancing the social and economic status of children and families, compensating for poverty and distressed environments, and, for millions of kids, paving the way to opportunities unavailable to their parents. [1]” Education is the catalyst for success. “Research shows that school completion and academic success increase children's ability to escape poverty, form strong families, and raise successful kids of their own. [1]” The more education one receives the greater your chances are of getting a higher paying job. 

Research from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Money Income in the United States, states that a college graduate earns twice as much money a year compared to an adult with only a high school diploma, and that same college graduate earns about three times as much as a high school dropout. Sadly, students living in these low-income neighborhoods are falling by the wayside. The chances of getting a quality education while living in poverty are very small. “If our nation is to remain prosperous and committed to equality of opportunity, we must create successful schools for poor children. [1]” 

==Contributing to Successful Students==
It is possible for students in poverty stricken neighborhoods to succeed but it requires quite a bit of dedication. “In order to contribute to kids' success in school and overall development five ideas should be demonstrated. They include: preschool experiences that prepare children to learn, schools that are small enough to engage every child, high standards in curriculum, instruction, and assessment, strong, meaningful family participation, and making education part of a larger community commitment to healthy youth and family development. “High-quality early childhood care and preschool education can stimulate cognitive development, increase school readiness, and advance academic achievement in the early elementary grades. [1]” Smaller classroom sizes promote more one on one between the student and teacher. Students are able to receive more individualized help. The teachers are also able to change the flow of instructional time if necessary; they can do what works best for the class a whole. Higher success rate also come from having “high learning standards, challenging curricula based on those standards, and instructional practices that keep kids actively engaged in learning. [1]” The definition of the word standard from the Encarta Dictionary is the level of quality or excellence attained by somebody or something. In schools standards are set so the students comprehend the seriousness and the value the school places on academic success. “States like Kentucky, Washington, and Maryland and districts like Milwaukee and Philadelphia have taken significant steps to set standards that are aligned with curriculum, instruction, and assessment practices. [1]” Parental involvement and parent-teacher interaction is also a key to the success of the students. Interaction between the teacher and parent can be as simple as a brief email or telephone call. Involvement should include knowing the latest news in the school, participating in any parent orientations and meetings, and helping and being aware of the students’ homework. 

==Other Factors That May Affect Education==
===Homelessness===
A child’s success may be dependent upon many factors that may take place in the home or the lack thereof. “According to the Year 2000 Report to Congress on the Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program, there were approximately 928,429 homeless children and youth (Pre K-12) reported in 2000, an increase of 10 percent over the last reporting year of 1997, with 65 percent of these children in Pre K-Grade 6. [3]” Students who are homeless are defined as lacking a stable, long term place to reside. “The students may be: Sharing the housing of other persons due to the loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason, 
Living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations, Living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings, Living in emergency or transitional shelters, Abandoned in hospitals, Awaiting foster care placement, Have a primary nighttime residence that is not designed for regular sleeping accommodation for humans” [3].

Homeless students are battered psychologically and emotionally and have added pressures once entering the school building. These children are presented with many obstacles to overcome in school ranging from having their homes taken away, living in a shelter, to not knowing when and where their next meal is going to come. Once in the classroom the students have a hard time focusing forcing them to become less motivated about completing school. Homeless students have a higher rate of dropping out of school entering the work force because of lack of enthusiasm and focus. Those students who chose to be homeless, because they have run away from home, experience both sexually and physical abuse. They sometimes become involved with illegal drugs and excessive alcohol use. Other factors that may be a factor that might prohibit a quality education for a homeless child may include: poor nutrition, inadequate sleep, and lack of health care.

===Family Composition===
An interview with a social worker revealed the impact home and social environment on a child’s education. In this social worker’s school, a school for children with emotional and/or learning disabilities, a number of the students reside in neighborhoods at or below poverty level. They are often times being raised by single parents or grandparents who also care for other children or relatives placing the child’s education low on the caregiver’s list of priorities. Children from these types of environments often display inappropriate behavior that negatively impacts their academic development.

A major difficulty for the teachers and social workers in this school is the lack of parental involvement. The school, according to the social worker, is at least is an hour long bus ride for the parents (most don’t own cars) which keeps many parents from visiting the school and meeting the child’s teachers. The school has often offered to fund the parents’ transportation to and from the school; however the parents face difficulties in getting time off from their jobs. Whether or not the parents’ have an interest in the child’s education, the children do not see a connection between the parent’s and their teachers resulting in lack of academic motivation and no desire to behave appropriately.

There is a fascinating article in ''The Elementary School Journal'' entitled &quot;Teachers' Reported Practices of Parent Involvement:  Problems and Possibilities,&quot; by Joyce L. Epstein and Henry Jay Becker of John Hopkins University which addresses the family and how the parental involvement affects a child's educational process.  This article is about a study of teachers in Maryland and how they feel about parent involvement.  The comments from the 3,700 teachers vary tremendously from teachers who strongly believe that their job can only be performed adequately if they can rely on parental help, and the other opposite thought from teachers who have long given up the hope of parental help.  Some of the teachers polled felt that &quot;parents have so little prime time to spend with their child or children,&quot; (Epstein, 1982) that it is very hard to cultivate a parent-teacher relationship much less a parent-teacher-child relationship.

This study/article also delves into the world of today, and how the working parents have more demands on their time and how helping kids at home becomes a more frustrating task when a parent is tired or has so many jobs to just pay the bills (Epstein, 1982).  Teachers seem to be split down the middle when it comes to deciding if it is worth their effort to try to involve parents, but the general synopsis of the study was that in the long run it is well worth the effort for the child's sake no matter what the family structure entails.  Single parents, working parents, grandparents raising their grandchildren, and all family structures should begin with the child's educational process at home and help the schools and teachers open the doors and windows into the mind of the child.  This applies to every socioeconomic structure of family, not just poverty structures.

===Drugs, Alcohol, and Abuse===
Drugs and alcohol can have a lasting affect on children.  The affects can start in fetal development and continue through life development. Having a mother that uses alcohol or drugs while she is pregnant can affect the fetus and have lasting affects on their cognitive and social development. Alcohol can cause mental retardation, slower physical development, severe learning and cognitive disabilities. A mother that uses illegal drugs, like marijuana, cocaine, etc, can also have a severe and lasting effect on the child.  They can decrease the cellular oxygen and nutrient supply for the fetus which then affects the parts of the brain responsible for learning, memory, behavior, and cognitive functions.  It can also cause language delays and attention problems. (Kaplan, 122) 

Drugs and alcohol can also effect more then just the child’s body, it also effects the environment they live in.  The drug and alcohol abuse leads to poverty, abuse, and neglect in the home.  The parents are too busy with there habits that they have little emotional involvement with the child. (Kaplan, 124-125)

Abuse is also a major problem affecting children in school and in life. Out of the three million children that are reported each year to child protective service agencies for being alleged victims of abuse and neglect, about one-third (about one million) are determined to be legitimate cases that require action (Bullough, 69).  There are three types of abuse; physical, sexual, and emotional.  Physical neglect is the most common form of child maltreatment. It is responsible for about sixty percent (60%) of all reported cases of abuse (Bullough, 57). They all have major lasting effects on the children.  All of them cause psychological problems in the child.  Abuse can cause language delays, poor social relationships with peers, lower intelligence scores, and behavioral problems. Studies show that the abused child also is more likely to experience failure in school because of all the problems abuse causes. (Kaplan, 355)
At least half of all valid cases of child abuse involve caregivers that are under alcohol or drug abuse.(Bullough, 43)

All of this can cause effects on the child’s learning.  The brain development, emotional development causes problems in school and how the child can learn.

==Conclusion==
A child’s destiny should not be determined by the neighborhood a child lives in, composition of the child’s family, or the child’s circumstances. Each and every child should be given the same equal opportunity to achieve excellence. Teachers should view every child as a child that is capable of learning. The responsibility of instilling the value of learning is placed not only on the parents, but the teachers, administrators, school board officials, and every other adult that has a part of a child’s life.

{{question-answer|question=After reading the following article how important do think parental involvement is to a child’s success in school? Do you feel that in young men a lack of male influence plays a part in the success of the student? Explain.
|answer=Parental involvement is perhaps one of the single most important factors in a child’s success in school.  As a 7th grade teacher I see students each and every day who are the product of a less than desirable home situation.  Unfortunately, these children are unable to leave that baggage at home and they bring it into the classroom.  Then when the children misbehave or fail to perform well, teachers contact parents and get little or no support.  Often times, these parents don’t want to engage, don’t want to help, and even blame the teachers for the child’s issues in school.  Just a little help from a parent really goes a long way.  And it doesn’t start when they get to school, parents need to be actively involved in their child’s education from day one-they are their child’s first teachers! 

I do feel that in many cases the lack of a male figure in a child’s life can negatively impact that child’s academic success. There are many reasons for this: many single women may not be as assertive with discipline, many single women may not have advanced knowledge in the subject matters taught in schools these days, many of these children may not have someone at home to make sure they study, and finally many of these children may be too concerned with “survival concerns” at home to focus in school.  However, if the male influences in a child’s life are not responsible, and don’t give added security, they can be equally if not more detrimental to the child. &amp;mdash;Brandy Herndon
----
Parental involvement is key in to a child’s success, not only in school but in all areas of life. This can be explained by using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. If a Child is not eating, chances are their need for safety is not being met. Likewise, if their need for safety is not being met then chances are they are lacking love. Finally, if they are not loved, they will not proceed to the next level of self-actualization where learning occurs. If a child does not have parents who support them emotional, physical, and educationally it is very unlikely that they will succeed. Parents are necessary to encourage learning and enforce discipline in the classroom. They hold the road-map to their child’s success. If the child does not have any support at home they will feel as if they do not have a chance at success in school. If they have no support at home what do they have to lose if they fail?

I absolutely feel that a lack of a male influence plays a part in the success of a student, both male and female. In our kindergarten class we had a troubled young boy who was constantly acting out. On day he was looking at my family picture which consists of seven children, yes seven, a Mom, a Dad, and a super cool black lab puppy. The person who caught his attention was my husband. He asked, “Is that the Dad?” and “Does he eat dinner with the kids?” That was such a light bulb moment for us. We realized what he was missing. I believe that every child needs a positive male influence in their lives. &amp;mdash;Brenda Kilmurray
----
I feel that parental involvement is extremely important to a child's success in the classroom.  Children not only need support and motivation from their teachers but also from their parents or guardians. In a classroom you can definitely tell if a child has support from their home environment or not.  From my experiences, often children who do not have a motivating and supporting family at home do not perform well in the classroom and usually are the trouble makers in the classroom.  I feel that parent should want to take an active role in their child's education.  The more involved a parent is in their child's educational experience the better their child will perform.

I think that the lack of a male figure in a child's life can definitely affect a child's success in the classroom, especially young boys.  A male figure can offer many attributes that a woman can not do alone.  For instance, a male figure can provide security and encouragement to a young boy that would lead to an overall feeling of achievement that their mother may not be able to provide. There are many things in life that a young boy may feel that he can only look to a male figure for guidance. &amp;mdash;Brittany Lester}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people may find it difficult to write books for children&amp;mdash;this book is designed to help the reader write high quality children's books.

== What is a good book for children? ==
A good book for children is funny, exciting and makes them laugh. A good children's book is one that children like to read!

== How to write a good book? ==

=== Brainstorming ===
In order to write a good book for little children, you must do the following:

* Use funny words.
* Do not use inappropriate language.
* Use a readable font (large enough for everyone to read).
* Write with a variety of different genres.
* Use bright colors while drawing a picture to catch the child's eye.
* Keep the reader interested in the book.
* Make sure that the theme of the story is clear and understandable so the children can relate to what is happening in the story and be interested in what happens next.
* Write about something you learned or experienced when you were in that children's age group you want to write about.
* Make the characters' characteristics interesting and clear.
* Ask children's opinions and suggestions on what you are writing.
* Make sure that the plot of the story make the children feel emotional e.g. Happy, sad, angry
* Use Different Size Fonts For Certain Age Groups
* Make sure that the pictures depict this very well
* Use peoples experiences
* Depending on your race you may have different ideas than others. Try to add that into your writing.
* Religion may also change your writing.
* Include the different aspects of the people (genre, environment, background and such)
* Include a large font for the little children to easily read the book even if he or she is far away from the book.
* A easy text for children to understand since their very little.
* A lot of pictures to keep the reader interested.
* Chapter books are not usually good for little children.
* Use a simple thought so that the child will understand and remember what has happened so far.
* Make sure there is a beginning, a middle and an end
* Use dictionaries
* Use easy pictures so children can understand
* Provide the child with at least one &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment
* Use some children's interests 
* Don't write about violence or it will influence the children badly
* Write a catchy title

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{A Beginner's Guide to D}}
{{A Beginner's Guide to D/Skim CXJ}}

One of the simplest kinds of loops in D is the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop.  This loop will keep looping as long as its condition is true.  This also makes the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop very flexible -- virtually any kind of loop can be written as a &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop, if you try hard enough.  
A &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
while(condition)
{
	//code goes here
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop will see if the condition is true, and if it is, it'll run the code inside it.  It'll keep doing that until the condition is false.

As was shown in the last section, the &lt;tt&gt;foreach&lt;/tt&gt; loop is useful for looping over the contents of some kind of container.  But what about when you don't know how much data you have, such as when you're reading from a file?  A &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop can help in this case.

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;
import std.stream;

void main()
{
	char[][] names;
	File input = new File(&quot;names.txt&quot;);
	
	while(input.eof() == false)
		names ~= input.readLine();
		
	writefln(&quot;Read &quot;, names.length, &quot; names.&quot;);

	foreach(name; names)
		writefln(name);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

So here we create an array of strings named &lt;tt&gt;names&lt;/tt&gt; to hold a list of names we'll read in from a file.  Then we create a &lt;tt&gt;File&lt;/tt&gt; object.  Remember in the [[A_Beginner%27s_Guide_to_D/The_Basics/Basic_Input | Basic Input]] section, where we used &lt;tt&gt;din&lt;/tt&gt; to read a line of text from the console?  &lt;tt&gt;din&lt;/tt&gt; is really a kind of &lt;tt&gt;File&lt;/tt&gt; object, so we're doing the same thing here, except we're reading from a file on disk instead of from the user.  

The important thing here is the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop.  Let's have a closer look at it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
while(input.eof() == false)
	names ~= input.readLine();
&lt;/source&gt;

The condition is &lt;tt&gt;input.eof() == false&lt;/tt&gt;.  The &lt;tt&gt;.eof()&lt;/tt&gt; method of &lt;tt&gt;File&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;end of file.&quot;  So we're going to use this loop to read data while we're not at the end of the file.  In other words, we're going to read all the data out of the file.  The body of the loop does just that -- it reads a line from the file, and appends it to the end of our list of names.

At the end of our program, we write out the list of names, using the familiar &lt;tt&gt;foreach&lt;/tt&gt; loop.

A second, very similar kind of loop is the &lt;tt&gt;do-while&lt;/tt&gt; loop.  In a &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop, the condition comes at the beginning of the loop, but in a &lt;tt&gt;do-while&lt;/tt&gt; loop, the condition comes at the end.  The reason this is significant is that with a &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop, if the condition is false the very first time, the loop body will never be run, so &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loops can run their bodies ''0 or more times''.  But with a &lt;tt&gt;do-while&lt;/tt&gt; loop, the body is run ''at least once'' before the condition is checked.  &lt;tt&gt;do-while&lt;/tt&gt; loops look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
do
{
	code
} while(condition)
&lt;/source&gt;

One case where this kind of loop comes up a lot is when you're trying to get valid input from the user.  Usually you ask the user to enter something in, then you check it to see if it's valid, and if it's not, you keep asking them until they give you something good.  This is what a &lt;tt&gt;do-while&lt;/tt&gt; loop is for: it'll run the input code at least once, and keep running it until the condition is met.

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;
import std.cstream;

void main()
{
	bool valid = false;
	bool yes;

	do
	{
		writef(&quot;Delete all your data?  y/n: &quot;);

		char[] response = din.readLine();

		if(response.length &gt; 0)
		{
			if(response[0] == 'y')
			{
				yes = true;
				valid = true;
			}
			else if(response[0] == 'n')
			{
				yes = false;
				valid = true;
			}
		}
	} while(valid == false)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code uses the &lt;tt&gt;valid&lt;/tt&gt; variable to keep track of whether what the user entered was valid or not.  It'll be set to &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; once they do.  Until then, though, the &lt;tt&gt;do-while&lt;/tt&gt; loop will keep looping, asking for user input.</text>

== What is Matter? ==
[[File:Concrete block.JPG|thumb|left|'''Matter''' has mass and volume, as exemplified by this concrete block.]]
Matter is defined as anything that has '''mass''' and '''volume'''. 

'''Mass''' is a measure of an object's inertia.  It is proportional to weight: the more mass an object has, the more weight it has.  However, mass is not the same as weight.  Weight is a force created by the action of gravity on a substance while mass is a measure of an object's resistance to change in motion.  Mass is measured by comparing the substance of interest to a standard kilogram called the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK). The IPK is a metal cylinder where the height and diameter both equal 39.17 millimeters and is made of an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. Thus, the standard kilogram is defined and all other masses are a comparison to this kilogram. When atom masses are measured in a mass spectrometer, a different internal standard is used. Your take home lesson with regard to mass is that mass is a relative term judged by a comparison.


'''Volume''' is a measure of the amount of space occupied by an object.  Volume can be measured directly with equipment designed using graduations marks or indirectly using length measurements depending on the state (gas, liquid, or solid) of the material. A ''graduated cylinder'', for example, is a tube that can hold a liquid which is marked and labeled at regular intervals, usually every 1 or 10 mL. Once a liquid is placed in the cylinder, one can read the graduation marks and record the volume measurement. Since volume changes with temperature, graduated equipment has limits to the precision with which one can read the measurement. Solid objects that have regular shape can have their volume calculated by measuring their dimensions.  In the case of a box, its volume equals length times width times height.

It is particularly interesting to note that measuring is different from calculating a specific value. While mass and volume can both be determined directly relative to either a defined standard or line marks on glass, calculating other values from measurements is not considered measuring. For example, once you have measured the mass and volume of a liquid directly, one can then calculate the density of a substance by dividing the mass by the volume. This is considered indirectly determining density. Interestingly enough, one can also measure density directly if an experiment which allows the comparison of density to a standard is set up.

Another quantity of matter directly or indirectly determined is the '''amount of substance'''. This can either represent a counted quantity of objects (e.g. three mice or a dozen bagels) or the indirectly determined number of particles of a substance being dealt with such as how many atoms are contained in a sample of a pure substance. The latter quantity is described in terms of moles. One mole is a specifically defined as the number of particles in 12 grams of the isotope Carbon-12. This number is 6.02214078(18)x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;  particles. 

{{DropBox|Units of Measure|2=
*Mass: the kilogram (kg).  Also, the gram (g) and milligram (mg).
** 1 kg = 1000 g
** 1000 mg = 1 g.
*Volume:  the liter (L), milliliter (mL).  Also, cubic centimeters (cc) and cubic meters (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
** 1 cc = 1 mL
** 1000 mL = 1 L
** 1000 L = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
*Amount:  the mole (mol).
** 1 mol = 6.02214078(18)x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;  particles}}

== Atoms, Elements, and Compounds == 
The fundamental building block of matter is the atom.
[[File:Stylised Lithium Atom.svg|thumb|right|The red dots are protons, the black dots are neutrons, and the blue dots are electrons.]]
Any atom is composed of a little nucleus surrounded by a &quot;cloud&quot; of electrons. In the nucleus there are protons and neutrons.

However, the term &quot;atom&quot; just refers to a building block of matter; it doesn't specify the identity of the atom. It could be an atom of carbon, or an atom of hydrogen, or any other kind of atom.

This is where the term &quot;element&quot; comes into play. When an atom is defined by the number of protons contained in its nucleus, chemists refer to it as an '''element'''. All elements have a very specific identity that makes them unique from other elements. For example, an atom with 6 protons in its nucleus is known as the element ''carbon''. When speaking of the element ''fluorine'', chemists mean an atom that contains 9 protons in its nucleus. 

{{TextBox|
*Atom: A fundamental building block of matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
*Element: A uniquely identifiable atom recognized by the number of protons in the nucleus.}}

Despite the fact that we define an element as a unique identifiable atom, when we speak, for example, 5 elements, we don't usually mean those 5 atoms are of the same type (having the same number of protons in their nucleus). We mean 5 'types' of atoms. It is not necessary there are only 5 atoms. There may be 10, or 100, etc. atoms, but those atoms belong to one of 5 types of atoms. I'd rather define 'element' as 'type of atom'. I think it is more precise. If we'd like to refer to 5 atoms having the same 6 protons in their nucleus, I'd say '5 carbon atoms' or '5 atoms of carbon'.

It is important to note that if the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom changes, so does the identity of that element. If we could remove a proton from nitrogen (7 protons), it is no longer nitrogen. We would, in fact, have to identify the atom as carbon (6 protons). Remember, elements are unique and are always defined by the number of protons in the nucleus.  The '''[[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|Periodic Table of the Elements]]''' shows all known elements organized by the number of protons they have.

An element is composed of the same type of atom; ''elemental carbon'' contains any number of atoms, all having 6 protons in their nuclei.  In contrast, '''compounds''' are composed of different type of atoms. More precisely, a compound is a chemical substance that consists of two or more elements.  A ''carbon compound'' contains some carbon atoms (with 6 protons each) and some other atoms with different numbers of protons.

Compounds have properties different from the elements that created them.  Water, for example, is composed of hydrogen and oxygen.  Hydrogen is an explosive gas and oxygen is a gas that fuels fire.  Water has completely different properties, being a liquid that is used to extinguish fires.

The smallest representative for a compound (which means it retains characteristics of the compound) is called a '''molecule'''.  Molecules are composed of atoms that have &quot;bonded&quot; together.  As an example, the ''formula'' of a water molecule is &quot;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&quot;:  two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

== Properties of Matter ==
Properties of matter can be divided in two ways: extensive/intensive, or physical/chemical.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| width=&quot;50%&quot; |
*''Extensive'' properties depend on the amount of matter that is being measured. These include mass and volume.
*''Intensive'' properties do not depend on the amount of matter. These include density and color.
| width=&quot;50%&quot; |
*''Physical'' properties can be measured without changing the chemical's identity. The freezing point of a substance is physical.  When water freezes, it's still H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
*''Chemical'' properties deal with how one chemical reacts with another. We know that wood is flammable because it becomes heat, ash, and carbon dioxide when heated in the presence of oxygen.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== States of Matter ==
One important physical property is the ''state of matter''. Three are common in everyday life: solid, liquid, and gas. The fourth, ''plasma'', is observed in special conditions such as the ones found in the sun and fluorescent lamps.  Substances can exist in any of the states.  Water is a compound that can be liquid, solid (ice), or gas (steam).
[[File:Icewithwater.JPG|thumb|right|The ice in this picture is a solid.  The water in the picture is a liquid.  In the air there is water vapor, which is a gas.]]
[[File:Solid liquid gas.svg|thumb|left|The states of matter depend on the bonding between molecules.]]

=== Solids ===
Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.  Most everyday objects are solids: rocks, chairs, ice, and anything with a specific shape and size.  The molecules in a solid are close together and connected by ''intermolecular bonds''.  Solids can be ''amorphous'', meaning that they have no particular structure, or they can be arranged into crystalline structures or networks.  For instance, soot, graphite, and diamond are all made of elemental carbon, and they are all solids.  What makes them so different?  Soot is amorphous, so the atoms are randomly stuck together.  Graphite forms parallel layers that can slip past each other.  Diamond, however, forms a crystal structure that makes it very strong.

=== Liquids ===
Liquids have a definite volume, but they do not have a definite shape.  Instead, they take the shape of their container to the extent they are indeed &quot;contained&quot; by something such as beaker or a cupped hand or even a puddle. If not &quot;contained&quot; by a formal or informal vessel, the shape is determined by other internal (e.g. intermolecular)  and external (e.g. gravity, wind, inertial) forces. The molecules are close, but not as close as a solid.  The intermolecular bonds are weak, so the molecules are free to slip past each other, flowing smoothly.  A property of liquids is ''viscosity'', the measure of &quot;thickness&quot; when flowing.  Water is not nearly as viscous as molasses, for example.

=== Gases ===
Gases have no definite volume and no definite shape.  They expand to fill the size and shape of their container.  The oxygen that we breathe and steam from a pot are both examples of gases.  The molecules are very far apart in a gas, and there are minimal intermolecular forces.  Each atom is free to move in any direction.  Gases undergo effusion and diffusion.  Effusion occurs when a gas seeps through a small hole, and diffusion occurs when a gas spreads out across a room.  If someone leaves a bottle of ammonia on a desk, and there is a hole in it, eventually the entire room will reek of ammonia gas.  That is due to the diffusion and effusion.  These properties of gas occur because the molecules are not bonded to each other.

{{Info|Technically, a gas is called a '''vapor''' if it does not occur at standard temperature and pressure (STP).  STP is 0° C and 1.00 atm of pressure.  This is why we refer to water ''vapor'' rather than water gas.}}
*In gases, intermolecular forces are very weak, hence molecules move randomly colliding with themselves, and with the wall of their container, thus exerting pressure on their container. When heat is given out by gases, the internal molecular energy decreases; eventually, the point is reached when the gas liquifies.

There are two types of change in matter: ''physical'' change and ''chemical'' change. As the names suggest, physical changes affect physical properties, and chemical changes affect chemical properties.

Chemical changes are also known as chemical reactions. The &quot;ingredients&quot; of a reaction are the reactants, and the end results are called the &quot;products&quot;. The change from reactants to products can be signified by an arrow.

&lt;center&gt;{{TextBox|1=
; A Chemical Reaction:
Reactants → Products}}&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the number of reactants and products don't necessarily have to be the same. However, the number of each type of atom must remain constant.  This is called the '''Law of Conservation of Matter'''.  It states that matter can never be created or destroyed, only changed and rearranged.  If a chemical reaction begins with 17 moles of carbon atoms, it must end with 17 moles of carbon atoms.  They may be bonded into different molecules, or in a different state of matter, but they cannot disappear.

When changes occur, energy is often transformed. However, like atoms, energy cannot disappear.  This is called the '''Law of Conservation of Energy'''.  A simple example would be putting ice cubes into a soft drink.  The ice cubes get warmer as the drink gets colder, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.  Note that energy can be &quot;released&quot; or &quot;stored&quot; by making and breaking bonds.  When a plant converts the energy from sunlight into food, that energy is stored in the chemical bonds within the sugar molecules.

== Chemical or Physical? ==
[[File:Blender.jpg|thumb|right|Is blending together a smoothie a physical or chemical change?]]
Physical changes do not cause a substance to become a fundamentally different substance.  Chemical changes, on the other hand, cause a substance to change into something entirely new.  Chemical changes are typically irreversible, but that is not always the case.  It is easier to understand the difference between physical and chemical changes with examples.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
| '' State changes are physical.''
| Phase changes are when you melt, freeze, boil, condense, [[w:sublimation|sublimate]], or [[w:deposition|deposit]] a substance.  They do not change the nature of the substance unless a chemical change occurs along with the physical change.
|-
| ''Cutting, tearing, shattering, and grinding are physical.''
| These may be irreversible, but the result is still composed of the same molecules.  When you cut your hair, that is a physical change, even though you can't put the hair back on your head again.
|-
| ''Mixing together substances is physical.''
| For example, you could mix salt and pepper, dissolve salt in water, or mix molten metals together to produce an alloy.
|-
| ''Gas bubbles forming is chemical.''
| Not to be confused with bubbles from boiling, which would be physical (a phase change).  Gas bubbles indicate that a chemical reaction has occurred.
|-
| ''Precipitates forming is chemical.''
| When  dissolved substances are mixed, and a cloudy precipitate appears, there has been a chemical change.
|-
| ''Rotting, burning, cooking, and rusting (for example) are chemical.''
| The resulting substances are entirely new chemical compounds.  For instance, wood becomes ash and heat; iron becomes rust; sugar ferments into alcohol.
|-
| ''Changes of color or release of odors (i.e. release of a gas) might be chemical.''
| As an example, the element chromium shows different colors when it is in different compounds, but a single chromium compound will not change color on its own without some sort of reaction.
|-
| ''Release/absorption of energy (heat, light, sound) is generally not easily categorized.''
| Hot/cold packs involve dissolving a salt in water to change its temperature (more on that in later chapters); popping popcorn is mostly (but not completely).

Matter can be classified by its state.
*'''Solids''' have a set volume and shape.The inter molecular force of attraction for solid matter is very strong.  
*'''Liquids''' have a set volume, but change shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for liquid matter is weaker than solid matter.
*'''Gases''' have neither definite volume nor shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for gaseous matter is negligible.  
*'''Plasma''' which are usually gaseous state of matter in which a part or all of the atoms or molecules are dissociated to form ions.

Matter can also be classified by its chemical composition.
*An [[w:Chemical_element|element]] is a pure substance made up of atoms with the same number of protons. As of 2011, 118 elements have been observed, 92 of which occur naturally. Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H) are examples of elements. The [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table]] is a tabular representation of the known elements.
*A [[w:Chemical_compound|compound]] consists of two or more chemical elements that are chemically bonded together. Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and table sugar (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) are examples of chemical compounds. The ratio of the elements in a compound is always the same. For example in water, the number of H atoms is always twice the number of O atoms.
*A [[w:mixture|mixture]] consists of two or more substances (element or compound) mixed together without any chemical bond. Salad is a good example. A mixture can be separated into its individual components by mechanical means.

== Types of Mixtures ==

There are many kinds of mixtures.  They are classified by the behavior of the '''phases''', or substances that have been mixed.

=== Homogeneous Mixtures ===
[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|Soda water is a homogeneous mixture.  (The straw looks broken because of [[wikt:refraction|refraction]].)]]
A homogeneous mixture is uniform, which means that any given sample of the mixture will have the same composition.  Air, sea water, and carbonation dissolved in soda are all examples of homogeneous mixtures, or solutions.  No matter what sample you take from the mixture, it will always be composed of the same combination of phases.  Chocolate chip ice cream is not homogeneous—one spoonful taken might have two chips, and then another spoonful might have several chips.

An example for a homogeneous mixture is a solution.  The substance that gets dissolved is the '''solute'''.  The substance that does the dissolving is the '''solvent'''.  Together they make a '''solution'''.  If you stir a spoonful of salt into a glass of water, salt is the solute that gets dissolved.  Water is the solvent.  The salty water is now a solution, or homogeneous mixture, of salt and water.

When different gases are mixed, they always form a solution.  The gas molecules quickly spread out into a uniform composition.

=== Heterogeneous Mixtures ===

A '''heterogeneous mixture''' is not uniform.  Different samples may have different compositions, like the example of chocolate chip ice cream.  Concrete, soil, blood, and salad are all examples of heterogeneous mixtures. 

[[File:DustWorkerStreet.jpg|thumb|left|This dust is a suspension because it settles after the work is done.]]
==== Suspensions ====
When sand gets kicked up in a pond, it clouds the water.  Soon the sand settles down, and is no longer mixed into the water.  This is an example of a '''suspension'''.  Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures that will eventually settle.  They are usually, but not necessarily, composed of phases in different states of matter.  Italian salad dressing has three phases: the water, the oil, and the small pieces of seasoning.  The seasonings are solids that will sink to the bottom, and the oil and water are liquids that will separate.

==== Colloids ====
[[File:Toothpaste.jpg|thumb|Toothpaste is a colloid, because it's part solid and part liquid.]]
What exactly is toothpaste?  We can't exactly classify it by its state of matter.  It has a definite shape and volume, like a solid.  But then you squeeze the tube, and it flows almost like a liquid.  And then there's jelly, shaving cream, smoke, dough, and Silly Putty...

These are examples of '''colloids'''.  A [[w:Colloids|colloid]] is a heterogeneous mixture of two substances of different phases.  Shaving cream and other foams are gas dispersed in liquid.  Jello, toothpaste, and other gels are liquid dispersed in solid.  Dough is a solid dispersed in a liquid.  Smoke is a solid dispersed in a gas.

{{Info|Colloids differ from suspensions in that they will not settle.}}

Colloids consist of two phases: a ''dispersed phase'' inside of a ''continuous medium''.

==== The Tyndall Effect ====

The Tyndall effect distinguishes colloids from solutions.  In a solution, the particles are so fine that they will not scatter light.  This is not true for a colloid.  If you shine light through a solution, the beam of light will not be visible.  It will be visible in a colloid.  For instance, if you have ever played with a laser pointer, you have seen the Tyndall effect.  You cannot see the laser beam in air (a solution), but if you shine it into a mist (a colloid, or suspension, actually), the beam is visible.  Clouds look white (or gray), as opposed to blue, because of the Tyndall effect - the light is scattered by the small droplets of suspended water.

== Methods for Separating Mixtures ==
[[File:Filtration diagram.svg|thumb|left|Filtration is one way to separate a mixture.]]
Because there is no chemical bonding in a mixture, the phases can be separated by mechanical means.  In a heterogeneous mixture like a salad, the pieces can easily be picked out and separated.  It is as simple as sifting through the salad and picking out all the tomatoes and radishes, for example.  However, many mixtures contain particles that are too small, liquids, or too many particles to be separated manually.  We must use more sophisticated methods to separate the mixture.

=== Filtration ===

Imagine you have a sandbox, but there are bits of broken glass in it.  All you would need is some sort of filter.  The sand particles are much smaller than the glass chips, so a mesh filter would let sand pass but stop the glass.  Filtration is used in all sorts of purification methods.  Some filters, like dialysis tubing, are such fine filters that water can pass, but dissolved glucose cannot.

{{Info|Filtration works with particles that are significantly different in size, like sand and rock, or water and glucose.}}

=== Distillation ===
[[File:Simple distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|A distillation apparatus has a boiling flask, a place to cool the vapor down, and a collecting flask.]]
If you were given a glass of saltwater, could you drink it?  Sure, if you distill it first.  Distillation is the boiling of a mixture to separate its phases.  Salt is a solid at room temperature, and water is a liquid.  Water will boil far before salt even begins to melt.  So separating the two is as simple as boiling the water until all that remains is the solid salt.  If desired, the water vapor can be collected, condensed, and used as a source of pure water.

Distillation can also be used if two liquids are mixed but have different boiling points.  Separation of several liquids with similar boiling points can be achieved using [[w:fractionation|fractionation]].

=== Centrifugation and Sedimentation ===
[[File:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|left|Sedimentation is used to purify waste water, by letting it settle and removing the settled material (sludge, in this case).]]
These processes rely on differences in density.  In a medical lab, blood often goes into a centrifuge.  A centrifuge is a machine that spins a sample at fairly high rates of speed.  Red blood cells are much denser than the watery substance (called plasma, but it's not the plasma state of matter) that makes up blood.  As a result of the spinning, the denser phases move outward and the less dense phases move inward, towards the axis of rotation.  Then, the red blood cells can be separated from the plasma.

Sedimentation is similar, but it happens when particles of different densities have settled within a liquid.  If a jar of muddy water is left to settle, the heaviest particles sink to the bottom first.  The lightest particles sink last and form a layer on top the heavier particles.  You may have seen this effect in a bottle of salad dressing.  The seasonings sink to the bottom, the water forms a lower layer, and the oil forms an upper layer.  The separate phases can be skimmed out.  To return it to a mixture, simply shake it up to disturb the layers.

=== Unique Properties ===
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|thumb|60px|Chromatography separates things dissolved in liquid.]]

The differences in substances' properties can be exploited to allow separation.  Consider these examples:
* A mixture of sand and iron filings can be separated by magnet.
* Salt and sand can be separated by solution (sand will not dissolve in water, salt will)
* Helium can be separated from a mixture with hydrogen by combustion (this is a very dangerous operation, since hydrogen in the presence of oxygen is highly explosive). Hydrogen is flammable, but helium is not.

=== Other methods ===

There are countless other ways to [[w:Separation_process|separate mixtures]].
For instance, gel electrophoresis is used to separate different sized pieces of DNA.  They are placed into gel, and an electric current is applied.  The smaller pieces move faster and separate from the larger pieces.

Chromatography separates phases dissolved in liquid.  If you want to see an example, take a strip of paper and draw a dot on it with a colored marker.  Dip the strip into water, and wait a while.  You should see the ink separate into different colors as they spread out from the dot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Survival Strategies =
* Note:  This section is deliberately brief.  It represents an attempt simply to list the survival strategies available.  It may take form at some future point.  As always, feel free to add anything.  JWM.
== Regression and Seclusion ==
* Lots of autistic spectrum people use this technique when life gets to them.
* Method:
** Find safe accommodation.  If this is going to be with other people, you need to be prepared to communicate with them and pay attention to their needs.
** Reduce all face to face human contact and living expenses to their bare minimums.
** Optionally, use your problem solving skills to raise your living standards on the cheap.
** To get the best from this method, it is best to take stock of the resources (financial, human and otherwise) available to you and to find ways to preserve them.  This is better done sooner than later, but can be quite difficult if depression is an issue.
* Pro's:
** Plenty of time to re-evaluate life, develop marketable skills and rebuild self esteem.
* Con's:
** Isn't really an option for school age autistic spectrum people unless homeschooling also is.
** Lack of face to face human contact can end up being quite depressing in the long term, and doesn't help develop social skills at all.
** This method can also be a trap.  If you regress to a point where you lose social skills you once had, it can be much harder to rejoin society.  There is a growing number of [[w:Hikikomori|young people]] in Japan who are in this situation.
== Escapism ==
* Method:
** Get socially involved in clubs, groups or communities that promote your passions.  It's a good bet that other autistic spectrum people will be there.
** Interests such as science fiction, fantasy, gaming, anime, cartoons, information technology that is cutting edge or experimental and autism itself are good examples of this, as is any interest that is considered &quot;geeky&quot;.
** You may find the experience more enjoyable if you read [[#Suggestions for Autistic Spectrum community building]].
* Pro's:
** You get to socialise in a more fulfilling way since the ground rules of any particular interest are usually very clear, and all you have to do to get respect is be good at promoting the interest in question.
** You get to see that you aren't really damaged for thinking the way you do.
** You get to see that life has the potential to be much deeper and more interesting than it seemed to be capable of.
** The self esteem you get from more worthwhile interactions can be enough to help you survive the less worthwhile ones.
* Con's:
** Groups of autistic spectrum people tend to attract non-autistic people who usually have ulterior motives.  Or rather, motives they usually don't declare up front.
** Non-autistic people may get involved to become more proficient in the interest itself.
** Non-autistic people may get involved to learn more about people who share the interest.
** Non-autistic people may get involved to learn more about somebody else who is autistic spectrum.
** Non-autistic people who will probably be &quot;superficially charming&quot; may get involved for the particularly nasty purpose of &quot;[[w:Internet_troll trolling]]&quot;.  This is a well developed form of bullying.
*** Something worth knowing about Trolls is that learning how to deal with them is a good way to train the senses.
** Eventually you realise that autistic spectrum social problems apply to autist social situations too, despite the fact that autist to autist communication is easier.
** Autism as an interest tends to put things in stark reality.  There are good things and extremely bad things about autism as an interest.  My current explanation for this is that there seem to be very few ground rules, and too many differing agendas.

== Avoiding Social Situations ==
* A lot of the historical autistic spectrum figures who found success in pursuing their passions seem to have been following this strategy.
* Method:
** Avoid social interactions that don't promote your goals in life.
** Learn the body language of someone who wants to stop interacting so that few difficult situations arise.
** If people you don't like are persistent in interacting with you, make sure they receive no pay off from doing so, so that they eventually give up.
* Pro's:
** Respect from other people will be easier to attain if you are good at what you do.
** This seems to be a good compromise between seclusion and full on social interaction.
* Con's:
** This pretty much requires active pursuit in a passion or interest to work.
** Building a reputation purely on your abilities tends to make people believe that you're socially adept too.
== Imitating Non-Autistic Behaviour ==
It should be noted that, if you are going to imitate non-autistic thought or behaviour, always give yourself time to be you. Be sure you give yourself time and space to just be yourself and not worry about pretending.
* Method:
** Read about rules of social interaction, and about how to learn what they are yourself.  This is what most of Marc Segars book appears to be about, and what part of this book is about.
* Pro's:
** Works very well for the basics.  Perhaps it is in part because non-autistic people keep them in the back of their minds too.
* Con's:
** Flat out doesn't work for anything more than the basics.  Figuring out what the rules are and when to use them is just one problem.  The rules are endless and non-autistic people appear to estimate them within appropriate limits on the fly.
** Pretending to be non-autistic for too long can be detrimental to your health, self-confidence and well-being. Give yourself set times and places where you can be yourself.
== Imitating Non-Autistic Thought ==
* In retrospect, it strikes me that this seems to be what Marc is trying to get at when he refers to &quot;plot&quot;.
* Method:
** Learn everything you can about how non-autistic people think and learn.  They learn moment to moment.  Read about [[w:Monotropism monotropism/polytropism]] and what Marc Segar has to say about &quot;plot&quot; and imitate non-autistic thought processes in all social situations involving non-autistic people.
** Learn about their priorities in life too, but avoid imitating the social status game unless you want life to become needlessly interesting.  Use the second commandment instead.  I have found the things in the &quot;non-autistic thought processes&quot; and &quot;visualising social interaction&quot; sections satisfactory in these regards.
* Pro's:
** Most of the things in the non-autistic world make a lot more sense when knowing where they're coming from.
** Body language appears to make much more sense &quot;naturally&quot; too.
** Done correctly it seems to work fairly well in gaining some equality, but most non-autistic people seem to find people who can otherwise interact well but who are unwilling to play the social status game creepy, amongst other things.
* Con's:
** Can feel un-natural, superficial and boring.  It's rather necessary to have some kind of pay off to make this work.
** Mastering the art of thinking according to &quot;plot&quot; means that it is possible to BEGIN learning the way non-autistic people do.  At this point, it becomes a game of &quot;catch up&quot;.
** Time spent imitating non-autistic people is time that could be spent in other forms of self development that can lead to a more fulfilling life.

== Educating Others About Autism ==
* Method:
** Learn everything you can about the differences and similarities between autistic and non-autistic people.  Although there are many different theories and new ones all the time, nobody seems to know the exact differences yet, so be prepared to develop and share your own perspective on these things.
** Avoid falling into the trap of believing autism is a handicap if at all possible, and if you can achieve that, avoid letting others do so too.
** Avoid falling into the trap of thinking that all autistic people are exactly the same as you. Each autist experiences life differently. There are as many &quot;types&quot; of autism as there are autistic people. It is often called a spectrum disorder for a reason.
** Non-autistic people have difficulty getting outside an acquisitive cost/benefit frame.  Even when they know you have autism, they will not necessarily be able to get outside this frame.  They will often believe (sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly) that their problems are as great as yours.  Many of them strongly dislike supporting others without getting something at least as great in return.
** Non-autistic people have difficulties making transitions from causal explanations to normative conclusions.  They will often continue to view a perfectly good reason as just an excuse.
* Pro's:
** Can mean deepening the friendship with the person you disclose to and perhaps gaining a little relief.
* Con's:
** This pretty much implies disclosing being autistic spectrum.  Marc Segar writes about the implications in his guide in the &quot;coming clean&quot; section and others have too.

== Getting a Diagnosis ==
* Method:
** Get an appropriate diagnosis or re-diagnosis.
** Claim any available government assistance.
* Pro's:
** The assistance available may be worthwhile.
** It's good to know you are not delusional.
* Con's:
** The assistance available may not be worthwhile and many nations do not offer any assistance at all.
** Once you have a diagnosis, people may lose interest in your development, given current perceptions about autism, and your self esteem tends to suffer.  These are _not_ good things for the wellbeing of young people.

== Knowing Your Rights ==
* Knowing your rights can help you in all official business, such as in dealing with government authorities, legal authorities, educationan providers, health insurances, employers. Issues can include admission/application and non-discrimination, getting support and understanding, and getting help when needed. For example, what if you are witness in a legal court and struggle understanding language literally, and may not remember faces of other witnesses? This is an area where you can constructievly help everyone, including yourself in an for the situation appropriate matter.

== Equal Rights Activism ==
* Method:
** The core of an equal rights perspective is the claim that a systematically disadvantaged group is suffering from structural oppression.
** It involves advancing claims that certain things should be provided, or recognised as rights, which are not universally recognised as such today.
** A person with this orientation will usually find the bulk of information available unhelpful.  They will choose to focus on accounts written by autistic people which express indignation at mistreatment.
** Groups of this kind are usually organised through web forums and e-lists.

* Pro's:
** Seeing a structural cause of the problem raises self-esteem.
** Research has shown that social movements make participants feel empowered.[[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/media/media270.shtml]]
** Participants believe they are addressing the real causes of various problems, whereas other strategies adapt to an unjust context.

* Con's:
** Can lead to judging non-autistic people too quickly.
** Tends to produce a defensive reaction in non-autistic people, and in autistic people who are well-integrated into the current system.  
** Negative reactions to advocacy can be a source of stress.
** Can be frustrating due to the lack of rapid, demonstrable successes.
** Social movements can be internally acrimonious.
** Anger against non-autistic people might be better directed at powerful actors who treat all human beings badly, and are unconcerned about human life except for its marketable qualities.
** Critics view such activism as distracting from concrete life-goals and as a waste of time.

* Fear is detrimental to self esteem.
* Finding gaps in your knowledge and filling them or otherwise addressing them can lessen the fears associated with those gaps.
* Fear can be a good guide to finding gaps in your knowledge.
* Taking time regularly to meditate about recent events can be beneficial and dangerous too. XXX (anon65 - conflicting objectives)
** A danger for autistic spectrum people that Marc Segars guide talks about is getting into circular reasoning traps.  See the section on &quot;self maintainance&quot; for more on this, and how to avoid them.
** Comparing recent events, good and bad, with what you would have expected to happen can teach you more about social interaction, or reinforce what you already know.
* Having hobbies and engaging in personal interests is one of the best ways to build self esteem.  The better you are at them, the greater the reward will be, but:
** Be very careful to investigate and understand the dangers in your hobbies.  Take safety seriously.  There's no point in developing a skill today that you can't use tomorrow.
** Don't let anybody force you into taking up a hobby.
** Don't let anybody manipulate you into giving up a hobby.
*** People may try to get you to give up a hobby by saying that it is childish or dangerous or takes up too much time.  There may or may not be some truth in what they say.
*** They may try to imply that YOU are childish or ignorant or dangerous for having your hobbies and interests.  This is almost certainly wrong.
*** If you take your own safety and the safety of others seriously, then ignoring warnings is a bad idea.
*** In virtually all cases it is possible to negotiate compromises that enable a hobby or interest to be pursued, while avoiding its dangers.
*** People who keep coming up with new reasons why you shouldn't keep pursuing your interests and hobbies when their old reasons have been proven wrong and who avoid negotiation are almost certainly not trying to help you.
*** If someone is persistent in doing this, then there may be other underlying issues on their mind that need to be addressed.  Finding out what they are and dealing with them can be an educational and rewarding experience.
* Successfully helping someone else achieve something they need is an incredible self esteem booster.
** When doing this involves sharing or developing your personal interests, it is even better.
** It is possible to experience negative emotions from assisting people too.  If you feel this happening, it's often best to reconsider.
** Beware that placing yourself in danger to save someone and getting hurt yourself means that both of you need to be rescued, and this means that such an act can ultimately hurt the person you're trying to help, because you end up halving the attention the rescuers have for the victim.
** Autistic spectrum people can succeed in learning the social games that people play with some effort, but are nearly always at a severe disadvantage.  Therefore, developing interests that are useful to others is well worth the effort.

      <comment>/* Trust and Loyalty */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Holding down a job =
:This section comes from my experience working at a corporation that had a strong union movent which prevented me being fired for the 6 years I worked there.  Instead, my boss's and workmates tried to teach me from the ground up about the things I needed to do to survive there.  I tended to spend my spare time fixing many of the rather obscene problems occurring in the workplace, and succeeded in multiplying productivity within the organisation, but I was working with some rather [[w:Sociopath|sociopathic]] people who found ways to make me suicidal and eventually to quit.  I didn't work in the decade afterwards due to the experience and lived very frugally, yet the corporation in question still earns money from my not particularly well remunerated work.  So please understand that I had a lot of time to work this out and that I can't communicate the following things properly if the more cynical parts are removed.  JWM.
== Trust and Loyalty ==
* A worker is someone who does tasks for another worker called a boss because the boss doesn't have the time or the capability to do all of their own tasks.
* Workers are expected to be empathetic and loyal to the work related values and goals of their boss and their employer.
* Workers are expected to diligently complete any tasks they have accepted responsibility for to the best of their ability, and to return with the results.
* Workers are expected to not accept tasks they know they won't be able to complete and to be able to explain why to the best of their ability.
* Failure to be consistent in these things can lead to a lack of trust in assigning tasks to the worker, and a worker with no tasks isn't doing work for the employer and might as well not work there.
* The good news is that nobody is a perfect worker and that it is part of a boss's responsibility to deal with most of these problems.
* The bad news is that social interaction unrelated to work or even outside of work hours can also contribute to trust or lack of trust.
* It is nearly always a boss's responsibility to be higher in the pecking order.  If they fail to do this, the workplace tends to fall apart.
* A worker can sometimes be expected to be empathetic and loyal to the non-work related goals of their workmates.  This falls into the realm of &quot;social interaction&quot;, and those rules apply.
* For example: small chats with collegues about all sorts of things (family, holidays) are common practice. Look at how long and often other chat, and don't exceed this.
* Also chat with collegues that don't you regularly work with, getting to know much people if often good.
* The coffee machine or other places where people wait together are perfect places to chat up. If you don't drink coffee, there's probably hot water to make thee or soup, or hot chocolate. Take your time to look for a cup, a spoon, some milk and in the mean time see if there's a conversation going on that you can join.

== Company Culture ==
* Each company and organisation within a company has its own unique &quot;culture&quot;.
* This culture is basically a mixture of written and unwritten policies related to things such as quality, efficiency, communication and even social and cultural things.  These are not entirely unlike unwritten social rules.
* Members of the organisation are consciously and unconsciously evaluated by how well they follow these policies.
* People who fit in with the culture become highly valued and are often given a bit of leeway in the way they are permitted to work.
* People who don't fit in often suffer, no matter how good a worker they otherwise are, or how much they have achieved for their employer.
* If you find yourself in the latter situation and unable to break out of it, you might consider seeking another job rather than letting your work record and self esteem suffer.  These things are much more important than they may at first seem.
* There are companies such as Google and Microsoft that have cultures that are dominated by autistic spectrum people.  These companies are mostly in industries that autistic spectrum people excel at, such as the software industry.
* The culture itself can ruin a company or organisation when it has to adapt to external forces which often makes culture of great concern to boss's themselves.

== Workplace Change ==
* Autistic people are often exceedingly good at customising their environment to suit their particular day to day wants and needs, however:
* Rearranging the workplace is often a dangerous thing to do, even if the changes lead to significant ongoing net profits for the employer.  Bosses often simply won't see the connection.
* It is usually the boss's job to govern the way an organisation operates.  Rearranging the workplace without their approval can be seen as a challenge to the pecking order.  See the section about &quot;confidence&quot; for more on this.
* All changes cause a temporary reduction in efficiency and quality while they are being implemented.  Bosses hate this, and it is why change is often frowned upon.
* Bosses often hire other companies for exorbitant amounts of money to implement change properly.  If a boss realises that a worker has saved them having to do this, then this can lead to a boost in the value placed in that worker, however the worker will rarely see any of the exorbitant amounts of money.
* Having realised this, it is easier and more profitable for a boss to accept credit for the change himself while rewarding the worker in less monetary ways.  It is a boss's job to manage change after all, and credit and blame will naturally fall into their laps.
* It is best to negotiate any benefit, bonus or pay rise BEFORE making a regular practice of implementing change, but don't expect to receive it without asking, or without having a track record of making good changes well.
* Changes can often lead to less work, but no change will ever lead to working less, unless it is by being fired.  A job in this society will always require doing tasks, whether it is necessary for survival or not.
* Given all of this, it is often easier to simply not attempt to rearrange the workplace, and to just hunker down and do your best to ignore the stupidities happening around you.
* If you use the last rule, be glad that there are people stupid enough to give people money to do silly things.
* Rearranging your own workspace is often OK, so long as it isn't detrimental to your work or the work of others.  Don't light camp fires in your cubicle.
* Beware that the greater the changes to your workspace, the less someone else will be able to work in it.  This can make eccentric people less replaceable, but bosses will often start trying when they realise this.  Rogue workers tend to scare bosses.
* If you find that you are constantly thinking of better ways to do business in your workplace, you may be better off in a research and development profession.

== Formal Employment Termination Proceedings ==
* Some large employers allow employees to respond to formal accusations before deciding whether to fire them.
* If this happens, the people making the allegations will be different from the ones doing the firing.
* Employers that do this usually allow employees to apply for other jobs within the company, and this may be the best thing to do if you succeed in refuting the allegations since the underlying problems that caused the accusations in the first place will still be there, and will have to be resolved if the situation is to stabilise.
* In such cases, always consult with people you know and trust within the company before making any decisions.  These things happen to more people than it may at first seem, but people don't often talk about it.
* You may have union representatives too and these are normally people you can talk to about this, but if they are part of your workplace, beware that they may be part of the problem and as such, may have conflicting interests.  In such cases it may be possible to talk with other union representatives from the same union.
* One good reason to follow procedure and formally respond to the accusations is that simply quitting without doing so usually results in a bad employment record.
* If you plan to defend your job, respond to the allegations that are easiest to disprove first and the ones that are hardest last.  If you can succeed in exposing the malice in the easy ones, then the hard ones will need less, if any convincing.
* Always get someone you trust to proof read your response.  It needs to be as consise, clear and convincing as possible.
* In all cases, avoid letting your boss, workmates and employer know that you're looking for another job or that you're going to quit until you do.  Otherwise satisfactory jobs can turn bad this way.

== Numbers ==
[[File:Atomo di litio.svg|thumb|right|If the red parts are protons and the green parts are neutrons, what's the atomic, neutron, and mass number of this atom? (lithium)]]
The '''Atomic number''' is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. This number determines the element type of the atom.  For instance, all neon atoms have exactly ten protons.  If an atom has ten protons, then it must be neon.  If an atom is neon, then it must have ten protons.

The atomic number is sometimes denoted '''Z'''.  Continuing with the example of neon, &lt;math&gt;Z=10&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Neutron number''' is the number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.  Remember that neutrons have no electric charge, so they do not affect the chemistry of an element.  However, they do affect the nuclear properties of the element.  For instance, Carbon-12 has six neutrons, and it is stable.  Carbon-14 has eight neutrons, and it happens to be radioactive.  Despite these differences, both forms of carbon behave the same way when forming chemical compounds.

The neutron number is sometimes denoted '''N'''.

The '''Mass number''' is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom.  It is denoted '''A'''. To find the mass number of an atom, remember that '''A = Z + N'''.  The mass number of an atom is always an integer.  Because the number of neutrons can vary among different atoms of the same element, there can be different mass numbers of a given element.  Look back to the example of carbon.  Carbon-14 has a mass number of 14, and Carbon-12 has a mass number of 12.  Every carbon atom ''must'' have six protons, so Carbon-14 has eight neutrons and Carbon-12 has six neutrons.
{{Info|Elements with the same atomic number but different atomic masses are '''isotopes'''.}}  Isotopes of the same element have nearly identical chemical properties (because they have the same number of protons and electrons).  Their only difference is the number of neutrons, which changes their nuclear properties like radioactivity.

=== Notation ===

There is a convenient way of writing the numbers that describe atoms.  It is easiest to learn by examples.

{{Helpful hint|hint=Keep in mind that any of the three numbers written around the element symbol are optional, but they should be written if it is important to the given situation.  The charge number is left off if the atom has zero charge (equal number of protons and electrons).  The mass number and atomic number are usually left off.}}
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;_9^{19}\text{F}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is how we write fluorine-19.  The atomic number is below and the mass number is above, followed by its symbol on the [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table of the elements]].
|-
| &lt;math&gt;^{12}\text{C}&lt;/math&gt;
| This example shows carbon-12.  Notice how the atomic number is missing.  You know which element it is because of the C, so there is no need to write the number of protons.  The atomic number is rarely written because the element symbol implies how many protons there are.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;_{12}^{25}\text{Mg}^{+2}&lt;/math&gt;
| The last example shows both the atomic number and mass number, along with a charge.  The charge is the difference in the number of protons compared to the number of electrons.  You can read more about charge, protons, and electrons [[General_Chemistry/Atomic_Structure/Subatomic_Particles|later on]].  From the example, you can see that this magnesium atom would have 12 protons, 13 neutrons, and 10 electrons.  Its mass is 25 (12 p + 13 n) and its charge is +2 (12 p - 10 e).
|}

{{TextBox|1=
;Exercise for the reader!
Try writing the symbol for an atom with seven protons, seven neutrons, and eight electrons.  You will need to look up its symbol on the [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table]].}}

== Atomic Mass ==
The mass of an atom is measured in ''atomic mass units (amu)''. An atom's mass can be found by summing the number of protons and neutrons.
By definition, 12 amu equals the atomic mass of carbon-12. Protons and neutrons have an approximate mass of 1 amu, and electrons have a negligible mass.

{{Yellow Warning|There is a difference between an atom's mass number and an element's atomic mass.  The mass number measures the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of a ''particular atom''.  The atomic mass measures the ''average mass of all atoms for an element''.  For example, a carbon atom might have a mass number of 12 or 14 (or something else), but carbon in general has a mass of 12.011 amu.}}

Usually, a pure element is made up of a number of isotopes in specific ratios. Because of this, the measured atomic mass of carbon is not exactly 12. It is an average of all the masses of all the isotopes, with the more common ones contributing more to the measured atomic mass.  By convention atomic masses are given no units.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example
Pretend that the element Wikibookium has two isotopes. The first has a mass number of 104, and the second has a mass number of 107. Considering that 75% of the naturally occurring atoms are of the first isotope, and the rest are of the second. The average atomic mass is calculated as

0.75 × 104 + 0.25 × 107 = 104.75

In this case, a bunch of Wikibookium atoms would have an average mass of 104.75 amu, but each individual atom might have a mass number of 104 or 107.  Keep in mind that all of the atoms would have the same number of protons. Their masses are different because of the number of neutrons.}}

== Moles == 
A mole is defined as the amount of an element whose number of particles are equal to that in 12g of C-12 carbon, also known as Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number equals 6.022 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;. Moles are not very confusing: if you have a dozen atoms, you would have 12. If you have a mole of atoms, you would have 6.022 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;. Why is this ridiculously large number important? It can be used to convert between atomic mass units and grams. One mole of carbon-12 is exactly 12 grams, by definition. Similarly, one mole of any element is the atomic mass of that element expressed as a weight in grams. The atomic mass is equal to the number of grams per mole of that element.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example
There are 128.2 g of rubidium (atomic mass = 85.47 amu).  How many atoms are there?

(128.2 g) / (85.47 g/mol) = 1.5 mol&lt;br&gt;
(1.5 mol) × (6.022 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;) = '''9.03 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; atoms of rubidium'''}}

[[Image:NO2-N2O4.jpg|thumb|These one-liter containers each hold 0.045 moles of nitrogen-based gas.  (1 L) / (22.4 L/mol) = 0.045 mol]] 
Moles are also important because every 22.4 liters of gas contain 1 mole of gas molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP, 0 °C and 1 atmosphere of pressure). Avogadro discovered this. (That's why it's his number.) A container filled with fluorine gas would have to be 22.4 L large to hold one mole of F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Knowing this fact allows you to determine the mass of a gas molecule if you know the volume of the container. This holds true for every gas.

Why every single gas?  Atoms and molecules are ''tiny''.  The volume of a gas is mostly empty space, so the molecules have an insignificantly small volume.  As you will [[General Chemistry/Gases|eventually learn]], this ensures that there is always one mole of gas atoms for every 22.4 liters at STP.

====Notes====

''This is an example.''

I have a 32-bit Win XP with an Athlon 3200+ and SATA, and this works fine for me. YourNameHere, 20 July 2007

==Scenarios==

===Using ATI All-in-Wonder 2006===

From [[user:joe_n_bloe|Joseph Hall]] as of 03 May, 2006:

Here is a procedure that works for me.

I have VirtualDub set up the following way:

*Preferences:
*Timing:
*Compression: HuffYUV

My S-video composite output (from a DirecTV box, etc.) is connected to the S-video input of the AIW 2006 dongle. The analog out is also connected to the dongle.

My computer is an Athlon 3400+ X2 running Win XP 64-bit, with 2GB RAM and IDE drives. I run the 32-bit VirtualDub because there is no 64-bit port of HuffYUV (as far as I know). With no other load, or only low-priority background load (such as an &quot;idle&quot; priority TMPGenc batch task), capture generally proceeds fine with no dropped frames and a handful of inserted frames. Some players may not play the resulting AVI-encapsulated HuffYUV stream with perfect A/V sync, but I have learned that the A/V sync is typically fine anyway.

TMPGenc Xpress (4.0) will play the HuffYUV stream with the correct A/V sync in its preview mode (in the clip editor or filter editor). If the A/V sync is correct there, it should be correct after encoding. I can't speak for other encoders at this time, because I am happy with TMPGenc.

A few dropped frames may be okay. If there is a burst of dropped frames, the resulting capture may or may not have good A/V sync. I rarely have dropped frames but every so often I have a source that has a spot that seems to cause dropped frames. Maybe this is because of some peculiarity of those frames that causes HuffYUV to take longer than usual to do the encoding. Several dropped frames in a second or two may not derail A/V sync, but more probably will. Special attention to fragmentation on the recording drive is not necessary in my experience.

Normally I get inserted frames one at a time spaced in intervals of at least a few minutes. A burst of inserted frames may also result in an A/V sync problem, usually due to some other task competing for disk (most likely) or CPU (less likely).

The data rate of the capture depends on the source material. Compression seems to range from about 2.7:1 to nearly 4:1 (on 2.2:1 letterboxed source). 30 GB/hr is a ballpark for capture of a clean but detailed signal from S-video.

====Notes====

When done correctly, '''the Lunge''' will help to stretch the hamstrings and work out quads. Holding the stretch for fifteen seconds will increase effectiveness.

==Steps==
# Start in a karate-like stance, with one leg in front of the other and front shoulder facing forward. 
# Squat down a small amount, bending your knees.
# Quickly move your front leg out in front of you and place it so you are almost in a split.
# Lean onto your front knee, placing pressure on it and stretching the back leg.
# Keep your body sideways and make sure your front knee is only at a right angle. Also keep your front foot facing straight and your back foot outwards.

== Introduction to Astrodyamics ==

'''Astrodynamics''' is the study of the interaction and motions of objects in space. While there are many generalized ways of studying astrodynamics, it makes the most practical sense to study the earth, and the actions of objects in orbit around the earth. Similarly, it is more practical to study the gravitational effects of our sun then it is to study the gravity of any arbitrary star. This book will provide the basic mathematical foundation for the study of astrodynamics, but will take specific care to focus on man-made craft lauched from the earth, intended to orbit the earth.

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will cover the necessary concepts and mathematics to study orbital motion. This book will focus on theory, although with a strong focus on practical applications of that theory. This book will focus on the earth and spacial objects that interact with earth including the sun, the moon, comets, asteroids, man-made orbital satellites, and ballistic missiles. 

This book will not cover astronomy or astrophysics in a general sense.

== Who Is This Book For? ==

This book is for engineers and physicists alike. It will be directed towards undergraduate students in a science or engineering program, who have had at least 1 semester of physics and two or three semesters of calculus.

== What Are The Prerequisites? ==

Readers of this book should be familiar with vector calculus and multi-variable calculus. Readers should know and understand calculus-based physics of motion. This book will not discuss vectors, vector arithmetic, vector calculus, multi-variable calculus, or basic physics. For those topics, you should consult the following books:

* [[Calculus]]
* [[Modern Physics]]
* [[Engineering Analysis]]

Readers who are unfamiliar with vector calculus will be at an extreme disadvantage when reading this book, and are encouraged to read the necessary passages of [[Calculus]] first. Because of the frequent use of conic sections, the student may also wish to read [[Conic Sections]] as well.

== Mathematical Notation ==

This book will use a simplified notation to express equations.

*Complicated mathematical formulae that need to be rendered with LaTeX will be moved to a new line, and indented. Important equations like this will be labeled on the right. Rendered equations should never be in-line with text in a paragraph, because the spacing is different.
*Scalar values or scalar-valued functions will be written in lower-case italics, such as ''i''. Because nearly everything in astrodynamics is a function of time, we will leave off the argument ''(t)'' from our functions. I.e. we will write the distance of a satellite from earth as ''r'' even though it's the function of time ''r(t)''.
*Greek or other non-Latin characters will not be made italic, because they are difficult to see in the body of text.
*Vectors and vector-valued functions will be written in bold. For example, '''r''' is a position vector. If the vector changes with time, the ''(t)'' will be implied. If we use a scalar and a vector with the same letter in the same place, such as ''r'' and '''r''', we know that the scalar value is the euclidean distance of the vector:
:&lt;math&gt;r = |\bold{r}|&lt;/math&gt;
*Time derivatives of functions will be expressed in dot notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bold{r}} = \frac{d\bold{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}|\bold{r}|\neq\left|\frac{d\bold{r}}{dt}\right|&lt;/math&gt;

== Wikipedia ==

Astrodynamics is a large topic, and there is no way to discuss all information of peripheral interest. This book will link extensively to related articles in '''Wikipedia'''. Links to Wikipedia articles represent departure points for additional reading, and are not required for the understanding of material in this book. Also, articles in Wikipedia are written with a different styles, and frequently with different terms and mathematical notation as is used in this book. This book uses a consistent vocabulary and mathematical notation, and no attempt will be made to synchronize this book with any Wikipedia articles.</text>

== History of Astrodynamics ==

The study of the sun, moon, and stars has been a subject of prominence among humans for many thousands of years. Because the revolution of the earth and other planets around the sun, and the daily rotation of the earth on its axis create regular patterns of motion, the study of the stars and planets was used as a method to tell time. The location of the north star, polaris, and the constellation &quot;the southern cross&quot; were used by ocean navigators to travel the seas in the times before magnetic compasses. Many religious ceremonies and beliefs also grew around the stars and their constellations.

The study of the motions of the stars and planets has also been a major driving force behind mathematics and science. Some of the fruits of this study are the optical lense (for use in telescopes) and the field of calculus. Many modern inventions and technologies were also furthered because of modern space exploration.  It is for all these reasons that we are studying astrodynamics.

== Early History ==

Since ancient times, the heavens have been studied.  It was known by the 2nd millennium BC, that certain lights in the night sky did not remain fixed with respect to the background stars. The Ancient Greeks referred to these as ''planetes asteres'', &quot;wandering stars&quot; and their motions were studied extensively, even in ancient times. Theories of their motions eventually culminated in the third century with the ''Almagest'', written by Claudius Ptolemy.  The '''Ptolemaic system''' placed earth at the center of the universe with seven planets (the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) which revolved about the earth on successively larger crystalline spheres which were again bounded by the sphere of fixed stars. Complex motions of the planets were explained via epicycles, which will not be discussed in great depth here.  Despite modern understanding of the flaws in the Ptolemaic system, it was fairly accurate and remained the basis of astronomy and cosmology until the 17th century.

== The Renaissance ==

Nickolaus Copernicus, having taken several measurements of the motions of various planets, came to the conclusion that the sun was the center of the universe, and that the earth rotated around the sun. Copernicus' model also assumed that the orbits of the planets were circular, which left a few inconsistencies from his measurements, but the model was much more simplistic then the Ptolemaic model.

Urban myth holds that Copernicus' theory was dismissed by the Catholic Church, when in reality Copernicus' book was funded by a church cardinal, and was dedicated to the current pope. It wasn't for nearly 100 years later, after Kepler had begun publishing that the church denounced the idea as heretical. 

150 years after Copernicus, Galileo Galilei began to observe the heavens with a telescope that he constructed; contrary to popular belief, he did not invent the telescope, but he was the first to use it for astronomical purposes. He made several discoveries including the four largest moons of Jupiter, phases of Venus, sunspots, rings of Saturn and the topography of the moon. These discoveries challenged long held notions that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the planets were perfect ethereal spheres.

Galileo also helped lay the groundwork of the concepts of kinematics and inertial coordinate frames, both of which are important foundations of Classical Mechanics.

== Johannes Kepler ==

{{Wikipedia|Tycho Brahe}}
'''Tycho Brahe''', a Danish nobleman, was a keen observer and machinist, and used his talents to compile a listing of the most accurate observations of stars and planets that had ever been taken up to that point. However, Brahe lacked the intuition to fit that data to a mathematical model. Brahe's assistant, '''Johannes Kepler''', an accomplished mathematician was tasked with using the data to compute future positions of the planets.
{{Wikipedia|Johannes Kepler}}
Following Brahe's death, Kepler inherited the body of data which he used to derive laws to accurately describe the motions of the planets. While Kepler did not understand the physical basis behind his discoveries, his three laws of planetary motion still bear his name today.

== Isaac Newton ==
{{Wikipedia|Isaac Newton}}
'''Isaac Newton''', the famous mathematician and physicist, used his new invention calculus to derive the orbital motion of a planet as an ellipse. However, it wasn't until after being prodded by '''Edmond Halley''', a fellow scientist, that he was persuaded to publish his work, ''Principia Mathematica'' with his results. 
{{Wikipedia|Edmund Halley}}
Halley, Newton's only contemporary that was able to understand the new calculus, was able to use Newtons results to predict the path and the time of return for the comet that still bears his name.

== Lagrange and Gauss ==

Gauss is known as an amazing mathematician, but many of the results he produced were due to his study of astronomy. Gauss developed many of the mathematical tools that we use today to study orbits. One of his developments, ''Least Mean Squares'' curve fitting, was developed to apply an orbit to a series of inexact measurements, but has since found uses in nearly every branch of engineering, science, and mathematics.

== Einstein and Relativity ==
In the early 20th century, understanding of physics was again revolutionized, this time by Albert Einstein with his Theory of Relativity. The special theory, published in 1905, posits that the speed of light is constant for all inertial frames of reference, which has the effect of unifying the concepts of space and time and also the concepts of mass and energy. The general theory, published in 1917, expanding relativity beyond inertial reference frames describes gravity as a curvature in space-time resulting from the presence of matter and energy.  Relativity has withstood numerous tests and experiments and remains one of the pillars of modern physics.

However, in most applications (including astrodynamics), Newtonian physics serves as a sufficient description of the motion of bodies and the effects of relativity can be ignored. Notable exceptions to this are GPS systems with rely on extremely precise time signals and must account for slight time dilation that occurs as a result of relativistic physics. Another notable example from celestial mechanics is the orbit of Mercury, which experiences precessional effects that cannot be explained by classical physics.</text>

'''The Handstand Push-Up''' is similar to a regular push up, but requires more balance and strength. It strengthens core, back and upper body muscles.

==Steps==
# Place palms on the floor and lean.
# Place the top of your head against the floor between your palms creating a triangle.
# Lean your body up until only your hands and head are touching the floor.
# Push your head off the floor until only your hands are holding you up.
# Keep yourself balanced while going down to the floor and pushing back up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Astrodynamics}}

== N-Body Problem ==
Newton's law of universal gravitation only accounts for two bodies, ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, in space there are frequently more bodies to be concerned with. We can generalize the problem to say that there is a number ''N'' bodies to deal with, and create an equation that can deal with an arbitrary number of bodies.

All of the bodies together are known as a '''system of bodies'''.

When studying the N-body problem, it is important to focus on a single body, whose motion is of primary interest. We assume that this body, known as the ''i''th body is able to move freely, but the other ''N - 1'' bodies are stationary. The force of gravity between a random body ''n'' and the body ''i'' is given by the law of universal gravitation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_{gn} = -\frac{Gm_im_n}{r_{ni}^3}\bold{r}_{ni}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance vector between object ''n'' and object ''i''. We can express this vector in terms of the location vectors of the two bodies:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r}_{ni} = \bold{r}_i - \bold{r}_n&lt;/math&gt;

The total force of gravity on the ''i''th object is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_g = -\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\frac{Gm_im_k}{r_{ki}^3}\bold{r}_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that the force of gravity on the ''i''th body from the ''i''th body (the force of gravity on itself) must be zero. We can also define a new force vector, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; that consists of all the force elements that can act on a body, besides gravity. Some of these elements are drag, solar radiation pressure, magnetic field pressure, and thrust (in the case of a man-made satellite or rocket). We can define the total force on the object, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; as a sum of the gravitational force and the other forces:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_T = \bold{F}_{gn} + \bold{F}_O&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling Newton's second law, the complete equation of motion of a particle in the N-body system is:

:&lt;math&gt;m_i\ddot{\bold{r}}_i=-\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\frac{Gm_im_k}{r_{ki}^3}\bold{r}_{ki}+\bold{F}_O&lt;/math&gt;

==Simplified Two Body Problem==
[[File:Orbital Equations Figure 2.png|300px|thumb]]
[[File:Orbital Equations Figure 3.png|300px|thumb]]
The equation of motion in its general form is impossible to solve. In the context of astrodynamics, it is generally sufficient to deal with only two bodies at a time, and the equation of motion becomes significantly easier to solve. Solutions also exist for certain three-body systems, which will be discussed in later chapters.

To solve for the motion of an object in a two body system, two simplifying assumptions can be made:
:1. The bodies are spherically symmetric and can be treated as point masses.
:2. There are no external or internal forces acting upon the bodies other than their mutual gravitation.

The shapes of large celestial bodies are close to spheres. By symmetry, the net gravitational force attracting a mass point towards a homogeneous sphere must be directed towards its centre. The shell theorem (also proven by Isaac Newton) states that the magnitude of this force is the same as if all mass was concentrated in the middle of the sphere, even if the density of the sphere varies with depth (as it does for most celestial bodies). From this immediately follows that the attraction between two homogeneous spheres is as if both had its mass concentrated to its center.

Smaller objects, like asteroids or spacecraft often have a shape strongly deviating from a sphere. But the gravitational forces produced by these irregularities are generally small compared to the gravity of the central body. The difference between an irregular shape and a perfect sphere also diminishes with distances, and most orbital distances are very large when compared with the diameter of a small orbiting body. Thus for some applications, shape irregularity can be neglected without significant impact on accuracy.

Planets rotate at varying rates and thus may take a slightly oblate shape because of the centrifugal force. With such an oblate shape, the gravitational attraction will deviate somewhat from that of a homogeneous sphere. This phenomenon is quite noticeable for artificial Earth satellites, especially those in low orbits. At larger distances the effect of this oblateness becomes negligible. Planetary motions in the Solar System can be computed with sufficient precision if they are treated as point masses.

Two point mass objects with masses ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and position vectors '''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' relative to some inertial frame of reference experience gravitational forces:

:&lt;math&gt; m_1 \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = \frac{-G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; m_2 \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_2 = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the relative position vector of mass 1 with respect to mass 2, expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;


Dividing by their respective masses and subtracting the second equation from the first yields the equation of motion for the acceleration of the first object with respect to the second:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = - \frac{\mu}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;mu;'' is the gravitational parameter and is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = G(m_1 + m_2)&lt;/math&gt;

In many applications, a third simplifying assumption can be made:
:3. When compared to the central body, the mass of the orbiting body is insignificant. Mathematically, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so ''&amp;mu;'' = ''G'' (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;asymp; ''Gm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
This assumption is not necessary to solve the simplified two body problem, but it simplifies calculations, particularly with Earth-orbiting satellites and planets orbiting the sun. Even Jupiter's mass is less than the sun's by a factor of 1047, which would constitute an error of 0.096% in the value of &amp;mu;. Notable exceptions include the Earth-moon system (mass ratio of 81.3), the Pluto-Charon system (mass ratio of 8.9) and binary star systems.

Under these assumptions the differential equation for the two body case can be completely solved mathematically and the resulting orbit follows Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The orbits of all planets are to high accuracy Kepler orbits around the Sun. The small deviations are due to the much weaker gravitational attractions between the planets, and in the case of Mercury, due to general relativity. The orbits of the artificial satellites around the Earth are, with a fair approximation, Kepler orbits with small perturbations due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, the moon and the oblateness of the Earth. In high accuracy applications for which the equation of motion must be integrated numerically with all gravitational and non-gravitational forces (such as solar radiation pressure and drag) being taken into account, the Kepler orbit concepts are of paramount importance and heavily used.

{{Wikipedia|Earth}}

The Earth is an object of special importance, not because it has any special characteristics, but because it is our starting point. All satellites that we lauch start on the surface of earth, and all our observations are made from the surface of earth. The only exception to the second rule is that some observations are made from satellites that have been previously launched from earth. Most of the practical applications of astrodynamics are centered around the earth (orbiting satellites, ballistic missiles, etc.), and so we will focus much of our attention on it. 

== Size and Shape ==

While it is typically thought that the earth is a sphere, it is not. The radius of the earth is over 21 kilometers longer at the equator then it is at the poles. This is known as the ''equatorial bulge'' of the earth, and can affect some of our more precise calculations. We will discuss the effects of this bulge later when we have developed more theory.

== Orbit and Rotation ==

One earth rotation on its axis, such that the sun is at the same place in the sky, is known as a solar day. A solar day is 24 hours by definition.

The period of the Earth's rotation is known as a solar year. A solar year is equal to 365.25 solar days.

The Earth's orbital plane is not parallel with the Earth's equator. This tilt in the orbital plane causes the seasons. 

[[Image:North season.jpg|center|400px]]

=== Equinoxes ===

{{Wikipedia|Equinox}}

When the sun appears directly over the equator, and the day is the same length as the night, it is called the '''equinox'''. The equinox between the months of March and April is known as the '''vernal equinox'''. The autumnal equinox is the transition between the months of September and October.

The equator around the center of the earth is a circle, if we cut the earth in half. If we extend this circle out to infinity, we have the equatorial plane. Anything on the equatorial plane appears directly overhead to a person standing on the equator.

== Canonical Units ==

{{Wikipedia|Astronomical Unit}}

The distance between the earth and the sun can be difficult to measure, and the units involved can make calculations difficult. However, we can define a new unit, the '''astronomical unit''' (AU) that is the average distance between the earth and the sun. 1 AU = 149 597 870.691 km.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Solar time}}
{{Wikipedia|Sidereal time}}
{{Wikipedia|Universal Time}}
{{Wikipedia|International Atomic Time}}
Time is a fundamental quantity in physics, and nearly all of our equations deal either directly or indirectly with the passage of time. 

== Solar Day ==



A solar day is the time it takes for the Earth to make one complete rotation about its axis with respect to the sun. With respect to inertial space, a solar day equates to approximately 360.986&amp;deg; of rotation. Because of the Earth's slightly elliptical orbit and the obliquity of its rotation axis with respect to its orbital plane, the time between successive transits of the sun are not identical. The sun occasionally lags or leads the mean value of its position in the sky. Thus two types of solar time exist: apparent and mean. Apparent solar time refers to the absolute position of the sun in the sky. Mean solar time refers to the position of the mean sun, which divides the day into 24 hours.

== Sidereal Day ==


[[Image:Tiempo sidéreo.en.png|framed|right|An illustration of the difference between the solar day and the sidereal day. ''Right'': The sun and a distant star initially transit the local meridian at the same time. ''Center'': after the Earth has rotated 360&amp;deg; in inertial space, the star transits again, but because of the Earth's motion around the sun, the sun appears to have moved with respect to the background stars. ''Left'': 24 hours have passed since the first transit and the sun once again crosses the meridian.]]

The sidereal day is the length of time it takes the earth to make one complete rotation with respect to the stars. A sidereal day is slightly shorter than a solar day: 23&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;56&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;04&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.09054 of mean solar time, or 0.9972695664 mean solar days.

To complicate matters slightly, sidereal time is also expressed in hours, minutes and seconds. Thus one solar day is equal to 24&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;03&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;56&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.55536 of sidereal time or 1.0027379093 sidereal days. Sidereal time can best be understood as an angular measure of the Earth's orientation. Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (GMST) is the sidereal time at the prime meridian and is essentially the angle between the vernal equinox direction and the vector pointing from the Earth's center to the crossing of the prime meridian and the equator.

== Universal Time ==
Universal Time (UTC) is basically the mean solar time at the prime meridian. It is based solely on the rotation of the Earth with respect to background stars. 

It is related to International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a high precision time base based on a weighted average of atomic clocks at national laboratories around the world. Because the rotation of the Earth is non-uniform, periodically leap seconds must be added or subtracted to convert to UTC. Because the rotation of the Earth is slowing gradually with time due to tidal effects from the moon, leap seconds have only ever been added. Since June 30, 2012, TAI is exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC.

== Converting from Universal to Sidereal ==

Sidereal time can be approximated from the current date and universal time to within 0.1 seconds by the following equation&lt;ref&gt;http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/GAST.php&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;GMST = 6.697374558 + 0.06570982441908 D_0 + 1.00273790935 H + 0.000026 T^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt; D_0 = JD_0-2451545.0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D = JD-2451545.0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T = D/36525&lt;/math&gt;

The '''H''' term is the current universal time.  '''JD''' is the current Julian date and '''JD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the exact Julian date of the previous midnight, this value will end with .5.  Generally, the final term can be omitted as it accounts for variations that occur over the course of centuries.

To use this equation, one must be familiar with the concept of Julian dates. The concept was introduced in the 16th century as a way to keep track of astronomical events without needing to deal with complex calculations relating to calendar dates. The Julian date is a running count of days elapsed since noon on January 1, 4713BC. Fractions of the day are expressed as a decimal value. Conversion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day#Converting_Julian_or_Gregorian_calendar_date_to_Julian_Day_Number algorithms exist for converting calendar date to Julian date], but they can be quite complicated and will not be discussed here.  Below is a reference chart of Julian dates at noon on January 1st of several years&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/&lt;/ref&gt;. The Julian day number can be calculated by adding the day number of the year and subtracting 1. Please note that Julian dates are integer values at noon, ''NOT'' at midnight

==Coordinate Systems==
Before orbits can be discussed, it is necessary to define the coordinate systems that will be used to describe them. Multiple systems are used in the study of space, and by extension astrodynamics.

Every coordinate system consists of three mutually perpendicular axes that describe the three-dimensional coordinates of all points in space. Each particular system is defined by three geometric objects: an origin, a reference direction and a fundamental plane. The origin defines the center from which the axes originate, three options for origins will be discussed in detail here: topocentric, geocentric and heliocentric. The reference direction defines the x-axis. The fundamental plane contains the x-axis and defines the z-axis as the direction normal to the plane. The y-axis completes the right-hand system defined by the other two vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{\hat{z}} \times \mathbf{\hat{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

Positions in these systems may be expressed either as spherical or rectangular coordinates. Generally, spherical coordinates are used in astronomy and other ground based observations where objects are sufficiently far away to not have discernible parallax.

One can define coordinate systems centered on planets and other large bodies, but these are analogous to geocentric coordinate systems and will not be discussed in great detail. Additional astronomical coordinate systems have been defined, such as galactic and supergalactic, but these are currently of little practical use in astrodynamics.

== Topocentric-Horizon ==
The '''topocentric-horizon''' system, also known as the &quot;SEZ&quot; system is a system of coordinates for use by observers on the surface of the earth. The surface of the observer forms the fundamental plane, that is tangent to the surface of the earth. The positive horizontal vector '''S''' is due south , the positive horizontal vector '''E''' is east, and the vector  '''Z''' normal to the surface of the earth (up) is the third axis. Notice that the unit vectors change with time, which means that the topocentric-horizon system is a non-inertial system. 

We can introduce a new vector, the vector '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the position vector from the center of the earth to a point on the surface of the earth. It is important to note that the length of this vector is not a constant, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere. The '''Z''' vector, which is normal to the surface of the earth does not necessarily pass through the center of the earth, and so it cannot be used to define the '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; vector.

== Geocentric-Equatorial ==
{{Wikipedia|Geocentric coordinates}}
The '''geocentric-equatorial''' coordinate system uses the center of the earth as the origin, and uses the circle of the Earth's equator as the fundamental plane with the positive vertical axis is the north pole of the earth. Two different coordinate frames are generally employed: the Earth-centered, Earth fixed (ECEF) frame, which is non-inertial; and the Earth-centered Inertial (ECI) frame, which in inertial.

=== Earth-centered, Earth Fixed (ECEF)===
{{Wikipedia|ECEF}}

=== Earth-centered inertial (ECI)===
{{Wikipedia|Earth-centered inertial}}
The ECI system is fixed in space, and does not rotate with the earth. The unit vectors that we will be using with the geocentric-equatorial system are '''I''' (for the vernal direction), '''J''' for the second direction in the equatorial plane), and '''K''' (for the direction of the north pole). 

== Ecliptic ==
{{Wikipedia|Ecliptic coordinate system}}
The '''heliocentric-ecliptic''' coordinate system uses the center of the sun as the origin, and is supremely useful for discussing orbits where the sun is the prime focus. The Earth's orbit forms the fundamental plane, and the vertical axis is the normal vector to that fundamental plane.

== Perifocal ==
The perifocal coordinate system is used to describe a satellite's position within its orbit. In a completely unperturbed orbit, the motion of the satellite is completely confined to one plane of motion, the perifocal system reduces orbital motion from three dimensions to two dimensions, greatly simplifying computations. This is most useful in the process of orbit propagation. Coordiantes for the perifocal system are generally expressed as '''PQW'''. The fundamental plane is the orbital plane. The '''P''' vector points from the prime focus to the periapsis point. The '''Q''' vector is in the fundamental plane, rotated 90&amp;deg; from the '''P''' vector, in the direction of the orbital motion. The '''W''' vector is normal to the orbital plane, and points in the direction of the angular momentum, '''h'''. Position and velocity vectors exist entirely within the orbital plane and thus can be described exclusively in terms of '''P''' and '''Q'''.

== Coordinate Transformations ==

== Noninertial Derivatives ==

A problem arises when we have two coordinate systems, the first is a fixed system (a, b, c) and the second is rotating with respect to the first and is (d, e, f). We know that (d, e, f) is rotating in (a, b, c) with an angular velocity vector '''&amp;omega;'''. That is, we can say:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{D}' = \bold{\omega}\times\bold{D}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{E}' = \bold{\omega}\times\bold{E}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}' = \bold{\omega}\times\bold{F}&lt;/math&gt;

We have a vector '''X''' that is defined in both systems:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{X} = X_a\bold{A} + X_b\bold{B} + X_c\bold{C} = X_d\bold{D} + X_e\bold{E} + X_f\bold{F}&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of '''A''' can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\bold{A}|_{(a, b, c)} = \frac{d}{dt}\bold{A}|_{(d, e, f)} + \bold{\omega} \times \bold{A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Specific Energy and Angular Momentum ==
Angular momentum, kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy are all proportional to the mass of the orbiting body. However, the topic of orbital mechanics it is more convenient to discuss the specific angular momentum and specific energy which are simply the angular momentum and energy per unit mass. Thus two objects in identical orbits may have very different masses, but will have the same specific angular momentum and the same specific energy (assuming, of course, that the masses of both bodies are negligible compared to the mass of the central body). Throughout this text, unless otherwise noted, the terms &quot;angular momentum&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; will refer to their specific counterparts.

== Conservation of Angular Momentum ==

We already have two fundamental vectors that are used to analyze orbits: the position vector '''r''', and the velocity vector '''v'''. We know from basic Newtonian mechanics that the velocity vector is the time-derivative of the position vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bold{r}} = \bold{v}&lt;/math&gt;

And that:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{r} = v&lt;/math&gt;

Starting with our motion equation we derived earlier, we can derive  the angular momentum of the body.

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\bold{r}} + \frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We use the cross-product with the position vector '''r''' on both sides of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} \times \ddot{\bold{r}} + \bold{r} \times \frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The second term cancels out because we know that '''r''' &amp;times; '''r''' ''= 0''.

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} \times \ddot{\bold{r}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

{{TextBox|As an aside, consider the following derivative, obtained using the product rule from calculus:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(\bold{x} \times \dot{\bold{x}}) = \dot{\bold{x}} \times \dot{\bold{x}} + \bold{x} \times \ddot{\bold{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term cancels because both vectors in the cross product are the same. We are left with the result:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} (\bold{x} \times \dot{\bold{x}}) = \bold{x} \times \ddot{\bold{x}}&lt;/math&gt;}}

We can substitute our above results into our equation to produce:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(\bold{r} \times \dot{\bold{r}})}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Because the derivative is zero, we know that the result must be a constant. We can integrate both sides, introducing the constant vector of integration, '''h''':

{{eqn|Angular Momentum Vector}}
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} \times \bold{v} = \bold{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Because we know that '''h''' is a constant, this equation shows that angular momentum is conserved in an orbital system. This constant is known as the ''angular momentum'' of the orbit, and is highly important in future calculations.

=== Meaning of '''h''' ===

'''h''' is a vector that is perpendicular to both '''r''' and '''v'''. '''r''' and '''v''' are both located in a single plane, known as the '''orbital plane'''. The entire orbit is located in this plane. However, the vector '''h''' is normal to the orbital plane, which means that it is perpendicular to the orbital plane. The scalar value ''h'' is the magnitude of this vector, and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;h = |\bold{h}|&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alternate Definitions of h ===

The magnitude value ''h'' can be derived from the magnitude values ''r'' and ''v'' as such:

:&lt;math&gt;h=rv\cos\phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h=rv\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;gamma; is the angle between the vectors '''r''' and '''v''', and &amp;phi; is the compliment of &amp;gamma;. &amp;phi; is known as the ''flight angle'' of the satellite. &amp;gamma; is known as the ''zenith angle''.

== Conservation of Energy ==

Similar to the angular momentum, we can derive the conservation of energy equation. Instead of performing a cross product on both sides by the position vector '''r''', we can perform the dot product by the velocity vector '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bold{r}} \cdot \ddot{\bold{r}} + \dot{\bold{r}} \cdot \frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the second derivative of '''r''' is the same as the first derivative of '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{v} \cdot \dot{\bold{v}} + \frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r} \cdot \dot{\bold{r}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In general, a result of the dot product is that:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{x} \cdot \dot{\bold{x}} = x\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

We can apply this result to our equation:

:&lt;math&gt;v\dot{v} + \frac{\mu}{r^3}r\dot{r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

From the chain rule, we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{v^2}{2} = v\dot{v}&lt;/math&gt;

And:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{r^2}\dot{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these results into our equation gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

To generalize the equation, an additional constant term ''c'' must be added:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} +c \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the derivative is equal to zero, so we know that the function has a constant value. We integrate both sides, and we call our new constant of integration the ''energy'' of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} + c&lt;/math&gt;


=== Kinetic Energy ===

From classical mechanics, the first term van be identified as the '''specific kinetic energy''' of the moving body:
{{eqn|Kinetic Energy}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_k = \frac{v^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the amount of work necessary to accelerate the body from a state of rest to its current velocity.

=== Potential Energy ===
The second and third term combined represent the '''specific potential energy''' of the moving body:
{{eqn|Potential Energy}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_p = -\frac{\mu}{r} + c&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the amount of work necessary to move the body from a given reference distance to its current distance from the center of the central body. The reference distance is defined by the ''c'' term in the equation. For instance, to define the surface of the Earth as having zero potential energy, ''c'' would be set to equal &amp;mu;/''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radius of the Earth. In this particular case, bodies below the radius of the earth would have negative potential energy and bodies above would have positive potential energy. It is most convenient, however, to set the reference distance to be infinite, which reduces the expression for the potential energy to:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_p = -\frac{\mu}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
This will result in potential energy values that are globally negative. This may seem counter-intuitive at first, but calculations are greatly simplified.

=== Total Mechanical Energy ===
The expression for the '''total specific mechanical energy''' of the system thus becomes:
{{eqn|Total Mechanical Energy}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
This quantity is important in determining the shape of the orbit and will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.

==Derivation of Kepler's Laws from Newton's Laws==
Now that the constants of motion have been defined, it is possible to derive Kepler's laws from Newton's laws of motion and gravitation.
===First Law===
As stated previously, the equation of motion for an object in the restricted two body problem is:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\bold{r}} = -\frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r}&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the cross product of both sides with the angular momentume vector yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h} = -\frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r}\times\bold{h}&lt;/math&gt;
Because the h vector does not change with time, the left side is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h} = \ddot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h}+\dot{\bold{r}}\times\dot{\bold{h}}=\frac{d}{dt}(\dot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h})&lt;/math&gt;
Meanwhile the left side becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\mu}{r^3}\bold{r}\times(\bold{r}\times\dot{\bold{r}})=-\frac{\mu}{r^3}\left(\bold{r}(\dot{\bold{r}}\cdot\bold{r})-\dot{\bold{r}}(\bold{r}\cdot\bold{r})\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\mu}{r^3}\left(\dot{\bold{r}}r^2-\bold{r}r\dot{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\mu\left(\frac{\dot{\bold{r}}}{r}-\frac{\bold{r}\dot{r}}{r^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\mu\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\bold{r}}{r}+\bold{B}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''B''' is a constant of integration. Thus the equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h}=\mu\frac{\bold{r}}{r}+\bold{B}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the dot product of both sides with '''r''':
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r}\cdot(\dot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h}) = \mu r+\bold{B}\cdot\bold{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling properties of triple vector products:
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r}\cdot(\dot{\bold{r}}\times\bold{h})=\bold{h}\cdot(\bold{r}\times\dot{\bold{r}})=\bold{h}\cdot\bold{h}=h^2&lt;/math&gt;
The equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;h^2=\mu r+Br\cos\nu&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging the equation:
{{eqn|Trajectory Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;r(\nu)=\frac{h^2/\mu}{1+B/\mu\cos\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
This equation is identical to the polar equation of a conic section centered at one focus:
:&lt;math&gt;r(\theta)=\frac{p}{1+e\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''e'' is the eccentricity of the conic section and ''p'' is the semi-latus rectum of the conic section. For an ellipse:
:&lt;math&gt;p=a(1-e^2)&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''a'' is the semi-major axis.

This derivation shows that in addition to elliptical orbits, a body is also capable of parabolic or hyperbolic trajectories (both of which will be discussed shortly). Thus, stated generally, Kepler's first law becomes:
:The trajectory of an object in a gravitational field is a conic section with the central body at one focus

===Second Law===
The angular momentum vector:
:&lt;math&gt;||\bold{h}||=||\bold{r}\times\bold{v}||=rv\cos\phi&lt;/math&gt;
Where &amp;phi; is the flight path angle and ''v''cos&amp;phi; is the component of the velocity vector which is normal to the position vector. From polar calculus, this can be re-expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;v\cos\phi=r\dot\nu&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the equation for angular momentum becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;h=r^2\frac{d\nu}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
Recalling from calculus, the differential element of area in polar form is:
:&lt;math&gt;dA=\frac{r^2d\nu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Combining these equations gives:
{{eqn|Kepler's Second Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{h}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
The angular momentum is already known to be constant in the restricted two body problem, so this is the mathematical expression of Kepler's second law. This equation holds true for parabolic and hyperbolic as well as elliptical trajectories.

===Third Law===
Because the third law only deals with closed orbits, it is only valid for elliptical orbits. The result from the previous section can be rewritten as:
:&lt;math&gt;dA=\frac{h}{2}dt&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating both sides over one complete orbit yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi ab = \frac{h}{2}T&lt;/math&gt;
Where &amp;pi;''ab'' is the area enclosed by the entire ellipse and ''T'' is the orbital period. The semi-minor axis can be rewritten in terms of semi-latus rectum and semi-major axis:
:&lt;math&gt;b = \sqrt{a^2(1-e^2)}=\sqrt{ap}&lt;/math&gt;
Recall that angular momentum is related to the semi-latus rectum via:
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{h^2}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
Combining these equations and reducing gives the expression for orbital period:
{{eqn|Period of an Elliptical Orbit}}
:&lt;math&gt;T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;
Which can be reduced to Kepler's third law:
{{eqn|Kepler's Third Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;T^2\propto a^3&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== Trajectory Equation ==

The '''trajectory equation''', which gives us the shape of the orbit is given as:

{{eqn|Trajectory Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\frac{h^2}{\mu}}{1 + \frac{B}{\mu}\cos\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''B'' is a constant of integration, and &amp;nu; (Greek letter ''nu'') is the angle between the semi-major axis and the position vector '''r'''.

== Conic Sections ==

Let us digress a little bit from the theory of an orbit, and discuss conic sections. People are typically familiar with conic sections (circle, elipse, parabola, hyperbola) from studying elementary algebra. However, the form in which most people are not familiar with these conic sections is in the standard cartesian coordinate system. If we use a polar coordinate system instead, we can see that the conic sections all have a similar equation format. We can generalize, and say that all conic sections have the following polar equation:

{{eqn|Conic Section Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{p}{1 + e\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''r'' is the radius, and &amp;theta; is the angle. As &amp;theta; travels around the circle, the value for ''r'' changes and the resulting points create the necessary conic sections. The variable ''p'' is known as the '''parameter''', and the variable ''e'' is known as the '''eccentricity'''. We will discuss these variables, and describe how they relate to the trajectory equation below.

=== Parameter ===

Comparing the trajectory equation and the conic section equation, we can see that:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{h^2}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

the variable ''p'' is a measure of the size of the conic section. Larger ''p'' means the orbit is larger. We can see that the size of an orbit is directly proportional to how much angular momentum the satellite has. Because of this relationship, we can get the vague sense that the more speed a satellite has, the larger the resulting orbit will be.

=== Eccentricity ===

The value for ''e'', the eccentricity, determines the shape the orbit will take. This table shows the various values for ''e'', and the resulting shape of the conic section:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!''e''
!Shape
|-
|&lt;math&gt;e = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|Circle
|-
|&lt;math&gt;e &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
|Elipse
|-
|&lt;math&gt;e = 1&lt;/math&gt;
|Parabola
|-
|&lt;math&gt;e &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
|Hyperbola
|}

Looking at our conic section equation, and the trajectory equation, we can see that:

:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{B}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

We know that ''B'' is just a constant of integration that doesnt correspond to any natural quantity. We can calculate ''e'' directly without having to calculate ''B'' first. We can relate ''e'' to the energy and the angular momentum of the satellite by:

:&lt;math&gt;e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2\mathcal{E}h^2}{\mu^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also relate ''e'' and ''p'' together, using the length of the semi-major axis, ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; p = a(1-e^2)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Eccentricity Vector ===

We can also define an eccentricity vector, '''e''', as:

{{eqn|Eccentricity Vector}}
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{e} = \frac{\bold{v} \times \bold{h}}{\mu} - \frac{\bold{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

This vector has the property that:

:&lt;math&gt;e = |\bold{e}|&lt;/math&gt;

And that '''e''' points towards the periapsis point (described below).

== Orbits ==

We can see that the trajectory equation is in the form of a conic section, and because of this form it's actually possible to have orbits in the shape of any conic section. We will discuss some of them below.

=== Elliptical ===

An elliptical orbit is an orbit with eccentricity ''e &lt; 1''. Elliptical orbits are some of the most common orbits, and nearly all bodies that travel around the sun have elliptical orbits.

We know from the equations for ''p'' that the speed of the satellite affects the size of the orbit. We also know from the equation relating ''p'' and ''e'' that the speed can affect the shape of the orbit. Putting a satellite into a certain orbit then is a matter of giving the satellite the correct speed for that orbit. An elliptical orbit is an orbit that is created by a speed less than the '''escape speed'''. The escape speed, which we will talk about below, is the speed at which a satellite breaks free from the gravity of the prime focus and forms a parabolic or elliptical orbit.

There is a particular speed known as the '''circular speed''' at which an elliptical orbit becomes a perfect circle. All other speeds, besides the circular speed and below the escape velocity create an elliptical orbit.

The values for these speeds can be calculated by plugging in the appropriate values into the trajectory equation to create the desired conic section, and then solving for the kinetic energy. We will omit the derivations here.

{{TextBox|'''Example: Earth's Orbit'''

Earths orbit is elliptical, although the two foci are relatively close together giving earth an orbit that is nearly circular. Because space is a vacuum and there is no appreciable drag or friction, the speed of the earth is constant and the orbit of earth is, therefore, constant. Mathematically, the earth will never spiral into the sun.}}

[[Image:Elliptic orbit.gif|center]]

=== Circular ===

A circular orbit is an orbit with eccentricity ''e = 0''. A circle is a special case of the ellipse. Circular orbits are difficult to obtain, but not impossible. The speed necessary to maintain a circular orbit is known as '''circular speed'''. We can define circular speed as:

{{eqn|Circular Speed}}
:&lt;math&gt;v_{cs} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''r'' in this case is the radius of the circular orbit.

{{TextBox|'''Example: Geostationary Satellites'''

Geostationary satellites are placed in one particular orbit where the period is exactly equal to the rotational speed of the Earth. In this sense, the Geostationary satellite is &quot;stationary&quot; with respect to the surface of the Earth, which proves very useful in communications and metorological applications.

[[Image:Geostat.gif|center]]

}}

=== Parabolic ===

A parabolic orbit is an orbit with eccentricity ''e = 1''. The speed necessary to form a parabolic orbit is known as the '''escape velocity''' ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''. The escape velocity is the minimum speed necessary to escape from the gravitational pull of the primary focus. Notice that when we obtain this minimum escape speed, we break free from the gravity of the prime focus, but our velocity approaches zero:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\infty = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We can define the escape velocity as:

{{eqn|Escape Velocity}}
:&lt;math&gt;v_{er} = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, ''r'' is the distance of the satellite from the primary focus, and ''v&lt;sub&gt;er&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the escape velocity from the point ''r''. For earth the velocity is equal to 2nd escape velocity which is 11.1799 km/s

[[Image:Parabolic orbit.gif|center]]

=== Hyperbolic ===

A hyperbolic orbit has eccentricity ''e &gt; 1''. Hyperbolic orbits are sometimes also known as ''escape orbits'', because a hyperbolic orbit allows a satellite to &quot;break free&quot; from the gravity of the prime focus, while maintaining some velocity. The amount of speed the satellite has over the escape velocity of the parabolic orbit is known as '''excess hyperbolic speed'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' and can be found by comparing to the launch velocity (or the velocity at periapsis) ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;v_l = v_e + v_h&lt;/math&gt;

And compared to the parabolic orbit, we have our final velocity as:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\infty = v_h&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Hyperbolic orbit.gif|center]]

=== Degenerate ===

People familiar with conic sections may recognize that there are also degenerate conics: points and straight lines. Degenerate conics occur for values of ''h = 0'', which means that ''e = 1'' (a parabola), but that the orbit will not be parabolic.

== Apses ==

The line between the focii is known as the major axis (in an ellipse and a hyperbola). The points at the intersection of the curve and the major axis are known as the '''apses'''. The point nearest the primary focus is called the '''periapsis''', and the point nearest to the secondary focus is called the '''apoapsis'''. There are several other words that can be used interchangeably:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Central Body
!Closest Distance
!Furthest Distance
|-
|General
|Periapsis/Pericenter
|Apoapsis/Apocenter
|-
|Earth
|Perigee
|Apogee
|-
|Sun
|Perihelion
|Aphelion
|}
Additional terms exist for other solar system bodies, but these are nore required for the purposes of this text.

Circles do not have points furthest or closest to the center, and so the periapsis and apoapsis are undefined on a circle. The parabola has a periapsis, but the apoapis is considered to be at infinity.

The distance from the prime focus to periapsis can be calculated as:

{{eqn|Distance to Periapsis}}
:&lt;math&gt;r_p = \frac{p}{1 + e} = a(1-e)&lt;/math&gt;

The distance from the prime focus to the apoapsis can be calculated as:

{{eqn|Distance to Apoapsis}}
:&lt;math&gt;r_a = \frac{p}{1-e} = a(1+e)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these equations arise by setting &amp;theta; ''= 0''&amp;deg; or &amp;theta; ''= 180''&amp;deg;, because the periapsis is located at zero degrees, and apoapsis is located at 180 degress.

==Vis-Viva Equation==
Note that the velocities at the apses must necessarily be perpendicular to the position vectors, thus:
:&lt;math&gt;||\bold{r}_p\times\bold{v}_p|| = r_p v_p = h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;||\bold{r}_a\times\bold{v}_a|| = r_a v_a = h&lt;/math&gt;
The following expressions can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{(1+e)}{(1-e)}\frac{\mu}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_a = \sqrt{\frac{(1-e)}{(1+e)}\frac{\mu}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
Recall the expression for specific mechanical energy:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging in values for ''r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''v&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \frac{v_p^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_p}= \frac{v_a^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_a}&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation in terms of ''a'' yields:
{{eqn|Vis-Viva Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}=-\frac{\mu}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;


== Orbital Period ==

The period of an orbit can be given as:

{{eqn|Period of Orbit}}
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2\pi}{\mu}a^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the period only makes sense for an elliptical or circular orbit, because parabolas and hyperbolas never make a full revolution. Notice also that this equation proves Kepler's third law. We can see this by rearranging the exponents:

:&lt;math&gt;T^2 = \frac{(2\pi)^2}{\mu^2}a^3&lt;/math&gt;

Now it's clear that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the major-axis, which is the mean distance from the sun.

The circular orbital period is similar to the elliptical, but with the circle radius, ''r'':

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2\pi}{\mu}r^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== Part 8 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and
disbelief- is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as
you are, that it's better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you
are inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by
telling you that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by
turns, and I have my motive in it. It's the new method. As soon as you
disbelieve in me completely, you'll begin assuring me to my face
that I am not a dream but a reality. I know you. Then I shall have
attained my object, which is an honourable one. I shall sow in you
only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree- and such
an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will long to enter the ranks of
'the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women,' for that is
what you are secretly longing for. You'll dine on locusts, you'll
wander into the wilderness to save your soul!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Then it's for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it,
you scoundrel?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humoured you are!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{-}}
== Part 9 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and
prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with
moss?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;My dear fellow, I've done nothing else. One forgets the whole
world and all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he
is a very precious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes
worth a whole constellation. We have our system of reckoning, you
know. The conquest is priceless! And some of them, on my word, are not
inferior to you in culture, though you won't believe it. They can
contemplate such depths of belief and disbelief at the same moment
that sometimes it really seems that they are within a hair's-breadth
of being 'turned upside down,' as the actor Gorbunov says.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Well, did you get your nose pulled?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; observed the visitor sententiously, &quot;it's better
to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an
afflicted marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated
by a specialist) in confession to his spiritual father- a Jesuit. I
was present, it was simply charming. 'Give me back my nose!' he
said, and he beat his breast. 'My son,' said the priest evasively,
'all things are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable
decrees of Providence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads
to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits. If stern destiny has
deprived you of your nose, it's to your advantage that no one can ever
pull you by your nose.' 'Holy father, that's no comfort,' cried the
despairing marquis. 'I'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every day
of my life, if it were only in its proper place.' 'My son,' sighs
the priest, 'you can't expect every blessing at once. This is
murmuring against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten
you, for if you repine as you repined just now, declaring you'd be
glad to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire
has already been fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose,
you were led by the nose.'&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 10 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Fool, how stupid!&quot; cried Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that's
the genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word for
word as I've told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal
of trouble. The unhappy young man shot himself that very night when he
got home. I was by his side till the very last moment. Those Jesuit
confessionals are really my most delightful diversion at melancholy
moments. Here's another incident that happened only the other day. A
little blonde Norman girl of twenty- a buxom, unsophisticated beauty
that would make your mouth water- comes to an old priest. She bends
down and whispers her sin into the grating. 'Why, my daughter, have
you fallen again already?' cries the priest: 'O Sancta Maria, what
do I hear! Not the same man this time, how long is this going on?
Aren't you ashamed!' 'Ah, mon pere,' answers the sinner with tears
of penitence, 'Ca lui fait tant de plaisir, et a moi si peu de
peine!'* Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of nature,
better than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on the
spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the
priest at the grating making an appointment with her for the
evening- though he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an
instant! It was nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What,
you are turning up your nose again? Angry again? I don't know how to
please you-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ah, my father, this gives him so much pleasure, and me so little
pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting
nightmare,&quot; Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition.
&quot;I am bored with you, agonisingly and insufferably. I would give
anything to be able to shake you off!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{-}}
== Part 11 == 

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand of me
'everything great and noble,' and you'll see how well we shall get
on,&quot; said the gentleman impressively. &quot;You are really angry with me
for not having appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and
lightning, with scorched wings, but have shown myself in such a modest
form. You are wounded, in the first place, in your asthetic
feelings, and, secondly, in your pride. How could such a vulgar
devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is that romantic
strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can't help it,
young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of
appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the
Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I was
positively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me for daring
to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least, the
Polar Star or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid, but,
mercy on us! I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence.
Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil, but did only
good. Well, he can say what he likes, it's quite the opposite with me.
I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and
genuinely desires good. I was there when the Word, Who died on the
Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul of the
penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim singing and
shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim which
shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all that's
sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all.
The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips...
you know how susceptible and aesthetically impressionable I am. But
common sense- oh, a most unhappy trait in my character- kept me in due
bounds and I let the moment pass! For what would have happened, I
reflected, what would have happened after my hosannah? Everything on
earth would have been extinguished at once and no events could have
occurred. And so, solely from a sense of duty and my social
position, was forced to suppress the good moment and to stick to my
nasty task. Somebody takes all the credit of what's good for
Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left for me. But I don't envy
the honour of a life of idle imposture, I am not ambitious. Why am
I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent
people and even to be kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound
to take such consequences sometimes? I know, of course, there's a
secret in it, but they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then
perhaps, seeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the
indispensable minus would disappear at once, and good sense would
reign supreme throughout the whole world. And that, of course, would
mean the end of everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for
who would take them in? I know that at the end of all things I shall
be reconciled. I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret.
But till that happens I am sulking and fulfil my destiny though it's
against the grain- that is, to ruin thousands for the sake of saving
one. How many souls have had to be ruined and how many honourable
reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man, Job,
over whom they made such a fool of me in old days! Yes, till the
secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for me- one, their
truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the other my
own. And there's no knowing which will turn out the better.... Are you
asleep?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 12 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I might well be,&quot; Ivan groaned angrily. &quot;All my stupid ideas-
outgrown, thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass
you present to me as something new!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you
by my literary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn't bad,
was it? And then that ironical tone a la Heine, eh?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget a
flunkey like you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young
Russian gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and
art, the author of a promising poem entitled The Grand Inquisitor. I
was only thinking of him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I forbid you to speak of The Grand Inquisitor,&quot; cried Ivan,
crimson with shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And the Geological Cataclysm. Do you remember? That was a poem,
now!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 13 == 

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Hold your tongue, or I'll kill you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You'll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat
myself to that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young
friends, quivering with eagerness for life! 'There are new men,' you
decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, 'they propose
to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they
didn't ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need be destroyed,
that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man, that's how we
have to set to work. It's that, that we must begin with. Oh, blind
race of men who have no understanding! As soon as men have all of them
denied God- and I believe that period, analogous with geological
periods, will come to pass- the old conception of the universe will
fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what's more, the old
morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take
from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the
present world. Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic
pride and the man-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his
conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science, man will
feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up
for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven. Everyone will know
that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a
god. His pride will teach him that it's useless for him to repine at
life's being a moment, and he will love his brother without need of
reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life, but the
very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire, which
now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave'... and
so on and so on in the same style. Charming!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 14 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to
his ears, but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible
that such a period will ever come? If it does, everything is
determined and humanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man's
inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand
years, everyone who recognises the truth even now may legitimately
order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense,
'all things are lawful' for him. What's more, even if this period
never comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no
immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is
the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position,
he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of
the old slaveman, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God
stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the
foremost place... 'all things are lawful' and that's the end of it!
That's all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a
moral sanction for doing it? But that's our modern Russian all over.
He can't bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction. He is so
in love with truth-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence,
speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But
he did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from
the table and flung it at the orator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah, mais c'est bete enfin,&quot;* cried the latter, jumping up from
the sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. &quot;He remembers
Luther's inkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a
dream! It's like a woman! I suspected you were only pretending to stop
up your ears.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;* But after all, that's stupid.&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 15 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan
jumped up from the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Do you hear? You'd better open,&quot; cried the visitor; &quot;it's your
brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I'll be
bound!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming,
and of course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings
'news,'&quot; Ivan exclaimed frantically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Open, open to him. There's a snowstorm and he is your brother.
Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait? C'est a ne pas mettre un chien
dehors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Does the gentleman know the weather he's making? It's not
weather for a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but
something seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort
to break his chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew
louder and louder. At last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up
from the sofa. He looked round him wildly. Both candles had almost
burnt out, the glass he had just thrown at his visitor stood before
him on the table, and there was no one on the sofa opposite. The
knocking on the window frame went on persistently, but it was by no
means so loud as it had seemed in his dream; on the contrary, it was
quite subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all
happened just now!&quot; cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the
movable pane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Alyosha, I told you not to come,&quot; he cried fiercely to his
brother. &quot;In two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,&quot; Alyosha answered from the
yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Come round to the steps, I'll open at once,&quot; said Ivan, going
to open the door to Alyosha.}}</text>

Use either pita bread or regular white sandwich bread. In either case, toast the bread by whatever manner you see fit. In the case of a pita, open the pita and create a pocket. Smear the inside of the pita or the surface of the bread with hummus, then sprinkle lettuce, a little vinegar and some olive oil, along with any other seasonings. Close and enjoy.</text>

== Alternate Remote for Motorola 6416 Phase III to get 30 second skip button ==

The URC remote model 1056B03 now provided by Time Warner cable in the Los Angeles area for their Motorola 6416 Phase III DVR no longer has a 30 second skip button (commercial skip) and can't be programmed to have a skip button using any techniques discussed in this article.  According to a technician it is due to the fact that Time Warner wanted to have one remote for both the 6416 and their whole-house DVR and the whole-house DVR uses all of the extra buttons that were used for things like skip for other features.  Whatever the case may be, the Logitech Harmony 200 works will with the DVR and can easily be programmed via a USB connection to a PC so that it has the 30 second commercial skip button. It was also necessary to program buttons for the preview (8 second skip back) and exit commands. But with the Logitech software it was simple drag and drop programming.  Their may well be other, and perhaps even less expensive, universal remotes that will work as well, but if you are looking for a solution then the Logitech 200 does work well.  Note that it seems like it has been discontinued in favor of the 300 which is a bit more expensive but still reasonable and probably would work also.  The 200 can still be obtained retail for about 20 dollars US.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 06:59, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

== Deleted page ==

No problem - can you let me know what the actual title was (I deleted two/three IIRC) and I'll get it back and place it in your user space for now?  Hope that is ok - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 06:59, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

::OK it is now [[User:Yasya/How a to write a good book for children?|here]] and in your space.  Let me know when you have what you want and I will delete it.  I'm guessing (as there have been five of these pages) that it is a class project of some sort?  If so could you get someone &quot;in charge&quot; to post in the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] so they can get some guidance on how to do things - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:07, 4 May 2007 (UTC)
:::Hi [[User:Herbythyme|Herby]], thank you, we got what we needed, feel free to delete the page. I guess, we'll have a team working on the issues of 'compatibility' with the rest of wikibooks at our next f-2-f meeting this Thrusday. Thanks, --[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] 01:54, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

== [[Applied History of Psychology]] ==

Hello Yasya, thank you for replying to my message. We've had several classroom projects similar to yours here at wikibooks, and over time we've learned alot about how to help those projects operate smoothly. We've written some of what we know at [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]], although that page is just a draft. Also, we we would appreciate it if you would &quot;sign in&quot; at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]. This way, the community will know about your project and can help you if you need help. 

If you need any help, I'm available most of the time. You can leave me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]], or you can post a question at [[WB:SLP|Staff lounge]]. There are plenty of cool things that you can do with the wiki software, and we can help you do all of them. Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 02:05, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

{{user language|pl|N}} {{user language|en|3}} {{user language|ru|2}} {{user language|eo|1}}

Nazywam się Grzegorz Jagodziński, &quot;grzegorj&quot; jest wykorzystywanym przeze mnie akronimem (7 liter imienia + 1 litera nazwiska), który dzięki nietypowej budowie jest niepowtarzalny. Z wykształcenia jestem biologiem, z zamiłowania - także językoznawcą. Mieszkam w Libiążu, w woj. małopolskim. Mam (bardzo) skromny wkład w redagowaniu różnych wikiprojektów. Jestem autorem [http://www.grzegorj.prv.pl/ witryny internetowej] poświęconej wielu interesujących mnie zagadnieniom. Tam też można znaleźć informacje o tym, jak się ze mną skontaktować w razie potrzeby.

Każdemu, kto zechce skorzystać z zawartości mojej witryny i uzna ją za przydatne źródło wiedzy, udzielam zgody do wykorzystania zawartych tam materiałów mojego autorstwa (wszystkiego, co nie jest oznaczone jako innego pochodzenia) przy redagowaniu Wikibooks, Wikisłownika, Wikipedii itp.

Welcome to my page in Wikibooks!

My name is Grzegorz Jagodziński, &quot;grzegorj&quot; is an acronym (7 letters of my first name and 1 letter of my surname) applied by me. Because of its untypical structure, it is unique. By my profession, I am a biologist, and I am also a linguist - hobbyist. I live in Poland, in Libiąż, a small town in Małopolskie Voivodship. I have (tiny) contributions in various wiki projects. I am the author of a [http://www.grzegorj.prv.pl/ website] on many topics, interesting for me. You can also find information how to contact me there.

Everyone can use my texts from my website to contribute Wikibooks, Wiktionary, Wikipedia and other similar projects.

Witaj na Wikibooks Grzegorzu. Na tutejszych Wikibooks mówi się tylko po angielsku, więc jest niewielki sens pisania o sobie po polsku. Wikibooks po polsku znajdują się [[:pl:|w innym miejscu]].

== Orbit Parameters ==

It is possible to specify an orbit entirely using a set of 5 parameters. With these 5 parameters, we can specify precisely where an orbit is, how it is oriented in 3-D space, and what size it is. If we have an optional sixth parameter, we can determine exactly where the satellite is in its orbit at any arbitrary time ''t''. These 6 parameters are called the Keplerian Elements.

{{Wikipedia|Orbital Elements}}

However, before we discuss the 6 orbit parameters, we need to introduce a few new terms.

=== Ascending Node ===

If the Earth's equator is a plane, the '''fundamental plane''' (as it is in the geocentric-equatorial coordinate system, which we will be using in this section), and the orbit forms a plane (the &quot;orbital plane&quot;) that contains the vectors '''r''' and '''v''', then the line formed by the intersection of these two planes is known as the '''line of nodes'''. 

We can find the vector '''n''' by taking the cross product of the angular momentum vector, '''h''', and the unit vector '''K''':

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{n} = \bold{K} \times \bold{h}&lt;/math&gt;

'''n''' is a unit vector on the line of nodes that points in the direction of the '''ascending node'''. The ascending node is the spot where the satellite crosses the equatorial plane in a northerly direction. Likewise, the descending node is the point where the satellite crosses the equatorial plane in the southerly direction.

In an equatorial orbit, '''n''' is undefined, and there are no nodes.

=== Direct and Retrograde ===

'''Direct''' means the satellite is traveling around the earth from west to east. '''Retrograde''' means the satellite is traveling from east to west.

=== Visual Representation ===

[[File:Orbit1.svg|center]]

This image shows two planes, the orbital plane (pale yellow) and the ecliptic (gray). The earth, or prime focus is considered to be at the dot at the center of the two planes. Notice how the orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points: once going northward (the ascending node), and once going southward (the descending node). The descending node is not marked in this picture, but its location should be obvious. We will explain some of the other terms below.

[[File:Orbital elements.svg|center]]

== Classical Elements ==

Now that we have the node vector, along with the vectors '''r''', '''v''', and '''h''', we can find our 5 classical orbital elements.

=== Semi-Major Axis ===

The semi-major axis, ''a'' can be found via the Vis-Viva equation:
:&lt;math&gt;a=-\frac{\mu}{2\mathcal{E}}=-\frac{\mu}{2}\left[\frac{v^2}{2}-\frac{\mu}{r}\right]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Eccentricity ===

The eccentricity ''e'' can be determined from the magnitude of the eccentricity vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{e}=\frac{1}{\mu}\left(v^2\bold{r}-(\bold{r}\cdot\bold{v})\bold{v}\right)-\frac{\bold{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternately, it can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;e=\sqrt{1+\frac{2\mathcal{E}h^2}{\mu^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
though the eccentricity vector will be needed in the calculation of later elements.

=== Inclination ===

The inclination, ''i'' is the angle between the '''K''' unit vector and the angular momentum vector '''h'''. It can be calculated using:

{{eqn|Orbital Inclination}}
:&lt;math&gt;i = \arccos\frac{h_K}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

The angle of inclination is always less than 180&amp;deg;.

=== Longitude of the Ascending Node ===

The longitude of the ascending node, &amp;Omega;, is the angle between the ascending node and the '''I''' unit vector. It can be calculated as:

{{eqn|Longitude of the Ascending Node}}
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \arccos\frac{n_I}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

If the ''n&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' component is greater than zero, then &amp;Omega; is less than 180&amp;deg;. Otherwise, &amp;Omega; is greater than  180&amp;deg;.

=== Argument of Periapsis ===

The argument of periapsis is the angle in the orbital plane between the ascending node and the periapsis. We can calculate it as:

{{eqn|Argument of Periapsis}}
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \arccos \frac{\bold{n} \cdot \bold{e}}{ne}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''e&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'' is greater than 0, then &amp;omega; is less than 180&amp;deg;. Otherwise, &amp;omega; is greater than 180&amp;deg;.

=== Time of Periapsis Passage ===

The time of periapsis passage is the time when the satellite reaches periapsis. We define this time as ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. It can be determined from observation. This is the sixth orbital parameter that allows calculating the position of a celestial object in any time.

== Optional Elements ==

=== Longitude of Periapsis ===
Longitude of the Periapsis is the sum of the Longitude of the Ascending Node and the Argument of Perigee
{{eqn|Longitude of Periapsis}}
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi = \Omega  + \omega&lt;/math&gt;

=== True Anomaly at Epoch ===

=== Argument of Latitude at Epoch ===

=== True Longitude at Epoch ===

== Finding '''r''' and '''v''' ==

From the five classical orbital elements, we can determine '''r''' and '''v'''. 

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} = r\cos(\nu)\bold{P} + r\sin(\nu)\bold{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{v} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{p}}[-sin(\nu)\bold{P} + e\bold{Q} + \cos(\nu)\bold{Q}]&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''P''' and '''Q''' are unit vectors in the perifocal coordinate system. Using our coordinate transformations, we can convert these into geocentric-equatorial coordinates.

The '''Mayapple''' (''Podophyllum peltatum'') is a herbaceous perennial plant in the family Berberidaceae, native to the eastern part of North America. Other common names include Devil's apple, Hogapple, Indian apple, Umbrella plant (for the shape of the leaves), Wild lemon (for the flavor of the fruit), Wild mandrake, and American mandrake (for the shape of rhizomes). 

==Description==
The stems grow to 20-40 cm tall, with palmately lobed leaves up to 20-30 cm diameter with 5-9 deeply cut lobes. The plant produces two growth forms. The form with a single umbrella-like leaf does not produce any flower or fruit. Stems having a twin leaf (rarely three-leaf) structure, however, bear a single white flower 3-5 cm diameter with six (rarely up to nine) petals, between the two leaves; this matures into a yellow-greenish fruit 2-5 cm long. The plant appears in colonies in open woodlands.  Individual shoots are often connected by systems of thick tubers and rhizomes. &lt;ref name = &quot;Fondren&quot;&gt; {{cite web|last = Fondren |first = Brian T |url = http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/mayapple.htm|title = Mayapple |work = Ethnobotanical leaflets|accessdate = 2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

==Uses==
The rhizome of the mayapple has been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, originally by Native Americans and later by other settlers. &lt;ref name = &quot;Fondren&quot; /&gt;

All the parts of the plant, excepting the fruit, are poisonous. This plant can kill humans within 24 hours. Even the fruit, though not dangerously poisonous, can cause unpleasant red/yellow diarrhea. The plant contains [[w:podophyllotoxin|podophyllotoxin]] &lt;ref&gt; Moraes, R.M., H. Lata, E. Bedir, M. Maqbool, and K. Cushman. 2002.

== Acid Base Disorder ==

&lt;b&gt;In general :&lt;/b&gt;
H+ = 24 &lt;b&gt;×&lt;/b&gt; PCO2&lt;b&gt;/&lt;/b&gt;HCO3– &lt;br&gt;
(Usually in clinical practice, H+ concentration is expressed as pH.)
*Normal pH = 7.35–7.45. 
**Acidemia = pH &lt; 7.35.
**Alkalemia = pH &gt; 7.45.
*PaCO2 (Arterial CO2 concentration normal = 35–45 mm Hg).
*HCO3– (Serum electrolytes normal = 22–31 mmol/liter).

==Acidosis-Alkalosis==
*Acidosis is a process that causes the accumulation of acid.
*Alkalosis is a process that causes the accumulation of alkali.

===Respiratory Acidosis-Alkalosis===
Disorders that initially alter arterial PCO2 (arterial CO2 concentration) are termed respiratory acidosis-alkalosis.

===Metabolic Acidosis-Alkalosis===
Disorders initially affecting HCO3– (serum electrolytes) concentration are termed metabolic acidosis-alkalosis.

==== Metabolic Alkalosis ====

===== Causes =====
#Chloride-responsive. 
#*The most common causes in the surgical practice include:
#**Diuretic therapy (e.g., contraction alkalosis).
#**Acid loss through GI secretions (e.g., nasogastric suctioning, vomiting).
#**Exogenous administration of HCO3– or HCO3– precursors (e.g., citrate in blood). 
#Chloride-unresponsive metabolic alkalosis is comparatively less common and includes:
#*Hyperaldosteronism
#*Marked hypokalemia
#*Renal failure
#*Renal tubular Cl– wasting (Bartter’s syndrome)
#*Oedematous states.

===== Diagnosis: =====
Measurement of urinary chloride concentration.

*Suggestive causes of the metabolic alkalosis if Urine Cl– concentration is &lt;15 mmol/liter:
**vomiting.
**nasogastric suctioning.
**postdiuretic administration.
**posthypercapnia. 
*Sughgestive causes of the metabolic alkalosis if Urine Cl– concentration is &gt; 20 mmol/liter:
**Mineralocorticoid excess.
**Alkali loading.
**Concurrent diuretic administration
**Presence of severe hypokalemia.

===== Treatment principles in metabolic alkalosis: =====

Goal of Treatments can be:
#Removing and identifying underlying causes, Discontinuing exogenous alkali, repairing Cl–, K+, and volume deficits. 
#Correction of volume deficits (can be used 0.9% NaCl) and hypokalemia. 
#H2-receptor antagonists or other acid-suppressing medications can be used after vomiting or nasogastric suctioning.
#If Edemea:
#*Acetazolamide (5 mg/kg/day IV or PO) can be used.
#**Eases fluid mobilization while decreasing renal HCO3– reabsorption.
#**Tolerance to this diuretic may develop after 2–3 days.
#Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) can be used in severe alkalemia (HCO3– &gt;40 mmol/liter; rate not exceeding 5 ml/minute).
#*Approximately one-half of the calculated volume of NH4Cl is usually administered and the acid-base status and Cl– concentration is usually rechecked to determine the need of further treatment. 
#*Hepatic failure is contraindication for NH4Cl.
#HCl more rapidly corrects metabolic alkalosis.
#Dialysis:
#*Can be considered in the volume-overloaded situation with renal failure and intractable metabolic alkalosis.

====== Estimation of the amount of H+ requirement ======

The amount of H+ to administer may be estimated by the following equation: &lt;br&gt;
H+(mmol) = 0.5 × wt (kg) × [103 – serum Cl– (mmol/liter)]

====== Estimation of the amount of NH4Cl requirement: ======

Can be estimated by the following equation: 
NH4Cl (mmol) = 0.2 × wt (kg) × [103 – serum Cl– (mmol/liter)]

====Metabolic Acidosis====
(Low pH with low CO2 content)
*Reduction in plasma Bicarbonate and a consequence rise in H+.
*PaCO2 is reduced secondarily by Hyperventilation, which mitigates the rise in H+.

=====Causes=====

Metabolic Acidosis is caused if:
*Accumulation of nonvolatile acids.
*Reduction of renal acid excretion.
*Loss of alkali.
*lack of soul!!!!

=====Mnemonics =====
MUD PILES

1.	Methyl Alcohol.
2.	Uremia.
3.	Diabetic Ketoacidosis
4.	Para-Aldehyde poisoning.
5.	Ischemia.
6.	Lactic acidosis.
7.	Ethylene Glycol Alcohol ingestion.
8.	Salicylic Poisoning.

===== Other commonest causes are: =====

*Addition of excessive acids to plasma.
**Ketoacidosis, Lacticacidosis.
**Methanol, ethylene glycol and salicylic poisoning.
*Failure to excrete acid:
**Chronic Renal Failure.
**Acute Renal Failure etc
*Loss of Bicarbonate (base):
**From G.I.T:
***Diarrhea.
***Fistulae.
**In Urine:
**Proximal renal tubular acidosis.
**Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

===== Clinical Feature =====

#Usually in severe cases Kussmaul's respiration can be present.
# When H+ &gt;70 mmol/L; then, 
#*Cardiac-Out-Put falls.
#*Blood pressure decreases.
#*Frequnet confusion.
#*Drowsiness.

===== Diagnostic Classsification (Anion Gap)=====

&lt;b&gt;Anion gap&lt;/b&gt; (AG: normal, 3–11 mmol/liter) &lt;br&gt;
AG (mmol/liter) = Na+ (mmol/liter) – [Cl– (mmol/liter) + HCO3– (mmol/liter)]

It is useful diagnostically to classify metabolic acidosis into:

#Increased AG metabolic acidosis.
#Normal AG metabolic acidosis.

===== Causes according to Anion Gap: =====

======&lt;big&gt;Increased anion gap Metabolic Acidosis:&lt;/big&gt;======
#Increased acid production:
##Ketoacidosis 
###Diabetic 
###Alcoholic 
###Starvation  
##Lactic acidosis 
##Toxic ingestion:
###Salicylates.
###Ethylene glycol.
###Methanol. 
#Renal failure.

====== &lt;big&gt;Normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) Metabolic Acidosis: &lt;/big&gt; ======

#Renal tubular dysfunction
##Renal tubular acidosis.
##Hypoaldosteronism.
##Potassium-sparing diuretics.
#Loss of alkali.
##Diarrhea.
##Ureterosigmoidostomy.
##Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
#Administration of HCl (ammonium chloride, cationic amino acids).

===== Management/Treatment of metabolic acidosis: =====

*Directed primarily towards the underlying cause of the acid-base disturbance. 
*Bicarbonate therapy is considered when there is moderate to severe metabolic acidosis, depending on the etiology.

#Infusion of NaHCO3, stoped when H+ is normol.
#Monitoring H+ and HCO3-
#Treatment of underlying causes.
&lt;br&gt;
The HCO3– deficit (mmol/liter) can be estimated by the following equation:

HCO3– deficit (mmol/liter) = Body weight (kg) × 0.4 × [desired HCO3– (mmol/liter) – measured HCO3– (mmol/liter)]

(This equation serves only as a rough estimate .)

====== The goal of HCO3– ======
*To raise the arterial blood pH to 7.00 or the HDRO3–  concentration to 10 mmol/liter. 
**Risks of bicarbonate therapy:
***Hypernatremia.
***Hypercapnia.
***Cerebrospinal fluid acidosis.
***Overshoot alkalosis.

Serial arterial blood gases and serum electrolytes should be obtained to assess the response to HCO3–  therapy.

====== Rate of HCO3–  replacement: ======
*In nonurgent situations:
**Continuous intravenous infusion over 4–8 hours (50-ml ampule of 8.4% NaHCO3 solution provides 50 mmol of HCO3–) can be added to 1 liter of D5W or 0.45% NaCl. 
*In urgent situation:
**Deficit can be administered as a bolus over several minutes.

'''''Podophyllum''''' is a genus of six species of herbaceous perennial plants in the family [[../Berberidaceae/]], native to eastern Asia (five species) and eastern North America (one species). They are woodland plants, typically growing in colonies derived from a single root.

==Description==
The stems grow to 30&amp;ndash;40 cm tall, with palmately lobed umbrella-like leaves up to 20&amp;ndash;40 cm diameter with 3&amp;ndash;9 shallowly to deeply cut lobes. The plants produce several stems from a creeping underground rhizome; some stems bear a single leaf and do not produce any flower or fruit, while flowering stems produce a pair or more leaves with 1&amp;ndash;8 flowers in the axil between the apical leaves. The flowers are white, yellow or red, 2&amp;ndash;6 cm diameter with 6&amp;ndash;9 petals, and mature into a green, yellow or red fleshy fruit 2&amp;ndash;5 cm long.

* Use dictionaries
* Use pictures
* Use easy words that children could understand
* Use childrens experiences
* Don't use very small font; use large font

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page, and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:32, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

== Cornmeal or cornstarch? ==

G'day Angr, on [[Cookbook:Keralan vegetable stew]] you added the optional ingredient &quot;corn flour&quot;. This is an ambiguous term, which can mean either [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] or [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] - which did you mean? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:35, 4 May 2007 (UTC)
:I didn't add it, I just fixed the formatting. It was added by [[User:Anushasekar]] as his only edit [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Keralan_vegetable_stew&amp;diff=767151&amp;oldid=574610 here]. [[User:Angr|Angr]] 17:06, 5 May 2007 (UTC)
::Sorry, my mistake. Given the unlikely return of the editor, and the use of this as a thickener, I'm going to make it &quot;cornstarch&quot;. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:46, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== What is a textbook? ==

I replied on [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Project Chat]] but I thought I'd copy it here in case.

This is explained in detail in [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks?]]. As long as your book isn't ''just'' reference material (I'm thinking of a [[w:Bescherelle|Bescherelle]]), it sounds good to me. If you still have questions, don't hesitate to ask.

__NOTOC__

==History==

{{Wikipedia|BlitzMax}}

BlitzMax is a BASIC dialect, and the latest Blitz language by Blitz Research Limited. It is the first to run on multiple operating systems; it runs on [[w:Mac OS|Mac OS]], [[:Linux|Linux]] and [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]]. The language is converted to assembler, then assembled - allowing it to be somewhat platform agnostic. From a gaming standpoint this is possible because, unlike earlier versions, BlitzMax can use [[w:OpenGL|OpenGL]] for rendering.

Other major changes from earlier Blitz products are its [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] and [[w:Modular programming|modular]] nature.

==Compilation==

BlitzMax code is first converted to a low level assembler format, which is then assembled into object code for the target platform. BlitzMax is capable of compiling for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

Individual files can be linked together through the '''Import''' command, thus allowing complex linking structures that can include not only other BlitzMax files (.BMX), but also C source as well as other languages (particularly ObjectiveC on Mac OS).

==Modules==

Modules provide the runtime functionality of BlitzMax. They are stored in the '''mod''' directory inside the BlitzMax directory, and accessed via the [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax runtime#Framework|Import and Framework]] commands. They can include both native BlitzMax code, and code in C or assembler formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A linked list allows you to efficiently add and remove objects to and from a collection of objects.

To create a linked list, use the [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#CreateList|CreateList]] function.

Add objects to a linked list using [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#ListAddFirst|ListAddFirst]] or [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#ListAddLast|ListAddLast]]. Both functions return a link object which can be used to later remove the object with the [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#RemoveLink|RemoveLink]] function. You can also remove objects with the [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#ListRemove|ListRemove]] function. However this is not as efficient as using [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#RemoveLink|RemoveLink]] because the list must first be searched for the object to be removed.

To visit all the objects in a linked list, you can use an [[BlitzMax/Modules/BASIC/BlitzMax_runtime#EachIn|EachIn]] loop.

=Lists versus Arrays=
It is important to keep in mind that index-based access in a linked list is relatively slow. For each item that you wish to index, the linked list must iterate through its internal links until it finds the requested index, whereas an array can directly access any value at any position.

&quot;So why use linked lists at all?&quot; you might ask. Inserting a value into the middle of an array is an &quot;expensive&quot; operation, you must move all items after the insert position down in the array by one, then insert the new value in the space created. In a linked list, you must simply redirect the pointers between links and you have instantly inserted a value in the middle of the list.

It is generally best to use a linked list when you need to make many changes to data and an array when you need to frequently access data at random. If you need to make many insertions and deletions to an array you can convert it to a list with [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#ListFromArray|ListFromArray]] and then convert the edited list back to an array with [[BlitzMax/Modules/Data_structures/Linked_lists#ListToArray|ListToArray]].
