      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What role does action research play?}}

Teachers constantly test and adapt their teaching methods to ensure the best learning environment for their students because teachers know that not all accepted methods work for all students.  After all, most educational research is conducted not in an actual classroom but in a controlled environment, yielding results that only theoretically work in a classroom.  Teachers who want to prove what methods work with their current group of students can conduct research in their own classroom, referred to as classroom action research.  

==Conducting Classroom Action Research==
Classroom action research is most often conducted collaboratively, but can also be used by individual teachers to answer a pressing question about learning in their classroom.  Classroom action research can focus on an individual student, a group of students, or two or more classes.  Educators pose a question and look for the answer within their classroom or their team, gathering data as they teach; in other words, action research is research that actively takes place in the classroom.  When performing action research, “…the researcher wants to try out a theory with practitioners in real life situations, gain feedback from this experience, modify the theory as a result of this feedback, and try it again” (Avison et al, 1999, p.95). 

==Analyzing Data==
Analysis of data will usually combine both qualitative (e.g. classroom discussions or student surveys) and quantitative (e.g. test scores or student averages) measures. Classroom action research can be instituted for as little as one semester or can take place over the course of an entire school year.  Because the researcher is also the teacher and not an outsider collecting data for publication, findings from data analysis can be used immediately to share with other professionals and to decide what course of action to take in the classroom regarding the issue studied.  In this way, classroom action research provides teachers an outlet to share common concerns and solutions to real classroom problems and helps to eliminate isolation that is common among teachers. Furthermore, classroom action research offers the teacher-researcher insight into what teachers know about how and what their students are learning in their classrooms.

==Supporting the Research==
{{Rquote|right|Ask a question, research accepted answers to the question, develop a research plan, collect data, analyze data, plan a results-based course of action, and finally, share the results.|(Mettetal, 2002-2003)}}

Many writers supporting classroom action research (e.g. Mettetal, 2002-2003; Johnson, 1993; Rinaldo, 2005) encourage teachers to participate in action research by equating the processes involved with action research to the behaviors of naturally gifted teachers because “…on a daily basis teachers design and implement a plan of action, observe and analyze outcomes, and modify plans to better meet the needs of students” (Anderson). Formally writing down these things essentially transforms good teachers' methods into research.  Most research writers agree that successful research follows a set of clearly articulated steps that are easily manageable with other daily duties, even for the beginning teacher: 

Overall, supporters for classroom action research want teachers to realize that teachers have the power to develop and implement best practices in their classrooms simply by turning their lessons or procedures into research and place importance on classroom action research as vital to educational reform. Supporters further argue that a teacher’s observations are more valuable than an outside researcher’s, given teachers’ real-life experience in the classroom, and subsequently hope in the future to see more teachers and schools involved in action research. (Mettetal, 2002-2003; Johnson, 1993; Rinaldo, 2005)

==Questioning the Research==
While supporters of classroom action research make some convincing arguments, those with doubts raise some interesting questions regarding the validity and ethics of classroom action research.  Skeptics view the role of teacher-researcher as poorly defined in the absence of clearly stated guidelines for carrying out action research and argue for the creation of ethical and procedural standards specifically related to classroom action research.  (Avison et al, 1999, pp.96-97; Bournot-Trites and Belanger, 2005, pp.197-215)

==Standards and Ethical Policies==
Most research standards and ethical policies are designed for medical experimentation and, therefore, do not readily apply to educational research.  Bournot-Trites and Belanger argue that some modern day ethical principles designed for medical research are important to classroom action research. (2005, p.199)  For instance, the Nuremberg Code, developed as a response to the inhumane practices of Nazi medical researchers and the basis for modern research ethics, dictates that a research subject must give voluntary consent upon being informed of the experimental procedures. However, classroom action research holds no standard for free and informed consent.  Without free and informed consent from both students and parents, Bournot-Trites and Belanger worry that students’ rights, including ownership of intellectual property (i.e. written work) and entitlement to best possible instruction, could be overlooked. (2005, pp. 204-210)   

==Guidelines==
Additionally, some researchers (Avison et al, 1999, pp.96-97; Bournot-Trites and Belanger, 2005, pp.197-215) believe that procedural guidelines must be established for classroom action research to be considered credible.  The purpose of guidelines or standards for any documented undertaking is to quantify the quality of information being communicated. In other words, guidelines or standards allow us to judge the validity of one person’s research compared to another.  In order “…for novice researchers and practitioners to understand and engage in action research studies in terms of design, process, presentation, and criteria for evaluation,” (Avison et al, 1999, p.96) guidelines must be developed.   Moreover, these writers believe that with these necessary improvements action research could be a valuable tool that could improve education. (Avison et al, 1999, p.96)   

==Conclusion==
In spite of their differences both supporters of action research and those doubtful of the current state of action research share the belief that classroom action research, when done properly, can make a difference in education.  Teachers must weigh the benefits and consequences of conducting research in their classroom, not only the ethics and credibility of action research but also their ability as a professional to balance those two roles of researcher and educator.  Although the practices of action research and a skilled teacher’s daily routine of observing, reflecting, and adapting material are similar, the ease with which a teacher can perform the additional task of consistently recording the data from these routine practices relies on solid time-management and multi-tasking skills.  Poorly planned and executed classroom action research can jeopardize a student’s education, and teachers must remain cognizant of their duty to provide the best possible instruction for their students.

{{question-answer|question=How might you use action research in your classroom?  Develop a question that you could address '''in your classroom and describe your research plan using the steps given in the article.
|answer=While working as an aide in an elementary resource room, the teacher and I performed classroom action research.  All of the 3rd and 4th graders that we saw were below their grade level in reading.  They often left their classrooms to come to the resource room during un-structured time or sustained reading time.  As a result they were not actively involved in the Accelerated Reader Programs in their individual classrooms.  The teacher and I decided to create an Accelerated Reader Program for the resource room.  At the beginning of the semester we gave each students a test to calculate both their independent and assisted reading levels.  We then broke the students down into to groups of 2 or 3 based on their reading levels.  During their time in the resource room each group read a book and then took a test in the program to earn points.  They read silently when not in the group reading.  I also read a portion of a chapter book each day in class, and class notes were created on that book.

Points could be stored and then cashed in for various prizes.  We made the prizes educational.  They were compromised mainly of books, art supplies and educational computer games.  Before long students were coming in before school and during their lunch to take Accelerated Reader tests.	
At the end of the semester each student had raised their reading level at least a full year.  At the end of the year each student had raised their reading level by an average of two years.  Two of the fourth grade students were able to leave the special education program completely. &amp;mdash;Sarah Mullins-Spears}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can PowerPoint presentations be used effectively?}}
{{Rquote|right|There are two kinds of teachers:  the kind that fill you with so much quail shot that you can't move, and the kind that just gives you a little prod behind and you jump to the skies.|Robert Frost}}

If you want your class to stay awake, take note: the bar has been permanently raised with the new technologies in computer-based presentation design. Forget the overheads and slides. Attracted by the same slick interface and easy learning curve that drew the corporate types, educators and students are employing the presentation software in classrooms in ever-increasing numbers. For some teachers, the computerized slide-show format is deposing the black/whiteboard.

It’s especially good for the visual learner; but while it's relatively easy to learn the basics of the program, it's not always obvious to teachers how to turn a PowerPoint presentation into a useful learning experience. 

Unfortunately, good software alone does not make for good presentation design. In fact, quite the opposite! As computer-based presentation design has become more the norm, classrooms are being overwhelmed with productions that seem to use every feature and font that the teacher (or student) can find. You may think your presentation is great and the class is with you as they politely nod their heads, smile, and take notes, but beware: the emperor believed that only a &quot;fool&quot; couldn't see his beautiful new clothes!

One of the criticisms that's been raised about PowerPoint is that it can give the illusion of coherence and content when there really isn't very much coherence or content. Jamie McKenzie, a former school superintendent and editor of the education website From Now On, uses the term &quot;PowerPointlessness&quot; to illustrate the drawbacks of the program.

Too many flying letters, animations and sound effects without seeing much original thought or analysis can be a real issue. In many cases, the medium shoves the message aside. Too many people forget that they are making a presentation first and that PowerPoint is just their assistant. Resist the temptation to make a PowerPoint presentation that uses sounds, colors, pictures, and actions that do nothing to get the message across and do everything to distract the students from the message that you are trying to deliver.

A quick Web search for PowerPoint lesson plans reveals a wealth of sites offering archives of presentations in subjects ranging from art to world history. Individual projects include such subjects as how to dissect a fish, perform the Heimlich maneuver or solve a long equation.

PowerPoint works well in the classroom in a number of ways. 
*Present information or instruction to an entire class. 
*Create graphically enhanced information and instructions for the learning centers. 
*Create tutorials, reviews, or quizzes for individual students. 
*Display student work and curriculum materials or accompany teacher presentations at parent open houses or technology fairs. You can set PowerPoint presentations to run automatically during such events, providing a slide show of classroom activities and events as parents tour your classroom or school.

==PowerPoint and the Student==
&quot;It's a neat tool, but it should be thought of as a supplement rather than as a way of providing your basic research,&quot; said McKenzie, who believes the program is often overused in student projects. (McKenzie, 2000) Teachers shouldn't allow a slide presentation to take the place of writing assignments. Students should use technology and things like PowerPoint to summarize their points and put their thoughts in order, but they still must have the experience of actual writing.

Intent on producing students with strong reading, writing and thinking skills, teachers should be on the lookout for thin quality of the student work, with an emphasis upon flash and special effects rather than content and thought. We must focus on student outcomes worth achieving, upon value added rather than glitz, glimmer and gimmicks.

==Linear vs. Non-Linear==
PowerPoint can be a very effective and valuable tool, but it can also serve as a downfall in the classroom. There are two main differences in PowerPoint presentations: linear and non-linear. Linear is the most common type of PowerPoint used by educators today. The presentation is slide after slide that is watched by the student while the teacher lectures in the background. The other type is non-linear presentations. As defined by Guides and tutorials.com “they engage the user by allowing him/her to control how the presentation is viewed and in what order.” Students are able to move around the presentation in any order which enables them to refer back to previous pages or jump around to retrieve the slides as needed. Many teachers add hyper links to allow the student to retrieve vital relevant information that has been posted online. There are many advantages of using Power Points within the classroom when used appropriately.  

==Organizing Your Presentation==
*Engage and inform
*Think concepts, not just facts and figures
*The Joy of Six
**Six points per slide maximum
**Six words per point
**Phrases, not sentences

Decide what the message of your presentation will be and be familiar enough with it so that you could talk about the subject even without the PowerPoint presentation. Suppose there was no projector or the bulb burned out. If you can’t carry on, it’s probably either because you weren’t familiar enough with your topic or your presentation was loaded with a lot of useless and uninteresting facts that would bore your students to death anyway. Presentations should flow like conversation, not be a never ending list of useless or uninteresting facts. You might as well stand up in front of your class and read your grocery list. As you talk to your class, your presentation should just highlight points. Those points should follow the Joy of Six Guidelines. To keep your slides uncluttered and more importantly, to make it more likely that your class will remember/write down things, try to limit your slides to six points per slide and no more than six words per point; and phrases are easier to read and remember than sentences. You’ll be speaking the sentences.

==Consider Your Audience (Class or co-workers)==
*Give them what they are expecting
*Give them what they need
*Don’t insult them by reading
*Involve them &amp; ask questions
*Use the B key where appropriate

Begin by asking a few questions to get an idea of the class expectations and experience. Then gear your presentation toward the bulk of the class, but make sure to give enough background to help those who need it, but not so much as to lose a large part of the class. For older students, one of the most deadly mistakes you can make is to read your presentation. The middle and high school students shouldn’t need you for that. And use the B key where appropriate in PowerPoint. What does the B key do? Very simply, it turns the screen black. There will be times in your lecture/presentation that you want the class to focus on you and forget the slides. Hit the B and the screen will turn Black. Hit it again and it will come Back.

==Color &amp; Layout==
*One background color
*Use contrasting but complementary colors
*Stay consistent with fonts and colors
*Don’t clutter
*Balance your slides

There are some simple design considerations that you should follow. You do want to use contrasting colors that work well together. Your words will be sending one message and your color choice another. Pick a background and stick with it. Constant changes cause your students to pay attention to the changes not the message. The same thing is true of your fonts, their color and size. Keep them consistent. If you change them, people will be watching to see what font you come up with next instead of listening to your message. Keep your slide balanced and remember the Joy of Six.

==Multimedia==
*Use graphics to enhance or emphasize
*Sound effects should be appropriate
*Sound clips should be short
*Avoid constant movement

Once again, when it comes to multimedia, anything you use should enhance or emphasize your message. Using cute pictures, video, or sounds without thinking about how they will help you get your message across may result in your students remembering the cute picture, but forgetting what you were trying to say. People like to use animations, because they are fun to watch. However, do you really want your students watching animations on your slide or listening to what you are saying?

==As The Old Saying Goes, Practice Makes Perfect==
*Script the lecture
*Use the notes area and print them out
*Practice paraphrasing
*Watch for like, ahh, umm, ya know
*Be aware of time

A great slide presentation without a well-prepared lecture is like a great recipe in the hands of a poor cook. The final product may be edible, but it’s not going to be a meal you will remember or want to have again. We all have speech habits that we don’t notice, but our students will pick up on quickly. If you are in the habit of pausing and saying things such as ahh or umm, or worse yet, ya know, people will begin to focus on that instead of your words.

==Benefits==
The comparative politics courses of the university of North Carolina did a study of PowerPoint usage in the classroom.  They found that is was more of a benefit then a hindrance.  Surveys administered to gauge student reaction to the PowerPoint presentation show that students perceive increased retention, grasp of material, organization, and enjoyment. PowerPoint also has a low learning curve, allowing busy instructors to integrate the software in their teaching without extensive retraining.

==Avoid PowerPoint Poisoning==
*Prepare the presentation before PowerPoint
*Know and consider your audience
*Think of PowerPoint as your assistant
*Deliver your material in an interesting way
*Be prepared

So to wrap it up, you should prepare your lecture before firing up your software. Have enough information available so that you can provide your class with what it needs. Choose your design and layout so that it is consistent and doesn’t take away from your message. Remember that the technology is your assistant and should help you, not take over the show. Tell a story, involve the students, use humor, be engaging, but stay on track with your lecture. Talk WITH your students not AT them. Be well prepared when you make your presentation.

==Conclusion==
Remember, as a teacher, to focus on teaching, learning and thinking. Remember the equipment/software is nothing much more than a set of new tools to support questioning, exploring and creating. It’s all about showing students how to make sense of their worlds, preparing them to think and read deeply and well. Our purpose should be literacy — not illiteracy or e-literacy.

{{question-answer|question=Imagine a widely used and expensive prescription drug that promised to make us beautiful but didn't. Instead the drug had frequent, serious side effects: It induced stupidity, turned everyone into bores, wasted time, and degraded the quality and credibility of communication. These side effects would rightly lead to a worldwide product recall. How can you relate this scenario to the use of PowerPoint?
|answer=The comparison of PowerPoint to a drug that promises to make us beautiful but also is known to induce stupidity, turn everyone into bores, waste time and degrade the quality and credibility of communication helps to demonstrate the possible negative side effects of utilizing PowerPoint for presentations.  PowerPoint is a tool that continues to become more widely used by teachers and students during presentations.  They are able to create a slideshow with various background and text colors, graphics, sounds and actions.  The benefits of PowerPoint are obviously to make a more visually appealing presentation that will especially affect those who are visual learners.  The main goal of all presentations though is that the topic be clearly presented, accurate and well researched.  If the presenter spends the majority of their preparation time creating a most impressive slideshow, they may lose sight of the purpose of the presentation.  The content of the presentation should always remain their focus!  The slideshow should contain a minimal amount of distractions that will take the audience’s attention away from the topic.  Frequent flying words, graphics and sounds not only distract from the message but create a longer slideshow.  The presenter should also minimally rely on the slideshow to make their presentation.  Reading the slides to the audience is boring and would make the presentation less appealing.  While ultimately the PowerPoint slideshow can improve a presentation, one should always focus on the content and their comfort in discussing it with the audience. &amp;mdash;Sarah Murphy

As an avid user of the PowerPoint tool in my lessons I find them very useful. I, unlike many in my field do not think that PowerPoint makes teachers lazy, and is a poor substitution for old fashion writing. On the contrary; PowerPoint is just a viable tool as Microsoft Word or Corel. The issue isn't the viability of PowerPoint, but rather the level of training that instructors receive or have received prior to the implementation of PowerPoint in the classroom, and the inclusion of PowerPoint in the lesson plans. Many times the teachers as well as students are overloaded on the wonderful art of creating slide shows, and so the tools capabilities actually have an adverse effect when teaching in the classroom. I think the best way to work slide shows into a class lesson is to not teach the entire lesson from PowerPoint. If the kids are not fully engaged with you, having them stare and copy off of a screen for fifty minutes to an hour and a half is the quickest way to increase classroom management issues. Why? Because as interesting as swooping in and flipping pictures of WWII, x2+2, and microorganisms are, they just aren't quite interesting enough to keep a kid's attention and reinforce material retention. That part of the burden still rests on the instructor's shoulders. So, how do we as teachers engage our students, increase our awareness and use of technology such as PowerPoint in the classroom with out becoming completely detached from our students' learning experiences? By using PowerPoint as the side show and NOT the main attraction in our lessons. PowerPoint is important and useful, but just as the chinese proverb goes &quot;everything in moderation...&quot; If we don't suppress the urge to overindulge in the simple expediency of technology we, as well as our students, will fall prey to watered down lectures, and disrupted learning time. &amp;mdash;Nichole White

I strongly agree with Nichole White’s response in that the burden to educate lies on teachers, not on technology.  Power point is indeed a great tool for teachers to enhance their effectiveness.  But if teachers are not qualified to begin with, Power point will not make them good teachers.  If a teacher can bore students using the blackboard, he/she can bore them just as easily using Power point slides.  Nichole also makes a valid point on the need for moderation.  No matter what new technology may appear, be in Power point or SmartBoard or anything else, teachers must not depend on these technologies to do the teaching for them.  I believe it is important that teachers be open and willing to learn new technologies to keep up with the times, but we need to, first and foremost, be concerned with our ability to engage our students and show them how to learn.  If we as teachers can keep Power point as the “side show”, our students can greatly benefit from what it has to offer.  More than anything, Power point is a tool to communicate the information and learning opportunities that teachers already have to present.  The technology without the information is useless. &amp;mdash;Carol Visotsky}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the Allen/Cosby theory of change?}}

The state of American public education today can often be viewed as outdated and ineffective.  As the world around us continues to evolve and advance, our education system also needs to advance.  While innovation has become decentralized from the United States, fantastic marvels in technology, transportation, energy, and other fields continue to emerge.  Why then are we not seeing such strides and innovation in our education system?  More importantly, what does a lackluster system for educating our youth mean for the security of all Americans?

Many of these questions and more are answered with the insight of Dr. Dwight Allen and Dr. William H. Cosby, Jr.  In their co-authored book, “American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge”, they tackle the problems of an outdated education system and propose reforms necessary to bring innovation into our classroom.  Together they have produced a plan for our government to invest $100 billion a year to begin a “bold, unprecedented journey to redefine education, its structures, its goals, and its staff.” (Allen/Cosby, 10)

==Theory of Change==
===National Commitment=== 
Dr. Allen and Dr. Cosby’s theory of change begins with national commitment.  If we are to safeguard our security, Americans must be willing to focus our efforts on a strong foundation in education.  Our country has had the drive to invest enormous amounts of resources into science and technology because they are worthwhile investments that typically pay for themselves. (Brody)  The American education system needs the type of funding and support from the federal government that is given to other programs, projects, and security costs.  We must recognize that national security does not simply include the collaboration of intelligence, communication, and the military.  Our other vital source of national security is America’s youth, who turn knowledge into innovation, innovation into productivity, and productivity into economic growth and prosperity. (Brody)  The first step to making innovative changes in education is to rekindle the American drive and commitment we had in order to put a man on the moon and focus those efforts into educational research and leadership. (Allen/Cosby, 15)

===NESA===
At the forefront of change, Allen and Cosby have proposed the establishment of the National Experimental School Administration (NESA).  The administration would consist of a network of experimental schools that allow for research.  These schools are established voluntarily by local school systems and will become a large-scale laboratory for new ideas.  A laboratory on the scale of an entire school would allow for more control in a research setting and as a result produce more credible innovations.  An idea that becomes successful in an experimental school can then be adopted by regular public schools. (Allen/Cosby, 114-117) These schools, serving as large research centers, would also foster new talent and leadership in education.

===Leadership===
“One of the biggest problems in American education today is ‘safe’ leadership.” (Allen/Cosby, 7) Allen and Cosby refer to a lackluster pool of teachers who still support outdated methods because they are “safe”.  In order to harvest the innovation our education system needs, we require not only more educational leaders but effective ones that are willing to move beyond the “safe”.  These educational entrepreneurs will help to break established outdated ideas and practices. (Hess)  Through national support, NESA research, and our very own innovative leaders, we can begin to redefine education in America.

==Example Areas of Suggested Reform==
Allen and Cosby point out many areas in which we need educational changes, including the following:

*'''Produce More Prepared Teachers''' – This begins with the way in which we train and educate our new teachers.  Often you hear about the poor quality of teachers in a school or the high rate at which teachers are leaving the profession.  Allen and Cosby suggest that the year or less of classroom practice attached to a liberal arts degree is simply not enough.  Among their ideas, teachers could join the ranks of other professions such as medical doctors, who spend extra time in residency practicing before becoming licensed.  Teachers could then ease their way into the classroom over time with increasing responsibility. (Allen/Cosby, 86-87) Potential programs within NESA would provide for an ideal training ground for new teachers.
*'''Increase Classroom Resources and Technology''' – Effective use of technology has the ability to transform boring lesson plans into an interactive, engaging new discovery of information for children.  As our society becomes more electronic and technology driven, many schools and children are left behind in a new information age. (O’Conner)  If America has the courage to commit to the $100 billion challenge, half of the funding will be allocated towards spending for technology purposes. (Allen/Cosby, 111-112)
*'''Continuous Professional Training''' – With society growing and changing at such a rapid pace, it is imperative that teachers too continue to develop and change.  This involves continuous training and education beyond the one day workshops.  Allen and Cosby suggest that teachers should be in lifelong training.  This involves continuously updating plans, procedures, and knowledge of technology. A veteran teacher of 29 years, Kathleen Baker says, “She feels like she's just getting a handle on the job.” (Blanchard)  Experimental schools could help provide programs that would work to help keep teachers as learners. (Allen/Cosby, 108) 

==Conclusion==
{{Rquote|right|Transformation of education won't be cheap, and it won't be without mistakes.  Those mistakes will be costly, but we can and will learn from them. It will require courage and commitment.|''$100 Billion Challenge''}}

Allen and Cosby’s theory of change involves recognizing that society is not only changing, but changing at ever increasing rates.  We have not reached a point where we can sit back and feel satisfied that we are doing our best.  In fact, we will never reach that point because change is always going to be necessary.  However, many changes are going to require a large amount of resources and work to bring us “back up to speed.”  Some of these resources can only be supplied by the federal government, and thus Allen and Cosby have made a proposal for $100 billion to serve as the backbone for change.  Other resources can only be supplied by the innovation produced from human ingenuity and hard work.  NESA and the development of educational entrepreneurs can help provide a network of resources for research and training.

{{question-answer|question=One of the areas suggested for change is teacher preparation.  If three years of &quot;residency&quot; was added to the license requirement for a teacher, Allen and Cosby mentioned that they would gradually increase the responsibility of the new teacher. Do you think this change would better prepare teachers? How could this serve as one of the steps towards redefining and improving education? Explain.
|answer=As a teacher just starting out in this field, I do not think that colleges and universities prepare hopefuls to the extent that is needed.  Presently, there is a high drop out rate of new teachers due to first-year stresses.  Lesson planning and after-school meetings take up most of the free time one has after a hard, often thankless day of work at school.
  
I believe that an extended preparation program would be beneficial not only to upcoming teachers, but students, as well.  With more time allotted, people would be able to collect thoughts more clearly of the pros and cons going into the profession and if the good would outweigh the bad.  In some cases, teachers hate the job, and their attitude reflects onto the students in the classroom.  The classroom should be a place where the teacher feels confident that he or she can give children an environment that will help with academic and self growth. &amp;mdash;Elizabeth S. Edwards
----
I think requiring teachers to have a “residency” period, whether it is three years, or perhaps a little less, would much improve teacher education programs. I can’t imagine being thrown into a classroom with no prior experience working with kids other than the few-month internship program that’s now required. In fact, all teacher education programs should begin with some sort of observation or internship requirement that gets students in the classroom at an early point in their education. This would help students confirm that they truly want to be teachers. As a potential career-change teacher, I’ve been working as a substitute to help me confirm that teaching is indeed the profession for me. While working with kids can seem like a “fun” job, until you are actually in the classroom having to keep 20+ students on task and orderly, you won’t know for sure if this is your life’s calling. 

With a residency requirement, teachers would be better prepared for the myriad situations they could encounter in the classroom. Additionally, new teachers would begin their teaching careers with some solid, hands-on experience in classroom management and also an assortment of ideas for plans and teaching methods. This would help alleviate first-year stresses on teachers when they typically have to develop all their teaching programs from scratch. 

The residency requirement for teacher education would also help improve education overall, because teachers would have more confidence in their ability to manage a classroom and therefore could more effectively teach the subject matter. &amp;mdash;Sarah Smarrelli}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we best accommodate children with hearing impairments?}}

Over the past twenty years, there have been many laws that have led to changes in the mainstream classrooms of our public schools.  With these changes, we have seen many cultural integrations taking place. One such integration is that we now see more and more deaf students in the mainstream classroom.  A group that was once clustered in their own “world” at separate schools has now begun to make an impact on both the students and teachers in the mainstream schools.  This has created new challenges for all involved.  Teachers and students both are faced with the impact of the changing climate of the classroom.  Some of these impacts will affect the language, learning process and communication.  The mainstream classroom must be able to integrate changes needed for all students to be successful.  In order for that to take place, it is important to understand the impact of deaf students on the mainstream classroom.   

&quot;Enrollment of deaf students (or other students with special needs) in local public schools is alternately known as mainstreaming or inclusion. Mainstreaming often involves deaf children attending special, 'segregated' classes in addition to classes that include hearing peers. It also frequently includes the availability of a resource room and specially trained teachers or aides. Inclusion, in contrast, entails deaf students receiving all instruction and support services within their regular classroom&quot; (Marschark).  

It is important to be able to distinguish the two as to know what setting is being discussed.  For purposes of this article the focus will be on mainstream setting regardless of which term is used.

== Language Issues with Deaf Mainstreamed Students ==
When a teacher sees an interpreter walk into the classroom, the main assumption might be that the interpreter is a qualified and skilled sign language interpreter and that the deaf students that utilize the interpreter will be given equal access to the classroom communication with no language issues present.  But among deaf educators, there is notice that educational interpreting does not meet the language needs of the deaf students.  This is especially true the higher the education level that is examined.  Nationally, there is a need for qualified interpreters, and due to the shortage of such professionals, many deaf students struggle both academically and with communication (Marschark).

Many deaf students do depend on an interpreter to provide their communication.  A teacher has to wonder if this &quot;secondhand&quot; information is as reliable as when it was first given.  An interpreter must first listen for the information given, process it, and then sign it.  In this process, there is not a straight &quot;English to English&quot; interpretation.  Instead there is an &quot;English to American Sign Language (ASL)&quot; interpretation process occurring.  &quot;Like the words of other languages, ASL signs express meanings, not English words.  A single ASL sign can express an entire sentence that requires three words or more in English.&quot; (Perlmutter).  

Not only because of a shortage of qualified interpreters but also because of the sheer complexity of the process, many interpreters may indeed fall short of the need of both the deaf student and teacher.  Even a qualified interpreter will begin to lose accuracy during longer exchanges of information.  An interpreter must also understand the information being presented themselves in order to effectively interpret.  This is true especially in cases of higher education where an interpreter may not be as proficient in certain academic areas for which he or she is responsible as the primary communicator.  How does this impact instruction for all in the classroom?  If the instructor is not made aware of the situation by either the student or interpreter, it may just cause the deaf student to perform poorly.  The teacher may mistakenly attribute the poor performance to having a hearing loss.  On the other hand, if the teacher is made aware, there may be other methods used.  The teacher may need to slow down the exchange of information to all students or the teacher may have to “segment” information so that the deaf students have the same access as the hearing students.  This can pose difficulties with respect to time restraints that are often present in mainstream classrooms.  Also, other students may not understand why the teacher is changing the structure of the teachings.  There has to be a way to delicately balance the new mainstream classroom so that very little disruption is felt by all students. 

Language is something that long ago seemed like such a barrier.  As our country has diversified in its population, we see that it is a gap that is much easier to bridge than previously thought as more and more people enter our country that may not yet have command of the English language.  Yet, they are still able to thrive and communicate effectively.  This is also the case with deaf students.  If the student has the necessary qualified interpreter relaying the information presented, and the two of them work closely with the teacher, language will be less of a barrier.  There will need to be changes made from all parties, but the outcome of a good, equal education is well worth the effort.

== Deaf Students and the Learning Process ==
&quot;Active Learning has long been considered a proven method in improving attention, motivation and retention of concepts taught in class. This is especially true for Deaf students and students with limited language proficiency because it facilitates the development of conceptual knowledge and acquisition of language through engaging in an activity. Engaging the students in the learning process during classroom instruction also enables the teacher to monitor student achievement and helps to keep the students focused and on task&quot; (Burik).

A major problem for general educators, it is often to involve deaf students in the actual learning process.  Many times, if a teacher has asked a question, the hearing students are prepared to answer the question even before the interpreter has relayed it to the deaf student.  How do we bridge this time gap?  If the teacher is unaware that this is a problem, they may just think that the deaf student is not engaged in the activity.  How can this problem be solved?  Teachers could tell all students to wait a minute before raising hands to respond.  This would allow the deaf student to receive the message, internalize it, and be able to have an equal chance at responding to the question.  Another method could be to give all students dry erase boards to write down their answers on with a pause before all students show their answers to the teacher.   Another method could be to put the assignment on the web for students to answer there to submit.  There are several alternate methods that can be used. 

Many times in the learning process, hearing students give wrong answers.  The deaf student may be unaware of this for a few reasons.  One may be that the interpreter has so much “correct” information to interpret they do not have time to include misinformation.  Another reason that is closely related is that the interpreter may not want to include the wrong answers as to avoid confusion for the deaf student.  Imagine the process of relaying correct information, interjecting wrong answers, and then trying to explain what was just signed was not correct information.  Now imagine that as this is happening, conversation is continuing that is expected to be interpreted as well.  Interpreters have to make decisions in situations like these of what is important and what can be reasonably omitted (remember it would all be signed if time allowed).  With the deaf student unaware that it is all right to give a wrong answer, they may feel less inclined to be a part of the learning process in fear that they may not give the correct answer and feel less than adequate.  The interpreter, teacher, and student should come up with a system to let the deaf student know when others are not correct, hopefully the deaf student will then be more inclined to participate when they are unsure of their answers.  With preparation, the process will be much easier. 

It takes time for the interpretation process.  Many times deaf students are unable to be part of the learning process due to lack of time or just bad timing.  Other times, the deaf student may be afraid of having the wrong answer so they do not participate.  By making a few changes, all members of the classroom can be actively involved in the learning process.

==Communication Issues with Deaf Students==
&quot;One way of viewing the communication experiences that deaf students face in the mainstream setting is in terms of their own perceptions about their ease or difficulty in communicating&quot; (Stinson).  “These perceptions deal with communication with hearing peers, with instructors, and also with deaf peers” (Stinson).

Communication is crucial for success in the mainstream classroom.  It is very important for the deaf students to be able to communicate effectively with the teacher.  Sometimes, the deaf student is unclear when an appropriate time would be to ask a question because the interpreter does not give these cues to the deaf student.  Many times when the communication is about to take place, the teacher is unsure of procedure.  The teacher may wonder if it is more appropriate to look at the student or the interpreter.  The deaf student may wonder if the interpreter is clearly conveying their message to the teacher.  All parties involved may be wondering if anything is getting “lost” in translation.  It is important for the deaf student to let the teacher know they look at them and not the interpreter.  The teacher should also be made aware that even though the deaf person will want to keep eye contact, they will need to look away to receive the signed message from the interpreter.  Also, the deaf student may watch the mouth of the interpreter as to make sure the interpreter indeed understands the communication from the deaf person.  

Communication between the deaf and hearing students may be equally frustrating.  If the students are asked to work in groups to share ideas, will the interpreter be able to keep up with everyone interjecting opinions and ideas at the same time?  What communication will the deaf person &quot;miss&quot;?  Will the deaf person have time to interject at appropriate times with the delay in the exchange of information?  A plan should be implemented ahead of time.  The group with the deaf student can have a more structured sharing of ideas, taking turns in order to be understood by all.  The group can also implement a &quot;reflective&quot; moment so that if the deaf person wants to comment they will have the time needed.  

With little time to &quot;prep&quot; the hearing students for this situation, the deaf student, interpreter, and teacher should come up with a strategy ahead of time in order to avoid as many communication issues as possible.  Planning is the key to successful communication.

== Conclusion ==
With the ever-changing climate of the mainstream classroom, it is important to expect change.  The inclusion of deaf students is no exception.  All parties must work hard and understand there will be language issues that need to be handled, that the deaf students must be included in the learning process, and that communication issues are expected.  

&quot;Mainstreamed adults were usually 'alone' in their school and did not have others who shared their stories. Describing educational experiences to family members, colleagues, or spouses either do not occur or perhaps, fall on ears that cannot fathom the experience of education in isolation&quot; (http://deafness.about.com/od/historicprogress/fr/alonemainstream.htm).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we encourage students and teachers to consider multiple perspectives?}}
{{Rquote|right|Instruction begins when you, the teacher, learn from the learner. Put yourself in his place so that you may understand what he learns and the way he understands it.|Kierkegaard}}

''Webster’s New World Dictionary'' defines perspective as being “a specific point of view in understanding or judging things or events.”  Synonyms for perspective include perception, viewpoint, standpoint, point of view, and outlook. 

What does perspective have to do with effective teaching? Without consideration of the various perspectives students may have, a teacher will be greatly disadvantaged. It’s important to understand a student’s perspective, or the way they learn, in order to most effectively teach them and empower them to learn on their own. 

This article will examine learning styles and why it’s important to recognize differences among students. There are numerous learning style theories; this paper will focus on two of the most well known.  

==What are Learning Styles?==

'''At-home Activity to Investigate Learning Style'''

Ask yourself and your child, roommate, friend or parent what comes to mind when you hear the word dog. Some people see a picture of the animal or hear a bark, while others visualize the dog. Those who see a picture of a dog in their minds's eye or see the letters &quot;dog&quot; are probably visual. While those who hear the bark are probably auditory learners. Those who feel the soft fur of a dog are probably kinesthetic.
[http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/succeed/04-learningstyles.html University of Illinois Extension]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

In basic terminology, learning styles are simply different approaches or ways of learning. It is not what a person learns, but how a person learns. Learning style can be described as the different ways in which children and adults think and learn. Everyone has a preferred and consistent set of approaches to learning. (Ron)

==Why Are Learning Styles Important?==
&lt;table ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
A teacher’s basic understanding of learning styles can lead to:
* Reduction of teacher and student frustration
* Higher student achievement and improved self-concept
* Accommodation of a variety of learners in a classroom
* The versatility that is crucial to learning
* Improved communication with parents, administrators and other staff. (Reiff)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
{{Rquote|right|The county advocates that teachers teach to all learning styles and use a variety of teaching strategies to meet the needs of all students. Certainly each teacher also has their own style also and they are allowed in Fauquier County to vary their instructional methods depending on the student’s needs.|Wendy Wilcox| Vice Principal, Coleman Elementary School, Marshall, VA}}

Each child's brain processes information differently, resulting in different ways of learning and acquiring knowledge. A teacher must be aware of the various perspectives, or learning styles, their students have in order to develop effective teaching strategies and lesson plans. No matter which learning style theory a teacher follows, the important thing is to recognize that there are differences among children and that one teaching method may not successfully reach all students. Teachers must employ a variety of strategies to ensure that all student perspectives are accommodated for. 
 
As Judith Reiff, explains “An understanding about individual differences and learning styles will provide teachers with the theory and knowledge upon which to base decisions. If teachers can determine why a student responds in a certain way, then they can make more intelligent decisions.” Teachers can not be expected to have a different lesson plan for every child’s preferred learning style. However, their lessons can reflect an understanding of individual differences by incorporating a variety of styles. 

In addition, teachers can talk to students about their preferred learning methods and encourage them to be aware of the different learning styles that their classmates may have. This can help students understand how they learn and also make them aware of the teacher’s different instructional methods, some of which may be geared more to other students than to them, and vice versa. 

However, a student’s awareness of their preferred learning style shouldn’t keep them from working to acquire those styles which they do not yet possess. Students can often develop the ability to adapt to other learning styles. Although there are characteristics of learning style that are quite stable in students across different learning tasks and contexts, there can still be variation in the same learner. (Smith,Dalton)

==Learning Style Theories== 
===Dunn &amp; Dunn Theory===
The Dunn and Dunn Model, developed by Dr. Rita Dunn in 1967, has a great deal of history and research behind it. According to Dunn, learning style is the way in which each learner begins to concentrate on, process, absorb and retain new and difficult information or skills. 

The Dunn model identifies three learning styles:

'''Auditory learners''' prefer to use their voices and ears to learn. They remember what they hear and what they themselves say aloud. They learn best through verbal lectures, discussions, talking things through and listening to what others have to say. They seem to thrive on working and talking with others. These learners often benefit from reading text aloud and using a tape recorder.

'''Visual learners''' prefer to process information by seeing it. They like to receive information from pictures, graphs and visual media. These learners frequently close their eyes to reassemble a picture of what they are trying to remember. During a lecture or classroom discussion, visual learners often prefer to take detailed notes to absorb the information. 

'''Tactile/Kinesthetic learners''' want to be as active as they can. They tend to learn better when they have the opportunity to touch or manipulate in some way. Role play, field trips, and movement activities can accommodate kinesthetic learners. These students may find it hard to sit still for long periods and may become distracted by their need for activity and exploration. (Wallace)

===Gardner Multiple Intelligence Theory===
Howard Gardner identified seven distinct intelligences. According to Gardner, his theory &quot;documents the extent to which students possess different kinds of minds and therefore learn, remember, perform, and understand in different ways.&quot; He argues that &quot;students learn in ways that are identifiably distinctive. The broad spectrum of students - and perhaps the society as a whole - would be better served if disciplines could be presented in a numbers of ways and learning could be assessed through a variety of means.&quot; (Lane) 

Gardner's seven learning styles:

'''Bodily-Kinesthetic learners''' like physical movement, making things and touching. They learn well when involved in physical activity, hands-on learning and in forms of expression like dance, mime, drama, or role playing.

'''Interpersonal learners''' engage in verbal and nonverbal communication with others. They learn best when working cooperatively in groups, reacting to others' moods and feelings, and understanding the perspective of others. 

'''Intrapersonal learners''' focus on situations that require them to reflect upon themselves. They like higher-order thinking and reasoning, self-reflection, spirituality, and the awareness and expression of feelings. They learn best through independent study and introspection.

'''Linguistic learners''' relate to language in both its written and spoken form. They have highly developed auditory skills and often think in words. They learn best through poetry, reading, playing word games, storytelling, abstract reasoning, metaphors, similes, etc.

'''Logical-mathematical learners''' focus on different types of reasoning, calculating and logic. They think conceptually and like to make observations, draw conclusions, make judgments, formulate hypotheses and experiment.

'''Musical learners''' have the capacity to recognize rhythm and tone patterns, and have sensitivity to sounds from the human voice and musical instruments. They like to interact with music and can be taught by turning lessons into lyrics or tapping out a tune. 

'''Visual-Spatial learners''' think in terms of physical space and like to deal with visualization and imagery. They learn well through painting, drawing, sculpture, designs, doing puzzles, and text with charts and graphs.

===Myers-Briggs Theory===
The Myers-Briggs Theory has evolved from the work of Carl Jung in the 1940s.  It tests 4 areas and puts you into one of two categories.  At the end of the test you are given a letter acronym that describes your learning style.  This description can help you to understand yourself and how you learn best.  Knowing about the different learning styles will help you to effectively teach students with differing learning styles from your own.
;Extroversion versus Introversion: Extraverted people tend to have high energy and cherish interaction.  They like to be involved with many types of relationships and are always building new ones.  Introverted people are the interactors.  They rarely start the interaction and are generally &quot;on-the-fly thinkers.&quot; (Brightman)
;Sensing versus Intuition: Sensing people are usually detail oriented and very trustworthy.  They want the basic facts needed to accomplish a task.  Intuitive people usually work within patterns and relationships.  They like to look at the &quot;big picture&quot; (Brightman).
;Thinking versus Feeling: Thinkers tend to value fairness and make decisions impersonally based on facts.  Feelers value harmony and focus their lives of human values (Brightman).
; Judging versus Perceptive: Judging people are decisive and take action quickly.  They are focused on completing the task at hand.  They &quot;plan their work and work their plan.&quot;  Perceptive people are curious and adaptable.  They are spontaneous and believe that &quot;deadlines are meant to be stretched&quot; (Brightman).

==Putting Learning Style Theory to Work in the Classroom==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Butler offers these suggestions for incorporating a learning style philosophy into the classroom: 
* Observe the students
* Build on strengths
* Help students to be flexible
* Have students think about their own thinking
* Offer choices
* Examine the curriculum (Reiff)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

When developing lesson plans and teaching strategies, teachers must keep in mind the varying learning styles of their students and how they can best incorporate methods that appeal to all students. Since each student may have several different learning styles that work best for them, it’s important to provide a variety of activities. In that way, teachers can help to develop other learning styles in their students. 

Learning styles can be used both to teach and reinforce concepts. Teachers can use one approach to teach a concept, and then use a different approach to reinforce it. For example, teachers might use a linguistic approach, such as a story, to teach the idea of an animal community, and then have students draw a picture that reflects that concept in art. 

Research shows that the highest achieving students tend to be the ones who learn most easily by listening or by reading, thus they are typically auditory or visual. (Wallace) In addition, research shows that many students who are not doing well in school are tactile or kinesthetic learners. Hard to reach and hard to teach students are more successful when taught with different teaching strategies representing the differing learning styles. (Reiff)

==Conclusion==
A basic understanding of learning styles is important for all teachers to enable them to tailor lesson plans, teaching strategies and methods to meet the needs of all students. Teachers can experiment with various strategies to determine which best meets the learning style needs of students. 

However, it’s important to keep in mind that students should not be labeled according to their learning style since this can change, and the student can adapt to different styles simply by being exposed to them. If teachers allow students to develop their preferences and style by exposing them to different styles, they will be able to engage in a wider set of learning experiences. (Smith,Dalton)

There are probably as many ways to &quot;teach&quot; as there are to learn. Perhaps the most important thing is to be aware that people do not all see the world in the same way. (Ron) 
The challenge for teachers is to provide for all types of learning style in a balanced way during class. By doing this, teachers can help improve the learning outcomes of all students.

{{question-answer|question=Why is it important for teachers to recognize that their students may have a variety of different learning styles and how can teachers accommodate for these differences in class? 
|answer=Teachers need to be cognizant of their students varied learning styles so they can ensure that all students are learning and understanding the lessons being taught. Some students learn better through written lessons, while others prefer more active, hands-on learning methods. A teacher must be sure to use a variety of teaching strategies to reach all students. 

For example if you follow the Dunn Learning Styles Theory when teaching mathematical concepts, a teacher could address multiple learning styles by developing a lesson plan that includes: oral explanation (for auditory learners); written explanation on the blackboard and through worksheets (for visual learners); and hands-on manipulatives and  movement exercises (for tactile/kinesthetic learners). 

Following the Gardener Learning Styles Theory, a teacher could teach math concepts by singing number songs for musical learners; telling stories in which numbers figure prominently for linguistic learners; using social activities such as cooking from a recipe to address interpersonal learners; and developing math puzzles or art projects for visual-spatial learners.
----
It is extremely important for teachers to recognize that teach of their students may have a variety of different learning styles because all students learn differently. Because of this, to be a successful educator, it is vital that you need to know several different ways to teach every student. The Dunn and Dunn Theory lists’ the three most popular learning styles among students as Auditory learners, Visual learners, and Kinesthetic learners. Accommodating all three of these learning styles into ones classroom is simply. When teaching a group of students, everything must be stated three times. The first time, for the auditory learners’, just saying it out loud is probably enough. The second time, for the Visual learners, draws a diagram, or shows a picture that relates to what you are trying to teach. And the third time, for the kinesthetic learners, do an exercise to represent the task. Have students get up. By using these three simple steps, not only would teachers be able to reach all three learning styles, but class would be entertaining and enjoyable for everyone. Every educator has the ability to aid all of their students in the correct manner without having to take the times to individually teach each student.}}

In addition, many of the programs communication programs listed above offer user directories that allow users to search for persons living in a particular country and/or speaking a particular language.


*'''Pyngo.com''' [http://www.pyngo.com] 
The most difficult aspect of learning Chinese language is to &quot;practice&quot; what you have learned from classes or audio tapes, often referred to as &quot;language immersion.&quot; According to the famous Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, &quot;all cognitive function processes, including learning language, arise from social interactions.&quot; So, unless you have a socially interactive environment, learning a foreign language on your own is very difficult, no matter how committed you are.

Through Pyngo, you can connect with Chinese native speakers at any time and practice what you have learned from audio tapes or classrooms. So you can achieve that all important level of language immersion - for better learning, comprehension and speaking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Are Draw Instructions Part of the Programming Language?==
Firstly, it seems that Draw Instructions are a separate entity from TI-BASIC. They are given a different section in the official TI-83 manual (not sure about other manuals), and are accessed through a different menu. In addition, the draw instructions are not defined in full, only the ClrDraw instructions. The others should be at lest given a mention, and possibly even explained in full. [[User:Redsoxcool|Redsoxcool]] ([[User talk:Redsoxcool|talk]]) 22:03, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

==New Info==
This section will stay, but the material will come and go.

Moved conventions to [[TI-Basic Programming/Authors/Conventions]].

TI-Basic Programming will be the bridge between the two versions, containing information on both books, but not including it.  This discussion will stay, only because it's so much easier to communicate.  In addition, perhaps we will add other pages to TI-Basic Programming, but for now, I don't know.

Syntaxs/Outputs/Examples all use TIB instead of bcode now! see the [[TI-Basic Programming/Authors/Conventions|Conventions Page]] to see how!.
--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 23:16, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

== Geared towards older versions? ==

It appears that this book is geared towards older versions of TI-BASIC (namely, the 83/83+ genre). I was wondering how I should go about adding in stuff about later versions (I'm quite adept at the 89), so should I create separate modules for already existing content, make separate sections in existing modules, or something else? If you could get back to me on this somewhat quickly, I'd appreciate it so I can start writing ^_^ --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] 23:40, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:Older versions, not necessarily (seeing how the TI-84 Plus isn't really that old), and I also believe that the TI-Basic for the TI-83 plus/TI-84 are the most common (though I only base this on experience).  However, I really do believe that TI-Basic 89 would be very beneficial to Wikibooks, even though I am a TI-Basic 84 programmer.  We could do either what you said, TI-Basic 83 Programming &amp; TI-Basic 89 Programming or, to combine it into one book of TI-Basic, then like you said sub-modules for both 83 and 89.  I think the first option would be the easiest.  

:In addition, since they are both TI-Basic, perhaps they should have the same basic layout/syntaxes.  If you think they should as well, perhaps we can work out some basics on this discussion.  As for making new pages, if you agree with me on the first option, go ahead and start making TI-Basic 89 Programming and such pages.  When I get back to making major changes to TI-Basic Programming, I’ll make the changes to make it a standard page describing TI-Basic &amp; Provide links to TI-Basic 84 Programming and TI-Basic 89 Programming.

:Sorry for the length.  If you don't agree, merely respond on what you don't and I should reply faster now that I know people are actually active here once again.  Hope this helps!
:--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 20:37, 8 October 2007 (UTC)
::Cool, I'll get to work on that then :) --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

::Should we talk format/organization?  I think it would be a good idea to stick to a similar format. --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 15:59, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

== Format == 
The current format is basically introduce the command under the catagory (ie prompt is the command under the input page), give the keys to press to reach the command (see input page for example), explain the command, give the syntax, then give examples and output if needed.  Like I said, for examples see the input/output pages.  This is the format thus far established, but no one has opposed me yet.  Thoughts on the subject?

===Links===
Links to subpages are currently using the template TI-Basic/CLink (Chapter links).  the syntax is 
&lt;pre&gt;
{dogs
who wants
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Bolded New Words===
So far, everyone has stuck to the if it's a variable then it's in italics, and the if it's optional it's in square brackets, and that's good.  What does everyone think of bolding the new functions/commands in the examples for the new functions/commands.  As an example, the ''if''s in the examples for if would be bolded.  Thoughts?--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 22:24, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

==Navigation==
I went ahead and finished the template TIB.  Now just add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TIB|89}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it will automattically add {{TIB|89}} Put the navigation you want to show up at [[TI-Basic 89 Programming/Navigation Include]], or just click the edit me link.  So just put that at the top of each page, or where you think it would be best.  As for the title of the navigation, I don't know if we need anything else other than Table of Contents, but if you think of something else, feel free... Should make our lives easier now...I'm gone for the weekend --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 21:59, 12 October 2007 (UTC)
:Table of Contents should be fine, but there cannot be headings on the Navigation Include sub-page. It screws up the section numbering of the page it gets included in, so use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; Section name &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead. Other than that, it looks good. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:23, 13 October 2007 (UTC)
::There's nothing I can do about that - it's automattically done in the navigation template - I'll see if I can find a way around that!--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 01:07, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
:Now the question is where on each page to put it...Where does it look best? Bottom, top? --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 01:19, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
::I'm thinking bottom would be best, because you'd want to be able to jump elsewhere ''after'' you finish reading the current page. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:41, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

== Functions vs Commands ==

Would If be considered a function or a command.  I automatically assumed command, but is it a function.  And if and &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; is a function, then everything is a function isn't it?  I only ask because I've been using command for Disp and Text, practically everything, but would function be better?  I considered functions to be like sin, cos, abs, and such.  What about the rest of you?
--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 01:35, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
:I consider a function something requiring parenthesis (and any passed parameters inside said parenthesis), like &lt;tt&gt;cos(''#'')&lt;/tt&gt;, and a command being something that doesn't, just needing a space to separate any passed parameters, like &lt;tt&gt;If ''test''&lt;/tt&gt;. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:40, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
::But then what about Text() and Disp, they both output things to the screen, but one just doesn't require parentheses.  That's where the line goes blurry because I consider both commands, though by the previous definition, Text would be a function...--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 22:11, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
:::Not owning an 83/84 (yet - need to get one soon because my 89 is disallowed on the ACT &gt;_&lt;), I have no idea what Text() does on it. Could you enlighten me? (By the way, I'm leaning towards function, but I don't know exactly WHAT it does. If it just output to the screen like Disp, then there really would be no point to it). --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 19 October 2007 (UTC)
::::Text() outputs to the graphing screen (smaller text, can have graphs showing) instead of the homescreen.  My argument is what is the true difference between a command and a function, Disp displays different things and it takes arguments, but why isn't it a function.  Parenthesis alone can't decide it.  Your &lt;tt&gt;output&lt;/tt&gt; takes arguments (the same as Ti84) but yours doesn't have Parenthesis.  But they do the same thing (I think).  Mine shouldn't be a function just because it has ().
:::::Yeah, output is only slightly different on the 89, in the fact that it puts it on the I/O screen (which the 84 and such don't have) and that it's passed parameters are in pixels, not characters. I do agree that it is more of a command than a function. Therefore, I'm proposing we take the &quot;easy&quot; way out:
:::::* A Command is something that you are telling the calculator to do, such as Disp and Text().
:::::* A Function is something that modifies the parameters passed into it in some way, such as cos() and string() (pretty much anything that can be represented in function-notation, even if it can't really be graphed as a function, e.g. string(x)=&quot;x&quot;).
::::: How's that as a decent distinguishing point between the two? --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:15, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
::::::even further: A function returns a value?  I think that works for the most part... --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 20:10, 24 October 2007 (UTC)
:::::::even further: A function returns a value based off the parameters passed into it in some way/shape/form (that way things like &lt;tt&gt;getMode()&lt;/tt&gt; for the 89, which returns a list of what all the modes are set to, would be classified as a command and not a function). --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:43, 24 October 2007 (UTC)
::::::::but would that be a command -- is it really something you're telling the calculator to do?(using the previous definition of telling the calc....)?--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 01:07, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

I'd consider it telling the calc something to do, since you're telling it to fetch the mode settings and display them to you in list format. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:12, 30 October 2007 (UTC)
:The problem I have with that with that is that it returns a value.  Are there any other comands that you return a value? --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 13:42, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
::Well, if you read my description carefully, I said functions return a value ''based off the parameters passed into it''. Since it's output is independent of whatever arguments you attempt to pass into it, it would ''not'' fit in the definition of a function. Of course, if this is really a problem, we can just define it on a book-by-book basis (since we're both editing different books anyway, we can get away with it). --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:10, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Okay, fine I'll give.  Functions must have parameters and the return value must be something based on those parameters. But just for clarification, when you say &quot;it's output is indepedent...&quot;, you are referring to it's return value, correct?  Sorry to have dragged this on for so long. --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 13:52, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
::::Yes, I was referring to it's return value (what it outputs to the screen). --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:30, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::::It outputs something to the screen?  Oh, I always assumed you meant return as in sin(25) returns a value and then you can use this to do calculations and such, not directly outputting it to the screen.  In that case I would have easily accepted it for a command --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 04:07, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

== Templates ==

Notice the change of the syntax of exceptions!
not
&lt;pre&gt;
|
this is an exception
&lt;/pre&gt;
but
&lt;pre&gt;
|this is an exception
&lt;/pre&gt;
and now it will put up to ?five? stars depending how many levels you go:
&lt;pre&gt;
|this is an exception
|this is an another exception
&lt;/pre&gt;
This affects syntax, output and example.  
===Bcode===
Currently to use syntax, output and example, we use bcode:command, but soon it will be modified to be used as TIB|Syntax.  Do you think that's  a good idea?  Easier for us...  No one else uses bcode, I would do the replacement within the current chapters.  --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 01:47, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
:Um, it'd be less confusing as TIB/Syntax, that way we would have separate templates instead of needing to use #ifeq to distinguish between what is wanted. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:40, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
::Would it be more convincing if I say I hate back slashes - oh so ugly.  Oh well!--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 22:35, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
:::They aren't back slashes, they're forward slashes. It's how things are sub-paged are mediawiki... using a pipe character defines separate parameters, so many parser functions would then have to be used... --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:42, 19 October 2007 (UTC)
::::Yeah I know the rules, I just don't like what they look like.  That's fine, I was just being facetious.  --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 20:06, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

== TI-89 Stuff ==

Input before prompt.  You mentioned that input accepts a string first which allows it to not display &quot;?:&quot; but you didn't say where the ?: came from - you mention input before prompt.  Should prompt be put first because it's a more simple way to input variables.  ''And'' seeing as how we have pretty much declared that a function is something that should return a value, it should be conditional commands, conditionals, or some other witty phrase for conditional statements rather than 'Conditional Functions'.  The TI84 version is the same way, but he created it before I had a chance to correct/change it.--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 01:14, 30 October 2007 (UTC)
:Conditionals works fine for me. And input is more commonly used than prompt, which is why I listed input first. As for where the ? came from, I am unsure of what you mean by this. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:10, 30 October 2007 (UTC)
::Nevermind, I must have read it wrong the first time.  Sorry

== TI-89 Programming/Input ==

It's not my call, but should there be a seperate section for functions in TI-89 Programming, perhaps explaining what functions are, how they're used, and how they're different from programs. Additionally, it seems a bit out of place to have functions in with input (it doesn't actually input anything, variables/values are more or less passed are they not?).

But then again, I don't know exactly how functions/programs work in TI-89 Basic, so maybe it's over my head in this case...

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:Rb_whiteeye.PNG|thumb|right]]
*Most common primary ocular malignancy of childhood; ~4% of pediatric malignancies
**Incidence 1/20,000
**~250 cases per year in USA
**Higher rates in developing countries
*Bilateral disease 20-30%
*10% patients have family history; 90% are sporadic (of these 20-30% are bilateral, and therefore heritable)
*Overall 40% have hereditary retinoblastoma, 60% have sporadic type
*Average age at diagnosis 1 year for bilateral; 2 years for unilateral
*Uncommonly, patients with bilateral retinoblastoma can also develop a midline neuroblastic tumor. The syndrome is called &quot;trilateral retinoblastoma&quot; (75% of the third tumors are [[Radiation_Oncology/CNS/Pineal|pineoblastoma]])
*Heritable form transmitted in autosomal dominant fashion
*Clinical presentation
**Leukocoria (white reflection in the pupil): initially inconstant, visible at certain angles/light conditions, may be seen on flash photography
**Strabismus
**Also iris rubeosis, hypopyon, hyphema, orbital cellulitis, and exophthalmia
**Some children may have no symptoms

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Fundus_retinoblastoma.jpg|Fundoscopic examination|thumb|right]]
[[Image:MRI retinoblastoma.jpg|Sagital MRI|thumb|right]]
*Awake examination with attention to visual acuity, extraocular movement, pupillary examination, slit-lamp examination, and indirect ophthalmoscopy
*Ocular fundus examination under general anesthesia: white tumor with angiomatous dilation of the vessels
**Unilateral or bilateral nature of the lesions
**Number of tumors
**Location in the retina (posterior pole, anterior retina), and anatomica relations with optic disc and macula
**Tumor size (diameter, thickness)
**Subretinal fluid and tumor seeds
**Vitreous seeding (localized vs diffuse)
*Ocular ultrasound: On A-mode shows very intense reflections from calcium deposits. On B-mode shows a heterogenous acoustic solidity with highly reflective intrinsic echoes within the tumor and attenuation of orbital pattern 
**Differential diagnosis includes [[w:Coats_disease|Coats' disease]], retinal detachment, retinopathy of prematurity, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous
*MRI: assessment of local extension to optic nerve, anterior chamber, and orbital fat. Slightly hyperintense on T1, hypointense on T2. Also to rule out trilateral retinoblastoma
*CT: intraocular mass with a higher density than the vitreous body, calcified in 90% of cases and moderately enhanced after iodine contrast agent injection. However, should be minimized due to ionizing exposure, particularly in heritable cases
*If patients needs enucleation, consider systemic staging with CSF cytology, bone marrow cytology, and spinal axis MRI
*Genetic testing should be considered

==Pathology==
[[Image:Retinoblastoma rosette.jpg|Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes|thumb|right]]
*First disease for which genetic etiology was demonstrated (Knudson, 1971 - two hit hypothesis)
*Rb gene located on 13q14 is part of [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/Cell_Cycle|G1/S checkpoint]]. It is also required for appropriate exit from the cell cycle of retinal progenitor cells and for rod development 
*&gt;900 mutations of Rb gene have been reported, many in areas of binding domain with E2F
*However, other molecular events are also necessary for tumorigenesis; n-myc is amplified in ~10%
*Given higher prevalence in developing countries, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus, via E7) may play a role
*Neuroepithelial origin
*Tumor cells form Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes

==Staging==
*Historically, retinoblastoma was separated into intraocular and extraocular disease
*Intraocular retinoblastoma was classified using the Reese-Ellsworth staging, which was based on the likelihood of preserving the eye after EBRT. However, it does not have good predictive power in strategies involving initial chemotherapy
*International Classification System was developed in 2003 to predict outcomes in response to chemotherapy and focal consolidative therapy, and is used in COG protocols


'''Reese Ellsworth Staging'''
*Stage Ia - solitary, &lt;4 disc diameters, at or behind equator
*Stage Ib - multiple, &lt;4 disc diameters, at or behind equator
*Stage IIa - solitary, 4-10 disc diameters, at or behind equator
*Stage IIb - multiple, 4-10 disc diameters, at or behind equator
*Stage IIIa - anterior to equator
*Stage IIIb - solitary tumor &gt;10 disc diameters, behind equator
*Stage IVa - multiple tumors, some &gt;10 disc diameters
*Stage IVb - anterior to ora serrata (serrated jct. between retina &amp; ciliary body)
*Stage Va - massive tumor, &gt; 50% retina
*Stage Vb - vitreos seeding

|}

==Treatment==
*For small localized tumors, enucleation or EBRT were used historically. EBRT use declined recently due to significant late toxicity and risk of second tumors. There is now increasing use chemotherapy and focal therapies such as thermotherapy, photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and plaque brachytherapy
*For extensive unilateral lesions, enucleation or definitive radiation are the main approaches
**Indications for adjuvant treatment after enucleation are somewhat controversial, but may include optic nerve involvement posterior to the lamina cribrosa as an independent finding; posterior uveal invasion (includes choroidal invasion); any degree of concomitant choroid and optic nerve involvement; tumor involving the optic nerve posterior to the lamina cribrosa (passage through sclera) as an independent finding; scleral invasion; anterior chamber seeding; ciliary body infiltration; iris infiltration
**COG has an ongoing study of adjuvant carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine x 6 cycles in patients considered at &quot;high risk&quot; after enucleation (ARET0332) for the following high-risk criteria:
***Massive choroid replacement defined as posterior uveal invasion grades IIC and IID
***Any posterior uveal involvement with any optic nerve involvement (optic nerve head, prelamina and post lamina cribrosa (Note: both posterior uveal involvement AND optic nerve involvement are required)
*For bilateral disease, conservative approaches have been suggested, but depend on size, number, and location of lesions
**Chemoreduction, with enucleation of the &quot;worse&quot; eye and focal therapy of the &quot;better&quot; eye can be considered
*Patients with extraocular retinoblastoma have a poor prognosis, although high-dose chemo with stem cell rescue is being explored by COG
*Treatment Guideline based on UCSF Protocol (PMID 19477707, 2009)
**Group A: Focal therapy only (laser, cryotherapy, hyperhtermia, brachytherapy)
**Group B: Vincristine + carboplatin up to 6 cycles; focal therapy with 2-6 cycles
**Group C: Vincristine + carboplatin + etoposide up to 6 cycles; focal therapy
**Group D: Same as C. EBRT
**Group E: Enucleation. Prophylactic 3-agent chemotherapy


===External Beam Radiation Therapy===
*Historically used as a treatment alternative to avoid enucleation in select patients
*Target was entire retina, up to ora serrata anteriorly
**Initially, &quot;D-shaped&quot; field was used
**Alternatively, a wedge pair with anterior and lateral fields could be used
**To obtain better sparing of lens, anterior lens block could be added
*Local control rates were &gt;75% for early lesions
*However, long-term toxicity was significant. In particular, stunted growth of orbital bone and poor long term cosmetic outcome became a problem
**Orbital bone growth centers are located along the sutures, frontozygomatic in lateral wall, frontomaxillary in the medial wall, and zygomatic-maxillary in the orbital floor
*Also, for patients with hereditary retinoblastoma, risk of second malignancy has been reported as high as 51% at 50 years
*Efforts are now under way to avoid EBRT in the primary treatment setting, and use it for salvage only
*Two dosimetric studies have shown that proton therapy may be dosimetrically superior to photon EBRT in settings where focal therapies are not appropriate


*'''MSKCC, 1996''' (1979-84) - PMID 8641925 -- &quot;External beam radiation therapy and retinoblastoma: long-term results in the comparison of two techniques.&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996; 35(1):45-51
**123 pts, 1979-91, tx'd w/ primary EBRT (larger fx size, 2.5 Gy, used b/f 1984), range of xrt 38-50 Gy
**Series compared a modified lateral beam technique to an anterior lens sparing technique; local control for Group I-III tumors appeared to be improved w/ modified lateral beam (84% vs 38% at 5 yrs)
*'''Hahnemann, 1996''' (1980-1991) - PMID 8641908 -- &quot;External beam radiation for retinoblastoma: results, patterns of failure, and a proposal for treatment guidelines.&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol, Biol, Phys.  1996; 35(1):125-32
**27 pts, 34 eyes, RE Groups I-V tx'd w/ definitive EBRT (median 45 Gy)
**Local control 78.5% in RE Groups I-II, 20% in RE III-V; EBRT did NOT appear to prevent new tumors in clinically uninvolved retina.
*'''St. Jude's, 1969''' PMID 5822720  Cassady, Ellsworth et al.  &quot;Radiation therapy in retinoblastoma. An analysis of 230 cases.&quot;  Radiology.  1969; 93(2):405-9
**230 pts, largest US series of retinoblastoma pts treated w/ EBRT.  3.3-4.0 Gy delivered 3x per week.
**Local control 73% in RE Groups I-II, 20% in RE III-V.  
**No significant difference in local tumor control when doses of 32.5-35 Gy compared to 40-45 Gy.

===Plaque Brachytherapy===
*Plaque brachytherapy introduced in 1931 with radon seeds
*I-125 used commonly in the U.S., Ru-106 in Europe
*For Ru-106 plaques, tumors should be &lt;5 mm deep due to steeper dose fall-off


'''''Iodine-125'''''
*'''Thomas Jefferson''' 
**'''Salvage; 2006''' (1994-2005) PMID 16949158 -- &quot;Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy as salvage treatment for retinoblastoma recurrence after chemoreduction in 84 tumors.&quot; (Shields CL, Ophthalmology. 2006 Nov;113(11):2087-92. Epub 2006 Sep 1.)
***Retrospective. 84 tumors in 71 eyes in 64 patients, solid recurrences after chemoreduction (vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin x6 cycles + thermotherapy or cryotherapy). I-125 plaque, dose 40 Gy to tumor surface + 2 mm margin. Mean thickness 4 mm. Mean foveola dose 45 Gy, optic disc 22 Gy. Prior EBRT in 30%. Median F/U 4 years
***Outcome: Local control after chemoreduction 95%, after chemoreduction + EBRT 100%
***Toxicity: Proliferative retinopathy 17%, maculopathy 24%, cataract chemoreduction 19% vs chemoreduction + EBRT 42%, iris neovascularization 8%
***Conclusion: I-125 plaque BT offers excellent tumor control; complications should be anticipated
**'''2001'''  (1976-1999) PMID 11713089 -- &quot;Plaque radiotherapy for retinoblastoma: long-term tumor control and treatment complications in 208 tumors.&quot;  Ophthalmology.  2001; 108(11):2116-21.
***Retrospective. 141 children managed w/ plaque brachy; 71% received prior therapy (chemo, EBRT, cryotherapy, photocoagulation, etc); 35% s/p prior tx failure
***Outcome: 5-year local control 79%, if primary therapy 88%
***Toxicity: 27% non-proliferative retinopathy, 15% proliferative retinopathy, 31% cataracts, 0% scleral necrosis at 5 yrs
***Conclusion: Good tumor control, particularly for those that fail prior therapy

**Retrospective. 39 children, 41 eyes, 63 tumors. First line treatment 5%, second-line 21%, salvage 74%. Plaque diameter &gt;= 2 mm than tumor diameter, margin 1 mm to tumor height for sclera. Prescription dose target 50 Gy at apex. Minimum F/U 1 year
**Outcome: 1-year tumor control 73%. Recurrence 12% if 1st/2nd line, and 32% if salvage. Eye retention 76% (though 3/10 removed eyes for different tumor than the one treated)
**Toxicity: Retinal detachments 17%, proliferative retinopathy 2%, cataract 10%
**Conclusion: Ru-106 brachytherapy effective

**Treatment planning. 8 patients (3 Rb, 2 MB, 3 pelvic sarcoma), retrospective DVH comparison of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, protons
**&lt;u&gt;Retinoblastoma&lt;/u&gt;: Protons best coverage combined with most orbital bone sparing (&gt;5 Gy protons 10%, electrons 25%, 3D lateral beam 41%, 3D anterolateral beam with lens block 51%, 3D anterolateral beam without lens block 65%, IMRT 69%). Single appositional electron field next best technique. 3D-CRT techniques significantly inferior
**Medulloblastoma: Protons least dose to cochlea, hypothalamus/pituitary. IMRT second best for posterior fossa. For craniospinal, 3D electrons better than 3D photons
**Pelvic sarcoma: Protons superior for ovary dose
**Conclusion: Protons superior, both for target coverage and for normal structure sparing

***Treatment planning. Different retinoblastoma tumor locations (posterior-central, nasal, temporal), different eye positions (straight, intrarotated, extrarotated), different beam arrangements (lateral, anterolateral oblique, anteromedial oblique)
***Conclusion: Homogenous target coverage, true lens sparing. Doses to orbit structures minimized depending on tumor location

== Questions and Conversation factoids ==

I hope the changes I've made are liked. I thought that the Questions and Conversations pages would make better sense as one chapter, since asking questions are part of having a conversation. I've copied the contents of the Questions into this one and redirected that page to this one, so people can still find it. There is a page named &quot;Visualising social interaction&quot;, so I renamed this page as &quot;Understanding social interaction&quot;, to be a second part to that chapter. This is much in the same way as &quot;Ways to maintain self esteem&quot; is a second part of &quot;Ways to build self esteem&quot;. I've also updated the page where this is included from, to reflect these changes. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:10, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:Please don't change the layout of the book.  The questions section is easily one of the most important parts of the book and should go up front because it doesn't discuss conversation at all. [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 15:13, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:: How are (asking) questions, and knowing how to do so effectively to get the answers you want, not part of a conversation? I would agree that questions are one of the most important parts of some conversations. Even my question is proof that questions are part of a conversation. Saying &quot;its not discussing conversation at all&quot;, makes no sense to me. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:43, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::The conversation section applies to non-autistic social conversation, whereas the questions section deals with actually retrieving needed factual information that can't be found anywhere else and that non-autistic people learn instinctively.  The kind of information contained in this book but which isn't in there. [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 03:06, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

:::: Surely the conversation section is (or should be) about social conversations between autistics and non-autistics, in order to help autistics deal with conversing with non-autistics? Rather then just how non-autistics converse. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:13, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

:::::It's a minor distinction really, but one well made.  The book isn't really about how to do anything.  The opening half of the book just talks about how the non-autistic world works, so theoretically it can be used for both things.  In reality, you have to actually get onto the &quot;non-autistic wavelength&quot; to be able to connect with any non-autistic person.  Once that's achieved, it may be possible to negotiate other communication styles, but in general, they use the same communication style for everybody.

== Reciprocal disclosure ==

&quot;There are very good reasons for everyone to be careful about how deep they go into any given relationship. The deeper they go, the more compatible they need to be for the relationship to remain positive, and the harder it can be emotionally to remain in, or end, a negative relationship; therefore the more they need to be sure of being compatible.&quot;

This is my understanding, anyway; but since I'm on the spectrum myself, it needs verification. [[User:Seahen|Seahen]] 00:11, 27 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Questions =
* DON'T try to follow these rules too closely (use your own judgement here).  This section is STILL in its beta phase.
* Questions are the things that enable autistic spectrum people to survive in this world.
* Knowing how to find the information you need and weed out the stuff you don't is likely to be one of your best survival skills.
* It is necessary to understand that you as an autistic spectrum person are very probably unique as a person; with your own goals, features, flaws, needs and perception(s) of life.  You are probably the one who is most willing and able to find out what you need to know to achieve something.
* This guide is not any kind of real answer to life the universe and everything; however, asking questions from people you know and trust is probably a good start.

== Types of questions ==
* Personal questions are ones that ask a person to reveal something about themselves, or their &quot;subjective&quot; opinion about something.  No particular answer is correct, and not answering is also an option.
* Leading questions are questions asked in such a way as to lead a person to answer a particular way.  These are often, but not always, forms of manipulation.
* Rhetorical questions are ones designed to get people to think about the answer rather than to answer them directly.
* Queries are requests for &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;definitive&quot; information.  The answers you get to these questions are rarely objective or definitive.  The best way to deal with this is to query again for more specific answers.  This method is not unlike dealing with Google.
* Open questions are used in conversation and allow the person being asked to talk for as much as they want for a reply.
* Closed questions are used in conversation and which require short clarifying answers.  These are often good &quot;listening tools&quot;.
* Statements are about telling people something.  Telling people that you don't know something in particular can prompt someone into explaining it but often it gets NOTHING as an answer.

== Getting useful information from people ==
* If the person you're seeking information from has bad experiences answering your questions then they may avoid doing so.
* If the person you ask questions of sees that you don't take answers to heart, they may put less effort into their answers.
* Questions usually have assumptions, and if they don't, then they often SEEM to have assumptions.
** These assumptions are statements that can often be more offensive than when they are stated outright.
** Example of a question with an assumption:  &quot;Why is X stupid?&quot; assumes that X is stupid and rules out an answer that may explain X.
** Example of a question that seems to have one:  &quot;How do you talk to people?&quot; is too broad a question, probably leading to the assumption that it's a personal question.  That is, &quot;how do YOU talk to people?&quot;
* The best questions are almost certainly the ones that assume nothing but that the answers to former questions are true.
* Starting a &quot;questioning session&quot; with the assumption that the former rule is correct leaves us no option but to ask a question with no assumptions.
** Examples of such a question: &quot;Is it fair to say that ... (any given statement)?&quot;
* NEVER ask a question that you aren't prepared for an honest answer to, and if you aren't prepared for the answer you get, never over-react.
* Bear in mind that &quot;knowledge is power&quot; and asking certain questions MAY reveal gaps in your understanding that other people MAY be able to exploit.
* I find it's usually easier to find the information I seek by staying focused on acquiring it in a form I understand.  This is an art in itself.
* It is usually OK to ask a few questions you already know the answer to test the person's answering abilities, so long as you don't ask them for the purpose of &quot;showing them up&quot;.

== Using questions to teach ==
* [[w:Socratic_method]].

== Debate ==
* Questions are so powerful that people have had to come up with some ingenious defences against them.
** These defences involve never answering the questions properly, or dissuading people from asking or pursuing them.
** &quot;I am asking the questions here.&quot;
** &quot;I disagree with your question on the basis that it doesn't entirely reflect my reality in all the minor details and so I am going to repeat your question in full whilst imposing my own vocal interpretation in the most dramatic of ways without actually clarifying anything in the hope of obfuscating the situation as badly as I can in the hopes of leaving all but the hopeful few actually interested in an answer or in pursuing the matter so flabbergasted that they won't, and those that are with much less time to do so.&quot;
*** Trying to understand political discussion is not an un-worthwhile pastime these days.
* Stating solid opinions will show others that you have something to contribute to society.

= Understanding social interaction =
This is an extension of the [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/marc2.en.html#conversation Conversation] section of Marc's book.  It is drawn in part from articles posted on wrongplanet.net, and from discussions with my mother and those on the WP channel.  JWM.
The (alpha) and (beta) tags next to each section's title indicate the state of development that they're in, given that it seems to me to be an extremely important part of the book.
== Defining Conversation ==
* Wiktionary defines [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conversation#Noun conversation] as &quot;expression and exchange of individual ideas through talking with other people&quot;.
* Conversation is similar to [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/speech#Noun speech] and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/discourse#Noun discourse] in that ideas usually generate new ideas in other people.
* Conversation is different from speech and discourse in that those new ideas can be communicated back immediately.
* When people meet to hold a conversation, they usually want those ideas exchanged as fully as possible.
* When ideas are being exchanged as fully as possible, they usually also want those ideas exchanged as quickly as possible.
* When ideas aren't being exchanged properly, there are many potential remedies that basically involve the listener getting the speaker to repeat, restate and/or give up communicating the idea.
* There have been many, MANY other books written about conversation, but most of them rely on knowing these basic ideas.
== Conversations between people ==
* The conversation between people who want to meet each other for the first time on agreeable terms usually follows a particular protocol.
* Such a conversation usually starts with greetings and small talk, during which both parties thresh out each other's disposition regarding certain things such as:
** How willing the person is to talk with the other.
** What kind of threats the person could represent.
** The person's place in any relevant pecking order.
** What kind of mood the person is in.
** What kind of person they are generally.
** What the person's pet areas of interest might be.  Yes, non-autistic people have them too.
** How much of the information that was gleaned from any previous encounters still applies.
* The interaction takes the form of questions and statements designed to elicit responses from, while not offending or embarrassing the other person; or rather, avoiding the consequences of doing so.
* If someone asks how you are, they really are not wanting to know the true or literal answer.  This is a way of judging another person's outlook.  A short answer is always best, and if you're trying to make a good impression, an answer that indicates a positive and confident mood such as &quot;well&quot;, &quot;doing great&quot;, or just &quot;good&quot; is best.  It may be acceptable or appropriate sometimes to give a short one sentence answer that communicates a &quot;status report&quot; in something you were talking to the person about before.  In all cases, remember to follow up with a similar greeting if you haven't already.
* If, on the other hand, you don't want to interact with people who introduce themselves to you, the &quot;best&quot; way to &quot;get rid of them&quot; is to AVOID using the most direct method, and to use the least offensive way of communicating that with them you can find.  This way you won't get a reputation for being brash and bad mannered.  If this doesn't work, it's OK to use more direct methods.  Starting with avoiding eye contact is not a bad idea.
* The key thing to look for in responses is whether the person has positive or negative reactions during introductions or when a subject has been brought up.
* People with negative outlooks and body language are usually avoided, and may in fact be trying to be avoided.
* People with un-confident or inconsistent body language are also often avoided.  The best way to deal with this by far is to just &quot;be&quot; the emotion you want to be.
* Based on each person's responses and body language, the conversation then gravitates back and forth between areas of common interest and small talk.
* Any time during the conversation, participants may switch to another topic, switch back to small talk, or use a distraction to pull out of the conversation.
* It is considered acceptable to tell white lies to end a conversation when no other distractions are available, but not ones that are obvious.
* Failure to respond can lead to people being scared off.
* Responding inappropriately can lead to being misjudged.
* Reading responses incorrectly can lead to misjudging people.
* It is much more important for the person starting the conversation to follow the protocols closely than for the other person.
* It is best to stay away from negative and contentious things unless the other person displays an interest in debating them constructively.
* It is important for both to try to develop an understanding of what the other person is thinking and feeling while talking.  This is rapport.
* It is worth noting that autistic spectrum people often end up in passionate conflicts with each other due to failing to understand each other's disposition.  Small talk is actually quite a neat and useful trick.

== Rapport and Friendship (alpha) ==
* [[w:Rapport]] is NOT something you have when you &quot;get&quot; someone or consistently understand their behaviour, or when you think the other person gets you, but when the other person also shares the same feeling.  Your [[w:Mirror_neuron|mirror neurons]] are capable of misguiding you.
* Friends share rapport, but rapport is not about friendship.
* One definition of Rapport is &quot;a feeling of mutual understanding or trust and agreement between people&quot;.
* Rapport may be when both people &quot;get&quot; each other or share a sense of &quot;connection&quot;.
* Rapport between two people develops over time as they gradually learn more about each other and develop trust and appreciation for each other's worth.  This is particularly true for friendship.
* THEORY:  Mirror Neurons WORK in autistic spectrum people the same way they do in non-autistic people, but the psychological effects are quite different due to the NUMBER of people those mirror neurons work for. It is possible that they work just like a neurotypical person's does, but only when dealing with Autistic spectrum people (and then only when the two people are thinking the same). Because AS people usually lack the ability to unconsciously conform, their thinking is much less likely to be the same as someone they're talking to.

== Reciprocal disclosure (beta) ==
* During a conversation, people will often take turns to trade personal information in the hopes of learning more about each other and developing some rapport.
* One person may elicit information from another either by asking direct questions or by disclosing personal information in the hopes of getting the other person to disclose similar information.
* The latter case is often used when a question may be considered too personal since it doesn't REQUIRE an answer.  Disclosing something else or changing the subject is quite acceptable.
* Disclosing too little information can be seen as being withdrawn or not willing to talk, or simply not willing to disclose a particular piece of information.
* Disclosing too much information may have the following consequences:
** Being seen as someone who is too trusting.  Perhaps even a potential victim.
** Being seen as someone less trustworthy, who can't keep secrets well.  Particularly if the information is about other people.
** Being seen as someone who is dangerous or ditsy, based on the nature or relevance of the information disclosed; particularly if other relevant pieces of information haven't already been disclosed.
** Being seen as being aloof, distracted or detached from the flow of the conversation.
** Being seen as needy, clinging or childish.
* The mystique created by knowing and obeying the reciprocal disclosure rules also contributes to charisma.
* People will have expectations about how far they want to take any relationship that develops, and also how quickly.  Those expectations will change as the conversation develops, and it is a bad idea to try to push this process further than the other person wants to take it.
* There are very good reasons for everyone to be careful about how deep they go into any given relationship. The deeper they go, the more compatible they need to be for the relationship to remain positive, and the harder it can be emotionally to remain in, or end, a negative relationship; therefore the more they need to be sure of being compatible.
* In fact, an ability to know when to stop going deeper is probably one of the best survival techniques.

== Approaching people (alpha) ==
* This section is at the end because it is probably the most difficult part of any successful conversation.
* If you have absolutely no ability to start worthwhile conversations, it is a good idea to think about the way people introduce themselves to you to get a feel for how it is done before embarking on the mission of learning this skill yourself.
* In fact, it's a good idea to have practised your other conversation skills first with people who introduce themselves to you.
* It is important to have practised voice tones prior to attempting a conversation. Telling someone their fly is open at maximum volume is not a good idea.
* Pay particular attention to the subjects people raise.  They may have something to do with the current environment or situation or perhaps they are trying to confirm things about the impression they have of you.  If different people keep raising the same subjects, it may be due to your image or appearance.
* Also pay attention to the care with which people approach you.
* An example of the last statement is that I realised once that people kept raising the subjects of consumerism, biking and heavy metal.  And when I thought about it, it clicked that I am quite a big man, with a long beard and hair who wears a biker jacket and no jewellery.  People were thinking I might be a biker or a hippy.  I didn't like the biker image, so I stopped wearing the jacket.
* Avoid trying to learn things from how people greet (and interact with) each other unless you know about their relevant backgrounds and their relationship to each other.  Friends greet each other in different ways from strangers, and greeting strangers like friends is quite a dangerous thing.
* It is quite important to be in a happy, comfortable, confident mood when meeting strangers.  If you are going to go somewhere to meet strangers, try to prepare yourself beforehand by thinking about things that make you happy.
* Conversation starters are also known as &quot;icebreakers&quot; or &quot;openers&quot;.
* The best icebreakers are &quot;closed questions&quot; about the situation or something good you notice about the person followed up by &quot;open questions&quot;.
* Don't feel bad if your efforts to start conversations fail.  Most first-conversations between strangers don't turn into extended ones.  Ask people about this sometime.

==IsNan==

''Function IsNan( x:Double )

'''Description''': Check if a value is NAN

'''Returns''': True if '''x''' is 'not a number' (e.g.: Sqr(-1))

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local a:Float = Sqr(-1)

Local b:Int = IsNan(a)	'b will equal True in this example, because the square root of -1 is 'not a number'&lt;/pre&gt;

==IsInf==

''Function IsInf( x:Double )

'''Description''': Check if a value is infinite (e.g.: 1.0/0.0)

'''Returns''': True if '''x''' is infinite

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local a:Float = 1.0 / 0.0

Local b:Int = IsInf(a)	'b will equal True in this example, because 1.0 divided by 0.0 is infinite&lt;/pre&gt;

==Sqr==

''Function Sqr:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Square root of '''x'''

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local a:Int = 4
Local b:Int = Sqr(a)&lt;/pre&gt;

==Sin==

''Function Sin:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Sine of '''x''' degrees

==Cos==

''Function Cos:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Cosine of '''x''' degrees

==Tan==

''Function Tan:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Tangent of '''x''' degrees

==ASin==

''Function ASin:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Inverse Sine of '''x'''

'''Comments''': 
The inverse sine can determine the remaining angles of a right triangle when the lengths of the sides are known. For instance, an angle may be calculated using the length of the opposite side and the hypotenuse.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local alpha:Double = ASin(length_opposite / length_hypotenuse)&lt;/pre&gt;

==ACos==

''Function ACos:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Inverse Cosine of '''x'''

'''Comments''': 
The inverse cosine can determine the remaining angles of a right triangle when the lengths of the sides are known. For instance, an angle may be calculated using the length of the adjacent side and the hypotenuse.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local alpha:Double = ACos(length_adjacent / length_hypotenuse)&lt;/pre&gt;

==ATan==

''Function ATan:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Inverse Tangent of '''x'''

'''Comments''': 
The inverse tangent can determine the remaining angles of a right triangle when the lengths of the sides are known. For instance, an angle may be calculated using the length of the opposite side and the adjacent side.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local alpha:Double = ATan(length_opposite / length_adjacent)&lt;/pre&gt;

==ATan2==

''Function ATan2:Double( y:Double,x:Double )

'''Description''': Inverse Tangent of two variables '''x''' , '''y'''

'''Comments''': 
ATan2 is similar to ATan. However, it makes use of the two arguments signs to determine the angle of a imaginary vector (x,y) relatively to the x-axis (counterclockwise). This is very useful, for example in determining the direction from one point to another.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local ax:Float = -1, ay:Float =- 2	'Point A
Local bx:Float = 3, by:Float = 2	'Point B

'Notice how the variables we are using are Float's, BlitzMax will automatically
'convert them into Double's when we call ATan2()
Local angle:Float = ATan2(by - ay, bx - ax)	'Angle from A to B&lt;/pre&gt;

==Sinh==

''Function Sinh:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Hyperbolic sine of '''x'''

==Cosh==

''Function Cosh:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Hyperbolic cosine of '''x'''

==Tanh==

''Function Tanh:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Hyperbolic tangent of '''x'''

==Exp==

''Function Exp:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Exponential function

==Log==

''Function Log:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Natural logarithm

==Log10==

''Function Log10:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Base 10 logarithm
&lt;!-- Log and Log10 need to be described --&gt;

==Ceil==

''Function Ceil:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Smallest integral value not less than '''x'''

==Floor==

''Function Floor:Double( x:Double )

'''Description''': Largest integral value not greater than '''x'''

'''Comments''': 
Ceil() will round a variable up, whereas Floor() will round it down.

'''Example''':
&lt;pre&gt;Local a:Float = 3.5

Local round_up:Float = Ceil(a)		'Becomes 4.0
Local round_down:Float = Floor(a)	'Becomes 3.0&lt;/pre&gt;

 Muscles are the organs that make us move. All our movements from running, jumping, to blinking and smiling are made by our muscles. Muscles are everywhere. They can be tiny as in the ear or huge like leg muscles. Although no muscle is directly visible you can watch many of them in action in the mirror, when you flex your muscles. 

=== What does a muscle look like? ===

A muscle is usually a long round organ. The color is red. A muscle is flexible and shortens and thickens during a [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#contraction|contraction]]. The figure on the right shows a series of magnifications of a muscle. You can see that a muscle is a collection of fibres or strings, each of which is capable of contraction. The added force of these fibres is the strength of the muscle.

=== What are the parts of a muscle? ===

A muscle has two ends each of which attach to some other organ, usually a bone. These connectors are called [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#tendon|tendons]].

=== What is the function of a muscle? ===

Without muscles, we cannot survive. Muscles produce almost all movements in our body. We need healthy muscles to be able to walk, move, and even smile. The human body has about 620 muscles that it uses for its movement. In addition there are many more that work automatically. The muscles in our heart move blood around the body, the chest muscles help us breathe and the stomach muscles help us digest food. 

=== How does a muscle interact with other parts of the body? ===

Muscles connect with all of the other parts of the body. Muscles in the heart pump blood throughout the body. The diaphragm is a large muscle that allows us to breathe. Muscles from our mouth to our stomach and beyond help us swallow food and move it through the digestive system. Even our eyes have muscles that let us look around and see our surroundings. The muscles do movement by becoming shorter and pulling the bones to which they are attached.

=== How can you keep your muscles healthy? ===
Our muscles are kept healthy through regular exercise. Eating properly and especially including a quality protein source in your diet will help keep your muscles healthy.

&quot;Actually, I believe that broccoflower and romanesco broccoli are two different things.  According to the website http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/Romanesco/, broccoflower is &quot;a cross of broccoli and cauliflower which superficially resembles Romanesco but lacks its near perfect self-similar fractal form&quot; (see parenthetical insert at end of second paragraph under the section entitled &quot;The Unclassifiable Romanesco&quot; - 71.231.151.125&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Digestive_system_diagram_en.svg|right|thumb|300px|Upper and Lower digestive tract]]

Our bodies need food to live and grow. [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#digestion|Digestion]] is the process of taking the food and drink we eat and getting it ready for all the parts of the body to use. The digestive system breaks down food and carries it to all parts of the body.

==What does the digestive system look like?==

The digestive system looks like a long connected set of tubes and organs. It is about 10 meters long. It starts with the mouth. The [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#esophagus|esophagus]] is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, which is within the ribcage. The stomach is a muscular bag-like structure and forms a J-shaped pouch and is located under the ribcage. The stomach connects to the small intestine. This is a long skinny tube that is about 7 meters long and winds forth and back within the abdominal cavity. This then connects to the large intestine which is larger in diameter and much shorter. The large intestine becomes the rectum and ends at the anus.
The [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#liver|liver]] and the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#pancreas|pancreas]] are glands that produce fluids that help with digestion - similar to the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#lsaliva|saliva]] produced in the mouth. This whole system includes tubes and all organs and glands form the alimentary canal where the digestion takes place.

==What are the parts of the digestive system?==

The digestive system starts with the mouth, where food and water enter our body. In our mouth, our teeth and tongue do part of the work of breaking food down into smaller pieces. Saliva contains the enzyme called salivary amylase or Ptyalin which converts the starch of food into maltose which is a complex sugar.

After we chew and swallow food, it goes down a tube called the esophagus. This tube goes from the mouth to the [[Wikijunior_Human_Body/Stomach | stomach]] by the movement of peristalsis, a rhythmic contraction and expansion. In the stomach, food is broken down more. The stomach has gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid, pepsin and mucus. Hydrochloric acid makes the food acidic, kills the germs and activates the pepsin. Pepsin digests the proteins. Mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach from the action of HCl and pepsin. After this happens, the food is passed on to the [[Wikijunior_Human_Body/DigestiveSystem/SmallIntestine | small intestine]].

The small intestine is a very long twisting tube. This is where most digestion happens; here, food mixes with succus entericus (intestinal juice) secreted by the small intestine, trypsin (which digests protein), lipase (which digests lipids) secreted by pancreas, and bile juice secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, which makes the food alkaline and emulsifies (breaks down) fats. These chemicals break the food down so it can be absorbed into the blood. The small intestine is lined with villi and blood vessels that absorb the nutrients from food. 

Whatever is left over goes on to the [[Wikijunior_Human_Body/DigestiveSystem/LargeIntestine | large intestine]] where more villi absorb water. From there, the waste finally passes out of the body through the anus. The anal sphincter controls the process of defecation.

==What is the function of the digestive system?==

The job of the digestive system is to take the food we eat and make it usable for our bodies. The digestive system breaks down the food so our body can use it. It also separates out waste products that the body cannot use. The food ingested is broken down separately- proteins into amino acids, carbohydrates into glucose and lipids into fatty acids and glycerol.

==How does the digestive system interact with other parts of the body?==

The digestive system works with the circulatory system to get nutrients to all the parts of our body. After food is broken down and  reaches the [[Wikijunior_Human_Body/DigestiveSystem/SmallIntestine | small intestine]], blood vessels absorb the nutrients. The blood then carries the nutrients to cells all over the body.

==How can you keep your digestive system healthy?==

A big part of keeping your digestive system healthy is eating healthy food. Try not to eat too much or too little. Make sure to chew your food well. It is also good to include [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#fiber|fiber]] in your diet. Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eating [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#yogurt|yogurt]] can also add healthy bacteria to your body. Don't eat too much &quot;junk food.&quot; This includes foods that are high in sugar or fat. If certain foods often make your stomach hurt or cause digestive problems, try cutting back or eliminating them from your diet.

Lastly, make sure to drink plenty of water. If you live somewhere where the water is not treated, make sure the water is boiled first this will kill any bacteria in the water and make it safe to drink.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Plastic surgery'''
== Introduction ==
A surgical treatment which is performed by authorized specialist. 
*Basic goal of plastic surgery is to treat surgically by: 
**Correction of disfigurement.
**Restoration of impaired function.
**Improvement of physical appearance.
Generally the term plastic refers to the molding and reshaping of body tissues:
*Bone. 
*Fat.
*Muscle.
*Cartilage.
*Skin.
Generally during Plastic Surgery: 
*Tissue may be moved to fill a depression, to cover a wound, or to improve appearance.
*Tissue may be completely removed to alter the contours of a feature.
=== Cosmetic surgery and Plastic Surgery === 
&lt;b&gt;Cosmetic surgery:&lt;/b&gt; Surgery performed solely to improve appearance in otherwise healthy persons.                                                   &lt;b&gt;Plastic Surgery:&lt;/b&gt; Surgery performed solely to improve health in otherwise unhealthy person.

=== Benefits of plastic Surgery ===
*The correction of a perceived physical imperfection.
*Psychological benefits.

== Common procedures ==
In plastic surgery the transfer of skin tissue (skin grafting) is one of the most common procedures.
(Traditionally in surgery “Graft” is a piece of living tissue, organ, etc., transplanted surgically)
===Grafts ===
*Autografts: Skin grafts taken from the recipient.
**If absent or deficient of natural tissue, alternatives can be: 
***Cultured Sheets of epithelial cells in vitro.
***Synthetic compounds (i.e. silicone). 
*Allografts: Skin grafts taken from a donor of the same species.
*Xenografts: Skin grafts taken from a donor of a different species.

=== Micro Surgery ===
Extremely fine needles and sutures make it possible to rejoin small blood vessels and other minute structures under an operating microscope.

== Common types and indications for plastic surgery ==
#Reconstructive plastic surgery (treatment of defects resulting from trauma or disease).
#Constructive plastic surgery (treatment of innate/inborn defects).
#Anaplastic surgery (treatment of disfunction of appearance).

=== Reconstructive Plastic surgery ===
It is performed:
#To correct severe functional impairments caused by:
#*Burns.
#*Traumatic injuries.
#To correct acquired or congenital abnormalities, such as:
#*Cleft lip.
#*Cleft palate.
#*Facial bone fractures.
#*Tumours.
#To compensate for tissue removed in:
#*Cancer or other surgery.
#**i.e Mastectomy.

== Techniques used in plastic surgery ==
Among the techniques which are commonly used in plastic surgery are:
*Incision.
*Excision.
*Chemosurgery. 
*Electrosurgery.
*Laser surgery.
*Dermabrasion.
*Liposuction.

== Prognosis in plastic surgery ==
Usually, the good results are expected if plastic surgery is performed by: 
*Careful planning of incisions so that they fall in the line of natural skin folds or lines. 
*Appropriate choice of wound closure.
*Use of best available suture materials.
*Early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Spice preparation needs elaboration ==

Although cooks with South Asian backgrounds hardly need instruction in preparing spices by frying, roasting, and grinding them, this is where people from other backgrounds fall down.  Either we throw in spices which haven't been properly prepared, or we resort to &quot;curry powder&quot;.  

It would be extremely helpful if an accomplished cook who has lived overseas and experienced our bungled attempts with their cuisine would contribute a tutorial. [[User:LADave|LADave]] 18:19, 5 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==

[[Image:Matrix.png|thumb|200px|right|Organization of a matrix]]
The numbers in the matrix are called '''entries''' or '''elements'''

The '''order''' of a matrix defines its shape. For example, 2×1 matrix. First digit defines number of rows, second digit defines number of columns.

Matrices of order n×1 with just one column, are called '''column matrices''':

For example: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1  \\
    5  \\
    6 
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Matrices of order 1×n with just one row, are called '''row matrices'''

For example: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp;5 &amp;6 \\ 
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


A '''zero matrix''' is a matrix with all entries equal to zero.

For example: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

An '''identity matrix''' is a square matrix with entries of 1 on the leading diagonal (from top left to bottom right) and entries of zero everywhere else.

For example: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


===Adding and subtracting matrices===
Two or more matrices of identical dimensions &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be added. Given m-by-n matrices A and B, their sum A + B is the m-by-n matrix computed by adding corresponding elements
For example:

: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2
  \end{bmatrix}
+
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 \\
    7 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 \\
    2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1+0 &amp; 3+0 &amp; 2+5 \\
    1+7 &amp; 0+5 &amp; 0+0 \\
    1+2 &amp; 2+1 &amp; 2+1
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 \\
    8 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 \\
    3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


===Multiplying a matrix by a number===
To multiply a matrix by a number, multiply every element by the number. For example:

: &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 8 &amp; -3 \\
    4 &amp; -2 &amp; 5
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    2 \cdot 1 &amp; 2\cdot 8 &amp; 2\cdot -3 \\
    2\cdot 4 &amp; 2\cdot -2 &amp; 2\cdot 5
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    2 &amp; 16 &amp; -6 \\
    8 &amp; -4 &amp; 10
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrix multiplication==
In order for matrix multiplication to occur, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. Consider Matrix A and B below:

: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
    2 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    2 &amp; -1 \\
    3 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the 2x3 and 3x2 matrices can be multiplied either way in this example. For this example, a 2x2 matrices will result. Note that if the 3x2 was multiplied by the 2x3, a 3x3 matrice would result.  Proceed by multiplying the 1st row of Matrix A with the first column of Matrix B and summing the results. This will be your first element of the 2x2. Multiply the first row of Matrix A with the second column of Matrix B. This will be the element in the first row and second column of the resulting 2x2 matrix. This process is shown below.


Continuing with Matrix A and B from above
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
    2 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    2 &amp; -1 \\
    3 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1+6+3 &amp; 1+-3+1 \\
    2+-2+3 &amp; 2+1+1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    10 &amp; -1 \\
    3 &amp; 4 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
note that matrix multiplication is not cummutative. so MxN is not equal to NxM

The 2x3 matrix is the most complex hand calculation the IBO will require on any examination, with subsequent matrices (3x3, 3x4, 4x4) being done through use of a GDC.

==2×2 matrices==
Similar to the process shown above, only simpler. A 2x2 mulitplied by a 2x2 will always yield a 2x2 matrix. Consider Matrix A and B below:

: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    4 &amp; 2 \\
    -1 &amp; 8 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 &amp; 3 \\
    2 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -4+4 &amp; 12+0 \\
    1+16 &amp; -3+0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 12 \\
    17 &amp; -3 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==3×3 matrices==

It is not advised by the IBO for SL students to calculate by hand 3x3 matrices, as it is merely a complex extension of multiplying 2x2 matrices. Instead, the IBO recommends the use of a GDC (Graphing Display Calculator), and the Matrix function on it.485.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who is Scoop0901? ==
[http://www.scoop0901.net/ Scoop0901] is the online moniker for Dave Jackson. He is a former reporter and editor for weekly and daily newspapers, having spent more than 20 years in print media.

=== The early days of computing ===
After having spent the late 1970's playing with various models of the TRS-80 (having started out with a TRS-80 Model 1 in 1979), Scoop found that computers were tools that could make his life much easier. In the early days, they saved him a lot of time by not having to retype manuscripts he sold.

=== The early days of DTP ===
By the late 1980's and early 1990's, Scoop was busy trying to push newspapers into the electronic era. Instead of relying on the newsroom's &quot;morgue&quot; -- it's library of clippings of every story printed in each edition of the paper -- he was pushing for electronic databases for articles and photos. Scanned images, the captions, cutlines, photographer's credit, and other information could be stored much easier on servers than in cabinets. It was cheaper, overall, saving it as electrons, and you didn't have to worry about negatives being warped, storing actual photos, or someone finding the exact photo you want when on deadline. Instead, everything was a few clicks away.

=== The mid-1990's ===
Scoop0901 left the corporate world in 1995, heading out to full-time freelance writing, editing, design, and other related work. He's helped more than a dozen individuals and companies launch new publications, both magazines and newspapers. He's provided guidance on formats, design, software, hardware, employees, networking, telecommuting, databases, and other key issues.

=== Other accomplishments ===
Scoop has been involved with launching four publications, from the earliest planning stages until well after actual launch. Three of the publications are now over a decade old; one publication folded after six years due to a decline in advertising.

== Scoop in the 21st Century ==
The end of the 20th century brought about the final days of the dot-com boom, but also brought about cheaper prices for computers, storage, and other electronic gadgets and gizmos.

A master of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Book_Design/Software_Applications PageMaker], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Book_Design/Software_Applications QuarkXPress], and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Book_Design/Software_Applications InDesign], Scoop busys himself with a variety of projects: still writing, shooting pix, and doing desktop publishing (DTP), he also designs stylesheets for several outlets that are moving to DTP for production, as well as provides a variety of services to various outlets and organizations. Those services include [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Writing/Editing editing], writing, design/layout, and creating Web-friendly (small) PDF files for Website readers.

=== Fire At Will ===
Scoop also continues to write for his own pleasure. He has several blogs, including a few under his own name. They are:
==== [http://blog.scoop0901.net Scoop's Views] ==== 
[http://blog.scoop0901.net Scoop's Views] is where Scoop writes about anything that strikes his fancy. He writes freely, firing shots at any target in the news.
==== [http://sleep.scoop0901.net The Sleep Blog] ====
[http://sleep.scoop0901.net The Sleep Blog] is where Scoop writes about anything related to sleep and sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and others. Sadly, too many people -- physicians, other health care providers, and companies, are in business for the almighty dollar, not really for &quot;helping others,&quot; as the saying goes. This is where Scoop shows what should be considered the baseline acceptable standard. Anything less is unacceptable, and anything more is, well, a bonus.

== From being a hack to being a sleep activist ... ==
On January 1, 2000, while in an ICU room at a Philadelphia hospital, Scoop was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea, among a host of other serious health issues. The physicians -- read that closely, as it is plural: '''physicians''' -- told him he had been suffering undiagnosed sleep apnea, most likely, for many years. After investigative work on his own health, he found there were tattle-tale signs of apnea going back to childhood, likely to birth. He is still fighting to obtain his medical records from birth.

Since being diagnosed, Scoop has devoted a fair portion of his time toward sleep advocacy. He's been involved with running [http://www.AwakeInPhilly.org Awake In Philly], a community education and support group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for people with sleep disorders, as well as those who are impacted by sleep disorders, as family members, friends, employers, and co-workers. He serves on the board for [http://www.AwakeInAmerica.org/ Awake In America], a national non-profit (501c3) organization focused on sleep and sleep disorders, and he does a lot of other outreach, education, and support, including working as a moderator of several sleep-related email discussion lists, including [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CPAPusers/ CPAPusers] and [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ApneaKinksters/ Apnea Kinksters], the latter being a group for anyone over the age of 18 who is involved in a relationship, and has concerns or issues they need addressed in a mature, adult manner.

==== Helping Others ====
With Awake In America, Scoop spearheaded efforts to launch the [http://www.AwakeInAmerica.org/DonateRelief/ xPAP Donation and Relief Program], which is designed to assist individuals in getting CPAP or bi-level (commonly referred to as BiPAP, which is a trademark of Respironics, Inc., for a specific line of machine) machines, as well as accessories. A few months later, he spearheaded efforts to launch a [http://www.AwakeInAmerica.org/DonateRelief/ Sleep Study Relief Program].

In addition to helping with the relief program, Scoop also works to find corporate sponsors for Awake In America, as well as individual sponsors. Anyone may contribute to Awake In America's mission via its [http://www.AwakeInAmerica.org/donate.shtml online donation page].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In biology the small intestine is the part of the gastrointestinal tract (gut) between the stomach and the large intestine and includes the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum. It is where the vast majority of digestion takes place.

Size and sections In humans over 5 years old it is approximately 7 m (21 ft) long and can vary from 4-7 m (13.12-22.97 ft).

It is divided into three structural parts:

    * duodenum 25 cm (9.84 in) in length
    * jejunum 2.5 m (8.2 ft)
    * ileum 3.5 m (11.5 ft)

Although the small intestine is much longer than the large intestine (typically 4-5 times longer), it is referred to as such due to its comparatively smaller diameter. On average, the diameter of the small intestine of an adult human measures approximately 2.5-3cm, and the large intestine measures about 7.6 cm in diameter.

==What Countries Did They Live In? ==

Around the first century AD, Arab and Persian traders began visiting the east coast of Africa in modern Somalia and south to Mozambique. This portion of the African coast was valuable land and many Muslim and Bantu speaking people settled there. The Swahili civilization has its roots in ancient Bantu Africans. The Swahili civilization went as far south as Kilwa, Zanzibar. Important Swahili cities include Mogadishu, Barawa, Mombasa (Kenya), Gedi, Pate, Malindi, Zanzibar, Kilwa, and Sofala in the far south.

== What did their buildings look like? ==

They had greatly crafted wooden doors for houses. These doors are displayed on the beach as a sign of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Swahili.html|title=Swahili People|publisher=The University of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What did they eat? ==

== What did they wear? ==
Men wore kiokis (a cloth tied around the waist), and kanzus (white tops reaching below the knee) over their kioki. Women wore buibui (a black garment that covered their whole body except their eyes and hands) when they went out, but at home they dressed lightly.

== What did their writing look like? == 
Their writing was formed from hieroglyphics.

== What did they believe? ==

In the main, the Swahili people are Muslims or followers of Islam. The religion of Islam is based on the surrender to God who is One. Allah is the Arabic name for God. Islam considers itself to be a message of the universal truth for God's unity. The prophets, especially Abraham, taught and shared with others this message of God's Oneness. Islam recognizes other prophets including Moses, Christ, and the last prophet, Muhammad.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

== What is left of them today? ==

== When did their civilization exist? ==

Around the first century AD Bantu Africans were living on the east coast of Africa. Arab merchants and  traders came to the east coast of Africa to trade and settle. These people and the Bantu Africans formed the Swahili civilization. The Swahili civilization expanded on the east coast of Africa through the fifteenth century. The civilization began to decline in the sixteenth century when Portuguese trade led to the Swahili centers of trade falling to ruin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A civilization is a '''large group of people who live and work co-operatively''', a society that share a single culture. The word ''civilization'' comes from the Latin ''civilis'', meaning civil, related to the Latin ''civis'', meaning citizen, and ''civitas'', meaning city or city-state, and that also somehow defines the size of the society.  City-states are the precursors of nations.

A civilizational culture also implies the passing on of knowledge across generations. A civilization is defined by its culture. All of a civilization usually shares not only a culture but other '''common characteristics'''. A specific region of the world shares a stable food supply and a form of government, and creates distinct social structures that implement a range of common techniques for stabilizing their way of life.

Civilized people generally practice agriculture and obey rules this allows them to settle and live in towns and cities in an organized way. Compared with barbarian cultures, members of a civilization are commonly structured according to specific skills such as farming, trading, or defending their settlements, rules, and beliefs. 

Civilizations are usually also characterized by an intricate social hierarchy. Older civilizations were usually headed by a powerful leader, a king, queen, emperor, or empress at the top, supported by tributes (taxes) and allegiance (obedience due to honor, family ties, duty and self interest) by a noble or ruling class who maintained and controlled a military forces and the land. These nobles often could, in the name of the leader, discipline the ordinary people on the land administered by they: artisans who made things, peasants who worked their land, merchants who traded things, and so on.

[[File:Civilizations.jpg|center|720px|thumb|Source: Samuel P. Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996. Some minor or cleft civilizations have been added by the author]]
Civilizations are not only found in the past. Today we can say that we are heading toward a global civilization. That means we are starting to share the same culture &amp;mdash; that includes the acceptance of differences &amp;mdash; all over the world. If we look into the last century, we can clearly identify some distinctions.

== Derivation ==

The solutions to the general-form quadratic function &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0 &lt;/math&gt; can be given by a simple equation called the quadratic equation. To solve this equation, recall the ''completed square form'' of the quadratic equation derived in the previous section:
:&lt;math&gt; y = a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4a}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, &lt;math&gt; y = 0 &lt;/math&gt; since we're looking for the root of this function. To solve, first subtract c and divide by a:
:&lt;math&gt; -\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} = (x + \frac{b}{2a})^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Take the (plus and minus) square root of both sides to obtain:
:&lt;math&gt; \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}} = x + \frac{b}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting &lt;math&gt; \frac{b}{2a} &lt;/math&gt; from both sides:
:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

This is the solution but it's in an inconvenient form. Let's rationalize the denominator of the square root:
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}} =  \sqrt{\frac{-4ac + b^2}{4a^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2|a|} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, adding the fractions, the final version of the quadratic formula is:

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

This formula is very useful, and it is suggested that the students memorize it as soon as they can.

== Discriminant ==

The part under the radical sign, &lt;math&gt;{b^2-4ac}&lt;/math&gt;, is called the discriminant, &amp;Delta;. The value of the discriminant tells us some useful information about the roots.
*If &amp;Delta; &gt; 0, there are two unique real solutions.
*If &amp;Delta; = 0, there is one unique real solution.
*If &amp;Delta; &lt; 0, there are two unique, conjugate imaginary solutions.
*If &amp;Delta; is a perfect square then the two solutions are ''rational'', otherwise they are irrational conjugates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Initial thoughts and ideas ==

Writing a technical book is a little like writing a computer program of comparable length; while it is a given that the details must be present and correct, the key is in having a clear vision for the structure and spirit of the work.

It might be possible to enumerate certain properties of the style of writing planned for this book, beyond the regular standards for all Wikibooks.  Some debate on this is likely, but consensus should be very possible.

Let's start the ball rolling:
* The book has a target audience.  The suggestion on the table is that this is people new to programming.
* The book has an area of focus.  This may be only standard C++, or may cover some other areas.  It will be helpful to at least include some basic material on how to compile simple programs, but that quickly turns into a large area to cover.  It may be appropriate to have one chapter (or even two smaller chapters), possibly as an appendix (or appendices) to cover issues of compiling and linking code in the most common development environments (Unix-like and Visual Studio, maybe).
* We might cover the productivity/clarity/correctness benefits of using C++ as a high-level language while also covering its low-level features for completeness.  Before writing starts in earnest, it would be good to have agreement on how to combine the two, and in particular on whether the early chapters should cover one or both approaches.
* While a book on C++09 would be great, Wikibooks discourages documentation of moving targets, so our focus will be C++98 aka C++03.
* This book may or may not choose to cover/use some of TR1; one issue is that good support is not widely available, which is a barrier to those learning it.
* Some coding conventions would be useful for examples, just as for a software project.  Many styles are in use, and many thousands of hours have been spent debating them.

(To be continued.)

&lt;!-- (deliberately) unsigned and impersonal|James Dennett --&gt;

: Yes I agree the focus of this book is for C++03, when C++09 has become accepted as a standard (eg no longer a moving target), this book can be updated to reflect any changes to that standard. I think TR1, probably should be covered. IIRC TR1, only includes additional libraries, which could be covered in its own chapter or chapters.

: The target audience includes not only people new to programming, but people who have some experience with whatever they are going to use to do the programming on. Such as experience using Windows, Linux, MacOS, the embedded environment of their choice, etc. The focus is on Standard C++ and common programming constructs like linked lists, hash tables, trees, etc which are always portable and which programmers are expected to know how to do. There is additionally a prerequisite that people have read a book or some other material on how to install a C++ compiler or IDE and have read how to use it. I was thinking of maybe including links to such material in [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}/Further Reading]]. This may include links to other Wikibooks, which cover the subject. There are other books which also do not include information on compiling a C++ program, such as &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; by Bjarne Stroustrup. There are so many compilers and other tools that its a big enough subject to be its own book. I do know and understand that it can be a tricky dependency, but it has been pulled off before. My thoughts are, this book shouldn't focus on or concern itself with what environment the readers may be using. Part of my plan for the Introduction chapter was to include some information  that answers the questions of what programs are needed to write and compile a C++ program, but without mentioning a specific compiler. Maybe could include a link to the further reading page with a suggestion to check that page out for a list of tools for various environments?

: I'm not sure whether this book should require a specific coding convention. I can understand however requiring all examples use a monospace font though.

: I was hoping that part of the goal of this book would be to teach Standard C++ without any bias or favoritism to certain aspects of C++ and in a simple manner. For example, I was thinking this book could avoid discussion of high-level vs low-level languages, because I don't think its needed in order to understand C++ and where exactly C++ or certain aspects of C++ fits into that, I think is a moving target. So the first thing I think thats needed is to provide some way to help writers to avoid thinking of C++ in that was, so this book isn't written in that way and help get writers thinking in the way that will be a benefit to this book. For example instead of thinking of and trying to answer &quot;how do I separate variables from...&quot; instead thinking of and answering &quot;Whats all involved in using and manipulating variables and how can I explain most of it in one chapter&quot;. I was thinking of creating some type of &quot;what you will learn&quot; or &quot;what you will know&quot; template to include in all chapters to aid both readers and writers. I think instead of agreeing how to combine them, it would be far better to maybe agree to whats needed to cover for example variables completely, how much to cover in a single chapter and what to cover in more detail later on.

: To get some of my ideas down:
:* variables - basic types, structs, classes, unions, new, delete. explaining the relationship between the basic types and creating more complex types using structs, classes and unions. explain pointers and references in terms of how they relate to any types. cover the operators using to change the value of variables. Maybe not explain every detail of structs, classes and unions in this chapter, just enough to grasp that more complex types can be created and how. Covering all the details in a later chapter. Use string and other types found in the standard library. This chapter would also cover type casting and type conversion.
:* program flow - explain, if, for, while, do, exceptions and goto. explain the basics of exceptions, how to catch them. save throwing exceptions for a later chapter.
:* functions - declaring, creating and calling them. talk about function overloading, mention member functions and the minor distinctions.
:* user defined types, cover all the details of unions, structs and classes thats not already been covered, including operator overloading, the relationship between new and the constructor, between delete and the destructor, inheritance and polymorphisms. This might also be the chapter to discuss, linked lists, trees and hash tables. This chapter will also explain how to provide custom type casting through operator overloading.
:* templates - explain what they are, how they can be used for generic programming, use types from the standard library that make use of templates, and discuss improving on the linked lists, trees and tables from the previous chapter so they can be used for all sorts of types through the use of templates.
:* optimization techniques - different ways to speed up a program, such as creating an object which allocates more memory then it needs at first. Keeping everything in the realm or portability, which means things readers can do by hand.
:* debugging techniques - different ways to debug a program by hand. also must remain portable.
:* the standard library - split up by types and/or other means to cover every detail of the library.
:* possibly other techniques may be covered.
:* limit discussion on how manipulating data is stored, as to avoid making assumptions. not all computers store data in memory, not all computers use binary, See [[w:Ternary logic|Ternary logic]] and [[w:Ternary computer|Ternary computer]] for examples. The only assumption that can be made is the right thing will get done according to what the rules of C++ say. IIRC even the C++ standard avoids making that assumption, so this book should avoid it as well.

Thats all I can think of for now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:45, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

::In my opinion, ducking the high vs low-level issue is impossible.  The first way people see to store a string value in a variable is going to have to make one choice or the other.  We can try to present all approaches in parallel, but that just makes for a confusing multiplicity of complex choices for beginners.  Maybe it's the terminology that's a problem.  Should we show people the short (programmer-time efficient) ways, the built-in (less programmer-efficient but more basic/primitive) ways, both?  There are so many choices in C++ programming, that to avoid &quot;bias&quot; is to avoid providing useful information.  As I mentioned before... I also think it's not possible even if we tried. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 22:07, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

::: I'm suggesting explaining both in the same chapter, but not in parallel. Using a top-down approach, a summary of all possible approaches followed by each individual approach in detail may be possible. Bias can also prevent providing useful information or cause information to be provided incorrectly. By bias I'm thinking of things which I think are covered by NPOV to avoid anyways. I use to read some C++ newsgroups (and C ones for that mater). There were often inexperienced people who seemed to have been easily influenced by opinions that were passed off as facts in bad books. I would like to have readers come away from this book, well informed and able to make their own opinions. For example a common occurrence was the opinion that if it works in the compiler they are using it should work in any compiler and if it doesn't, must mean something is broken with the compiler and not their programming. Another common one involved goto being slower or that goto should be avoided. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:57, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

:::: Just a simple thing: I think we might be in agreement that both primitive and higher-level approaches should be presented rather than presenting an incomplete view.  The more interesting questions are about emphasis and order of presentation.  A chapter which shows how to implement (say) string handling could start from std::string, and then derive a &quot;String&quot; class from the ground up, but doing so would require teaching use of classes, pointers, memory management, RAII, operator overloading and more.  Which is all very well -- but puts a lot of &quot;details&quot; up front rather than looking earlier at achieving results in the problem domains rather than the solution domain (C++).  I'd like a reader who's familiar with the whole book to be able to write a String class, but I'd hate for them to have to understand how to do that before they can write a simple, robust program to ask for a user's name and write &lt;code&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '\n'&lt;/code&gt;.  In a nutshell, the &quot;high-level or low-level first&quot; amounts to &quot;focus on the problem domain or the solution domain&quot; question.  The more you focus on one, the less you focus on the other.  There's no &quot;neutral&quot; position, no objective choice of where on the continuum to stand.  Many positions are defensible.  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 01:54, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

:If i may interject, there is a difference between simply presenting the C++ language, and making your target audience &quot;understand&quot; it. Since the title of this book is &quot;Understanding C++&quot;, it seems to me that the focus should be on the latter. We should strive to present all information in multiple ways, to help all audiences understand it, and to reinforce that understanding. Instead of selecting which way to present the material, we really need to look for a standardized way to present ''all'' methods of presentation. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 01:13, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

:: Can you give an example of what you mean? I'm not understanding what your trying to suggest/propose. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:21, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

== Coding Conventions ==

I don't suggest that the book should try to promote a coding style to its readers, only that the style of any examples should be consistent.  It's very jarring/distracting to readers to have to read code in different styles, just as it is suboptimal when a C++ project of significant size uses too much of a mix of styles.  My personal preference might be to blend in with the standard library, though one might find merit in doing the exact opposite! -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 21:57, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

: For clarity, are you saying all examples used in this book should use a consistent style, or that the style used within one example should be consistent? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:09, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

:: I'm advocating that all examples in the book should be written in the same style.  That's certainly the case for all printed C++ books I've seen.  Not sure I'd go as far as van der Linden in using names of fruits for all variables, but consistency here avoids distraction and confusion, IMO.  To be clearer: the &quot;style&quot; should apply only to trivial matters of convention such as layout and naming, I'm certainly not saying that only one &quot;paradigm&quot; should be presented.  Keeping the naming and layout the same allows the more interesting elements of the code to stand out. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 00:19, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

::: I would not have a problem with that, but I think it may become unrealistic when more people are contributing to the book, as people will generally prefer to use the style that they are most use to. I also believe readers might benefit some from seeing different coding styles. I was going to cover that some in the instruction chapter too. Comparing coding styles to writing styles. I'm indifferent to whether or not to stick to only one style or to allow multiple styles to be used, my only preference is sticking to a single style within an example. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:12, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

== C++ Compilers/IDEs ==

My suggestion to include an appendix on using simple tools is based on the fact that this seems to be the single biggest sticking point for those trying to learn C++ from online resources (I've been reading the newsgroups for longer than I care to remember).  I agree that it's good to keep the focus of the book away from platform-specific issues, but this is one place I'd make an exception.  Obviously I'd be willing to do much of the work of writing a suitable appendix.  While no book is an island, it's preferable for a Wikibook to be reasonably self-contained.  (We can debate the &quot;reasonably&quot; there ad infinitum.) -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 21:57, 6 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

''Glottogeny'' is the origin of language in the human species.

== Language in Animals ==
While some people have suggested that animals use language, this is generally not accepted among linguists.  Animals, including most higher primates, are known to have semantics, that is sounds that correspond to arbitrary meanings and some animals.  Additional some parrots studied are known to have dialects, where the &quot;words&quot; they use differ among regional groups, and new members must learn them. There is also the posibility that some species, such as prairie dogs which may form simple sentences with nouns and adjectives. &lt;!-- And verbs?  I must find that article --&gt;  However, there are no species apart from humans known to use '''recursion''', which is therefore considered the defining feature of human language.

== Theories ==
A theory of the linguistic origins must take into account the complexity of human language.  Steven Pinker argues in his book ''The Language Instinct'' that human language is like an elephant's trunk--a very complex system in which the intermediaries have been lost, but nonetheless not a hopeless problem, if we can work out the stages of language development.
&lt;!-- Derek Bickerton: /Adam's Tongue/, must be summarized, but not until I find other theories. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Sexual relationships =
There are plenty of high quality sex/relationship guides around, so this section is deliberately brief.

* Sexual relationships are the subject of much discussion amongst non-autistic people.  In fact, much of the non-sensical discussion amongst non-autistic people is about this.  This has the implication that you can often discuss sexuality with non-autistic people if you obey the social rules.
* The key to learning from these guides and discussions is knowing that they are nearly always written/spoken from the perspective of someone who has had personal success or who has had success in teaching non-autistic people and who are trying to teach specific things from particular perspectives.
* This leads to many important things being glossed over or not mentioned, and many unimportant things being included or incorrectly emphasised.
* This in itself doesn't mean that they are useless.  In fact, if they were, the reputations of the writers would suffer.
* Extracting useful information from them can be difficult though, but not impossible.
* One good way to achieve this is to read all the guides you can find and look for recurring themes.
* Some regularly recurring themes:
** Self Respect and Self Confidence.
** Respecting your partner and potential partners.
** Connecting with your partner.  This is rapport.  Very important when meeting potential partners.
** Communicating with your partner.  This involves negotiation.  Very important in ongoing relationships.
** Developing trust with your partner.
** How to fake the important things.  This is not always necessary or a good idea unless you have your heart set on one person you only want a short term relationship with.
* Some things rarely mentioned in guides that are particularly relevant to autistic spectrum people:
** The courting process allows EITHER party to slow the pace of the process down or quit at any time, but communicating this can be difficult.  Not communicating this properly can be destructive to the relationship.
** There is NO special protocol for initiating and developing relationships that nobody told you about and that everyone uses in secret.
** This doesn't mean that there aren't protocols, but that the protocols involve using the same rules and communication methods used in the non-autistic world to do many of the things mentioned above under &quot;recurring themes&quot;.  Also, the protocols vary wildly depending on the partners and situations involved.
** These communications are nearly always played out when both partners are in plot mode and playing the social status game as best as they possibly can.  Some guides refer to this as &quot;turning the brain off&quot;, or &quot;animal instinct&quot;, if they refer to it at all.
** Some autie to autie relationships have developed successfully almost entirely outside of plot mode, but these are usually clumsy events.  Even so, they are often more rewarding relationships than autie to non-autie relationships.
** Everybody has quirks in their sexual preferences, and it is usually possible for lovers to negotiate the ones that cause no harm.  This is more true for stronger relationships.
** Men and women both enjoy sex and love, but men tend to &quot;fall in love&quot; with the ones they &quot;sexualise&quot;, and women tend to sexualise the ones they fall in love with.
** Since men want sex from relationships, they often try to be, or appear to be more loving to attract sexier women.
** Since women want love from relationships, they often try to be or appear to be sexier to attract the most loving and supporting men.
** The idea in both cases is for each partner to give the other what they want in order to receive what they want.
** Just as there are men who make a practice of one night stands for the purpose of acquiring sex from many women, there are women who make a practice of one night stands for the purpose of acquiring love from many men.
** These men and women can be destructive to the self esteem of non-autistic people in general and devastating to autistic spectrum people.  This doesn't necessarily mean that they should be avoided or that all people who behave like them are like them.
** The trick to understanding these men and women is knowing that they go for &quot;unattainable&quot; people.
** Many of the rules regarding discretion and promiscuity are designed to weed such men and women out.  In my personal experience, autistic spectrum people can be caught out by such rules when meeting people.
** Men tend to want to be respected, but women tend to want to be cherished.
** Going for the less attractive potential partner is NOT a good way to improve your chances.
** The relationship between partners typically does NOT change in the bedroom.  If it does, rapport either deepens or the relationship changes for the worse.
** In many ways, the social interactions between partners outside of the bedroom can be considered practice for inside.  This may be why figuring out &quot;what kind of a person&quot; someone it is such a popular pastime.
* Some good relationship/sex guides and resources:
** The Lovers Guide, Dr Andrew Stanway, video and book series.  Besides offering high quality advice on many subjects, it is a rather high quality piece of pornography.  Suitable for males, females and couples.
** Dial a Woman/Dial a Man, Rosalind Neville, books.  Written by someone who runs a relationship agency and who listens to women talking about all the mistakes their men make.
** Adam Perry, various magazine articles.  A man who slept with 3000 women in 15 years and who now teaches sex education in UK schools.
** Sex Tips for Geeks, Eric S Raymond, web page linked to in the &quot;[[#References]]&quot; section.  Written by someone who has known autistic spectrum males and their problems for a long while.  Even this guide has usability problems.
** [http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC guide to flirting].  Fairly self explanatory really.  A little sparse on reasoning, but strong on basics.
** Speed Seduction, Ross Jeffries.  Written by someone who is in the [[w:seduction community]].  Probably a good example of a guide to avoid, but it's still possible to learn a lot from these things.
** Wikipedia: [[w:Category:Human_sexuality]]; [[w:Human_sexual_behavior]]; [http://www.wikiprocess.com/wiki/Dating_With_Women Dating with Women].
== Chatup factoids (beta) ==
* If you have reached this &quot;level of development&quot; and you still find this section useful, you may be focusing too much on detail and not enough on plot.
* These rules may have cultural and situational biases.  In general, they should be applicable in at least the UK and Australia in situations where you meet someone you may never meet again.
* In situations where you are interacting with potential partners, a new consequence of breaking social rules is that OTHER potential partners will see or hear about the damage your behaviour causes to your potential partner and because of that, they may then start avoiding you.
* It is ALWAYS a bad idea to fool with a woman's hand bag, and it is an extremely bad idea to investigate what's inside without permission.  Note:  I'm not exactly sure in which section this rule should go, but this is probably the best one.
* &quot;Making a move&quot; is when one person starts flirting with another during a conversation.
* A chatup is when the other person flirts back.
* How does one know exactly when a move has been knocked back?  This isn't always obvious.  If nothing happens, she/he may be deciding whether to accept or how to not offend.  Alternately, they may not have noticed the move.  This is something autistic spectrum people often do.
* What behaviours become appropriate once a chatup starts?
** Smiling and good eye contact.  These are also flirtatious behaviours but can appear creepy if not returned.
** Focusing only on the partners face, the things they say and the things they pay attention to.
** Touching is possibly best left to the woman to initiate and this doesn't mean that the man should start touching too, nor indeed that it is wrong for a man to do so.
** Asking more personal questions that may otherwise appear creepy such as where someone is going or where someone is from.
* Subtlety in flirting is more complex but necessary.
** Being subtle hides the proceedings from public scrutiny.  This is showing respect for your partner and it is important in knockbacks too.
** Showing respect for ones partners lessens the chance that other potential partners will be put off.
* Asking for a womans number becomes permissible after you both have a sense of rapport and are talking comfortably.  Towards the end of the conversation is best.
* Saying something like &quot;it would be nice to talk to you again&quot; or &quot;would you like to go out with me some time?&quot; is better than asking in a way that sounds pushy such as taking out the phone and asking &quot;what's your number&quot;?
** Never suggest a time/date when asking this question.  It makes it too easy for them to knock you back indecisively by saying they're doing something then.
** Alternately, if you have been asked by someone if you would like to go out with them at a particular time and you can't be there, but you would still like to go out with them, you can say no, but suggest another time instead.
* It is usually bad form to let a woman whose number you've just taken see you taking another womans number.
* If a person asks &quot;do you want to come back to my place&quot; it usually means for sex though if it does, there are no guarantees that it will happen.
** If you want to do so, smile and give a definite positive answer such as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;sure&quot;.  A negative or hesitant answer is always offensive.
** The actual act of asking this question is more of a risky social endeavour than a positive answer so long as the answer isn't over entheusiastic and a negative answer is a more risky social endeavour than a positive one so don't feel embarrassed in answering positively.  They will probably be relieved and pleased if you do.
** Men sometimes ask this question of women, but it is a bad idea for an aspie male.
* By making potential partners jump over all these hurdles, people are often trying to avoid retribution from competitors and also short term relationships in which only their partner benefits.

== Dating factoids (alpha) ==
* &quot;Going out&quot; refers to one or two dates with a particular partner.
* &quot;Dating&quot; refers to going out regularly with a partner who is a bit closer.
* Being &quot;exclusive&quot; means not dating other people and having a relationship with one person.
* There are some who say that the act of dating itself means being exclusive and some who say that dating multiple partners is permissible until both partners agree that the relationship is exclusive.
* Figuring out which kind any given relationship is can be difficult since it is an unwritten rule to not raise this subject, but exclusive relationships are taken more seriously.
* If you don't want to become exclusive, this is probably the best time to explain why, or say that you &quot;need more time&quot; (to decide).
* It is probably best to not look for reasons that you and your partner shouldn't be together until this point too.
* A relationship is when the partners are communicating for at least an hour a day or several hours a week.
* A relationship can be &quot;resumed&quot; if both partners agree that the reasons for ending it have changed.
* Gifts are best given during the good times, not the bad, and particularly not after fights.
* The 24 hour rule applies to subsequent dates too.
** XXX Under what circumstances does the 24 hour rule stop applying?
* The phrase 'we need to talk' often means 'we should break up'.  Sometimes it can simply mean 'we need to talk'.  It can be very ambiguous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|Spice]]

'''Mixed spice''', also '''pudding spice''', is a mix of sweet spices commonly used in [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]], and with [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]], particularly in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British cuisine]], and in cuisines that derive from it (e.g. the old colonies of the British empire).

The mix almost always contains [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], and [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]. Often, other spices are added to the mix, including [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]], [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]], [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], and [[Cookbook:Mace|mace]].

==Ingredients==
Here is a typical blend of spices used to make mixed spice:
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] ground [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
* 1 Tbs ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1 Tbs ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] ground [[Cookbook:Mace|mace]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]]

Blend all spices together, and store in a sealed jar away from light.

==Chili powder==
''Chili powder, as sold in stores, and called for in most recipes, is not simply powdered chili, but a blend of chili and other spices.''

* 3-8 dried [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|chilies]] (mix or match depending upon availability and taste)
** ''ancho'' (mild)
** ''pasilla'' (mild)
** ''mulato'' (mild)
** ''New Mexico/ristra'' (medium)
** ''cascabel'' (medium)
** ''chiltepin'' (very hot)
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]] seed
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:coriander|coriander]] seed

* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* 1 teaspoon ground red [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]] 

# Wearing protective gloves, break up the chilies into small pieces, and remove the seeds (or leave the seeds in for a hotter and slightly bitter flavor).
# Toast the chilies, cumin, coriander, cloves, and allspice in a dry skillet over low heat, stirring continually until you can smell the peppers (about two minutes). Depending on the size of the skillet and the amount of peppers you may need to do more than one batch.
# When the toasted ingredients are cool, pour them into a food-processor or blender along with the other ingredients, and grind it into a powder. '''Do not open the food processor lid until the powder settles.'''
# Store in an airtight jar.

==Seasoned salt==
''A mix of salt and other spices.  Recipes for this blend can be simple or complex.''

* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
* 1 teaspoon dry [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
* 1 teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* 1 teaspoon dehydrated [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] (minced or powdered)
* 1 dehydrated [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (minced or powdered)
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:celery|celery]] seed
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]

** [[Cookbook:dill|dill]] weed
** crushed or ground [[Cookbook:caraway|caraway]]
** asoefetida
** sugar
** powdered [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|soup bouillon]] 

Mix all ingredients and store in an airtight jar.

==Chili mix==
''Most American grocery stores sell little single-use packets of instant spice mix for seasoning chile con carne. This recipe is for a homemade version of the chili spice.''

* 2 tablespoons '''chili powder'''
* 1 tablespoon dehydrated [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (minced or powdered)
* 2 teaspoons '''seasoned salt'''
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]] powder
* 1-2 teaspoons ground red [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]] or crushed/powdered chilli pepper (''ancho'')
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon dehydrated garlic (minced or powdered)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Mix all ingredients and store in an airtight jar. Use 1-3 tablespoons of Chili Mix per 1 lb of meat (to taste). Substitution: If you don't have seasoned salt, substitute powdered soup bouillon or increase the salt, pepper, and garlic.
&lt;!-- still to do:
Taco spice, Curry powder, Herbes de Provence, Garlic salt, Lemon pepper, Pumpkin pie spice, Apple pie spice, Baking spice(?)

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Visualising social interaction =
Please note, it would be silly of me to say that any one way to visualise social interaction can be 100% effective or appropriate at all times.  In fact, non-autistic people seem to approximate everything at best.  It is worth noting though that visual thinking is an autistic strong point, and it is very likely that a visualised understanding of social interaction is going to be the most effective.
* Marc Segar talks about &quot;plot&quot; and &quot;detail&quot; in his book, but leaves it to the imagination as to what the exact differences are.  One can only speculate, but my understanding is this:
** &quot;Plot&quot; is exactly like the plot in a movie or TV show.  The sequence of events is more important than the exact details about the events themselves.
** The information gleaned from observing the events and their sequence goes towards building a picture of the situation an observer is currently in.  This is &quot;situational awareness&quot;.
** This situational awareness is related to self interest in the non-autistic mind and provides the observer with information about threats and opportunities in the social environment.
** Also, the information gleaned from observing what other people do goes towards building a picture of &quot;who they are&quot;. This may be what Marc Segar was talking about when he talks about &quot;slates&quot; and keeping them clean.
** This picture of &quot;plot&quot; vs &quot;detail&quot; is incomplete if one does not understand the forces driving non-autistic people, but this is beyond the scope of &quot;plot&quot;.
* There is another possible way to think about plot vs detail:
** People who are not experts at something need to consciously think about doing it until they become experts.  This is a rather &quot;static&quot; way of thinking.
** People who are experts at something know their field so well that they base their real time actions on their detailed understanding rather than conscious thought.  This is a much more &quot;dynamic&quot; way of thinking.
** conscious thought tends to get in the way of doing something efficiently even for experts, however using conscious thought is usually necessary when fixing mistakes.
** It may be the case that non-autistic peoples fluid behaviour in social situations is based on this kind of expert understanding, however the fact that they have no conscious technical understanding of what they're doing DOES lead them to make mistakes that are difficult to fix.
** If this particular interpretation of &quot;plot vs detail&quot; is correct, it is incomplete without knowing what non-autistic people are experts at.
** If this particular interpretation of &quot;plot vs detail&quot; is correct then autistic spectrum people prefer to keep learning rather than actually being experts on anything.
* The single best way I have found to keep a grip of what's going on is by applying the second commandment, &quot;You Must Love Your Neighbour As Yourself&quot;.
** One translation of this rule reads &quot;Do Unto Others As You Would Have Others Do Unto You&quot;.
** Another plausible translation could read &quot;Don't Do Unto Others As You Would Not Have Others Do Unto You&quot;.
** The pagan tenet &quot;anything which causes no harm is probably OK&quot; seems to approximate this rule, as does Plato's conclusions about justice in [[w:Platos_Republic|Platos Republica]].
** Most people seem to try to follow this rule even when they don't know about it, and those that aren't, try to appear as if they are.
** Nobody ever succeeds in following it 100%, however, honest people will usually try to fix their mistakes when they realise them, and they usually try to do so according to this rule.
** By working out all of the things a person is doing to other people that they would accept other people doing to them, it is possible to &quot;zone in&quot; on acceptable behaviour.
** By working out all of the things a person is doing to other people that they would not have the other person do to them, it is possible to work out whether someone is being malicious or not, and even the nature of that malice.
** In the case of conflict, it is often possible to perform this &quot;calculation&quot; for every deed involved and come up with extremely equitable resolutions based on the things that people should be doing, before other people even realise there's a problem.
** It is often possible to figure out if someone is trying to deceive or manipulate you by working out whether the person is willing to do themselves what they are trying to convince you to do.  Asking detailed questions can reveal the deceit.
** People who clearly have no interest in following this rule are usually well worth avoiding.
* The second commandment is not a bad rule to live by either, but it doesn't work perfectly if you don't know what's important to other people.
** Even so, if you wish to question or challenge people on the basis that they have broken this rule, then you pretty much need to be obeying it yourself.  Otherwise you can be seen as a hypocrite.
** It is fair to say that everybody has their own personal preferences about how they like to be treated, and it would therefore be breaking the rule to not treat other people according to those preferences once you learn about them.
** On the other hand, using your own preferences when you don't know the other persons, as the rule would at first suggest can be a good starting point for people you don't know.  Beware though that you may not know whether you like to be treated a particular way by strangers until you experience it.
** It is possible to take this rule way too far and end up never doing anything for yourself the way Jesus or Socrates might.
* Many of the laws of physics seem to apply in the average social interaction:
** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  EVERYTHING that happens has meaning.
*Plot vs Detail may also refer to a scale, as in Tactical vs Strategic. Plot may refer to the general overall thing (like a Strategy in a war) and Detail would be the close-up pieces (like Tactics in warfare/battles)

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Suggestions for Autistic Spectrum community building =
* Auties may seek the company of other auties for many reasons.  Common reasons are wanting to socialise, to develop social skills, to address personal quality of life issues or simply to communicate with each other vocationally.
* Know what it is that you're trying to accomplish by entering the community, stick to your goals and let others go about accomplishing theirs.
* Know your [[w:MBTI]] type.  Many of the major autistic spectrum sub-groups some people insist on seeing can be attributed to this, and many of the battle lines in conflicts are drawn along their borders.
* Above all, try your absolute best to remain constructive, even when people around you are not.  And although you should never reward bad behaviour, it's best to never over-react.
* Unwritten social rules can be broken into two groups.  Ones regulating destructive behaviour, and ones regulating eccentric behaviour.  XXX Insert Relationship Building Skills Comment Here XXX The eccentric behaviour rules can usually be dropped in autie social circles, but when the destructive behaviour rules are dropped, things can turn very bad.
* If you are the leader of a community, think very carefully about the rules you choose.  Autistic spectrum people in general usually measure everything in terms of equality/equity and are often unforgiving.
** KNOW that the words &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; do not apply to autistic spectrum people the way they apply to non-autistic people.  A non-autistic person &quot;develops&quot; and an autistic spectrum person &quot;learns social skills&quot;.  In the same way, a non-autistic person would have to &quot;learn&quot; in whatever field of interest an autistic spectrum person &quot;develops&quot;.
** Separating the &quot;person&quot; from their &quot;behaviour&quot; is a good tool in trying to work out who someone is.
* If you are lucky enough to be in a successful relationship, be careful what you say and do regarding it in autie social circles.
** This cannot be stressed enough.  Public displays of affection and innuendo between lovers is a major cause of ill feeling and conflict in autistic spectrum circles.
** Many of us are not in worthwhile relationships and despair at ever being able to find one and unless you are willing to open up and share large amounts of personal information, you are likely to invoke bad feelings by flaunting what you have.
** Don't try to get away with it by being discreet or by saying it gives hope to certain people.  Most auties KNOW how much hope there is and are smart enough to decipher your discretion.  What irks people is that they simply don't know what it is that makes a worthwhile relationship work and that other people are rarely willing to share.  Furthermore, being direct about this issue exposes one to ridicule, even in autistic spectrum circles.
** If you try to use your success to raise your social status amongst auties, expect pain.  Many auties simply cross people who do that off their &quot;people worth talking to&quot; list.  Nastier and more confusing reactions are common.  Particularly when that doesn't work.
** If you feel like disclosing to other people intimate details for educational purposes but fear the consequences, consider doing so anonymously.  Your contribution will surely be valued even if you resort to doing this.
* Don't insist that people change in any particular way that seems to have been successful for other people.  Different people measure success in different ways, and doing so when someone is unwilling or unable to see the benefit contributes to a lack of TRUST that is extremely valuable in teacher/student relationships.
** It's important to understand that there are good reasons why an autie may ignore advice from others, even though they may complain openly about their current situation.  Many of us have experienced varying levels of success according to the NT definition but have not found any value in doing so.
** Successfully adapting to an NT world leads to serious quality of life issues for many auties.  Putting large amounts of valuable energy into surviving the social status game when there is little to nothing in the way of pay off except promise is depressing.  Particularly if one realises that ones effort in life has been largely wasted or misused by others.
** If you feel the need to help another autie, it's often best to just find out what it is they want/need and offer help to achieve that if you feel you can.
* Avoid forming fixed notions of what autism is at all costs.  This is another leading cause of disputes within autistic spectrum communities.
** To understand what autism IS, one must realise that it has largely been defined as simply being different to people who aren't autistic.
** Yes, there are certain common characteristics that many autistic spectrum people seem to share and that many non-autistic people don't.  This doesn't mean that all auties are the same or that some auties are more worthy of speaking for other auties.
** Auties who have experienced NT life often bring their survival behaviours and &quot;baggage&quot; back into the autie world.  It is true that this is not helpful, but throwing them out because of this isn't helpful either.
* Give up the idea of organising the &quot;autistic community&quot;.  There may be communities of autistic spectrum people, but there is no autistic community.  This should come as no surprise if you understand that &quot;the average autie&quot; is very wary of being controlled.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Choosing a profession =
== Research and Development ==
* It is necessary to understand that the research and development professions that autistic spectrum people often excel at have some far reaching ethical problems associated with them.
* Research and Development are fundamentally different kinds of work from other jobs.  They are largely acts of invention.
* Inventions are patentable and employers will often receive patents for the inventions of their workers.
* Furthermore, employers own all &quot;intellectual property&quot; their workers develop during working hours by default, legally.
* Workers who do research and development are usually paid in wages and rarely become financially secure.
** XXX Netscape.
* People who want to patent their own inventions or own their own &quot;intellectual property&quot; usually have to support themselves financially while researching and/or developing those things.
* Once a worker finishes an R&amp;D job, the worker in question is no longer relevant to the invention.  This means that unless the worker receives an income from owning patents or intellectual property, another source of income will then be necessary.
* Until an R&amp;D project is finished, there is usually very little to show for the work done.  This is a major cause of conflict in R&amp;D workplaces.
* For example, when such projects keep missing their deadlines and budgets, deadly serious &quot;blame games&quot; usually start occurring.
* Just as a bell cannot be unrung, an invention cannot be uninvented, and inventions seem to have the innate quality of being usable for just as much evil as good.
** XXX Einsteins only error.
** XXX Computers shortening the working week.
** XXX Plato's Republic.
* One of the most XXX things you will ever have to do as an expert is to have to stand in front of your peers who you are trying to teach something to and then realise that you need to ask them questions.
== Highly Skilled Labour ==
* Highly skilled yet non R&amp;D jobs are also jobs where autistic spectrum people can excel.
* Such jobs are usually high stress and carry a lot of responsibility.  Take note bipolar people.
* They are often harder to get than less skilled labour jobs and as such, represent a deeper commitment which, again, is a problem for bipolar people.
* They may involve knowing a lot of workplace specific knowledge and as such, not permit time off to address personal issues.  This can also happen in R&amp;D jobs.
* They often also include interacting with people who have little time for communication problems.
* They often also include working closely in a team which may or may not include other autistic spectrum people.
== Manual labour ==
* Manual labour can be good exercise and has its health benefits.
* Manual labour jobs are usually easier to get, get used to, and quit.
* On the other hand, manual labour usually requires much more diligence than highly skilled labour.
== Managing your own business ==
An internet business may be the autistic persons financial salvation. On the internet you don't need to interact with people face to face to make money. A good internet business for an autistic person would be selling on ebay. You can invent things to sell on ebay putting up websites that earn money via adsense and affiliate marketing. Beware that this kind of business has become more difficult in the last years because a lot of people started one.

Building websites and computer programming are not recommended unless you want to work like a dog for 2.00 an hour. As most other businesses, software development requires face-to-face communications, for example to acquire new customers. Many customers would like to know you personally or even demand that you work at their place so that they can control your work easier.
In addition, website development has made its way out of the &quot;garage&quot; into professional business in the last 10 years. Projects are now much more interwoven with the real world - and real people and their businesses - than in earlier years. You will probably spend as much time talking to customers and their business partners as with coding.
And you'll have to talk to other web developers - most software that can be developed by a single person has already been developed. Real projects most likely will require teamwork.

Another offline business that would work well for autistic people are things like window washing. It may be difficult to acquire corporate contracts unless you are willing to do it very cheap.

== Miscellaneous ==
* Beware the jobs and professions that require significant investments of time, energy or money to get into.  If you want to leave them, those investments can be wasted or hold you back.
* When all is said and done, the job that you enjoy doing most is probably the best one to have.

Likely the include dir is already known, but that can be added with -I switch (e.g. -I/usr/local/include) to GCC. Other than that, you only need to include the library's .a (?) file with all the rest of the files when linking the app (not -l as you usually do for dynamic linking with shared libraries).

The following creates two object files (one.o and another.o) and then links the static library and the generated object files together to form the executable 'myapp'.
 g++ -c one.cpp -I/usr/local/include
 g++ -c another.cpp -I/usr/local/include
 g++ one.o another.o /usr/local/lib/libfoo.a -o myapp

Building static library involves generating the object files and then bundling them together with ar. Something like the following (creates libother.a from something.o and else.o object files).
 g++ -c something.cpp -I/usr/local/include
 g++ -c else.cpp -I/usr/local/include
 ar -rcs libother.a something.o else.o

I am an organic farmer and horticulturist living in Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania, USA. My initial interest in wikibooks was to write how-to styled information about gardening and crop growing, but since then I've become interested in the how-tos in general, as well as helping out with the academic projects that use wikibooks.

I'm [[w: user:SB_Johnny|SB_Johnny]] on other Wikimedia projects. (I was also under that name here, originally, but somehow was unable to retrieve the password for a couple days.)

My wiki-time is mostly being spent on Wikiversity these days trying to shape up the [[v:Bloom Clock|Bloom Clock]]. I'll have more time (and energy) to write come midsummer.

The '''greater celandine''' ('''''Chelidonium majus''''') is a yellow-flowering poppy, native to Europe and the Mediterranean basin. It is also widespread in North America, having been brought there by settlers as a herbal remedy for skin problems such as warts as early as 1672. The whole plant is toxic, containing a range of alkaloids, such as Chelerythrine; it may also cause contact dermatitis, particularly the latex.

The greater celandine is the only species in the genus ''Chelidonium'', and is not closely related to the lesser celandine (''[[../Ranunculus ficaria/]]'').

==Description==
Greater celandine plants may reach 80 cm high, with deeply divided, 30-cm long leaves. The flowers comprise four yellow petals, each about 1 cm long, and are produced from May to July. The seeds are small and black, and possess an elaiosome, which attracts ants to disperse the seeds (myrmecochory). A double-flowered variety, a naturally occurring mutation, also exists.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

==Uses==
The plant was formerly used by gypsies as a foot refresher; modern herbalists use its purgative properties. The plant is toxic and should not be used without supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael. ''Traditional Folk Remedies'' (Century, 1987) p.146-7&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Probability==
===Combined events===
This is when both &lt;math&gt;(A \and B)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \or B)&lt;/math&gt; can occur. Note that when A OR B occurs, A AND B also occurs. This means that

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \and B)&lt;/math&gt;
It also means that A occurs, '''or''' B occurs, '''or''' both A AND B occur.

===Mutually exclusive events===
[[File:venn_diagram2.gif|thumb|250px|right|Mutually exclusive events represented in a Venn Diagram]]
When two events are said to be mutually exclusive, then these two events cannot occur at the same time. For example, the outcome of one coin toss cannot be head and tails. When expressed in a Venn diagram, mutually exclusive events do not intersect with each other and have no overlapping area. In other words: 
&lt;math&gt;P(A \and B) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore: 
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \or B) = P(A) + P(B) - 0&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since the intersection of the two events is equal to 0.

===Exhaustive Events===
This is when set A and set B include ''all possible outcomes'' in either set A, or set B. This means that &lt;math&gt;P(A \or B) = U&lt;/math&gt; where ''U'' is the set of all outcomes
Or in other words
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \or B) = 1&lt;/math&gt; .

For Exhaustive events, the complementary of A, and A add up to 1
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \or B) = P(A) + P(A') = 1&lt;/math&gt;. 
If an event isn't exhaustive, then you simply add up P(A) and P(A').
===Conditional probability===

Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that a second event will definitely occur. Note that for mutually exclusive events, conditional probability will always be equal to zero.

Conditional probability can be found by first finding the probability that both events will occur. (For independent events, this simply means P(A)*P(B).) The result should then be divided by the probability of the given event.

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac {P(A \and B)}{P(B)} &lt;/math&gt;

===Independence===
Two events are said to be independent if
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac {P(A \and B)}{P(B)}  = P(A)&lt;/math&gt;
Meaning that
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \and B) = P(A) \times P(B) &lt;/math&gt;

==Statistics==
===Diagrammatic representation of data===
===Mode, median and mean===
'''MODE'''- the part of a set of data that occurs the most frequently

Example:
given the number set: 1,3,4,4,5,7,8,10,13,13,13

the number 13 occurs most frequently, thus the mode is ''13''

'''MEDIAN'''- the number that is in the middle of a set of data
To find the median, arrange the numbers such that they are in order and determine the middle number

Example:
given the number set: &lt;s&gt;1&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;3&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;4&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;4&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt;,'''7''',&lt;s&gt;8&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;10&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;13&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;13&lt;/s&gt;,&lt;s&gt;13&lt;/s&gt;

the number 7 is in the middle of the data, thus the median is ''7''

'''MEAN'''- the average of a set of data
To find the mean, one adds together all numbers in the data set, then divides this sum by the number of numbers in the set

Example:
given the number set: 1,3,4,4,5,7,8,10,13,13,13 &lt;-- there are 11 numbers in the data set
Add all numbers together: 1+3+4+4+5+7+8+10+13+13+13= 79
Divide the sum (79) by the number of numbers in the data set (11) = 79/11 = ''7.18''

Thus the average number of the data set, the mean, is ''7.18''

===Measures of dispersion===

Measures of dispersion, also known as measures of spread, measure how spread out the data is. There are two types: those parameters that are resistant to outliers and those parameters that aren't resistant to outliers.

Resistant to outliers: standard deviation, the standard deviation will measure what percentage of the statistics will fall under a certain range or standard deviation. 68% of all the data is said to fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
                       interquartile range,

&lt;br&gt;Nonresistant to outliers: range, ie in the case of outliers in company salaries the top executive may earn upwards of $400,000 and a factory worker only $10,000,ergo, a range exists of $390,000 in salary amount. 

The phrase &quot;resistant to outliers&quot; denotes that the parameter disregards the extremities and abnormalities of the set of data.

===Cumulative frequency===

===Histograms===
In statistics, a histogram is a graphical display of '''tabulated frequencies, shown as bars.''' It shows what proportion of cases fall into each of several categories: it is a form of data binning. The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent. The intervals (or bands, or bins) are generally of the same size.

'''Histograms are used to plot density of data''', and often for density estimation: estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the x-axis are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a relative frequency plot.

An alternative to the histogram is kernel density estimation, which uses a kernel to smooth samples. This will construct a smooth probability density function, which will in general more accurately reflect the underlying variable.

The histogram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control, which also include the Pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, flowchart, and scatter diagram.

===Random variables===
===Expected values===
The expected value of a random x variable to occur is given by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;E(X) = \sum xP(X = x)&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of event &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; occurring. For example, the expected number of heads to occur when flipping a coin twice would be:
:&lt;math&gt;E(X) = (0 \times \frac {1}{4}) + (1 \times \frac {1}{2}) + (2 \times \frac {1}{4}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of getting a head once, is 1/2 because there are two outcomes that include one head (HT, and TH).

===The binomial distribution===

A distribution is binomial if and only if it fits the following four parameters: 1) The outcome is independent 2) There are only two outcomes,success or failure 3) The probability of success is constant 4) There is a fixed number of trials. For example, there is a bag containing 10 marbles, 5 are red, 3 are blue, and 2 are green. If 5 marbles are drawn, with replacement, what is the probability of drawing exactly 2 red marbles? This is binomial because the outcomes are independent, it is either red or not red,the probability of success is .5, and the number of trials is 5. To solve binomial ditributions use the following equation: &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(p)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;(1-p)&lt;sup&gt;n-k&lt;/sup&gt; where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, and p is the probability of success. For the previous problem the equation would be : &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(.5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1-.5)&lt;sup&gt;5-2&lt;/sup&gt; which would equal 10*.25*.125 = .3125 whih means the probability of drawing exactly 2 reds is 31.25%

===The normal distribution===
A normal distribution is a continuous distribution defined by two parameters, mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;. Because of symmetrical shape of the normal curve, the mean is equal to the mode and median.
====The standard normal distribution====
[[Image:Normaldistr.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of standard normal distribution curve]]
The standard normal distribution has mean of 0 and variance 1. The area under the curve (probability) is 1.


In order to find area under the normal curve, students can use '''normalcdf()''' in their TI calculator. The syntax is:

normalcdf (lower limit, upper limit, mean, standard deviation)

====Probabilities for other normal distribution====

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

===Probability mass function===

In general, if the random variable ''K'' follows the binomial distribution with parameters ''n'' and ''p'', we write ''K'' ~ B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p''). The probability of getting exactly ''k'' successes in ''n'' trials is given by the [[probability mass function]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(K = k) = f(k;n,p) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(K = k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''n'' and where

:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[binomial coefficient]] (hence the name of the distribution) &quot;''n''&amp;nbsp;choose&amp;nbsp;''k''&quot;, also denoted ''C''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k''),&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The formula can be understood as follows: we want ''k'' successes (''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' failures (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the ''k'' successes can occur anywhere among the ''n'' trials, and there are C(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') different ways of distributing ''k'' successes in a sequence of ''n'' trials.

In creating reference tables for binomial distribution probability, usually the table is filled in up to ''n''/2 values. This is because for ''k'' &gt; ''n''/2, the probability can be calculated by its complement as

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;n,p)=f(n-k;n,1-p).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

So, one must look to a different ''k'' and a different ''p'' (the binomial is not symmetrical in general). However, its behavior is not arbitrary. There is always an integer ''m'' that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)p-1 &lt; m \leq (n+1)p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

As a function of ''k'', the expression ''ƒ''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is monotone increasing for ''k'' &lt; ''m'' and monotone decreasing for ''k'' &gt; ''m'', with the exception of one case where (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' is an integer. In this case, there are two maximum values for ''m'' = (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' and ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. ''m'' is known as the ''most probable'' (''most likely'') outcome of Bernoulli trials. Note that the probability of it occurring can be fairly small.</text>

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%&quot;&gt;'''Welcome to Circuit Idea!'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[File:NNR_step_3_1000.JPG|thumb|left|thumb|400px|link=Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance|Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance|Visit the amazing circuit story about the [[Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance|true negative impedance]] (renewed)!]]

This novel electronics wikibook is for the creative student, teacher, inventor, technician, hobbyist, and anyone who is not satisfied by formal circuit explanations. It is intended for people who really want to grasp the basic concepts of electronics by relying on their human imagination, intuition and emotions rather than on pure logic and reasoning.

{{Electric Circuits}}

We treat electronic circuitry not only as a science, but also as an art. Inventing novel electronic circuits is a result of human fantasy, imagination and enthusiasm. Fortunately, abstract electronic circuits are based on clear and simple ideas, which we derive from our human routines. In order to really understand how circuits operate, we have first to reveal the basic ideas on which they are based. We just need to know what problem the electronic elements solve, why they are soldered together, what they actually do in the circuit, how they do it, and more. As human beings, we just want to &quot;see the forest for the trees.&quot;

{{clear}}

Great circuit ideas are &quot;non-electrical&quot;; they are not dependent on the specific implementation (tube, transistor, op-amp etc.). The purpose of this wikibook is to reveal great circuit ideas, real truth about circuits. It just answers a simple but reasonable question...

{{clear}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''''What is the idea behind the circuit?'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

''Circuit idea'' is composed of two main logically connected parts: in the first part (''Creating a circuit methodology''), we will create universal methods for unearthing the ideas behind circuits; then, in the second part (''Revealing circuit ideas''), we will use these methods to reveal the secrets of popular circuits. The second part is designed as a collection of exciting stories about odd circuits and the amazing electrical phenomena behind them.

Following a novel building approach, the book presents every new more complex circuit based on the previous simpler one. First, we will derive the most elementary passive building blocks from the basic electric circuits of Ohm, Kirchhoff, Thevenin and Norton. Then, we will use these &quot;bricks&quot; to build more complicated compound passive circuits. Further, adding active elements in accordance with suitable basic ideas, we will build various transistor circuits. Finally, applying the powerful negative feedback principle in all its forms, we will transform these circuits into almost ideal op-amp ones. 

''Circuit idea'' will also contain stories about circuit paradoxes, contradictions, conflicts, and building schemes to induce creativity in readers. Historical &quot;excursions&quot; will show circuit evolution through the years. Some of the most interesting circuit stories will be created by students during their exercises in the laboratory; they will represent famous experiments (like [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Ohm's law]]). Other stories will be derived from teacher's lectures and exercises.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While a past discussion resulted in the rejection of [[Wikibooks:Blocking guideline]], nearly all other projects have some sort of guideline/policy.  We could at least get some information down on why blocks are made, how to resolve unblocking, etc.  Like most of our policies this can be vague enough such that it doesn't tie administrators' hands. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:03, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

== A few changes made ==

*Grammar, spelling, and stylistic changes.
*Removed the adjective &quot;persistently&quot; from disruption reasons for blocking. This doesn't reflect reality and opens the door to wikilawyering.
*&quot;Unblock to reblock&quot; is no longer necessary, you can alter block settings without unblocking.
*You must not use autoblock when blocking malfunctioning bots.
*Removed mention of enwiki's unblock-en-l mailing list
*Used language from [[Template:Checkuserblock]] - they must not be altered without consultation.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:29, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

== A few changes to be made ==
*I think this should be a guideline, not a policy. This would reduce the space users may wikilawyer in.
*The section &quot;Recording in the block log after username change&quot; mischaracterizes [[m:RTV]]. The section should point to the page on Meta, rather than duplicating content (badly).
*The conflict of interest section(s) are too strict. This is a small wiki, and everyone knows everyone (more or less). Requiring an uninvolved administrator at every turn would effectively stop ''any'' administrative action from being taken. The real standard must be whether the action is ''correct'', not who did it. The section should make this clear.
*The section &quot;Dealing with off-wiki block requests&quot; is also too restrictive, and singles out IRC when there are a multitude of off-wiki discussion forums (Skype or other IM, Facebook or other social networking sites, mailing list, private email, phone, in-person...). Again here, the standard must be whether the block is ''correct'', not how it happened to be discussed. Mentions that &quot;IRC != consensus&quot; belong at [[WB:IRC]], not in the blocking policy. The section should simply be removed.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:39, 8 December 2009 (UTC)
:Removed section on off-wiki requests.  Removed defined block period reference to leave it to discretion of blocking admin.  Removed section on conflicts of interest.  I'm not familiar enough with [[m:RTV]] to know what needs to stay on the page.  As to guideline/policy, I have no position on that but put the new revision here to avoid overwriting the version linked above that failed to reach consensus. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:03, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

::The last proposal was voted as a guideline because it was extremely simplified (lots of exceptional situations were expected), this new proposal seems very complete.  It also resolves some of the terminology issues the previous proposal had.
::A point that wasn't made clear in the previous discussion is that this policy is not especially important to the users that will be discussing it. But it will be extremely important to the normal Wikibookian that may eventually be target to a block. I think that this is the basis for the references to the problem of using this text for wikilawyering, there is an understandably resistance in one minority but extremely vocal group (admins) to see their actions restricted (or strictly defined) as this will increase the level of effort and difficulty to execute them, even if in this case the result can only be positive.  Even in extreme circumstances, our objective shouldn't be the exclusion of people.
::As for the edits I noticed that in the Disruption section the word &quot;persistent&quot; was removed this creates an inconsistency on the text as in general it points to repeated occurrences...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:26, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

::Made some changes to Block reviews section to conform to what was discussed in the past as reasonable. Admins should, if possible, be first informed of any changes to blocks they made (this avoids errors and reduces confusion). I also made the possible discussion more public, as there is no special reason that it should take place on the Administrative Assistance room (it should be made visible to the general community so all can participate), otherwise some level of more general announcement would be necessary (and included on the text).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:25, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

::I don't agree that the &quot;The conflict of interest section&quot; was particular problematic (probably could have been better worded). But I'm certain that the reason Mike provided for the removal is not completely  aplicable since as I said above the text establishes relations between few-to-many.  In any case and because of the type of relation, that restriction is made redundant, as admins are expected to know better (IIRC this is in some form already covered on the policy defining administrators), and the text makes it so that any review is not performed by the blocking admin. A better approach to the previous practice, that on our community level of activity permits quicker reactions, as I think was part of the point Mike raised...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:53, 8 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! and thanks for any help you can provide on the C++ Programming book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:09, 6 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

What in the world is an &quot;ss&quot; (appears as abbrev. in recipe)? I've looked all over, and can't figure it out. ____ spoons? [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 20:59, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

:I left this until I could do a bit of a search. I came up with this [http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/index.html marvellous website], which has lots of arcane and obscure units of measurement. 
:When ''ss'' appears next to another measurement, it means ''half'' (Latin ''semis''), and is used in old apothecary recipes (medicines and tonics). Not this one, then!
:Likely candidate is ''saltspoon'', which is ¼ of a teaspoon, about 1.2 mL. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:57, 10 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

This content is already covered at [[Cookbook:Separating eggs|separating eggs]]. The verb &quot;separate&quot; doesn't always refer to eggs, so this title seems a bit weird to me. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 21:01, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Outreach project==
One of the greatest things about Wikibooks is that ''our'' textbooks can contain the sorts of thing you &quot;can't learn from a textbook&quot;. I think this could be especially true about &quot;trades&quot;, as opposed to the more academic fields. So I'm interested in what people think about constructing invitation letters that Wikibookians could hand off to people they encounter in day-to-day living. There's a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything, including: trash collection, rebuilding a transmission, fixing a leaky roof, repairing guard rails, sexing chickens, dredging ports, etc. 

On our part, we'd need to make some efforts at making the bookshelves user-friendly, and perhaps even have a separate &quot;entry page&quot; for these contributors (this might also help the Main Page debackle too). I'd also strongly argue that the &quot;How-tos&quot; category and bookshelf be abolished, and replaced with &quot;Trades and Vocations&quot;, &quot;Hobbies and Avocations&quot;, and &quot;Life Skills and Self-Help&quot;. As a tradesman myself, I think I might speak for more than a few who would feel that classifying trades and vocations with &quot;how-tos&quot; (side by side with &quot;[[Shaving]]&quot; and &quot;[[How to Tie a Tie]]&quot;) is rather insulting and dismissive of our fields of specialty.

[[User:Bastique]] (one of our faithful stewards) has been &quot;talking us up&quot; on both IRC and various lists and projects as well, and is particularly interested in &quot;recruiting&quot; retirees through a partnership with the [[w:AARP|AARP]]. Regardless of whether this is successful, it does make me think about perhaps getting in touch with labor unions and trade associations, government agencies such as agricultural extension services, museums and schools, and even web forums, mailing lists, religious institutions, or local clubs. 

For AARP contributors in particular, we might even set up a new css &quot;skin&quot;, based on monobook but with larger fonts for the edit window in particular (I personally wouldn't mind a larger font either... as much as I like the &quot;unix-terminal&quot; quality of the edit window, it's really not very user friendly for those with older eyes!), but also for image captions and even the main text of modules. Coming up with a more ''helpful'' &quot;Help:&quot; namespace would go very far too.

Within Wikimedia, 2 of our &quot;sisters&quot; are quite interested in us. Wikiversity's experimental style has in at least a couple cases led to the creation of ''very'' good book stubs, and their learning projects should ideally use our textbooks for reading material. Commons of course serves all projects, but the difference between the needs of Wikibooks projects and those of the Wikipedias has been a topic of many discussions lately. 

As far as our relations with en.Wikiversity goes, I think we only need to ask for import to be enabled, so that we can copy over textbook-like learning projects and hope that the Wikibooks versions will continue to grow. For the commoners (commonists, commonsians, etc.), organizing &quot;illustration projects&quot; could both generate more interest and give image contributors a better idea of what kinds of images we need (Wikijunior, in particular, needs very different genres than does Wikipedia). 

Last but not least, we need to attract Wikipedians. They know how to edit, and we might be able to identify those who are experts. Wikipedia is spotty and patchy, but there are subjects where it's very well developed because people with expertise have contributed. The problem is, no-one is an expert on everything, and the expert eventually runs out of new things to write and/or gets frustrated with the wikipedian problems of vandals, spammers, POV-pushers, and trolls. 

On that, I think we've got a strong &quot;selling point&quot;. Over the past 6 months or so, vandalism and spamming has been rather tightly controlled here thanks in large part to two of our most active administrators. We're not as strong on POV-pushing and trolling, but an influx of &quot;angry Wikipedians&quot; might tip the balance there. For the Wikipedians we also need to provide clear guidelines on &quot;maintenance tasks&quot; such as categorizing, RC patrolling, orphan pages, etc.</text>

This lesson needs work.
I just figure, for my students, whether ESL students, Spanish students, French students or Portuguese students, one of the first things I teach them is the pronouns.  I´m too lazy to really post something professional at the moment.  --[[User:AnthonyBaldwin|AnthonyBaldwin]] 03:13, 7 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Glad to see I'm not quite the only one that thinks this is a good idea. Thanks for not fighting on the page style so far... Just a couple things. The '''Signature:''' line for methods/functions should probably have a colon to conform to standard labeling usage. Also I've tried to use a cleaner coding style. I notice a lot of BMax source has strange ways of putting spaces around parameters and no spaces after a comma, or a space before a comma. It just looks really wrong to me, makes it harder to read so I'm trying to keep most of the source more standard.

Anyway hopefully we can get some other people to jump in. I think this is our best bet for a good, permanent documentation source. [[User:Blueapples|Blueapples]] 04:50, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

Forgot to mention, if variables in examples or signatures are left to their default values we should probably put ''':Int''' in there to be clear. [[User:Blueapples|Blueapples]] 04:51, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

If someone knows how to, please add this to the computer languages bookshelf. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 14:27, 13 May 2007 (UTC)
Nevermind, figured it out. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 15:11, 13 May 2007 (UTC)
:I was trying to find how to do that, glad you got it. [[User:Blueapples|Blueapples]] 21:52, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

===Organization===

The page in growing pretty long... The front page should probably only have an introduction to each topic, and then a separate page for deeper discussion. At least the list of modules needs a separate page soon. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 10:03, 26 May 2007 (UTC)

Reorganized the modules on a separate page. Also, I renamed the pages for individual modules as they are names inside the mod directory. Something similiar should be done to Arrays.[[User:Otus|Otus]] 11:47, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

:Good thinking, I knew after content was added that the page might get out of hand. Arrays and Control Structures could also easily use their own pages.
:I wish I had more time to document additional modules. I will get back to it in a couple weeks hopefully. [[User:Blueapples|Blueapples]] 21:43, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

===Code Style===
For purposes of documentation, I am thinking it might be best to write all samples so they would compile in SuperStrict mode. Otherwise, we may be misleading by committing information that is assumed by the compiler in less strict modes. On the other hand, it will make samples somewhat more verbose which may also be misleading by implying that BMax is difficult to code in. I'm not sure, but I personally never write code that can't compile in SuperStrict and I believe it's easiest tool to help write reliable code. Probably good to promote that style. [[User:Blueapples|Blueapples]] 21:49, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

I agree, except for very simple beginner examples. There I think we should choose simplicity over more advanced code. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 17:57, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

===Source for examples===
[http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=70704 Here] is a thread with much information that chould be copied/used here. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 17:57, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

===Modules page revision===
I redid the category structure and added some extra information to the [[#BlitzMax/Modules|Modules]] page.
I also redid all the existing code and documentation for [[BlitzMax/Modules/Brl/Map|BRL.Map]] and [[BlitzMax/Modules/Brl/LinkedList|BRL.LinkedList]] for testing/examples.

All the code on the book should be entirely SuperStrict compliant, that way anyone using code examples from the book can use whichever strictness mode they want to (SuperStrict down-levels perfectly with non-Strict and Strict, whereas neither non-Strict and Strict - in most cases - will not go up in strictness).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Persistence? ==

If the following (small) section is going to be in the article, can we have an explanation of what it means.  Personally, I've gone through a number of courses in logic and have never run into this concept, so I have no clue how to clarify it by myself.

&quot;How about the persistence of p or q?
p is p. We know this much. And we know that q is q. Do we really? Well can't they change? We must define these statements as persistent. If they change, then they are defined as new statements.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This component allows you to grab image from firewire cameras using the [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/ CMU] driver. The output images are grayscale or color (RGB) images. As the CMU driver does only exist for Windows, this component is not cross platform.

== Input ==

A firewire (1394A or 1394B) camera.

== Output ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_ColorImage.jpg]]

A grayscale or color (RGB) image.

== Parameters ==

=== Camera Number ===
Allows you to select the camera if there are multiple firewire cameras connected.

=== Video Format and Mode ===
Video Format (0..2) and Mode (0..7) allow you to select the desired input type from the camera. Beware that a conversion is automatically done to output only grayscale or RGB images. Thus, YUV format are not really interesting, except if it allows for an increased camera frame rate.

The following table describes the different modes and formats. To check the available input types of you camera, you can use the 1394CameraDemo.exe that is shipped with the CMU driver, or check the camera datasheet.

=== Frame Rate ===
Select the camera frame rate: 1.875 fps (0), 3.75 fps (1), 7.5 fps (2),15 fps (3), 30 fps (4), 60 fps (5), 120 fps (6), 240 fps (7).

To check the available frame rates of you camera, you can use the 1394CameraDemo.exe that is shipped with the CMU driver, or check the camera datasheet.

=== Configuration Window ===
Allows you to open a configuration window to modify other camera parameters of the firewire camera, such as the white balance, saturation, gain, etc. Note that not all cameras allow you to modify all these parameters.

The fluorescent lamp is really just a subtype of light bulb, and, as such, should be merged into the section on fluorescent light bulbs.

Cheerio!

== STL ==
Humm but should we have redirects to pagemodules ? Should it point to the book section or to the book front page? or is it really necessary at all (using the site search would be more useful), you will either agree or disagree, if you don't agree please consider at least mark it for VfD and we can argue about it and see if is really needed , if so, then we would have a lots of redirects that would like to see existing :) (I'm using a bit of reverse logic and skipping to the final stage of this rational), but as you I also see some (but less) positive reasons to have it and others like it preserved...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:37, 11 April 2007 (UTC)
: Take it to VfD if you want.  Its a petty issue.  And currently if someone searches &quot;STL&quot; it automatically redirects them to the appropriate module; I don't think it would if the redirect were deleted.  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:43, 11 April 2007 (UTC)
:: You are right there, btw that is also another thing that doesn't work well, for instance if you do a search for CPU, since there is no CPU in the root Wikimedia after checking there it jumps to the users pages, people using Wikibooks search would most probably wish a reply on book contents first.
:: I know it is of this is of less importance but for the sake of consistency and so not to let this depend on who does or takes action (it would have saved me the time to have marked it to deletion or even you removal from deletion), we should probably see if this is a process that should be made default or just avoid deletion redirects of this nature is they serve some purpose and to where should they point to the book or to the module, in this case the module has relevance since when I made the wrong move (to the root and not to the book) the path to the last copy was preserved.
:: For instance C++ (also a redirect has some logic since it is indeed the core of the book subject) but STL is part of the subject, humm is like if I crated a Chocolate redirect to a recipe in the Cookbook (generally speaking), either way a consensus decission of what to do would serve to make this into the proper police (deletion, VfD or other) this would save someone else repeating actions and even this discussion later on. As you seem not to have strong filling either way and I do I think it is one of those minor issues that should benefit from clarification, I will only post this on the chat page, someone may have other valid points either way.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:14, 11 April 2007 (UTC)
::: A guideline regarding redirects may be appropriate.  About redirects to the Cookbook, what I would like to see is the cookbook namespace searched in addition to the main namespace by default.  I asked [[m:User:Pathoschild]] about it in January ([http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pathoschild&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=525580 his answer]) and I can ask around tomorrow.  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:23, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

== Deadminiship ==

In response to your comments at [[WB:RFA]], and [[User:Withinfocus]]' reply, I have created a dedicated discussion area for this topic at [[Wikibooks_talk:Administrators#Inactive_administrators]]. If you are interested in changing the policy, you can make your comments at that place. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:36, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
: I'm sorry, am I supposed to respond to a declaratory statement that my comments were inappropriately made at WB:RFA or assumptions that I haven't read the previous discussions?  I fail to see how that will be productive.  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 16:48, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::I didnt mean any offense to you, but if you are interested in altering the policy (as your comment would seem to indicate), then you should discuss it at the proper forum. [[WB:RFA]] is a place for implementing policy, not working to change policy. I don't want your criticisms to go unheard because people dont feel they were made in the right place. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:51, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::Fighting with [[User:Withinfocus]] isn't going to help anything. If he comes off as abrasive it's because he has a large amount of frustration over that page, a frustration that I share with him. If you do want to change the policy, you can discuss it at the appropriate places. If you keep fighting on the [[WB:RFA]] page, it wont accomplish anything except to make everybody angry. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:36, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::: Thank you for the note.  I do not intend to make anyone angry, and I suppose that I am a bit to confrontational and stubborn sometimes and feel out of the loop partly because I am not as active here as I would like and partly because what I see for Wikibooks is not necessarily what everyone else seems to see.  I just committed another revision to WB:RFA and, now that I think about it, it will likely only perpetuate the problem—stupid me.

}}'''''Aconitum''''' (known as '''aconite''', '''monkshood''', or '''wolfsbane''') is a genus of flowering plant belonging to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). There are over 250 species of ''Aconitum''. 

All species are lethally toxic, causing death within hours when ingested.

==Description==
These herbaceous perennial plants are chiefly natives of the mountainous parts of the northern hemisphere, growing in damp soils on mountain meadows. Their dark green leaves lack stipules. They are palmate or deeply palmately lobed with 5–7 segments. Each segment again is 3-lobed with coarse sharp teeth. The leaves have a spiral or alternate arrangement. The lower leaves have long petioles.

These are handsome plants, the tall, erect stem being crowned by racemes of large and eye-catching blue, purple, white, yellow or pink zygomorphic flowers with numerous stamens. They are distinguishable by having one of the five petaloid sepals (the posterior one), called the galea, in the form of a cylindrical helmet; hence the English name monkshood. There are 2–10 petals, in the form of nectaries. The two upper petals are large. They are placed under the hood of the calyx and are supported on long stalks. They have a hollow spur at their apex, containing the nectar. The other petals are small or lack completely. The 3–5 carpels are partially fused at the base.

The fruit is a follicle.

==Growing conditions==
Moist, fertile, well drained soils in light to medium shade.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
The most common plant in this genus, ''Aconitum napellus'' (the Common Monkshood) is of therapeutic and toxicological importance. Its roots have occasionally been mistaken for horseradish. It has a short underground stem, from which dark-colored tapering roots descend. The crown or upper portion of the root gives rise to new plants. When touched to one's lip, the juice of the aconite root produces a feeling of numbness and tingling. 

The roots of ''Aconitum ferox'' supply the Indian (Nepalese) poison called ''bikh'', ''bish'', or ''nabee''. It contains large quantities of the alkaloid pseudaconitine, which is a deadly poison. ''Aconitum palmatum'' yields another of the bikh poisons. The root of ''Aconitum luridum'', of the Himalaya, is said to be as virulent as that of ''A. ferox'' or ''A. napellus''.

Several species of Aconitum have been used as arrow poisons. The Minaro in Ladakh use ''A. napellus'' on their arrows to hunt ibex, while the Ainus in Japan used a species of Aconitum to hunt bear.&lt;ref&gt;Peissel, Michel. 1984. ''The Ants’ Gold. The Discovery of the Greek El Dorado in the Himalayas''. London, Harvill Press, pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also used Aconitum poisons both for hunting,&lt;ref&gt;Sung, Ying-hsing. ''T’ien kung k’ai wu''. Sung Ying-hsing. 1637. Published as ''Chinese Technology in the seventeenth century''. Translated and annotated by E-tu Zen Sun and Shiou-chuan Sun. 1996. Mineola. New York. Dover Publications, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; and for warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Chavannes, Édouard. “Trois Généraux Chinois de la dynastie des Han Orientaux. Pan Tch’ao (32-102 p.C.); – son fils Pan Yong; – Leang K’in (112 p.C.). Chapitre LXXVII du Heou Han chou.”. 1906. ''T’oung pao'' 7, pp. 226-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of ''Aconitum'' are cultivated in gardens, having either blue or yellow flowers. ''Aconitum lycoctonum'' (Alpine wolfsbane), is a yellow-flowered species common in the Alps of Switzerland. As garden plants the aconites are very ornamental, hardy perennial plants. They thrive well in any ordinary garden soil, and will grow beneath the shade of trees. They are easily propagated by divisions of the root or by seeds; care should be taken not to leave pieces of the root where livestock might eat them, owing to their poisonous character.

Aconite has been ascribed with supernatural powers relating to werewolves and other lycanthropes, either to repel them, relating to aconite's use in poisoning wolves and other animals, or in some way induce their lycanthropic condition, as aconite was often an important ingredient in witches' magic ointments. In folklore, Aconite was also said to make a person into a werewolf if it is worn, smelled, or eaten. They are also said to kill werewolves if they wear, smell, or eat aconite.

Aconite have also been known under names such as wolfsbane, leopard's bane, women's bane, Devil's helmet or blue rocket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4113983]&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus '''''Aesculus''''' comprises 20–25 species of deciduous trees and shrubs native to the temperate northern hemisphere, with 7–10 species native to North America and 13–15 species native in Eurasia; there are also several natural hybrids. They have traditionally been treated in their own monogeneric family Hippocastanaceae, but genetic evidence shows that this family, along with the maples (formerly Aceraceae), are better included in the soapberry family (Sapindaceae).

The North American species are known as '''Buckeyes''' and the Eurasian species as '''Horse-chestnuts'''. Some are also sometimes called &quot;White Chestnut&quot; or &quot;Red Chestnut&quot;. 

==Description==
''Aesculus'' are woody plants from 4 to 35 m tall (depending on species), and have stout shoots with resinous, often sticky, buds; opposite, palmately divided leaves, often very large (to 65 cm across in the Japanese Horse-chestnut ''Aesculus turbinata''); and showy insect-pollinated flowers, with a single four- or five-lobed petal (actually four or five petals fused at the base). Flowering starts after 80–110 growing degree days. The fruit is a rich glossy brown to blackish-brown nut 2–5 cm diameter, usually globose with one nut in a green or brown husk, but sometimes two nuts together in one husk, in which case the nuts are flat on one side; the point of attachment of the nut in the husk shows as a large circular whitish scar. The husk has scattered soft spines in some species, spineless in others, and splits into three sections to release the nut.

==Growing conditions==
The most familiar member of the genus worldwide is the Common Horse-chestnut ''[[../Aesculus hippocastanum/]]'', native to a small area of the Balkans in southeast Europe, but widely cultivated throughout the temperate world. The Yellow Buckeye ''[[../Aesculus flava/]]'' (syn. ''A. octandra'') is also a valuable ornamental tree with yellow flowers, but is less widely planted. Among the smaller species, the Bottlebrush Buckeye ''[[../Aesculus parviflora/]]'' also makes a very interesting and unusual flowering shrub. Several other members of the genus are used as ornamentals, and several horticultural hybrids have also been developed, most notably the Red Horse-chestnut ''A. x carnea'', a hybrid between ''A. hippocastanum'' and ''A. pavia''.

They are generally fairly problem-free, though a recently discovered leaf-mining moth ''Cameraria ohridella'' is currently causing major problems in much of Europe, causing premature leaf fall which looks very unattractive. The symptoms (brown blotches on the leaves) can be confused with damage caused by the leaf fungus ''Guignardia aesculi'', which is also very common but usually less serious. Common Horse-chestnut is also used as a food plant by The Sycamore, another species of moth.

*''[[../Aesculus sylvatica/]]'': Painted Buckeye
*''[[../Aesculus turbinata/]]'': Japanese Horse-chestnut
*''[[../Aesculus wilsonii/]]'': Wilson's Horse-chestnut

==Uses==
The nuts contain high concentrations of a saponin-class toxin called Aesculin, which is toxic to many animals including humans because it causes hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). The saponin can be eliminated by leaching the pulverized nuts in multiple changes of boiling water, to yield a wholesome starchy porridge once important to some Native American tribes.  Some animals, notably deer and squirrels and alligators, are resistant to the toxins and can eat the nuts directly. An interesting side-note is that Aesculin is a natural pH indicator which, when extracted turns from colorless to fluorescent blue under UV light in an acidic pH range.

Crushed buckeye nuts have also been thrown into lakes by poachers, to kill fish for easy capture.

California Buckeyes ''[[../Aesculus californica]]'' are known to cause poisoning of honeybees from toxic nectar (other locally native bee species not being affected). Other buckeye species are thought to have the same effect, but the toxins are diluted because the trees are not usually abundant enough in any one area. 

The wood is very pale whitish-brown, fairly soft and little-used. Uses include cheap furniture, boxes and firewood.

In some cultures, the buckeye tree is thought to bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiodnr.com/forestry/education/buckeyetrees2.htm] [http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~herb/buckeye.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesculus is used in homeopathic medicine for pain in the sacroiliac region and rectal pain &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]]

'''Cha shao''' is a kind of spiced Cantonese honey roast [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]. It is often also called by the Cantonese '''char siu''' or '''char siew'''. Sometimes (usually in America) it is called '''Chinese BBQ pork'''. It is very popular, and can be eaten by itself (usually cold), or used as an ingredient for other dishes such as cha shao bao (pork buns), or in noodles or rice.

The pork used should be quite fatty in order to keep the meat moist during cooking. Pork shoulder is a good choice. The meat is traditionally hung to cook, as this allows it to cook from all sides in the very hot oven. It can be laid on a rack, but if possible hang from metal S-hooks on a high rack, which are easily and cheaply available from hardware stores.

[[Cookbook:Sherry|Sherry]] can be used instead of [[Cookbook:Rice Wine|Shaoxing wine]] (also called Shao Hsing wine), but it does not provide quite the same flavour.

Since this dish requires a reasonably large amount of time and preparation, even while cooking (frequent basting is needed), it is easiest to make it in large batches. The recipe here makes 1kg, which is enough for several different dishes. It can be kept in the fridge for several days or frozen until required.

==Ingredients==

* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] shoulder.
* 2 tbsp. dark [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 2 tbsp. light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp. oyster sauce
* 2 tbsp. Shaoxing [[Cookbook:Rice Wine|rice wine]]
* 2 tbsp. clear [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 4 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|hoisin sauce]]
* ½ tsp. [[Cookbook:Five Spice Powder|five spice]]

==Procedure==

#Slice the meat into strips about 1 inch wide by 6 inches long. A long thin strip like this will keep its shape better when hanging.
#Pierce the pork all over thoroughly with a fork. This makes the pork more tender and allows the marinade to penetrate the meat to give flavour all the way through.
#Mix all other ingredients together.
#Place pork strips in a tray and cover with marinade. Ensure strips are covered completely in marinade.
#Cover tightly with cling film and place in the refrigerator for several hours. Overnight or for 24 hours is preferable.
#Preheat the oven to 230°C or 420°F and place a pan in the bottom to catch drippings. Line this pan with aluminium foil to make cleaning easier.
#Hang the meat on hooks in the oven or lay them on a rack. Depending on the method and the size of your oven, it may be easiest to do this in two or three batches, rather than all at once.
#Roast for 20 minutes, until pork is cooked all the way through. Baste at least twice to build up a good layer of marinade on the outside of the meat. The pork should turn a golden-red colour as it cooks.
#Allow to cool while still hanging, or lay on wire rack to cool. Avoid laying on top of other meat or on a flat surface until cooled.
#Cover and refrigerate until needed.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Serve cold, or use diced in other dishes.
* Add 1 tbsp. of toasted sesame oil for a nuttier flavour
* Add red food colouring to the marinade to give the traditional deep red hue. This used to be due to the preservative used for the pork. Also, in China, the red colour generally symbolises good fortune. However, due to the strong colour of the marinade described above, a significant quantity of food colouring will be needed.

This dish goes very well with ginger and onion.

==Warnings==
* Use care in handling the raw pork. Wash hands and utensils that come into contact with raw pork. Don't allow raw pork or its juices to come into contact with other foods, unless they are to be cooked afterwards.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread recipes]]

A '''baozi''', also known as '''bao''' or '''bau''', is a type of steamed, filled bun or
[[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]-like item in Chinese cuisine. In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese mantou, but baozi has filling. It can be filled with meat or vegetarian fillings, and used as an alternative to [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Noodle|noodles]]. It can be eaten at any meal in Chinese culture, and is often eaten for breakfast.

This recipe is just for the dough. Links to commonly made baozi fillings are given below.

==Ingredients==
===Steamed buns===
*600ml warm water (3 cups)(around body temperature - 100°F or 38°C)
*3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (or 1 packet)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]. granulated white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*450g or 3 1/2 cups white bread [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], plus extra for flouring hands, surfaces, etc.
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]. Must be double-acting (i.e. has a raising agent that works at high temperature).
*½ tsp. salt, if desired.
*a little bit of sesame oil for step 7

==Procedure==
===Making the Dough===
#Stir yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar into 1 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 15 minutes. Skip this step if your yeast does not need proofing (it will say so on the packet)
#Sift the flour and sugar together.
#If you pre-mixed the yeast, add to the flour and the rest of the sugar in a mixing bowl.
#If you didn't pre-mix the yeast, mix flour, salt if desired, and the sugar, then mix in yeast in a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of the water in a steady stream, mixing constantly.
#Mix together. The dough will begin to form a ragged clump. If the dough does not stick together, add a small amount more water.
#Knead dough for 5-10 minutes. The dough will stiffen, and should spring back slowly when indented with a finger. The surface should be smooth and slightly shiny.
#Coat the bottom of a large bowl with the sesame oil to give a thin film, and place the dough in the bowl. Roll over so it is coated with the oil.
#Allow dough to rise and double in volume in a warm place for 1-1½ hours, or in a cool place like a fridge for 2-3 hours. A slow rise in a cool place will produce a finer texture.
#Punch dough down. If you wish at this point, you can allow it to rise and double again, in a warm or cool place, and punch down again. A double rise also results in a finer, more tender texture.
#Form into a large pancake shape.
#Sprinkle the baking powder evenly across the dough, and knead again, until the same consistency as before it rose. Water from the yeast's respiration may have made the dough softer, so add a bit more flour if needed.
#Divide the dough into two long rolls, and cut each into 6 pieces.
#Roll each piece of dough into a ball. If you are making plain baozi, go straight to Step 20 now. If making filled baozi, then flatten each ball into a 6-inch disc.
#Shape the disc so that it is significantly thicker in the centre than at the edges. 
#Position one hand as if you were holding a normal drinking glass, and place a disc of dough over the top.
#Using two fingers, push the centre of the disc down by about 1 inch. 
#Place 1 dessert spoon of filling into the well you just made in the dough. 
#Still holding your hand in position, use your other hand to fold the edges of the dough together, in a sort of pleated fashion.
#Pinch edges together and twist (so that you twist a small portion at the top right off) to close the baozi.
#Place each baozi on a square of parchment paper, 3 inches to a side.
#Allow to rise in warm place 1 hour. The dough should end up springy to the touch.

===Cooking===
#Place buns in a steamer. Try to position so they do not touch one another. It will almost certainly require several batches to steam all the buns, unless you have lots of steamers, or a very big one. You can put them seam up (opening flower effect) or seam down (smooth, round top).
#Steam buns over gently boiling water for 10-15 minutes.
#After this time, remove the pan and steamer from heat, but '''don't''' remove the steamer from the pan, or lift the lid of the steamer. By allowing the steam to subside gradually like this, you prevent the dough from collapsing on contact with the cold air.
#After a few minutes, carefully lift the lid and remove the bun gently from the steamer.
#When cool enough to handle, remove parchment paper from bottom of buns.
#Serve warm.

==Variations and Tips==
*Use bleached flour for a whiter bread
*The ideal sweetness of the baozi is subjective - in China, they generally get sweeter the further south you go. This recipe is fairly sweet, but can be modified either way.
*Depending on taste, you can add salt to the dough - ½ tsp. should be sufficient. Remember not to allow concentrated salt to come into contact with the yeast, as it will kill it. Mix the salt with the flour, then add the yeast.
*Ensure the place used for rising is draft-free. Drafts prevent the dough from rising as much, resulting in a flatter bread.
*Use flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands, not oil. This keeps the dough from getting too wet. It is cooked in a damp environment, so you don't want wet dough.
*Try to keep the dough from drying out and forming a crust when not being worked with. Rise in a covered container (using clingfilm), and cover with a towel when not immediately handling the dough.
*Add a couple of tablespoons of vinegar to the steaming water to bleach the buns slightly. The vinegar does not significantly affect the taste of the buns.
*Try to use a bamboo steamer. Although a metal one will suffice, it doesn't impart a subtle flavour to the buns like bamboo, and it won't prevent water from forming on flat surfaces and making soggy patches.

==Warnings==
*Keep leftovers refrigerated.
*To reheat, steam for 10-15 minutes or heat in microwave for 30-45 seconds. Reheating by steaming gives better results.

==Common Baozi Fillings==

*[[Cookbook:Cha Shao|Cha Shao Bao]] - Chinese honey roast pork ('''cha shao''', '''char siu''' or sometimes &quot;Chinese BBQ&quot;)
*[[Cookbook:Red Bean Paste|Red Bean Paste]] - A sweet paste made of [[Cookbook:Azuki Bean|adzuki beans]] and sugar
*Jiu Cai (simplified: 韭菜, Pinyin: jiu3 cai4) - Fried green vegetables often with stir-fried egg
*Luobosi (simplified: 萝卜丝, Pinyin: luo2bo si1) - Thinly sliced radish
*Xiaolong Bao (小籠包) - &quot;Little cage&quot; dumplings, one of the most famous fillings, usually soupy with spicy pork. Highly variable depending on region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are literally millions of objects orbiting the Sun - asteroids, comets, meteors and Kuiper Belt objects - but eight of these bodies are very large and seem to stand out from the rest. These eight enormous spheres are called the planets and are widely recognised to be the most interesting things in the solar system. In order from the Sun, they are:

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

You can use a mnemonic like &quot;Men Very Easily Make Jugs Serve Useful Needs&quot; to help remember the order of the planets from the Sun.

Some of you may be wondering what happened to the ninth planet, Pluto. Pluto's status has now been officially changed from a planet to a &quot;dwarf planet&quot;. Astronomers realised that they didn't have an actual definition of the word &quot;planet,&quot; even though they'd been using the word for centuries! By 2006 chaos had emerged and nobody could agree whether there were eight, nine or ten planets.

On August 24th of that year the International Astronomical Union (the official astronomy naming community) held a vote to determine what a planet actually is. The first definition they came up with was that a planet is something that orbits the Sun and is massive enough for gravity to pull it into a round shape. This included the nine planets known at the time (Mercury through to Pluto), but would also include several asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects as well. At the time twelve bodies were officially known to be round and orbited the Sun, but that number could have risen to hundreds as more round bodies were found. So the IAU tried again, and decided a planet should have enough mass to &quot;clear the neighbourhood&quot; around its orbit, and this definition won the vote.

Pluto is not a planet, because it orbits in the Kuiper Belt - its orbit is littered with thousands of other small icy bodies. However, the eight other planets have mainly empty orbits except for their moons and a few asteroids or wandering KBOs (known as centaurs.) Astronomers felt that to just get rid of Pluto would be to ignore nearly 80 years of tradition and recognition of Pluto's status as the ninth planet, and so a new category, &quot;dwarf planet&quot; was created. Pluto is a dwarf planet. Dwarf planets are objects not quite big enough to clear their orbits and become planets, but big enough to be pulled into a round shape.

So now our solar system contains eight planets and three dwarfs - Ceres in the asteroid belt, Pluto in the Kuiper belt and Eris in the scattered disk. This page is about them.

==Cultural Evolution and Education==

===Introduction===

The 21st century has brought with it the expansion of communication technology that has altered the way humans communicate with each other, learn material, and interact with text.  This cultural evolution into a “techno” world has ramifications that affect educational curriculum, textbook development, and pedagogy.  The need to educate those who have grown up in the world of fast-paced, immediate feedback from recently available technology has created new educational concerns. 

===Student Knowledge===

Students must be taught skills that will allow them to be successful in their future endeavors, regardless of what they may be.  The technology that exists today will not be the technology of the future.  Students should acquire a set of generic skills and knowledge they could utilize in the decision-making process and other academic and occupational pursuits (Otto, 1986).  Although there is some benefit in teaching kids skills they can apply immediately, there’s more value in teaching them deeper concepts that will benefit them forever, regardless of changes in specific applications (Nielsen, 2007).  Educators need to find stronger themes, around which they can coordinate big ideas (Cavanagh, 2006).   This allows students to make deeper connections with academic material.  These themes can successfully be developed with the integration of current technology.  Technology has the ability not only to develop these skills but also to present material to students in a manner to which they are accustomed. These computer literate students have been “programmed” to learn through digital technology.  In order to be effective in teaching, teachers need to incorporate not only problem-solving skills, but incorporate appropriate technology training as well.  If students learn problem solving skills, how to analyze data, and how to apply new knowledge to novel situations they will be prepared to tackle any task they may encounter in their future.  Because technology is embedded in so many aspects of a student’s life, students need to learn skills that will allow them to effectively use this technology.  These include creating hypertext, computer-supported presentation skills, and basic usability guidelines.  In addition, students should be able to analyze the validity of data received digitally and assess the value of the material they obtain.  There is increasing recognition that the end result of computer literacy is not only knowing how to operate computers but also using technology as a tool for organization, communication, and problem solving (Johnson, D. &amp; Eisneberg, M., 2002).

===Textbooks===

A textbook is to students what software is to computers; something to be installed on them so that if testing reveals that loading did in fact occur, they can be certified as fit for use (Westhues, 1991).  Some textbooks lack coherence, and others do not challenge students to think (Calfee, 1987).  Textbook are designed in a way that makes it look at once authoritative (with lists of endorsements, ample footnotes, a hard cover, relatively expensive paper and graphics) and easy for students to study from as they prepare for tests (major concepts in bold face, a glossary of memorizable definitions, chapter summaries for last-minute cramming).  Today’s students quickly become bored with the traditional textbook design.  Life and learning can be so much richer, more constructive, more joyful than the textbook world allows (Westhues).  Textbooks need to support the knowledge that is required for a course of study, but they need to do so in a way that allows today’s students to effectively interact with this material.  Textbooks should be marginal in courses, while debates, discussions, computer-based presentations, and other forms of communication should be the main focus of the classroom.  Textbooks should be chosen based on their ability to incorporate problem-solving skills, use real-life situations to support concepts, link material to broader understandings, and incorporate computer technology.  Modern technology has allowed textbooks to be interactive by accompanying traditional texts with CD's as well as having companion websites.  There are also now electronic textbooks that are exclusively online and that are written collaboratively using wikis.  These textbooks are unique in that they can be accessed and edited by anyone on the internet.  Electronic textbooks can present animation and sound and provide links to several items and suggest associations among ideas (Blystone, Barnard &amp; Golimowski, 1990).  Providing links to other websites allows students to learn about topics in more detail by reading additional articles, participating in online activities, and even watching movies.  This allows the students to interact with the material in a way that the traditional textbook does not.  With the new technology of wikis, students themselves are able to take part in writing part of their textbook.  This enables them to learn about a spectific topic in detail, write about it, and then post it on the internet for anyone to read.  When students do this, they take more responsibility and ownership in learning about the topic (Cragun, 2007).

This is not to say that textbooks should be discarded completely.  Rather, they should be used as one possible resource among many. A good textbook can help to structure content and provide solid groundwork for further learning.  For the inexperienced teacher especially, the textbook may provide information in a well-organized, coherent framework and could well save him or her precious hours that might otherwise be used for research rather than for preparing ways of making the material interesting to students.  Moreover, the instructor is responsible for structuring the presentation of the material in ways that appeal to students with all possible kinds of learning styles.  Whereas many students may respond more readily to digital text, no doubt a few will remain who enjoy reading and find the appearing solidity of the textbook reassuring.

However, in addition to the format of instructional materials, we must also look closely at content. Textbooks are often rife with inaccuracies, biases, and outdated information. Whether presented as a book, interactive CD, or on-line, texts and instructional resources must be selected carefully and questioned critically. History texts in particular are biased with a Eurocentric view. As teachers select materials to reflect the cultures represented in their classroom, they must not neglect those that are not. Perhaps no group is treated as unfairly in the retelling of American history as the Naïve Americans. In this age of multiculturism and appreciation of diversity, we still have not come to terms with this part of our history. We tend to pass over many facts of history. It is easier to believe that our country was founded on integrity, cooperation, and bravery and to ignore the atrocities. We still propagate the myths. Elementary schools nationwide still celebrate Thanksgiving with kids wearing pilgrim hats and Indian feathers celebrating together as friends and neighbors. We do not teach our children the fact that not long after, those same Indians were massacred by the English. Elementary children still celebrate Columbus Day as the “discovery” of the new world as opposed to beginnings of the conquering of an entire race of people. Thanksgiving and Columbus Day, holidays which we celebrate, are a time of mourning for the Native Americans. Textbooks, in whatever form, can be very influential, and we must ensure that students understand how they are presented. Students should be taught to question the information in any text and to look further for additional information. Never before has this been so easily accomplished. In this digital age the information is literally at our fingertips.

===Digital Natives===	

We cannot consider the issues of what students should learn and how textbooks should be formatted without looking at the audience of the 21st century.  Today’s students are computer savvy.   They have grown up in a digital world that has allowed them access to information at unprecedented rates.  According to Prensky (2001), today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach. Today’s students are comprised of the first generation to have grown up in a world of technology.  Email, the Internet, cell phones, PDI’s, instant messaging, and computer games are integral parts of their lives (Prensky, 2001).  These digital natives are vastly different from the students who our current educational system was designed to teach.  They have been networked most of all their lives.  Today’s students will spend hours on My Space and Facebook, while they find it difficult to focus on book work for any duration of time.  They have little patience for lectures, step-by-step logic, and “tell-test” instruction (Prensky). To design engaging learning experiences for these digital natives, the digital immigrants (those who have not grown up in a digital world) must be well trained in technology and understand its potential (Burke, 2000). Since the International Society for Technology in Education released its National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers, many states have developed technology standards for current and pre-service teachers (Burke, 2000). In many states these standards address teacher proficiency with technology, as well as provide a framework for inclusion of technology in ways that will meet the learning preferences of today's students. Those who have grown up surrounded by digital technology communicate differently and use different problem solving methods (Pasteur, 2007).  They prefer receiving information very quickly, parallel processing and multi-tasking, and working with graphics and hypertext over text. They thrive on instant gratification and frequent rewards, and they prefer games to “serious” work (Prensky).  Games embody well-established principles and models of learning.  For instance, games are effective partly because the learning takes place within a meaningful (to the game) context (Van Eck, 2006).   Research has consistently found that games promote learning and/or reduce instructional time across multiple disciplines and ages (Van Eck).

===Conclusion===	
As educators, we need to adapt our lesson presentations to these digitally “programmed” students.  There is little hope that these digital natives will “power down” their minds to become more engaged with traditional learning styles.  From the digital natives’ point of view their digital immigrant instructors make their education not worth paying attention to compared to everything else they experience (Pensky, 2001).  This is not to say that existing teaching styles need to be ignored; but they need to be augmented to include digital avenues that will stimulate today’s students.

==Essay Question:==
What adaptations can be made in the classroom to more effectively educate 21st century students? 

===Response (Camilla): ===
In order to teach the “digital natives” I incorporate differentiation into my lessons in order to give the students a variety of presentation styles.   This keeps them from becoming bored with repetitive delivery of material, and supports the workings of their “fast-paced” digital brains.  Each lesson has a component that involves a hands-on approach to learning.  Laboratory investigations, discussions, student-created multi-media presentations, Web Quest, debates, and Internet aided instruction (imbedding links in lectures to animations, etc.), are all vital to the delivery of material.  Many of my laboratory investigations involve the use of interfacing probe ware,  CBL’s (computer based labs), and modern biotech equipment (PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, pGlo (gene transfer between species)).   In addition, students are asked to develop their own questions about topics and to then design an investigation to answer that question.   Lecture is designed to be inquiry based; the students are actively involved in discourse as new material is presented. 

I do not use the textbook in my classroom.  Students are assigned a textbook that is kept at home for reference.  Handouts, multi-media presentations, discussions, lectures, investigations, and student presentations are the main forms of presentation of material.  Students have told me that they like the CD that accompanies the book because it has animations to reinforce concepts.  This would make sense since they are digital natives. 
After the presentation last night, I am planning on incorporating new technology tools into my instruction.  Blogs seem to be great ways to have the students share their ideas and foster group work.  Questions can be posed that can be answered with collaboration and problem solving skills.  The development of problem-solving skills is vital due to the fact that information changes rapidly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Silicates''' are the largest and most important group of minerals in nature.  Silicates account for around 95% of all the rocks of the Earth's crust, and the soils, clays and sands formed when those rocks break down.  

Silicates are so ubiquitous that oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass, with silicon in second place: oxygen makes up 46% of the mass of the Earth's crust, while silicon is responsible for 27%.  Silicon and oxygen together therefore account for 73% of the crust.

== Tetrahedra ==
The basic building block of all silicate minerals is the  [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron.  There are four covalent Si−O bonds.  Each oxygen atom forms one vertex of the tetrahedron. The silicon to oxygen ratio is 1:4.

Silicate minerals containing isolated [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra are called ''nesosilicates'' or ''orthosilicates''.

Image:Silicate-tetrahedron-plan-view-2D.png|&lt;center&gt;''Chemical Ideas'' representation&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Corner-sharing tetrahedra ==
If two [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra share an oxygen atom at one common vertex, an [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; ion is formed. The silicon to oxygen ratio is 2:7.

Silicate minerals containing isolated [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; double tetrahedra are called ''sorosilicates''.

Image:Silicate-double-tetrahedra-plan-view-2D.png|&lt;center&gt;''Chemical Ideas'' representation&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Chains ==
Silicate minerals containing chains are termed ''inosilicates''.

=== Single chains ===
(SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. The silicon to oxygen ratio is 1:3.

=== Double chains ===
(Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. The silicon to oxygen ratio in double chains is 4:11.

==== Asbestos ====
Asbestos (from Greek ''ἅσβεστος'', unquenchable) is a group of fibrous silicate minerals containing double chains.  Prolonged exposure to dust containing fibres from certain types of asbestos is now known to cause scarring of the lungs, lung cancer, and a particularly aggressive cancer called mesothelioma.  Mesothelioma is almost always fatal, with a median survival time of 11 months.  Due to the exceptional danger posed by some absestos, all work involving asbestos in the UK must be done by specialist companies.  The vast majority of asbestos is the so-called white form, which is not known to pose any real danger.

== Sheets ==
[[Image:Silicate-sheet-3D-polyhedra.png|thumb|right|300px|Polyhedral model of a silicate sheet]]
SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra can be arranged to form sheets, as illustrated to the right.  The formula of such a sheet can be written (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Silicate minerals containing sheets are termed ''phyllosilicates''.

== Three-dimensional frameworks == 
Perhaps the most structurally complicated silicates are those based on networks of Si and O that extend in all three dimensions.  Examples of such minerals include quartz, zeolites and feldspars.

Silicate minerals containing three-dimensional frameworks are termed ''tectosilicates''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Reactions with Recycle ==

Reactions with recycle are very useful for a number of reasons, most notably because they can be used to improve the selectivity of multiple reactions, push a reaction beyond its equilibrium conversion, or speed up a catalytic reaction by removing products. A recycle loop coupled with a reactor will generally contain a separation process in which unused reactants are (partially) separated from products. These reactants are then fed back into the reactor along with the fresh feed.

== Example Reactor with Recycle ==

{{example|Consider a system designed for the hydrogenation of ethylene into ethane:

*&lt;math&gt; 2H_2 + C_2H_2 \rightarrow C_2H_6 &lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;(2A + B \rightarrow C)&lt;/math&gt;

The reaction takes too long to go to completion (and releases too much heat) so the designers decided to implement a recycle system in which, after only part of the reaction had finished, the mixture was sent into a membrane separator. There, most of the ethylene was separated out, with little hydrogen or ethylene contamination. After this separation, the cleaned stream entered a splitter, where some of the remaining mixture was returned to the reactor and the remainder discarded.

The system specifications for this process were as follows:

* Feed: 584 kg/h ethylene, 200 kg/h hydrogen gas
* Outlet stream from reactor contains 15% hydrogen by mass
* Mass flows from membrane separator: 100 kg/h, 5% Hydrogen and 93% ethane
* Splitter: 30% reject and 70% reflux
 
What was the extent of reaction for this system? What would the extent of reaction be if there was no separation/recycle process after (assume that the mass percent of hydrogen leaving the reactor is the same)? What limits how effective this process can be?}}

'''Solution''':

Let's first draw our flowchart as usual:

[[Image:Reactor with Recycle.PNG]]

=== DOF Analysis ===

*On reactor: 6 unknowns &lt;math&gt;(\dot{m}_5, x_{A5}, x_{B5}, \dot{m}_3, x_{B3}, X)&lt;/math&gt; - 3 equations = 3 DOF
*On separator: 5 unknowns &lt;math&gt;(\dot{m}_3, x_{B3}, \dot{m}_5, x_{A5}, x_{B5})&lt;/math&gt; - 3 equations = 2 DOF
*On splitter: 3 unknowns - 0 equations (we used all of them in labeling the chart) -&gt; 3 DOF
*Duplicate variables: 8 (&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_5, x_{A5}, x_{B5} &lt;/math&gt; twice each and &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3, x_{B3}&lt;/math&gt; once)
* Total DOF = 8 - 8 = 0 DOF

=== Plan and Solution ===

Generally, though not always, it is easiest to deal with the reactor itself ''last'' because it usually has the most unknowns. Lets begin by looking at the overall system because we can often get some valuable information from that.

'''Overall System'''
DOF(overall system) = 4 unknowns (&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_5, x_{A5}, X, x_{B5}&lt;/math&gt;) - 3 equations = 1 DOF. 

{{NOTE|We CANNOT say that total mass of A and B is conserved because we have a reaction here! Therefore we must include the conversion X in our list of unknowns for both the reactor ''and'' the overall system. However, the ''total'' mass in the system is conserved so we can solve for &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_5 &lt;/math&gt;.}}

Let's go ahead and solve for m5 though because that'll be useful later.

&lt;math&gt;784 = 100 + 0.3(\dot{m}_5) &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_5 = 2280 \mbox{ kg/h}&lt;/math&gt; }}

We can't do anything else with the overall system without knowing the conversion so lets look elsewhere. 

DOF(separator) = 4 unknowns (&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_3,  x_{B3}, x_{A5}, x_{B5}&lt;/math&gt;) - 3 equations = 1 DOF. Let's solve for those variables we can though. 

We can solve for m3 because from the overall material balance on the separator:

*&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_3 = \dot{m}_4 + \dot{m}_5 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3 = 100 + 2280 &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3 = 2380\mbox{ kg/h} &lt;/math&gt; }}

Then we can do a mass balance on A to solve for xA5:

* &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3x_{A3} = \dot{m}_4x_{A4} + \dot{m}_5x_{A5} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; 2380(0.15) = 100(0.05) + 2380(x_{A5}) &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|&lt;math&gt;x_{A5} = .1544&lt;/math&gt;}}

Since we don't know &lt;math&gt; x_{B5} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; x_{B3} &lt;/math&gt;, we cannot use the mass balance on B or C for the separator, so lets move on. Let's now turn to the reactor:

=== Reactor Analysis ===

DOF: 3 unknowns remaining (&lt;math&gt; x_{B3}, x_{B5}, and X&lt;/math&gt;) - 2 equations (because the overall balance is already solved!) = '''1 DOF'''. Therefore we still cannot solve the reactor completely. However, we can solve for the conversion and generation terms given what we know at this point. Lets start by writing a ''mole'' balance on A in the reactor.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A1} + \dot{n}_{A,recycle} - X*a = \dot{n}_{A3} &lt;/math&gt;

To find the three nA terms we need to convert from mass to moles (since A is hydrogen, H2, the molecular weight is &lt;math&gt; \frac{1\mbox{ mol}}{0.002016\mbox{ g}} &lt;/math&gt;):

* &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A1} = 200\frac{kg}{h} * \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.002016 \mbox{ kg}} = 99206 \frac{\mbox{mol A}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A,recycle} = 0.7*\frac{m_5*x_{A5}}{MW_A} = \frac{0.7(2280)(0.1544)}{0.002016} = 122000 \frac{\mbox{mol A}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the ''total'' amount of A entering the reactor is:

* &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A,in} = 99206 + 122000 = 221428\frac{\mbox{mol A}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

The amount exiting is: 

* &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A,out} = \frac{ \dot{m}_3*x_{A3}}{MM_A} = \frac{2380*0.15}{0.002016} = 177083 \frac{\mbox{mol A}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore we have the following from the mole balance:

* &lt;math&gt; 221428 - 2X = 177083 &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|&lt;math&gt; X = 22173 \frac{\mbox{ moles}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Now that we have this we can calculate the mass of B and C generated:

* &lt;math&gt; m_{B,gen} = -Xb*MW_B = 22173 \frac{\mbox{ mol B}}{h} * 0.026 \frac{kg}{\mbox{ mol B}} = -576.5\frac{\mbox{ kg B}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; m_{C,gen} = +Xc*MW_C = 22173 \frac{\mbox{ mol C}}{h} * 0.030 \frac{kg}{\mbox{ mol C}} = +665.2\frac{\mbox{ kg C}}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

At this point you may want to calculate the amount of B and C leaving the reactor with the mass balances on B and C:

* &lt;math&gt; 584 + 0.7*x_{B5}*2280 - 576.5 = x_{B3}*2380 &lt;/math&gt;
* (1) &lt;math&gt; 0.7*(1-0.1544-x_{B5})*2280 + 665.2 = (1-0.15-x_{B3})*2380 &lt;/math&gt;

However, ''these equations are exactly the same!'' Therefore, we have proven our assertion that there is still 1 DOF in the reactor. So we need to look elsewhere for something to calculate xB5. That place is the separator balance on B:

* &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{B3} = \dot{m}_4*x_{B4} + \dot{m}_5*x_{B5} &lt;/math&gt;
* (2) &lt;math&gt; 2380x_{B3} = 0.02(100) + 2280x_{B5}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving these two equations (1) and (2) yields the final two variables in the system:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; x_{B3} = 0.00856, x_{B5} = 0.008058 &lt;/math&gt; }}

Note that this means the predominant species in stream 5 is also C (&lt;math&gt; x_{C5} = 0.838 &lt;/math&gt;). However, the separator/recycle setup '''does''' make a big difference, as we'll see next.

=== Comparison to the situation without the separator/recycle system ===

Now that we know how much ethane we can obtain from the reactor after separating, let's compare to what would happen without any of the recycle systems in place. With the same data as in the first part of this problem, the new flowchart looks like this:

[[Image:Reactor with NO Recycle.PNG]]

There are three unknowns (&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3, x_{B3}, X &lt;/math&gt;) and three independent material balances, so the problem can be solved. Starting with an overall mass balance because total mass is conserved:

*&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_1 + \dot{m}_2 = \dot{m}_3 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3 = 789\frac{kg}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

We can carry out the same sort of analysis on the reactor as we did in the previous section to find the conversion and mass percent of C in the exit stream, which is left as an exercise to the reader. The result is that:

* &lt;math&gt; X = 20250\mbox{ moles}, x_{C3} = 0.77 &lt;/math&gt;

Compare this to the two exit streams in the recycle setup. '''Both of the streams were richer in C than 77%, even the reject stream'''. This occurred because the unreacted A and B was allowed to re-enter the reactor and form more C, and the separator was able to separate almost all the C that formed from the unreacted A and B.

'''Merit Badge Requirements'''
 
If meeting any of the requirements for this merit badge is against the Scout’s religious convictions, it does not have to be done if the boy’s parents and the proper church officials state in writing that:
	* To do so would be against religious convictions.
	* The parents accept full responsibility for anything that might happen because of such exemption.  They release the Boy 	Scouts of America from any responsibility.

1)
A) Before you try to meet any other requirements, have your health-care provider give you a thorough examination using the Scout medical examination form.  Describe the examination.  Tell what questions you were asked about your health.  Tell what health or medical recommendations were made and report what you have done in response to the recommendations.  Explain the following:
		1) Why physical exams are important
		2) Why preventative habits are important in maintaining good health
		3) Diseases that can be prevented and how
		4) The seven warning signs of cancer
		5) The youth risk factors that affect cardiovascular fitness in adulthood
B) Have an examination made by your dentist.  Get a statement saying that your teeth have been checked and cared for.  Tellhow to care for your teeth.

2) Explain to your merit badge counselor verbally or in writing what personal fitness means to you, including:
	A) Components of personal fitness
	B) Reasons for being fit in all components
	C) What it means to be mentally healthy
	D) What it means to be physically healthy and fit
	E) What it means to be socially healthy.  Discuss your activity in the eight areas of healthy social fitness
	F) What you can do to prevent social, emotional, or mental problems

3) With your counselor answer and discuss the following questions:
	A) Are you free from all curable diseases?  Are you living in such a way that your risk of preventable diseases is minimized?
	B) Are you immunized and vaccinated according to the advice of your health-care provider?
	C) Do you understand the meaning of a nutritious diet and know why it is important for you?  Does your diet include foods 	from all four groups?
	D) Are your body weight and composition what you would like them to be and do you know how to modify it safely through 	exercise, diet, and behavior modification?
	E) Do you carry out daily activities without noticeable effort?  Do you have extra energy for other activities?
	F) Are you free from habits relating to nutrition and the use of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and other practices that could be 	harmful to your health?
	G) Do you participate in a regular exercise program or recreational activities?
	H) Do you sleep well at night and wake up feeling refreshed and energized for the new day?
	I) Are you actively involved in the religious organization of your choice, and do you participate in their youth activities?
	J) Do you spend quality time with your family and friends in social and recreational activities?
	K) Do you support family activities and efforts to maintain a good home life?

4) Explain the following about physical fitness:
	A) The components of physical fitness
	B) Your weakest and strongest component of physical fitness
	C) The need to have a balance in all four components of physical fitness
	D) How the components of personal fitness relate to the Scout Laws and Scout Oath


5) Explain the following about nutrition:
	A) The importance of good nutrition
	B) What good nutrition means to you
	C) How good nutrition is related to the other components of personal fitness
	D) The three components of a sound weight (fat) control program

6) Before doing requirements 7 and 8, complete the aerobic fitness, flexibility, muscular strength, and body composition tests as described in the Personal Fitness merit badge pamphlet.  Record your results and identify those areas where you feel you need to improve. 

Aerobic Endurance Test
Record your performance on one of the following tests:
	A) Run/walk as far as you can in nine minutes
	B) Run/walk one mile as fast as you can

Flexibility Test
Using a sit-and-reach box constructed according to specifications in the merit badge pamphlet, make four repetitions and record the fourth reach.  This last reach must be held for 15 seconds to qualify.

Muscular Strength Test
You must use the sit-up test and EITHER the pull-up or push-up test.
A) Sit-ups.  Record the number of sit-ups done correctly in 60 seconds.  The sit-ups must be done in the form explained and illustrated in the merit badge pamphlet.
B) Pull-ups.  Record the total number of pull-ups completed consistent with the procedures presented in the merit badge pamphlet.
C) Push-ups.  Record the total number of push-ups completed consistent with the procedures presented in the merit badge pamphlet.

Body Composition Test
Have your parent, counselor, or other adult take and record the following measurements:
A) Circumference of the right upper arm, midway between the shoulder and the elbow, with the arm hanging naturally and not flexed.
B) Shoulders, with arms hanging by placing the tape two inches below the top of the shoulder and around the arms, chest, and back during breath expiration.
C) Chest, by placing the tape under the arms and around the chest and back at the nipple line during breath expiration.
D) Abdomen circumference at navel level (relaxed).
E) Right thigh, midway between the hip and the knee.
*If possible, have the same person take the measurements whenever they are recorded.

7) Outline a 12-week physical fitness program using the results of your physical fitness tests.  Be sure your program incorporates the endurance, intensity, and warm-up guidelines discussed in the Personal Fitness merit badge pamphlet.  Before beginning your exercises, have the program approved by your counselor and parents

8) Complete the physical fitness program you outlined in requirement 7.  Keep a log of your fitness program activity (i.e., how long your exercised; how far your ran, swam, or biked; how many exercise repetitions you completed; your exercise heart rate; etc.).  Repeat the aerobic fitness, muscular strength, and flexibility tests every two weeks and record your results.  After the 12th week, repeat all four tests, record your results, and show improvement in each one.  Compare and analyze your pre-program and post-program body composition measurements.  Discuss the meaning and benefit of your experience.

9) Describe your long-term plans regarding your personal fitness.

{{Wikiversity|Data Analysis using the SAS Language}}

This book is intended to be a guide to SAS programming. SAS is a commercial statistical software. SAS help is known to be messy and it is often difficult to find relevant documentation on a specific issue in SAS programming. Note that the WPS software is another interpreter of the SAS language&lt;ref name = &quot;WPS&quot;&gt;WPS http://www.teamwpc.co.uk/home&lt;/ref&gt;. There are lots of alternative to SAS. [[R]] is a free software and powerful statistical package. SPSS is easy to use. [[Stata]] is widely used in economics. SAS is especially adapted if you deal with very large datasets such as census data because it works directly on the data files without loading them in memory.
Your contributions to this book are welcome.

There is also a Wikiversity course, [[v:Data Analysis using the SAS Language|Data Analysis using the SAS Language]], which is organized by SAS functions and not by tasks.

      <comment>/* Quiz questions */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I disagree with the statement that compiling GHC from source is a bad idea.  I do it myself with every new release.  What's true is that trying to compile GHC from source without already having a working GHC (generally an older version) is a bad idea, though it's theoretically possible (I've never been able to make it work).  Once you have a GHC running, compiling a newer version is easy, though it does take forever and chew up an ungodly amount of disk space (almost 1 gigabyte the last time I did it).

== GHCi ==
The GHCi looks different now. Should I change it? Or wait for one more release? --[[User:Uchchwhash|Uchchwhash]] ([[User talk:Uchchwhash|talk]]) 06:30, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

:Sure, go ahead :-) -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 16:15, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

Some &quot;next/prev&quot; links would be useful on this page.

== Quiz questions ==

I have just removed the quiz. It was a little too simple (which would be hard to avoid in a setup prologue like this), and also because I can't really see quizzes being used elsewhere in the book. The answers to the questions, however, had some interesting material. Below is a copy of the quiz in case we decide to use some of the text later on.

&lt;quiz display=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
{What is the program that translates Haskell code into machine code?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- an interpreter
|| [[w:Interpreter (computing)|Interpreters]] can be used to execute code in some programming languages, and this includes Haskell ([[w:Hugs|Hugs]] is an example of a Haskell interpreter), but they do not translate the code into machine code.
+ a compiler
|| [[w:Compilers|Compilers]] are indeed programs that translate source code into machine code, or, in some case, byte code or simply languages of a lower level (i.e. languages that are closer to the workings of the processor and that are less abstract). GHC is the most used Haskell compiler and it compiles Haskell code to machine code.
- a translator
|| It is true that compilation can be seen as a form of translation and that compilers can, in a way, be considered as translators, but the term “compiler” is more appropriate.
- an executable
|| An [[w:executable|executable file]] (or simply ''executable'') is a file that can be executed as a program. The result of compilation is sometimes an executable file (sometimes accompanied by other files), but this is not always the case.
}

{What do we call the line with (&lt;code&gt;Prelude&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) where you type code into GHCi?
| type=&quot;{}&quot;}
{ prompt (i) }
|| The prompt is the message that ''prompts'' the user to type code. In GHCI, it indicates the modules that are loaded. The Prelude module is always loaded, so it shows it in the prompt message when no other module is loaded.
&lt;/quiz&gt;

In case you disagree with the removal, please comment here, or just be bold and reinstate the quiz. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 03:03, 24 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

TiddlyWiki is akin to software Lego bricks for writing: You pick a model to start with, then add the bricks you find suitable for what you want to create. The model, in the TiddlyWiki world would be a template that you or others have put together, the bricks would be plug-ins that help you produce exactly what you want. Accepting the limitations of the tool.

TiddlyWiki and its various derivatives could be billed - without overselling - as the Fun Way to Write. Actually, overselling doesn't really apply here, as it's all free, open source software, centered around the web browser and it's various backend options. The only investment on your part is the time it takes to get your head around it and appreciate the power it offers. You could choose to see it only as fancy way to take notes, or you could use it as a vehicle for creative writing, for structuring information or several other applications. Either way, you'll find it refreshingly different from traditional office software. You may consider it perfectly suited also as the form for presentation, or you may explore its vast array of options for tailoring the experience though styling, tweaks, and plugins. TiddlyWiki is being cared for and supported by a community of creative developers and users on the web.

'''TiddlyWiki (http://www.TiddlyWiki.com/)''', in its original form, is a kind of wiki that typically is edited by only one person and is completely self-contained in a single HTML file. It does not rely on a web server for storage, but rather on various solutions for letting the web browser save directly to a file on the users own PC. It uses [[HyperText Markup Language|HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[JavaScript|JavaScript]] code. TiddlyWiki is supported by many extensions and plugins that modify how it works or what it can do.

Using a TiddlyWiki to build a web page is a good idea because:
* it's fun
* it's simple to create 
* it's simple to update 
* it's simple to customize
* it's an innovative way of presenting text

This book will serve a reference for people who want to learn to read,  write, customise or develop/code a TiddlyWiki. No technical knowledge will be assumed. Screenshots will be used liberally for faster learning, and the reader is encouraged to tinker with their own TiddlyWiki while reading this book.

==Contents==

for everyone:
* [[/Introduction/]]: what is a TiddlyWiki? history, examples, license info etc
* [[/Resources/]]: annotated and reviewed links

for readers:
* [[/Reading/]] - Confused by how a TiddlyWiki works? Overwhelmed by things popping up all over the place?   Start here.

* [[/Installing/]] - The basic TiddlyWiki install couldn't be simpler - except with screenshots!
* [[/Writing/]] - using one - tags vs tiddlers
* [[/Extras/]] - extra functionality - useful plugins, extensions etc
* [[/Customizing/]] - different look - themes/skins

for developers:
* [[/Developing/]] - creating plugins etc, where to release/publicize it

== Description ==

[[SwisTrack/Components/BinaryDilation|Dilation]] is a method used in image processing to enlarge the white areas of the binary image. The structuring element is a 3x3 rectangle (using the 8 nearest pixels). Combining [[SwisTrack/Components/BinaryErosion|erosion]] and [[SwisTrack/Components/BinaryDilation|dilation]] allows you to perform opening and closing operations, which remove individual black or white pixels, or smooth out the borders.

It is generally adviced to use the same number of dilation and erosion interations.

== Input ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_Threshold.png]]

A binary (black and white) image.

== Output ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_Threshold.png]]

A binary (black and white) image.

== Parameters ==

=== Iterations ===

Number of dilations to apply on the image.</text>

== Description ==

This component will mask certain areas of your image, and therefore allow you to remove particles that are not in your area of interest (e.g. the arena).

== Input ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_BinaryMaskInput.png]]

A binary image.

== Output ==
[[Image:SwisTrack_BinaryMaskOutput.png]]

A binary image.

== Parameters ==

=== Mask image ===

A binary (black-and-white) image with the mask.

=== Mode ===

One of the following combination modes:
* ''Black -&gt; black'': Black pixels in the mask image will be black in the output image. All other pixels remain unchanged.
* ''White -&gt; white'': White pixels in the mask image will be white in the output image. All other pixels remain unchanged.
* ''Black -&gt; white'': Black pixels in the mask image will be white in the output image. All other pixels remain unchanged.
* ''White -&gt; black'': White pixels in the mask image will be black in the output image. All other pixels remain unchanged.</text>

      <comment>Whining about an error in the deletion algorithm</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The algorithm for removing an extreme element is just wrong, as far as I can see.  It &quot;percolates&quot; the hole down the tree, but not necessarily to the last element in the array, which is where it has to be for subsequent truncation of that array to work.  The algorithm as it stands will remove whatever is last in the array, regardless of where the hole is.  When the hole has not percolated to the last element of the array, an element will be lost, and another will be duplicated.

The correct algorithm is to start by put the last array element at the first position in the array and then percolate that down.  This guarantees the last element has been vacated, ready for truncation of the array.

Now the above problem seems to have been corrected, but the current pseudo-code for &quot;percolating&quot; elements downward on deletion is also completely wrong as of 2010/05/27.  The LEFT and RIGHT macros and the indexing in the loop assume an array indexed from 1 (as LEFT(0) = 0, i.e. itself) but the pseudo-code begins by assuming that the first entry is 0 as in C.  Additionally it will attempt to access elements with invalid indices in the case where the size after removal is 0.

I haven't examined the code for addition, but would not be confident about that either.


I agree that the extreme value removal algorithm is incorrect. See correct implementation here: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~holte/T26/heap-del.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!
Good luck! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 12:41, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

*Hello! I am accustomed with the Germans wikibooks. I will not work directly on the English text (my English is to bad). I put the translation of my German work on a special page. On this I write my translation. The other users can take it and create their own side. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] 18:30, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

==New Chords and Scales==

Just thought I would let you know that I have added a Scale Manual page to Wikibook: Guitar and I have also added a Technical Exercise page. I have put chord images in the Chord Reference section. I don't know if any these images would be useful to you but you can see them in the Wikimedia Commons categories [[commons:Category:Scales on guitar|Scales on guitar]] and [[commons:Category:Chords_in_guitar|Chords in guitar]]. Keep up the good work.
--[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|talk]]) 15:03, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

:Now I have noticed the new chords and scales. I consider to internationalize my chords and scales (fingering in 1234 or pimaq instead of zmrk (= German fingering)). And B for the German Note H. But this would be many work. In this context I will take over your cords. Every chord and scale should be in the SVG-format. Incscape is an useful free-ware-programm for vector-graphics. But easier to handle is Corel-Draw. (A bit older Version is adequate and cheap enough. Only a SVG-export should be available.) I'm going to have a look at your pages with your new chords. I will report back. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 12:31, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

:Thanks for the reply. I looked at the German Wikibook for the guitar and was very impressed by the layout and use of images. I'll find out about the SVG format and will try to get some software. 
--[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|talk]]) 16:09, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

== [[Songbook]] ==

I fixed the link on that page, but wanted to point out [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].  You'll want to use a slash (/) instead of a colon (:) for the book's pages. If you can ensure that every page (other than the title page) has {{tlx|BookCat}} on it, that would be great.  That will put all the book's pages into the proper category.  Welcome and happy editing. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:48, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

:I added the other categories you requested and you can find them shown in [[:Category:Songbook]]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:50, 10 August 2009 (UTC)
::Thank you for your efforts! New categories will be inserted automatically with the new songs. Now I know how it works. :o)) --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 21:25, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== Todo-upgrade ==

I notice you've recently been adding a second unnamed parameter to some {{tlx|todo}} transclusions.  The {{tlx|todo}} template doesn't use a parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, though.  Is there some deeper reason for doing this, that I'm missing?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:58, 13 August 2009 (UTC)
:Not yet! But it is in preparation. Currently, the additional parameter set does not harm anything. But it will allowsa specified todo-list for each book and each user. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 15:06, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

:: A thought, or perhaps a thought and a half:  Rather than requiring the name of each book to be hardwired into a todo list, it might make sense to build the tool so it deduces the book name using {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} (possibly combined with a test for NAMESPACE, if one wants different behavior for, say, userspace).  At least, it probably would make sense to use {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} as the parameter when calling {{tlx|todo}}, so that renaming the book wouldn't mess up its {{tlx|todo}}s.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:30, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

:::That makes sense! It would make the handling of the todo-list extremely simple. The parameter would only be used for username and separate books of several volumes. Good idea, I will convert it. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 17:50, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

::::You should file your categories in [[:Category:TODO]] and not [[:Category:Todo]] as the former already existed. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:20, 13 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::I have already noticed that, and I was already in the process to correct it. :) --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 19:24, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

===Syntax error===
Major and possible critical break. I only attempted to fix the first one and failed, it may be also defeating the propose of simplicity that such a template need to be usable by any editor. See todo boxes in [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/What is Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Legal Perspective]], the ones with todonote are the one broken, I've attempted to fix one of them but it didn't seem to work probably due to the use of the hyperlink inside. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:05, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
:@Panic Curly brackets were missing. Syntax is fixed. Sorry for the trouble --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 08:17, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
::Yup all seems right... Thanks for the prompt fix. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:16, 14 August 2009 (UTC)

== Writhe ==

Looking at your user page, I suspect [[wikt:writhe|writhe]] isn't the word you wanted.  (I'm wondering if this might be due to a [[w:false friend|false friend]].) --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:47, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
:It was a spelling mistake. Thanks for the tip --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 19:11, 14 August 2009 (UTC


== Test ==
;ROOTBOOKNAME:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}
;FULLBOOKNAME:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}
;ARTICLESPACE:{{ARTICLESPACE}}
;BOOKNAME:{{BOOKNAME}}

== Request of template NOTE==
Can you extend {{[[Template:NOTE]]}} (without any other change, ie: rounding of the box) so that it can replace the existing one without changes to the pages that uses it. So it generates a per book category (ie:Notes) similar to the TODO's ?
This would not change the functionality and would help editors.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:38, 21 August 2009 (UTC)
*Does this makes sense? Notes don't have to be processed. Or should the notes in the long run disappear? Serves the notes only as a working aid, or can it also be notes for the reader? Before I start working on this template, I want to make sure that the functionality not unnecessarily be inflated. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 21:16, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
**It enables a better coordination of the content on the book (avoid duplication and even point to a section that goes into a subject/book more in depth with that particular case), we have to take in consideration that sometimes people even leave comments on the main page, even if I have most of the pages of the books I'm working in my watchlist other editors (especially sporadic ones will not, or even readers, it is somehow expected that more experienced readers would like to browse all those asides/considerations on the book content). To be able to easily list all of them would be a boon. We can even argue that having other templates share these in book categories would increase awareness of the feature and the other inbook categories.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:02, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
***The programming is done! Unfortunately, yet the linked sites are not displayed, but I don't see any mistakes. I will check it tomorrow. (Now it's time to go to bed!) --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 3:05, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
:Now that I saw the implementation I understood your first question...
:Yup there is no useful reason to have the category show as a &quot;root&quot; category (like the Category:TODO).
:The idea was just to have a hidden subcategory inside the book category like the TODO/C++ Programming, probably named &quot;Notes and Observations&quot;. Where pages using the NOTE template in a book would be listed. I hadn't think further than that.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:23, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

:I was also looking on all the new possibilities of the TODO and think that the new category &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:TODO]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; shouldn't have pages listed but only subcategories, that would use only one page that would indeed show relevant information. (This would also remove the duplication of having TODO and TODO/BOOKTITLE as categories on a page (and having the more relevant to users and editors of a particular book set as a hidden category). Having only one show could also be improved, can't the TODO category on a particular book be made to open directly that TODO/BOOKTITLE page ? (less verbosity for example [[Animating Weapons for Counter-Strike Source/Draw Animation]] using NOTE)
:Another issue that I now see is with the categories and the possibility of signing the templates uses. It does generate (ie: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:TODO/Mjchael]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) categories. Because not all are signed and the signature isn't obligatory (couldn't since the use of the template is now so extensive, correcting that would be an huge task), it really doesn't serve any real purpose (the category), signatures would always be an helpful addition but since it can't be made obligatory the concept fails. A different concept would be generating a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:TODO/Unsigned]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for unsigned TODOs/NOTEs is it possible ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:52, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
**In the German wikibooks I work with the category:todo and the category:todo-booktitle. The first one gives an overview about all projects, and the second one helps me by working on a single book. But we don't create automatically  categories. Except the main-category Todo. However the opportunity is given to customize the todoes. But no one is forced to use it. I operate readily with these both options. Maybe we should delete the automatically creating of sub-categories. Should they be used, then they can still be created manually. Maybe I should think it over, if I can program the template in that way, that only those who want it, will get an automatic sub-category of the book. The subcategories TODO/username are used for teamwork. Shall the note-template be reduced? (Excuse please, if my English should be wrong.) --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 14:23, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
=== my solution ===
The automatically creating of categories by the Notes is deleted. Notes from the author to the reader don't need any categories. With one or more optional parameter of the bookname or an username a &quot;note&quot; can be customized (in case of comments about the book or the chapter). Then it will be an instruction to do something or to fix something. In that case a note is treated as a Todo. And only in this case a category will be created --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 3:50, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

:Ok I tweaked it a little one thing thought I would like that the note should be obligatory (there is no purpose on having a NOTE without text and today there aren't any notes without a body). The unsigned doesn't work well I have also attempted to use
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexist: page title | value if exists | value if doesn't exist }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; so that the new listings and links on the heading would be optional (this is important since &lt;nowiki&gt;__HIDDENCAT__&lt;/nowiki&gt; is needed on the categories pages).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:45, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
:PS: Notes are only related to the content not to pending actions by editors.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:47, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
:Pending issues. [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries/Configuring Visual Studio]] uses one NOTE and I signed it it should be in Category:C++ Programming/Notes not in Category:C++ Programming/Notes/Unsigned and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if: {{{3|}}} |{{#ifeq: {{{example|no}}} | yes |[[Category:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Notes|{{PAGENAME}}]] }}|[[Category:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Notes/Unsigned]] }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; should test if there is a signature and select one of the categories, for what I understand ifeq is needed only to prevent the example to use a category.
:Using #ifexist: would resolve these redlinks (with the considerations talked above) [[Help:Starting a new page or book]]. Read the explanation on the template page (#ifexists could also verify that the user that signed does exits by checking his talk page, since those are generally created first) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:29, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
::a signatur can be affix by the normal text on the first parameter
&lt;pre&gt;{{note|text... --~~~~}}&lt;/pre&gt;
::on many notes a signator isn't needed. So a programming of a signatur-check would complicate these matters unnecessarily. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 21:46, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
:::The idea was to duplicate the functionality of the the TODO (the rational for defending the need for a signer is valid in both for the same reasons), if a need arises and the person who affixed the information needs to be contacted it can be a very complicated task in a busy page (lots of edits), indeed on notes this is less relevant as the person adding the note also must have done some other editing work to be adding a note about a specific exception or related issue that can't be directly included, even so there are instances of that occurring.
:::One should remember that signatures inside the book content should not be acceptable and will create confusion because of the practice of not altering signed posts/comments. 
:::Did you attempt anywhere to put #ifexist to work this would also solve that extra load of work you add on the TODO template (you had to create a lot of Category pages), that may or may not be useful (due to the already existing uses of the templates for instance in one book I make extensive use of them but I'm working alone there for years now (The P2P book), that would permit the book communities to make use of the function as they see fit.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:05, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
:::PS: If you don't mind move all this discussion to the Template Talk page, there may be editors that are now out of the loop and see now red links on the top their books. I'm watching there also so to us there shouldn't be a issue and this will also alleviate your talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:05, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
::::I work with the template TODO on the German guitar-book with different volumes of a guitar-school. There I use several parameter for the main book &quot;guitar&quot; the sub-volume &quot;campfire-diploma&quot; my todo-list &quot;mjchael&quot; and sometimes another &quot;co-author&quot;. And sometimes it also affects &quot;music-theory&quot; or &quot;songbook&quot;. Thus more than one parameter makes sense. Disclosure of an author in the main book is not habit of wiki. This is good manners at the talks. But authors will be identified by the history, ans this should be enough. The TODO-template creates only one category per book, or at the most one more for each sub-volume. And only one category will be created for an user. Thats all, and it's rather easy and comprehensible. The administration is extremely simple, and uncommonly practical. A greater degree of functionality complicates unnecessarily the matter. You must also think of the inexperienced user and author. I fear that every new features could make the template &quot;note&quot; unusable or impractical for each task for whatever they may be used. You should really consider what is actually needed. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 08:43, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 : Accelerating Wikibooks : Would like to discuss! ==


Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

== [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology]] ==

I know it's been mentioned twice before, on [[Talk:A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology]], but this really is outside the [[WB:WIW|scope of Wikibooks]]. Please make an effort with the rest of the contributors to make sure that this gets turned into something other than a dictionary or glossary, as these are not what Wikibooks is for. If something isn't done to turn it into a textbook, someone will eventually put it up for deletion.

:It looks like you've done some good work trying to bring this book back within project scope. Thanks! You might want to consider moving the terminology section to an appendix and creating chapters for the other content, which should be the focus of any further expansion. Remember, a glossary must be secondary and auxiliary to the main text. If you need help, you can ask on my talk page, or at [[WB:SLP]].

As the name implies, TiddlyWiki takes its primary inspiration from the kind of interactive, more or less &quot;social&quot; web site, that has come to be known as a wiki. The original concept was defined and demonstrated in the mid-1990's by Ward Cunningham for the purpose of building what he called the [http://c2.com/ppr/index.html Portland Pattern Repository] and it's rather more broadly scoped derivative forum, the [http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb WikiWikiWeb]. The latter name was obviously inspired by the still fairly &quot;hot&quot; new concept called the World Wide Web, while Cunningham explains the 'WikiWiki' part as being a Hawaiian word for 'quick'. While certainly a forum in nature, it was distinctively different from the bulletin board services and the Usenet forums that pre-dated the WWW architecture and its defining protocols, HTTP and HTML. The design of the WikiWikiWeb - and most of the solutions that have followed - builds on both these protocols: HTTP as the way the web browser speaks to a server somewhere on the internet, and HTML as the language that the web browser interprets as defining the structure of the content. To achieve their goals, early &quot;wiki&quot; engines focused on creating rather simple server-side solutions for letting the users build the content directly through the web browser. Ward Cunningham's original idea made a virtue out of this simplicity, which relied on the users to take care that the content stayed on topic and continued to evolve in a positive direction, despite a total lack of hard measures to protect the content, they were building.

One of the obvious characteristics of the WikiWikiWeb, the extensive use of hyperlinks, was of course nothing new. Cunningham relates that he was inspired by the HyperCard application developed by Apple Computer for their Macintosh PC's in the mid-1980's. What he did was to define the convention that writing a word using CamelCase, often by SmashingWordsTogetherLikeLhis would automatically make it a link to a page by that name.  Strictly speaking, this mechanism commonly known as WikiLinks isn't entirely automatic, the server takes care of generating the HTML that it sends to the browser in such a way that it works, but this is still a novel idea compared to placing the chore on the shoulders of the writer.  An aspect of this idea is that if a Page named TiddlyWiki exists on the site, and an author of another pages writes TiddlyWiki, not really knowing that this page exists, the rendered page will have the link all the same.

TiddlyWiki adopts this idea, but restricts the scope of the automatic linking to be within the HTML document itself, as we shall see.

===TiddlyWiki compared to MediaWiki===
TiddlyWiki isn’t like a traditional MediaWiki or Confluence wiki which requires a database server and PHP in order to run. TiddlyWiki is a self contained .html file that you can use in any modern web browser even without internet access. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/26515/build-your-own-personal-wiki-accessible-from-any-pc/ Build Your Own Personal Wiki Accessible from Any PC] - How-To Geek&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its big brother, MediaWiki (the web program that wikipedia runs), TiddlyWiki’s core trait is that it supports simple formatting syntax, and simple links to pages within itself. If you’re in wikipedia, and you’re viewing a page called Piano, and there is a reference to “Mozart”, instead of having to create a hyperlink containing “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart,” all you have to do is write “&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Mozart]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;”.  TiddlyWiki has a similar simplified syntax. &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.flapdoodlenow.com/tiddlywiki/ TiddlyWiki] - FlapdoodleNow&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Scientific Method ==

Welcome to the wikibook about the scientific method. This book is a wiki, and may be freely edited by all users. This book is released under the terms of the GFDL.

{{GFDL}}

== Who is this book for? ==

This book is for any person interested in learning about the scientific method. No background in science or mathematics is required to read and understand this text. Some of the historical chapters will discuss some philosophical topics that might be confusing to people with no familiarity with philosophy, but an attempt will be made to make all sections accessible.

== What will this book cover? ==

This book is going to cover the scientific method, its history, and its applications. This book will not attempt to cover all of science, nor will it provide technical instruction in any particular branch of science. This book is mostly historical and philosophical, not technical.

== How is this book organized? ==

This book will be organized into three primary sections. The first section will discuss the history of the scientific method, and the philosophical and scientific advancements that let to it's modern form. The second section will talk about how to apply the method to your inquiries, including a discussion of some common terms and tools. The third and final section will take a look at some specific experiments in various fields of science, to demonstrate how the method has been used to make major breakthroughs.

== What are the prerequisites? ==

There are no specific prerequisites to reading and understanding this book. However, because the subject matter will be focused on history (especially European history) and philosophy, readers may find some benefit to reading books on those subjects first. This is not strictly required, however.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

== [[w:Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] and the Discovery of The Cells ==

Prior to Leeuwenhoek, there had been little or notion of the idea that microscopic living things could exist. Part of this was due to the fact that most microscopes of the time were not strong enough to see them, though they did exist &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.euronet.nl/users/warnar/leeuwenhoek.html Microscopes in Leeuwenhoek's time] &lt;/ref&gt;. However, Leeuwenhoek was skillful enough to make such a powerful microscope, and observed protazoans in pond water &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1593.html Leeuwenhoek's observations] &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Not only did he observe them, but he also was able to ''deduce'' that they were living because they were motile, and only living things have the ablility to move by their own power. Leeuwenhoek's deductions, and his creative use of technology to explore new avenues, led to the recognition of cells as the building blocks of life, which would have profound influence on biological study and knowledge.

== [[w:Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] and the Death of Spontaneous Generation ==

Before Louis Pasteur and other scientists proved them wrong, the mainstream belief in science was that living things arose spontaneously from non-living things. This was particularly true of the &quot;cells&quot; which Leuvenhok discovered, because the cells were comparatively simple and therefore it appeared logical that they arose naturally from their environments &lt;ref&gt; [http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio114/spontgen.htm spontaneous generation] &lt;/ref&gt;. Another scientist named [[w:Lazzaro Spallanzani|Lazzaro Spallanzani]] had previously proven that many bacteria (though not all) are killed by boiling and, if sealed from the air, they will not regrow in the container &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.kent.k12.wa.us/staff/timlynch/sci_class/chap01/spallanzani.html Boiling kills microbes] &lt;/ref&gt;. However, contemporaries refused to deny spontaneous generation, saying that since the organisms spontaneously arose from ''air'', sealing off the container made Lazzaro's hypothesis invalid.

Pasteur put this to rest by designing an experiment. He designed an apparatus, called a ''swan-neck flask'', in which a sterile liquid was exposed to the air but no bacteria could reach it. Bacteria and the dust they lived on were trapped in the swan neck, and sterile air reached the liquid. Since the liquid did not become contaminated with bacteria, Pasteur proved that they did not spontaneously arise from the air. This led to the death of the theory of spontaneous generation and to further studies about how bacteria ''do'' reproduce. These studies are important because they have lead to an understanding of how many antibiotics, including [[w:Penicillin|Penicillin]], work.

== [[w:Robert Koch|Robert Koch]] and his Four Postulates ==

Before scientists like Pasteur and Koch arrived on the scientific scene to prove them wrong, many scientists had false beliefs concerning the nature of disease. One of these beliefs was that infectious bacteria spontaneously generated in a human body as a result of diseases &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bact.wisc.edu/Microtextbook/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=283&amp;allpages=1&amp;theme=Printer Historical beliefs about diseases] &lt;/ref&gt; . While Pasteur proved that spontaneous generation was impossible in the air, Koch devised a scheme by which the cause of diseases in people (and animals) could be experimentally tested.

His scheme revolved around the notion that, if a person is able to prove that one organism is common to ''all cases'' of a disease, and if it can be shown that no outside factor causes the disease, then the organism must, indeed, cause the disease. To make it experimentally rigorous, Koch needed a control scheme, so he devised a set of &quot;postulates&quot; to prove that the organism in question actually caused the disease &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.microbiologybytes.com/introduction/b2.html Koch's Postulates] &lt;/ref&gt;:

# The organism had to be present in any case of the illness in question.
# It had to be possible to take the organism ''out of the patient'' and purify it so that only one species was present. This prevents the possibility that an organism other than the one being observed actually causes the disease.
# The now-purified organism had to cause the disease when injected into a healthy animal. This prevents the possibility of something ''before'' the bacteria causing the disease, and debunks the possibility that the toxins came first and caused formation of the bacteria.
# As a final check, one must be able to re-isolate the organism from the newly-sick animal.

Koch used this to prove that ''Bacillus anthracis'' causes anthrax &lt;ref&gt; Madigan M; Martinko J (editors). (2005). Brock Biology of Microorganisms, 11th ed., Prentice Hall. ISBN 0-13-144329-1. &lt;/ref&gt;, and it has been used to establish the causes of a large number of other bacterial diseases as well.

==[[w:Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] and the Periodic Table ==

The Periodic Table is an example of '''bringing order''' to a large amount of information that may seem chaotic. Before it was developed, trends between similar compounds were more difficult or impossible to visualize. There are a large number of properties which can be roughly predicted from trends in the periodic table including:

# How the elements react
# What the elements will react with
# How big the atoms are
# How the electrons are organized around the atoms.

There are several others properties that are also predicted well from the table. Mendeleev was not the first to ''notice'' the patterns but he was the first to bring an organizational scheme to the scientific community in a way that people would accept his work. In particular, he did several things differently from his predecessors:

# He '''chose different patterns''' on which to base his ordering scheme. Previous attempts at organizing the elements met with some failure because they were based on increasing atomic weight, and when two dissimilar compounds fell in the same column of the table, they went with the order based on weights, not based on properties &lt;ref&gt; Asimov, Isaac. ''Asimov's Guide to Science''. New York: Basic Books, 1972, 230.&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Mendeleev not only switched around molecular weights so that the properties of elements in the same column were similar, he also left spaces for undiscovered compounds when there was no in a reasonable weight range. In this way he was '''forward-thinking''', which left room for later discoveries.&lt;ref&gt; [[http://aip.org/history/curie/periodic.htm History of the Periodic Table]] &lt;/ref&gt;
# He was able to convince people of the value of his scheme after several of the elements for which he had left &quot;holes&quot; were discovered.

This example shows that science benefits a great deal from the ability to ''organize information''. Organizing information is necessary in order to generalize what is known and to generate new theories from the observed trends, and is a key step in hypothesis generation and testing.

== [[w:Robert Boyle|Boyle]] and his Law ==

Boyle, back in the 17th century, helped to prove that gasses have weight and that their density depends on how much pressure is applied to them. In particular he discovered Boyle's Law, which roughly says that if you double the amount of pressure applied to a gas (at constant temperature), its volume will be halved &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/boyle.html Boyle's Law demo] &lt;/ref&gt;. 

He did this by making use of a [[w:Manometer|manometer]], which is a U-shaped instrument that measures pressure by the height of a liquid that is displaced. He capped one end and poured some mercury into the other end, thus trapping air in the middle. Then he measured the pressure, and added enough mercury to halve the volume of air present in the tube &lt;ref&gt; [http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/87/4/1543 Description of Boyle's measurement methods] &lt;/ref&gt;. He then measured the pressure at that instant, and through many measurements, showed that volume and pressure are inversely related.

This example shows that sometimes a scientist must be quite clever to achieve a new discovery. Many groundbreaking experiments, including this one, involved the use of fairly new inventions or apparatuses which cleverly could be used to measure quantities. It is only through measurement that hypotheses can be proved.

== [[w:Amedeo Avogadro|Avogadro]] and the nature of atoms and molecules ==

Before Avagadro made a keen, unifying observation to the theory of gasses, scientists weren't sure how to usefully define atoms and molecules, and therefore had difficulties measuring the molecular weight of compounds. However, Avagadro was able to remedy this by hypothesizing that any gas occupying the same volume at the same temperature and pressure has the same number of ''molecules'', not the same number of ''atoms'', and that these molecules were made of combined elements &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/periodic/avogadro.html Avagadro's theory] &lt;/ref&gt;. Scientists were later able to prove that this is true by using the theory to measure atomic weights more accurately than had been possible before, and then combining them to yield the weights of known molecular compounds.

Avagadro's '''theory''' was important because it reconciled a couple of other theories: Dalton's theory that everything is made of atoms, and Gay-Lussac's observation that the volume of gasses in a gas-phase reaction changes in proportion to the molecules of gas consumed or generated &lt;ref&gt; [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/LawofCombiningVolumes.html Guy-Lussac's Law] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/AvogadrosHypothesis.html Avagadro's Hypothesis] &lt;/ref&gt;. This type of unification is central to the advancement of science.

== Pasteur and Enantiomers of Tartaric Acid ==

Among his many accomplishments, Pasteur was one of the first people to discover that certain molecules have a property called '''chirality'''. A molecule is considered chiral if its mirror image or ''enantiomer'' is different from the original molecule. A typical physical analogue to this is a glove: you cannot put the right glove on your left hand because the thumb is the &quot;wrong way&quot; (unless they're specifically designed to fit both, in which case the glove is ''achiral'').

Pasteur's experiment involved separating the enantiomers of tartaric acid from a mixture containing both. Now, enantiomers are not in general easy to separate from each other because they usually have identical physical and chemical properties, but tartaric acid is unusual because it forms crystals which are visibly different from one another in their direction &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/Pasteur.html Pasteur's Experiment] &lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, Pasteur was able to visually separate the two enantiomers.

Once he separated, he drew upon the work of Jean Biot and shined light through each enantiomer. Biot had previously shown that, due to some unknown physical pheonomenon, some substances rotated light in one direction, some on another direction, and some did not at all. Pasteur '''hypothesized''' that this was due to the presence of the asymmetric enantiomers, and when he tested his theory he turned out to be right.

It is now known that many compounds are achiral due to the nature of carbon-carbon bonds. In particular, if a carbon has four different substituents attached to it, that carbon is chiral &lt;ref&gt; http://www.chemguide.co.uk/basicorg/isomerism/optical.html#top Chiral molecules] &lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur's experiment helped in both deducing structures of chiral compounds and in spurring experiments regarding their biological significance.

== Science ==

Modern science is broken into so many divergent branches that it's almost inconceivable to think that they are all related. However, despite the varied subject matter, all scientific disciplines are tied together through their use of a common method, the scientific method. The scientific method is mostly a philosophical exercise that is used to refine human knowledge.

== Precepts of the Method ==

Different disciplines may employ the general scientific method in slightly different ways, but the major precepts are the same:

;Verifiability:Any result should be provable. Any person (with the proper training and equipment) must be able to reproduce and verify any scientific result.
;Predictability:Any scientific theory should enable us to make predictions of future events. The precision of these predictions is a measure of the strength of the theory.
{{Wikipedia|Falsifiability}}
;Falsifiability:Falsifiability is an important notion in science and the philosophy of science. For an assertion to be falsifiable it must be logically possible to make an observation or do a physical experiment that would show the assertion to be false. It is important to note that &quot;falsifiable&quot; does ''not'' mean false. Some philosophers and scientists, most notably Karl Popper, have asserted that no empirical hypothesis, proposition, or theory can be considered scientific if no observation could be made which might contradict it. Note that if an assertion is falsifiable its negation can be unfalsifiable, and vice-versa. For example, &quot;God does exist&quot; is unfalsifiable, while its negation &quot;God doesn't exist&quot; is falsifiable. Any scientific theory must have criteria under which it is deemed invalid. Should predictions and verifications fail completely, the theory must be abandoned.
;Fairness:Data needs to be analyzed as a whole or as a representative sample. We cannot pick and choose what data to keep and what to discard. Also, we cannot focus our attention on data that proves or disproves a particular hypothesis, we must account for all data even if it invalidates the hypothesis.

== Stages of the Method ==

We will get into more detail in the following chapters, but the basic steps to the scientific method are as follows:

#Observe a natural phenomenon
#Make a hypothesis about the phenomenon
#Test the hypothesis

Once the hypothesis has been tested, if it is true we can work to find more evidence, or we can find counter-evidence. If the hypothesis is false, we create a new hypothesis and try again.

The important thing to note here is that the scientific process is never-ending. No result is ever considered to be perfect, and at no point do we stop looking at evidence.

=== Example: Newton and Einstein ===

Isaac Newton, a brilliant physicist, developed a number of laws of motion and mechanics that we still use today. For many many years the laws of Newton were considered to be absolute fact. Many years later, a physicist known as Albert Einstein noticed that in certain situations Newton's laws were incorrect. Especially in cases where the object under consideration is moving at speed nearing the speed of light.Einstein helped to create a new theory, the theory of relativity, that corrected those errors. Even though Einstein was a brilliant scientist, modern physicists are developing new theories because there are some small errors in Einstein's theories. Each new generation of physicists helps to reduce the errors of the previous generations.

=== The Complete Method ===

The complete scientific method, as it is generally known is:

# Define the question
# Gather data and observations
# Form hypothesis
# Perform experiment and collect data
# Interpret data and draw conclusions 

Notice that the first step is to define the question. In other words, we can not look for an answer if we do not know what the question is first. Once we have the question, we need to observe the situation and gather appropriate data. We need to gather ''all'' data, not just selectively acquire data to support a particular hypothesis, or to make analysis more simple. 

Once we have our data, we can analyze it to determine a hypothesis. In many cases a hypothesis is a mathematical relationship between the data points. However, it is not necessary to use mathematics at any point with the scientific method. Once we have our hypothesis, we need to test it. Testing is a complicated process, and will be the focus of the second section in this book. We collect data from our tests, and attempt to fit that data to our hypothesis. At this point, we need to ask, is the hypothesis right or wrong? Or, if it is not completely wrong nor completely right, we need to ask if this hypothesis is better then the previous hypothesis? If this hypothesis is not quite right, we can modify it and perform the tests again.

Once we have completed tests and verified our hypothesis, we need to draw conclusions from that. What does our hypothesis mean, in the bigger picture? What kinds of relationships between the data can we find? What further problems does this hypothesis cause? What would it take to prove this hypothesis wrong?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If 
: The Output Voltage is V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
: The Input Voltage is V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
: ω = 2πf
: The Impedance of Resistor : Z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = R
: The Impedance of Capacitor : Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 / jωC
: The Impedance of Inductor : Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + jωL
: The Respond Frequency is the Frequency when Capacitor or Inductor starts to React or conduct current : ω&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
: ω : 0 → ω&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; : Low Frequency Range
: ω : ω&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; → Infinity  : High Frequency Range

==Resistor==
The Voltage or Current of the resistor does not change with frequency
or time only the magnitude change

&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i - I*Z_R = V_i - I*R &lt;/math&gt;

==Capacitor==
The Voltage of the Capacitor lags the applied Voltage one angle of 90°

The Capacitor has a respond frequency equal to 1 / RC (The frequency when Capacitor starts to react i.e. starts to conduct ). And the time it takes to reach this frequency equals RC

The Voltage or Current of the Capacitor will change with frequency
or time 

&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i - I * Z_C &lt;/math&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - I * [R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 / jωC] 



{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ω = 0 !! ω = 0 → 1 / RC !! ω =  1 / RC !! ω = 1 / RC → !! ω = infinity
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0 &lt;/math&gt;|| O || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i &lt;/math&gt; || Mo || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The circuit of the Capacitor is more stable at high frequency . Frequencies from the response frequency 1 / RC to infinity

==Inductor==
The Voltage of the Inductor lead the applied Voltage one angle of 90°

The Inductor has a respond frequency equal to R / L . And the time it takes to reach this frequency equals L / R

The Voltage or Current of the Inductor will change with frequency
or time 

&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i - I * Z_L &lt;/math&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - I * [R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - jωL] 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ω = 0 !! ω = 0 → 1 / RC !! ω =  1 / RC !! ω = 1 / RC → !! ω = infinity
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i &lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o &lt; V_i &lt;/math&gt;  || &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The circuit of the Inductor is more stable at low frequency (The Voltage of the Inductor Does change with Frequency). Frequencies from zero up to the response frequency R / L

With the right connection of the Resistor and Capacitor or Inductor the circuit can be used as a Low Pass Filter or High Pass Filter

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

== Early Science ==

Some of the earliest science was a combination of practical wisdom, basic arithmetic, observations, and mysticism. Many early civilizations used supernaturalism to explain natural phenomena, which helps to explain why these early civilizations had such a broad and varied mythos. Every new phenomena required the creation of a new god, goddess, spirit, or demon for explanation.

The sun was not a burning sphere in space, but instead it was the god Apollo on a burning, flying chariot. Desert mirages were not an optical and psychological occurrence, it was a trick played by an evil jinn. Natural disasters represented the wrath of an angered deity.

== Greece and Rome ==

The rise of Greece and Rome created an environment where philosophical minds could consider the natural world more readily and easily than was possible in previous times. The philosophical tradition began with Thales of Melitus, who posited that the world was made of water. While it's obvious to us now that the world is not made of water, it does give insight into the conceptual framework that the earliest scientists had. It is clear that world is not immutable, that is that it changes over time. Water is also known to take multiple forms of ice (solid) and vapor (gas).

After Thales, there were a long line of scientific thinkers: Anaximenes (who held that the world was made of air, not water), Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Democritus and Euclid. Aristotle, one of the last great Greek philosophers was said to know all of science by the time he died.

== Dark Ages ==

After the fall of the Roman empire, Europe descended into a period known as the dark ages. Religious oppression and oppression by feudal lords led to a sharp decline in scientific thought.
then no one knows!!

== Renaissance ==

The renaissance, or the &quot;rebirth&quot; was a period where great thinkers challenged the power of the church, and opened up the way for science to grow once again. Much of science at the beginning of the renaissance was centered around observational science, such as astronomy (with Galileo, Copernicus, and Kepler). However, Mathematics was going through a rebirth of it's own, and many great thinkers were beginning formalize mathematical tools and apply them to physical problems. Rene Descartes, a preeminent philosopher, scientist and mathematician created the first version of the scientific method, and employed it to study various subjects in science and philosophy.

Best known of this period, although certainly not the only great thinker was Isaac Newton, who used the new mathematics of Calculus to unify the study of physics and astronomy.

== Industrial Revolution ==

The industrial revolution was a time when machines were used to a much greater extent then they had ever been. Many processes were automated through the use of mechanical machines, and many great inventions, including the steam engine, were created. It was during this time that many great scientists began to study electricity and magnetism, effects that were poorly understood and not explained by the theories of newton.

== Modern Science ==

While the world of the industrial revolution was about mechanics and machines, the modern world has been dominated by the study and application of electricity. Starting with the equations of Maxwell, many great thinkers such as Heaviside, Edison, Tesla, and Hertz began to invent new technologies that we still use today: Telephones, Electrical power distribution, and electrical communications. With the advent of the vacuum tube and silicone transistor, the computer revolution has pushed science and technology further and faster than it has ever been.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Understanding non-autistic thought processes =
* NOTE:  This section does NOT explain everything that happens in SOCIETY, but it goes a long way to understanding SOCIAL situations.
* It is impossible to overstate the importance of self confidence in this world.
* Self confidence is invaluable in at least three aspects of life:  attracting partners, dealing with people in general and in personal wellbeing.
* Understanding the role of self confidence is possible in the context of this framework, and although I think that it is true, it doesn't actually matter whether it is or not since it approximates non-autistic behaviour very well:
** Self confidence is a huge biological factor in animal mating rituals.
** Animals within a single sex of a species will compete amongst themselves by challenging each other in various ways to determine who dominates and submits to who.  The end result of this is the &quot;pecking order&quot;.
** Being high in a pecking order involves having few leaders and tends to increase &quot;alpha partner&quot; neurotransmitters that make an animal much more confident.
** Being low in a pecking order involves having many leaders and tends to cause more stress which decreases confidence and also shortens an animals life.
** Being confident is hard to fake since being bold tends to attract negative attention from the competition and may lead to fights.
** The opposite sex are attracted to the most confident since confidence is a key indicator of being the best of the competition.
** Since the opposite sex are attracted to the most confident and therefore successful within the pecking order, the offspring tend to get better DNA, and the species benefits.
** A females hormonal cycles make her more aggressive during the time that she is ready to mate, adding yet another confidence test in the case of a male.
** A male will tend to have these hormones most of the time, forcing a female to be much more selective.
** In species such as ours where the offspring are nurtured and raised by at least one parent, strength of character, generousity and sensitivity are huge factors in attractiveness.
** In species such as ours where raising offspring is a two parent job, compatibility and loyalty are also huge factors in attractiveness since the parents may be in each others company for quite some time.
** These rules seem to apply even when people are avoiding having children or only interested in casual sex.  It simply appears to be so instinctive to non-autistic people that they don't even think about it.
* In this context, the following should be clearer:
** Most human endeavours and behaviours that are not related to survival are probably related to climbing the pecking order so that the individual can build self confidence and become more attractive.
** Clubs and sports are examples of social hierarchies that are often designed for the purpose of having a pecking order that can be challenged.
** Financial success, popularity and charity are often also social status games, though sometimes they have more to do with survival.
** Non-autistic people often believe something largely on the basis of how confidently it has been said.  This is a powerful rule.  None of the famous leaders or despots of the world would have gotten as far as they did without having consistently displayed an air of rock solid self belief.
** People often do things in personal interaction that are designed to test or demolish a persons confidence or challenge the pecking order.
** People also often use an attack on peoples confidence to communicate dissatisfaction.  If the message isn't communicated properly, the situation can escalate.
** People often resort to telling a white lie or a &quot;hint&quot; rather than a truth which may appear to be an attack on someone's confidence.  Considering this to be nice is probably a good idea.
** The concept of equality (or equity) that autistic people seem to hold so dearly often simply doesn't exist in non-autistic people, despite platitudes to the contrary.
** Presenting an air of confidence while assertively avoiding conflict can be a good strategy for surviving social situations generally.
** Presenting an air of confidence while assertively deflecting challenges can be a good strategy for thriving in some social situations.
** Initiating and winning challenges is a difficult thing for NT's to do, and is a recipe for disaster for autistic spectrum people.
** To initiate a challenge and not win is to lose.  Since it is far too easy to be seen as initiating a challenge when trying to negotiate serious issues with other people, it is very important to make sure the other person knows that you're trying to negotiate rather than challenge.
** Small talk and body language help to avoid many potential conflicts which may come about according to these rules by communicating the basics about where people are coming from.
** Self confidence in and of itself enhances a persons ability to function effectively.
** To interact with people you like, it is often necessary to be part of a social hierarchy with people you don't like.
** There are men in this world who have no claim to any form of social status and whose confidence comes directly from being able to pull women.
* The difference between self esteem and self confidence is subtle yet significant.
** Self confidence (or [[w:self_efficacy]]) is what you have when you believe that you can survive the situation you are in satisfactorily.
** [[w:Self_esteem]] is what you have when you believe that your life is valuable and worth respecting.
* Where does the autistic spectrum mind fit into all of this?  Perhaps we are stuck in &quot;survival mode&quot;.  Perhaps we are capable of finding fulfilment in things other than sex and relationships.  Perhaps we are trying to play the social status game by developing passions to share with others.
== The Physiology and Energy of Self Confidence ==
* Lack of self confidence can also be observerd at physiological and energetic levels. Therefore the question of self-confidence can also be addressed at these respective levels. Actions than can be taken are numerous, and can include sport, art, meditation, nutrition, complementary and alternative medicine that understand correlation between self-confidence and physiology and/or energy.
== Another way to understand the social status game ==
* Just as in strategy games, the social status game has complex strategy, or unwritten rules which all stem from the simple idea that every player is out to win the game according to a specific measurement of success defined and limited by relatively simple written rules.
* In the social status game, the measurement and limitations seem to be part of [[w:Sexual_selection]].  To win in the game, one must mate as often as possible with appropriate partner/s.  The implication of this is that one must BE the best possible mating partner that they can be as often as possible.  In turn, one must perpetually be displaying examples of these characteristics.
* In fact, when people talk about maturity and development, they're usually talking about how far someone has progressed in this game.
* Examples of how these basic rules and goals end up translating into life's unwritten rules:
** Attractive people are nice to be close to and associated with and are therefore clean and otherwise physically attractive to appropriate partners.
** By being accepted by friends who are fellow competitors in the social status game, one gets to practice and display strength of character, loyalty, and other characteristics required to be accepted rather than dominated by such people.
** By helping others &quot;less fortunate&quot;, one displays generousity.  If done appropriately, this displays sensitivity.  Put-downs often come under this rule.
** By having a good income and by being independent, one displays the ability to support a family.
** By having a better education and better marketable skills, one has access to better income opportunities.
** By being good at sports and by being able to resolve conflicts without losing face, one displays the ability to defend a family.
** By putting others slightly above or equal in the pecking order down, rank can be gained when swapping places in the pecking order.  Done correctly, this should look like &quot;helping someone less fortunate&quot; or &quot;resolving conflict without losing face&quot; otherwise, this can look like bullying, which it often is, and backfire.
** By finding and maintaining an &quot;image&quot; and manner that appropriately reflects ones personality, one helps potential partners determine compatibility.
** By being subtle and discreet about your goals in this game and not promiscuous, one displays the characteristics required to remain loyal in long term child rearing relationships.
** Since equality/equivalence only ever exists between people who haven't determined who dominates in the pecking order, &quot;difficult&quot; children and other inferiors are always trying to assert leadership and the remedy is to show them who's boss.  When this doesn't work, they have a disorder or an attitude problem.
** By being inventive and creative in such a way that the world becomes a better place, one almost by necessity has to worry less about personal gain and the social status game and ends up displaying only some of the characteristics of good mating partners and perhaps eccentricity, arrogance, mind blindness and lack of situational awareness.
** By going into un-necessary detail on any given subject, one fools with the plot mode picture building process, displays a lack of connection with their conversation partner and appears to be self absorbed.
** By playing with friends and losing, one gets a chance to learn from their mistakes, develop the characteristics of good mating partners and &quot;mature&quot;.  Therefore, over-reacting is missing the point of play.
** By playing with friends and winning, one gets a chance to prove ones value in their friends development.  Therefore, playing too competitively and lording it over the loser is inappropriate.
** By having friends that are not at the same maturity level as ones self, one does not contribute and benefit contstructively from the relationship, therefore one has to &quot;move on&quot;.
** By being a happy person generally, one displays comfort with ones place in the world, an ability to survive difficult situations and a readiness to mate.
** By being popular with, and &quot;acquiring&quot; potential partners, one has achieved the primary goal of the social status game, and therefore has little need to build further status.  The object now becomes to put the characteristics displayed into effect.
** Since most children will grow up to marry and have children of their own, &quot;development&quot; is about accomplishing this goal and &quot;maturity&quot; is a measure of success.
** XXX This subsection needs to be rewritten and expanded into a book.  The idea that non-autistic people are out to a&gt; survive, and b&gt; mate is the beginning of EVERY social story that is likely to help autistic spectrum people understand the non-autistic world.
* The subtlety here is that &quot;displaying&quot; is just as much about subconsciously proving to ones self where they stand in the pecking order.  This is then reflected to potential partners by way of an outward display of confidence.
* The trick to understanding this game is that (particularly non-autistic) people tend to assume everyone is striving to play it ALL THE TIME.  Every single action performed by everybody must somehow be an attempt to maintain or improve ones position on the ladder legitimately or illegitimately or to &quot;cash in&quot; and mate, or to survive so as to be able to do so, or to give in because one is unable to do so.
* One thing that I find helps me understand why NT's don't consider the practice in the last statement unethical is that their one and only philosophy is that EVERYBODY is playing social status games, and that kinda makes sense ethically.  If everyone is playing social status games to win, then making them lose is OK.
* Please don't take this section too seriously, and if you do, try to read it constructively.  Please also note that this section is likely to be a recipe for becoming a sociopath, if taken to heart.
* Personal observations:
** When I first observed autistic spectrum peoples behaviour as a child, it was as if they appeared to be more &quot;real&quot; than the non-autistic people, who seemed rather like ghosts or half people to me.  I imagine that this was because my mirror neurons were firing for the non-autistic people.
** When I adopt a mindset in which everything happening around me socially must somehow be related to the primary goal as stated above, I can often work out where non-autistic people are coming from fairly quickly (not real time) and the ghost people are a lot more real to me.  This makes it much easier to communicate with them too, but when I want to communicate with autistic spectrum people again it takes effort to switch back and rethink what is happening.
** Something that convinces me that this theory is close to the mark is that when I am thinking with this mindset, I tend to jump to the same conclusions about other autistic peoples social endeavours that non-autistic people do.
** One consistent point of failure in my social endeavours is when people realise that I am not interested in playing the social status game even when I've never broken any social rules.  The first impression is always that I must be a whacko.
** These last statements tend to be consistent with observations I made of drama shows while researching this subject.  Every show seems to have an odd collection of geeks, manipulators, and otherwise typical people.  The manipulators always get a better &quot;social deal&quot; than the geeks, and both are tainted with the same brush when one screws up.  It's as if people consider geeks to be less &quot;mature&quot; manipulators.
* Some may observe that the examples stated above assume that people are heterosexual and (relatively) monagomous and therefore the theory cannot be true.  In answer to this, may I point out that there are in fact large rifts between gay, lesbian, heterosexual and non-monagomous cultures, perhaps for the very reason that the rules are necessarily slightly different for each of these cultures.
* Apparently this is not even a [[w:Relational_aggression|New Concept]].  See also [[w:Sexual selection]] and [[w:Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)]].
* Reconciling this theory with other theories:
** Monotropism:
*** It could even be said that this game forces players to use the plot rather than detail view of the world since everybody has to be on the lookout for threats and opportunities and that non-autistic people are monotropic about social status rather than polytropic.
** Multiple causes of autism:
*** Throw a piece of mud at a wall.
*** Notice that the wall does vagluely nothing.
*** Notice that the piece of mud does many things.  First amongst them, dividing into many differently behaving pieces of mud.
*** The social status game is EXTREMELY complex and there are MANY ways to deal with it when it's difficult to play.  This doesn't mean that the different methods have different causes.
** Theory of Mind:
*** Understanding the context of any given situation is quite necessary before theory of mind is possible.  One must understand something about mechanics to be able to assign motives to a mechanic from watching him work.  The social status game described above is just such a context.
** Extreme Male Brain XXX:
** Central Coherence Deficit XXX:
** Executive Function Deficit XXX:
== Reasons that understanding the non-autistic world is necessary ==
* To be able to &quot;defeat&quot; your autism spectrum problems, you must be able to think like a non-autistic.
* Learning what the reward will actually be like when you succeed is worth the effort.
* Understanding the context of where non-autistic people &quot;are&quot; is an extremely useful TRANSLATION tool.
* Understanding how non-autistic people work tends to make them more predictable and helps to reduce social anxiety.
* To be able to survive in the non-autistic world while retaining self esteem one needs to know how to not give people reason to attack it.
* To be able to withdraw from the non-autistic world, one needs to know how to do so without stepping on peoples toes and be able to leave the door open for a return.
* To know how to enter and leave the world at will, one is able to waste less of ones time.
* To know the similarities and differences is to be able to recognise and communicate with fellow auties more effectively.
* Autistic spectrum people may have some similarities, but realistically, we all live in our own individual worlds, largely separated even from each other.
* To know how non-autistic people think, one is better equipped to create things for them.  Think user interfaces, books and art.
* To be able to manipulate this environment, it is necessary to know what it is so that you don't end up destroying it and pissing people off.
* There is no point in trying to understand what autism is in technical terms without knowing what it is to be non-autistic, in technical terms.  I strongly agree with Marc Segar on this.
* Understanding what is happening in the autistic spectrum world will be easier if autistic spectrum people know what the differences between the worlds are.
* The non-autistic world is making inroads into the autistic spectrum world lately and is quite willing to address any issues they see arising from our differences, some of which are quite real and many of which are not.  We may have a sense of security in the vastly diverging differences amongst us, but if we do not make an effort, the solutions to these issues are likely to be theirs alone.
== Reasons to avoid understanding the non-autistic world ==
* It has long been known{{citation needed}} that an autistic spectrum person who gets too drawn into the non-autistic world will suffer. People{{Who?}} have said that [[w:Marc_Segar|Marc Segar]] killed himself because of this.{{citation needed}}

== Reasons that non-autistic people have issues making room for autistic spectrum people and probably always will ==
* Non-autistic people may know at some level what's going on and often explain it in their language, but rarely know in technical terms what they're doing.
* There is only ONE context of understanding in the non-autistic world.  One approximated in this section.  Switching to another is extremely difficult for anyone, let alone someone who has never done it before.
* There are in fact people who have bad higher level social skills who make a practice of taking advantage of others.  These people are called manipulators or sociopaths and many of the social rules are designed as protection from them.
* Autistic people are often mistaken for sociopaths or manipulators because most people are not used to dealing with people who are very honest and/or genuine in their mannerisms. They often feel there must be some sort of agenda behind one's actions. 
* An alternate view to the last statement:  Autistic spectrum people are often mistaken for sociopaths or manipulators by non-autistic people because sociopaths and autistic spectrum people have the same fundamental characteristics in the non-autistic persons minds eye, only, the sociopaths are more worth talking to because their understanding of the non-autistic world is better because they focus more on interaction between people, as it interests them more.
* Another alternate view to the last two statements:  Autistic spectrum people, especially people with aspergers (simply because people with aspergers tend to make social efforts more than autistics), may be viewed by non-autistic people as sociopaths because the autistic people may match the image of a sociopath.  This is simply because autistic people may appear to not care in both their actions and words, while at the same time they may appear to not be genuine.  This is a simplistic and uninformed view, of course, because it might be said that autistic people are the opposite of sociopaths: The autistic person cares and is often making an effort, an effort which may not come naturally, to appear social and to relate, while the sociopath is adept at being social and lacks concern or care for other people.

== Connecting ==
== Non-Autistic Thought Process Factoids ==
* Non-autistic people do their &quot;developmental thinking&quot; between social interactions, as opposed to during one or never at all.  XXX define &quot;developmental thinking&quot;.
* Non-autistic people seem to be able to quickly imagine and choose between the myriads of different ways that a conversation can go.  I think this may be VISUAL THINKING.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Filter is a circuit constructed from Resistor and Capacitor or Inductor in order to pass certain range of frequencies . The range of frequencies that make the circuit  stable

Let examine the following circuits

==RC Circuit==
A circuit with one resistor in series with the input and one capacitor parallel to the load
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i  \frac{\frac{1}{j\omega C}}{R + \frac{1}{j\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ω = 0 !! &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{R}{L} &lt;/math&gt;!! ω = Infinity 
|-
|&lt;math&gt; V_o = V_i &lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The RC circuit is more stable at frequencies from  zero up to the response frequency :&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt; . This circuit is ideal for Low Pass Frequency Filter .

==CR Circuit==
A circuit with one capacitor in series with the input and one resistor parallel to the load

:&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i  \frac{R}{R + \frac{1}{j\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ω = 0 !! ω = &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt; !! ω = Infinity 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The CR circuit is more stable at frequencies from  the response frequency &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt; up to infinity. This circuit is ideal for High Pass Frequency Filter .

==RL Circuit==
A circuit with one resistor in serires with the input and one inductor parallel to the load


:&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i \frac{j\omega L}{R + j\omega L}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ω = 0 !! &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt; !! ω = Infinity 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The RL circuit is more stable at frequencies from  the response frequency &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt; up to infinity. This circuit is ideal for High Pass Frequency Filter .

==LR Circuit==
A circuit with one inductor in serires with the input and one resistor parallel to the load

&lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i \frac{R}{R +  j\omega L}&lt;/math&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ω = 0 !! &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt; !! ω = Infinity 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_i&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The LR circuit is more stable at frequencies from  zero up to the response frequency &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt; . This circuit is ideal for Low Pass Frequency Filter .

In Conclusion, Resistor and Capacitor or Inductor can be used for constructing a Filter

*For Low Pass Filter use LR or RC
*For High Pass Filter use RL or CR

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a &quot;Unit Operation&quot;? ==

A '''unit operation''' is any part of potentially multiple-step process which can be considered to have a single function. Examples of unit operations include:

* Separation Processes
* Purification Processes
* Mixing Processes
* Reaction Processes
* Power Generation Processes
* Heat Exchangers

In general the ductwork between the processes is not explicitly included, though a single pipe can be analyzed for purposes of determining friction loss, heat losses, pressure drop, and so on.

Large processes are broken into unit operations in order to make them easier to analyze. The key thing to remember about them is that ''the conservation laws apply not only to the process as a whole but also to each individual unit operation''.

The purpose of this section is not to show how to design these operations (that's a whole other course) but to give a general idea of how they work.

== Separation Processes ==

There are a large number of types of separation processes, including distillation, extraction, absorption, membrane filtration, and so on. Each of these can also be used for purification, to varying degrees.

=== Separation by Flashing ===

A mixture of two liquids or a liquid and vapor can be separated by passing it to a '''flash drum''' at a fixed temperature and pressure. The mixture is allowed to reach equilibrium (or near it), and then the vapor exits the top and the liquid exits the bottom of the drum. This separates the components somewhat, provided that the temperature is chosen between the boiling temperatures of the components of the mixture at the pressure of the drum. The degree of separation depends on the composition of the mixture, the concentrations of the species in the mixture, and the temperature and pressure. Having data such as fugacity data or even vapor pressures for simple modelling like Raoult's Law is invaluable when choosing the operating conditions.

When a solution boils, the resulting gas is '''still a mixture''', but the gaseous mixture will in general have more of the lower-boiling compound than the higher-boiling compound. Therefore, a higher-boiling compound can be separated from the lower-boiling compound by simply allowing part of the solution to boil and part to remain as liquid.

=== Distillation ===

Distillation, like flashing, is a process which is generally used to separate a mixture of two or more liquids based on their boiling points. However, what happens in a distillation column is essentially a series of flashes, which are connected with recycle loops. The liquid from each tray comes to equilibrium (ideally) with the vapor, and the vapor rises up to the next tray and the liquid falls to the tray beneath it. Each tray has a different temperature because a reboiler on the bottom and a condenser at the top maintain a temperature gradient across the column (in certain separation setups one of these components is omitted).

Distillation is an unit operation, in which two constituent is separated by different boiling point.

The net result is, like flashing, more of the lower-boiling compound(s) will exit at the top of the column, and more of the higher-boiling compound(s) will fall to the bottoms. Since distillation is multiple flashes in a row, it is typically more effective than a single flash, although the latter may be sufficient depending on the purpose. Distillation columns are standard for many types of separations because it is relatively inexpensive for its efficacy. Distillation has a limit, however: non-ideal mixtures can form '''azeotropes'''. An azeotrope is a point at which when the solution boils, the vapor has the same composition as the liquid. Therefore no further separation can be done without another method or without using some special tricks.

Two examples of distillation processes are petroleum distillation and the production of alcoholic beverages. In the first case, oil is separated into its many components, with the lightest at the top and the heaviest on the bottom. In the latter, the gas is enriched in ethanol, which is later recondensed.

=== Gravitational Separation ===

Gravitational separation takes advantage of the well-known effect of '''density differences''': something that is less dense will float on something that is more dense. Therefore, if two immiscible liquids have significantly different densities, they can be separated by simply letting them settle, then draining the denser liquid out the bottom. Note that the key word here is ''immiscible''; if the liquids are soluble in each other, then it is impossible to separate them by this method.

This method can also be used to separate out solids from a liquid mixture, but again the solids must not be soluble in the liquid (or must be less soluble than they are as present in the solution).

=== Extraction ===

Extraction is the general practice of taking something dissolved in one liquid and forcing it to become dissolved in another liquid.  This is done by taking advantage of the '''relative solubility''' of a compound between two liquids. For example, caffeine must be extracted from coffee beans or tea leaves in order to be used in beverages such as coffee or soda. The common method for doing this is to use ''supercritical carbon dioxide'', which is able to dissolve caffeine as if it were a liquid. Then, in order to take the caffeine out, the temperature is lowered (lowering the &quot;solubility&quot; in carbon dioxide) and water is injected. The system is then allowed to reach equilibrium. Since caffeine is more soluble in water than it is in carbon dioxide, the majority of it goes into the water.

Extraction is also used for purification, if some solution is contaminated with a pollutant, the pollutant can be extracted with another, clean stream. Even if it is not very soluble, it will still extract ''some'' of the pollutant.

Another type of extraction is ''acid-base extraction'', which is useful for moving a basic or acidic compound from a polar solvent (such as water) to a non-polar one. Often, the ionized form of the acid or base is soluble in a polar solvent, but the non-ionized form is not as soluble. The reverse is true for the non-ionized form. Therefore, in order to manipulate where the majority of the compound will end up, we alter the pH of the solution by adding acid or base. 

For example, suppose you wanted to extract Fluoride (F-) from water into benzene. First, you would add ''acid'', because when a strong acid is added to the solution it undergoes the following reaction with fluoride, which is practically irreversible:

&lt;math&gt; F^- + H_3O^+ \rightarrow HF + H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

The hydrogen fluoride is more soluble in benzene than fluoride itself, so it would move into the benzene. The benzene and water fluoride solutions could then be separated by density since they're immiscible.

The term '''absorption''' is a generalization of extraction that can involve different phases (gas-liquid instead of liquid-liquid). However, the ideas are still the same.

=== Membrane Filtration ===

A membrane is any barrier which allows one substance to pass through it more than another. There are two general types of membrane separators: those which separate based on the '''size of the molecules''' and those which separate based on '''diffusivity'''.

An example of the first type of membrane separator is your everyday vacuum cleaner. Vacuum cleaners work by taking in air laden with dust from your carpet. A filter inside the vacuum then traps the dust particles (which are relatively large) and allows the air to pass through it (since air particles are relatively small). A larger-scale operation that works on the same principle is called a '''fabric filter''' or &quot;Baghouse&quot;, which is used in air pollution control or other applications where a solid must be removed from a gas.

Some fancy membranes exist which are able to separate hydrogen from a gaseous mixture by size. These membranes have very small pores which allow hydrogen (the smallest possible molecule, by molecular weight) to pass through by convection, but other molecules cannot pass through the pores and must resort to diffusion (which is comparatively slow). Hence a purified hydrogen mixture results on the other side.

Membranes can separate substances by their diffusivity as well, for example water may diffuse through a certain type of filter faster than ethanol, so if such a filter existed it could be used to enrich the original solution with ethanol.

== Purification Methods ==

In order to bring any product to market, it is necessary to purify it adequately. Without purification, people could get sick from eating foods, side-reactions could occur in industry which would cause safety concerns, or a scientist's research could be invalidated. Fortunately there are several methods used to purify things. The separation processes mentioned above are often used for this purpose, as are the following two processes:

=== Adsorption ===

Not to be confused with ''absorption'', adsorption is a process which separates components by their relative '''adhesiveness''' to a surface. An adsorption column is essentially a pipe filled with a certain material. When the contaminant flows by, it will bind to the material, and in this way the fluid flowing by is cleaned.

A major disadvantage to this method is that the material will always have a ''saturation point'' after which no more contaminant can latch on to it. At this point cleaning stops and therefore the spent material must be replaced by new material.

=== Recrystallization ===

Recrystallization is the purification of substances by taking advantage of changes in solubility with respect to ''temperature''.We take advantage of this by dissolving an impure compound and then lowering the temperature ''slowly''. The solubility of most solid substances increases with temperature [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility], so decreasing the temperature will cause the solubility of both the impurities and the substance to be purified to decrease. However, since there is likely much more of the impure substance present than impurities, the impure substance will crystallize out long before the impurities will. Therefore, as long as the temperature is not lowered too quickly, the impure substance will crystallize out in a purer form, while most impurities will remain in solution.

A disadvantage to this method is that it takes a long time to perform, but it is often the most effective method for obtaining a pure sample of a product.

== Reaction Processes ==

=== Plug flow reactors (PFRs) and Packed Bed Reactors (PBRs) ===

A '''plug flow reactor''' is a (idealized) reactor in which the reacting fluid flows through a tube at a rapid pace, but without the formation of eddies characteristic of rapid flow. Plug flow reactors tend to be relatively easy to construct (they're essentially pipes) but are problematic in reactions which work better when reactants (or products!) are dilute.

Plug flow reactors can be combined with membrane separators in order to increase the yield of a reactor. The products are selectively pulled out of the reactor as they are made so that the equilibrium in the reactor itself continues to shift towards making more product.

[[Image:PFR Membrane diagram.PNG]]

A packed bed reactor is essentially a plug flow reactor packed with catalyst beads. They are used if, like the majority of reactions in industry, the reaction requires a catalyst to significantly progress at a reasonable temperature.

=== Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactors (CSTRs) and Fluidized Bed Reactors (FBs) ===

A '''continuous stirred-tank reactor''' is an idealized reactor in which the reactants are dumped in one large tank, allowed to react, and then the products (and unused reactants) are released out of the bottom. In this way the reactants are kept relatively dilute, so the temperatures in the reactor are generally lower. This also can have advantages or disadvantages for the selectivity of the reaction, depending on whether the desired reaction is faster or slower than the undesired one.

[[Image:CSTR FB diagram.PNG]]

CSTRs are generally more useful for liquid-phase reactions than PFRs since less transport power is required. However, gas-phase reactions are harder to control in a CSTR.

A '''fluidized bed reactor''' is, in essence, a CSTR which has been filled with catalyst. The same analogy holds between an FB and CSTR as does between a PFR and a PBR. Unlike CSTRs though, Fluidized beds are commonly used with gases; the gas is pumped in the bottom and bubbles through the catalyst on the way to the top outlet.

=== Bioreactors ===

A '''bioreactor''' is a reactor that utilizes either a living organism or one or more enzymes from a living organism to accomplish a certain chemical transformation. Bioreactors can be either CSTRs (in which case they are known as '''chemostats''') or PFRs.

Certain characteristics of a bioreactor must be more tightly controlled than they must be in a normal CSTR or PFR because cellular enzymes are very complex and have relatively narrow ranges of optimum activity. These include, but are not limited to:

# Choice of organism. This is similar to the choice of catalyst for an inorganic reaction.
# ''Strain'' of the organism. Unlike normal catalysts, organisms are very highly manipulable to produce more of what you're after and less of other products. However, also unlike normal catalysts, they generally require a lot of work to get any significant production at all.
# Choice of substrate. Many organisms can utilize many different carbon sources, for example, but may only produce what you want from one of them.
# Concentration of substrate and aeration. Two inhibitory effects exist which could prevent you from getting the product you're after. Too much substrate leads to the '''glucose effect''' in which an organism will ferment regardless of the air supply, while too much air will lead to the '''pasteur effect''' and a lack of fermentation.
# pH and temperature: Bacterial enzymes tend to have a narrow range of optimal pH and temperatures, so these must be carefully controlled.

However, bioreactors have several distinct advantages. One of them is that enzymes tend to be stereospecific, so for example you don't get useless D-sorbose in the production of vitamin C, but you get L-sorbose, which is the active form. In addition, very high production capacities are possible after enough mutations have been induced. Finally, substances which have not been made artificially or which would be very difficult to make artificially (like most antibiotics) can be made relatively easily by a living organism.

== Heat Exchangers ==

In general, a '''heat exchanger''' is a device which is used to facilitate the exchange of heat between two mixtures, from the hotter one to the cooler one. Heat exchangers very often involve steam because steam is very good at carrying heat by convection, and it also has a high heat capacity so it won't change temperature as much as another working fluid would. In addition, though steam can be expensive to produce, it is likely to be less expensive than other working fluids since it comes from water.

=== Tubular Heat Exchangers ===

A '''tubular heat exchanger''' is essentially a jacket around a pipe. The working fluid (often steam) enters the jacket on one side of the heat exchanger and leaves on the other side. Inside the pipe is the mixture which you want to heat or cool. Heat is exchanged through the walls of the device in accordance to the second law of thermodynamics, which requires that heat flow from higher to lower temperatures. Therefore, if it is desired to cool off the fluid in the pipe, the working fluid must be cooler than the fluid in the pipe.

Heat exchangers work because heat naturally flows from higher temperature to lower temperatures. Therefore if a hot fluid and a cold fluid are separated by a heat conducting surface heat can be transferred from the hot fluid to the cold fluid.

Tubular heat exchangers can be set up in two ways: '''co-current''' or '''counter-current'''. In a co-current setup, the working fluid and the fluid in the pipe enter on the same side of the heat exchanger. This setup is somewhat inefficient because as heat is exchanged, the temperature of the working fluid will approach that of the fluid in the pipe. The closer the two temperatures become, the less heat can be exchanged. Worse, if the temperatures become equal somewhere in the middle of the heat exchanger, the remaining length is wasted because the two fluids are at thermal equilibrium (no heat is released).

To help counteract these effects, one can use a counter-current setup, in which the working fluid enters the heat exchanger on one end and the fluid in the pipe enters at the ''other end''. As an explanation for why this is more efficient, suppose that the working fluid is hotter than the fluid in the pipe, so that the fluid in the pipe is heated up. The fluid in the pipe will be at its highest temperature when it exits the heat exchanger, and at its coolest when it enters. ''The working fluid will follow the same trend'' because it cools off as it travels the length of the exchanger. Because it's counter-current, though, the fact that the working fluid cools off has less of an effect because it's exchanging heat with cooler, rather than warmer, fluids in the pipe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AND''' gates is one the basic gates used to implement logical conjunction. It is basically a multiple input gate with a single output. 
== Electrical Analogy ==
It is analogous to a pair of switches in series which operates a bulb which is again in series with these switches. Thus, the bulb will be ON only when both the switches are closed. As seen from the truth table of an AND gate, the output will be HIGH only when all of its inputs are in logical 1 state.

The adjoining '''logic diagram''' shows the construction of an AND gate using N-Channel [[Electronics Fundamentals/Semi Conductor Devices/MOSFET|MOSFET]]. Alternatively, an AND gate can also be constructed using P-Channel MOSFET.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

The scientific method is not without it's criticisms. Science has limitations but most if not all are human in nature and not a fault in the process itself, if that was the case the methodology would simply be improved. The biggest fragility of the scientific process is its reliance in consensual acceptance of results, this in itself does not invalidate the process but can delay or hinder scientific advance, especially on areas that require complex, costly or a high degree of verification of data, making replication difficult. Other issues to consider is in regards to how scientific knowledge is prone to be adulterated, even subverted by the way it is disseminated, validated and funded. 

== Science Delusion ==
The concept of the scientific delusion is often proposed as a fault of science. The premise is that science includes a belied that it has a grasp (and the only possible grasp) over reality. While science can validate itself and so only consider the validity of its own conclusions the idea that science is the end all in regards to finding universal answers comes not from science itself (since if it had the ultimate word and a conclusive stage the continuation of the process would be broken), but from those that impart on science some of the characteristics of faith (belief without verifiability).

Since science is done by humans (and humans are intrinsically fallible), it, like in any other process will incur in error of judgment. This is not a fault of the scientific process (science) but of those that misapply it or impart on it characteristics that do not apply. Science is not a belief system, not even a perfect system, it is nevertheless the best process we have constructed to explore &quot;reality&quot;.

== Scientific Taboos ==
This proposal addresses the notion that science has partitioned areas where it does not function or is not applied. Since science is a process there may be areas that scientific tests are harder to perform, especially in fields on the border of the human knowledge but its failing is a human limitation an not of the process itself. Society also has an influence in determining (and even dictating) what areas get to be scientifically investigated and those that should be avoided, in this science itself has no blame it is humans that bring into it artificial limitations or simply are unable to properly devise or accept scientific experiences as to validate observations.</text>

This '''Timeline of the history of scientific method''' shows an overview of the cultural inventions that have contributed to the development of the scientific method. For a more detailed account see [[The Scientific Method/History of Scientific Thought|History of Scientific Thought]].

*2000 BC — First text indexes (various cultures).
*320 BC — Aristotle, comprehensive documents categorising and subdividing knowledge, dividing knowledge into different areas (physics, poetry, zoology, logic, rhetoric, politics, and biology).
*200 BC — First cataloged library (at Alexandria).
*800 AD — Arguably the scientific method in many of its modern forms is developed in some aspects of early Islamic philosophy, theology and law. In particular the methods of citation, peer review and open inquiry leading to development of consensus. 
*1015 - Alhazen used experimental methods to obtain the results in his book ''Optics'' In particular, he combined observations and rational arguments to show that his intromission theory of vision was scientifically correct, and that the emission theory of vision supported by Ptolemy and Euclid was wrong.
*1327 — Ockham's razor clearly formulated (by William of Ockham)
*1403 — Yongle Encyclopedia, the first collaborative encyclopedia.
*1590 — First controlled experiment, (Francis Bacon).
*1600 — First dedicated laboratory.
*1620 — ''Novum Organum'' published (Francis Bacon).
*1637 — First Scientific method (René Descartes).
*1650 — Society of experts (the Royal Society).
*1650 — Experimental evidence established as the arbiter of truth (the Royal Society).
*1665 — Repeatability established (Robert Boyle).
*1665 — Scholarly journals established.
*1675 — Peer review begun.
*1687 — Hypothesis/prediction (Isaac Newton).
*1710 — The problem of induction identified by David Hume .
*1753 — Description of a controlled experiment using two identical populations with only one variable. (James Lind's ''A Treatise of the Scurvy'').
*1926 — Randomized design (Ronald Fisher).
*1934 — Falsifiability as a criterion for evaluating new hypotheses (Karl Popper's ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'').
*1937 — Controlled placebo trial.
*1946 — First computer simulation.
*1950 — Double blind experiment.
*1962 — Meta study of scientific method (Thomas Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'').</text>

'''Dr. Hal Emmerich''', nicknamed '''Otacon''', is an American weapons designer and computer hacker who functions as a Q-like sidekick to Solid Snake, usually giving him support via codec. 

Otacon is first introduced in ''Metal Gear Solid'' as the designer of Metal Gear REX, and is being held captive at the outset on Shadow Moses Island. After Snake rescues him, he joins the FOXHOUND team and guides Snake through the process of disarming and destroying Metal Gear. He also becomes infatuated with FOXHOUND member Sniper Wolf while in captivity and is crushed when she is later killed in battle by Solid Snake. During the cutscene where Snake reveals Metal Gear's true purpose, Otacon says nuclear weapons must be written into his genes. Genetics being a major theme of Metal Gear solid. He then reveals that his grandfather worked on the Manhattan Project and his father was born on August 6, 1945, the day Hiroshima was bombed.

In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Otacon and Solid Snake form Philanthropy, an anti-proliferation organization. Otacon supports Snake via the radio as he infiltrates a converted tanker to photograph Metal Gear RAY, and later, supports Snake and Raiden as they infiltrate the Big Shell in a bid to rescue his foster sister, Emma, while attempting to destroy Arsenal Gear. Later on in the game, Emma is killed by Vamp. Lead character designer Yoji Shinkawa stated in an interview that Otacon is designed to look somewhat &quot;tougher&quot; than he did in ''Metal Gear Solid''.

Though Otacon himself does not appear in ''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'' (the game being set in the 1960s), his grandfather (also a scientist) is mentioned in conversation between Naked Snake and Sigint and also appears in a photograph alongside Russian weapons designer Aleksandr Leonovitch Granin. 

Otacon also appears in ''Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots'' trailers, still supporting Solid Snake as a member of Philanthropy. In early trailers, he's remote controlling a robot reminiscent of the Metal Gear Mk. II from an earlier Hideo Kojima directed game, ''Snatcher''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Revolver Ocelot''' is an antagonist in the ''Metal Gear'' video game series created by game designer Hideo Kojima. Introduced in the 1998 video game ''Metal Gear Solid'' Revolver Ocelot began as a member of the rebellious FOXHOUND unit, an ex-Soviet agent with an ironic American gunslinger-theme, while in each subsequent installment his true elegances and motives remain uncertain, making him emblematic of Metal Gear's labyrinthine narrative. Voiced by: Patric Zimmerman (Old Adamska &quot;Revolver&quot; / &quot;Liquid&quot; Ocelot), and Joshua Keaton (Young Adamska Ocelot).

==History==
===As Revolver Ocelot=== 

Revolver Ocelot (Solid Snake's evil archnemesis) is introduced in ''Metal Gear Solid'', where he is clothed in a duster, spurs and gunbelts, the traditional garb of gunslingers in Spaghetti westerns and wields a Colt Single Action Army pistol in battle. His appearance is based on that of veteran Western film actor Lee Van Cleef.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerz-edge.com/ps2/previews/mgs3s.html Gamerz Edge interview with Ryan Rayton] access date 4 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, he serves as Liquid Snake's right hand man. He is also a sadistic capturer and takes pleasure interrogating and torturing hostages. 

Ocelot is the first member of FOXHOUND Solid Snake confronts in the game. Ocelot survives the battle, but loses his right hand to the Cyborg Ninja and flees the scene. Ocelot later appears as an interrogator in the game once Solid Snake has been captured. He then spends most of the remainder of the game with Liquid, assisting him in his plot. 

Ocelot and Naomi Hunter are the only members of FOXHOUND who are still alive by the end of the story. It is revealed that Ocelot provoked Liquid into initiating the takeover and is actually under the orders of Solidus Snake, the third Snake brother and by then President of the United States. Ocelot manages to sell the MO Disk with the Metal Gear REX data (which he stole from Solid Snake) on the Black Market, leading to the proliferation of Metal Gear-like weapons.

Ocelot returns in ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'' with a new arm surgically attached which originally belonged to his former boss, Liquid. During the initial Tanker chapter, he betrays Col. Gurlukovich, a former CO from his GRU days, during the hijacking of a Marine vessel containing the Metal Gear RAY prototype, murdering both him and U.S. Commandant Scott Dolph. But before he gets the chance to enter RAY, his new arm reacts to Solid Snake's presence, causing Liquid Snake's personality to take over Ocelot for a brief period. Ocelot regains control of his mind and then steals RAY and sinks the tanker before reporting back to Solidus Snake, Ocelot's new boss. 

In the Plant chapter, he assists Solidus Snake in his takeover of the Big Shell cleanup facility. He spends most of the Plant chapter surveying Raiden's actions without directly confronting him, save for one scene in which he personally assassinates the President of the United States. His motives are made clear near the end of the game, when it is revealed that Ocelot is a spy for an Illuminati-like group known as The Patriots. He betrays Solidus and kills Fortune, the daughter of Scott Dolph, but before he gets the chance to kill Snake, Liquid's personality again takes over Ocelot's body. Liquid reveals that he intentionally chose Ocelot to bear his arm and escapes with Metal Gear RAY once again. It is unknown if Ocelot regained his personality after this point.

Ocelot’s relationship with Solidus Snake was intentionally designed by Kojima to resemble that of Ocelot and Liquid in ''Metal Gear Solid''.&lt;ref name= &quot;gameplan&quot;&gt;[http://www.mgstus.org/downloads/misc/MGS2_orginal_gameplan/metal_gear_solid_2_grand_game_plan.pdf MGS2 Game plan (translated)] accessed 1 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with character designer, Yoji Shinkawa, Ocelot was originally meant to have a mechanical arm, however Shinkawa thought the idea of him having Liquid's was a good concept to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalgearsolid.org/show_features.php?id=124 Yoji Shinkawa interview] accessed 21 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Then when it was decided to use Liquid's instead of the mechanical one, Ocelot was initially not going to be able to move the fingers on that arm.&lt;ref name= &quot;gameplan&quot;/&gt;

===As young Ocelot===

Set in 1964, ''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'' features a young Revolver Ocelot (back then known simply as Ocelot) as one of Naked Snake's (the future Big Boss) adversaries in  the game. He is a young member of the GRU with the rank of Major and leads his own elite Ocelot unit. During the end of the Virtuous Mission, Ocelot confronts Snake in which he wields a Makarov PM, but is quickly subdued and humiliated. Taking Snake's advice into consideration he quickly acquires his known preference for revolvers, choosing a pair (and sometimes three) Single Action Army revolvers. As the first boss in the game, the battle between Ocelot and Naked Snake is interrupted by a swarm of hornets controlled by The Pain.

For the rest of the game, Ocelot tries to catch up with Snake in an attempt to have a rematch with him. While Snake is captured and interrogated Ocelot is responsible for the loss of his eye, accidentally wounding him with a misfired bullet while threatening EVA by juggling his revolvers. The final battle between Snake and Ocelot occurs inside the WIG prior to the game’s ending sequence with four possible outcomes, all of them ending virtually amicably, renewed respect shared between both. After the ending credits, it is revealed that Ocelot is a triple agent; not only is he the KGB mole ADAM (aka Adamska), he is also working under the orders of the Director of Central Intelligence in an attempt to recover the Philosopher’s Legacy for the American Government. 

It is heavily implied in a hidden radio-conversation with EVA in the Chyornaya Peschera cave branch that Ocelot is the biological son of The Boss and The Sorrow when it is combined with The Boss' speech in Rokovoj Bereg.&lt;ref name=eva&gt;'''EVA''': &quot;The Colonel never told me. All I heard was that his mother was supposedly shot in the gut during battle and that he was born right there, bullets whizzing past them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;'''Snake''': &quot;A pregnant women in the middle of a battle?&quot;&lt;br&gt;'''EVA''': &quot;That's what I heard. They say that when they stitched her up, the scar was shaped like a snake.&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 90%;&quot;&gt;(''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boss&gt;'''The Boss''': &quot;Look at this scar. This is proof that I was once a mother. I gave up my body and my child for my country.&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 90%;&quot;&gt;(''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Hideo Kojima confirmed in the ''Extreme Box'' DVD commentary that Ocelot is the son of The Boss and The Sorrow.&lt;ref&gt; Metal Gear Solid 3 Extreme Box game commentary, DVD, publisher = Konami, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon The Boss's story of giving birth in 1944, this would make Ocelot 20 years old at the time of Operation Snake Eater.

The younger Ocelot appears again in ''Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops'', albeit his role is mostly offscreen. He is first mentioned when Gene contacts him via telephone, implying, at the time, he and Gene are in league. Gene does question the nature of Ocelot's activities, however, pointing out he is &quot;betraying his employers&quot; and realizing it would be impossible for Ocelot to do everything he is doing without someone higher up backing him. As Gene ponders over who Ocelot's mysterious backer could be, Gene confesses he already believes it to be &quot;the man with the same codename as [[Gray Fox (Metal Gear)|Null]]&quot;. Later, Gene mentions Ocelot in front of Naked Snake.

Ocelot is not mentioned again until the game's ending, the point at which he finally appears in person. Ocelot intercepts the DCI while he is on his way to a nuclear shelter in a top-secret facility underneath the CIA's headquarters. After the DCI shows him documents he has gathered which contain all important data on the Philosophers, including their identities and the location of the Philosophers' Legacy, Ocelot suddenly draws his revolver, shoots the DCI's bodyguards, then holds the gun on the DCI himself. After alluding to his larger motives and intentions,&lt;ref name=patriots&gt;'''DCI''': &quot;What the hell are you doing?! You're not planning to betray the Philosophers, are you?&quot;&lt;br&gt;'''Ocelot''': &quot;Betray? No, I'm not going to betray them. I'm going to end them! Then we'll take back what you stole from us. We will carry on the spirit of the true patriot.&quot;&lt;br&gt;'''DCI''': &quot;The true patriot?&quot;&lt;br&gt;'''Ocelot''': &quot;It's all part of our plan to make the world she envisioned a reality.&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 90%;&quot;&gt;(''Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops'')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; he confesses he came for the remaining half of the Philosophers' Legacy, then murders the DCI.

After the credits there is a phone conversation between Ocelot and an unknown man that alludes gene therapy. To end the conversation with the man whose name never becomes known, Ocelot tells him he will work with him as long as they get Big Boss to join them, to become the Patriots.

===As Liquid Ocelot===

Revolver Ocelot is set to return in the upcoming ''Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots'',  which continues where ''Sons of Liberty'' left off. He is still possessed by Liquid Snake's mind and now goes by the name of '''Liquid Ocelot'''. He no longer wears his full cowboy attire, but sports eyeglasses similar to those worn by his father, The Sorrow. Also, Ocelot preferred to tie his long hair back, but now wears it freely, in much the same fashion as Liquid had. In the trailer, he possesses Liquid's voice and personality (hence his new moniker), with no sign of his original self. It should be noted that Koji Totani, the original Japanese voice of Revolver Ocelot, died a few months before the production of the E3 Trailer.

==Other appearances==
Ocelot also appears as a boss in the Arena Mode in ''Metal Gear Acid 2'' along with Liquid. His polygonal model is extracted directly from the original ''Metal Gear Solid''.

In the Metal Gear Solid Drama CD series, a character with connections to Revolver Ocelot named Sergei Gurlukovich plays a prominent role in the second story arc. He is introduced as a war buddy of Ocelot during his service with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Like Ocelot, Gurlukovich is a sadist and spends most of the time torturing Campbell during his captivity. Due to his connections with Ocelot, he is aware of the FOXDIE virus and wishes to produce similar biological weapons.

This young incarnation of Revolver Ocelot also appears as a playable character in ''Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s (''Snake Eater''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s expansion) online mode where he is played by the top scoring player in the Ocelot Unit while in a game including &quot;Special Characters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence/644090p1.html Gamespy Subsistence preview] access date 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia is a project to build free encyclopedias in all languages of the world. Virtually anyone with Internet access is free to contribute, by contributing neutral, cited information.

Wikipedia started in January 2001, and currently offers more than ten million articles in 250 languages. The largest Wikipedia is in English, with more than two million articles; it's followed by the German and French editions, each of which contain more than half a million articles. Nine other language editions contain 100,000+ articles, and more than 100 other languages contain 1,000+ articles.

Wikipedia is also known for its community. In 2004 Wikipedia won the Webby Award for &quot;Community&quot; and the Prix Ars Electronica's Golden Nica for &quot;Digital Communities&quot;. Since the start of the project, over 100,000 registered users have made at least ten edits.&lt;ref&gt;It is unknown how many users have registered on multiple projects at once.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of accounts created on the English Wikipedia alone exceeds 3.4 million. However, most edits on that language edition come from around one thousand of the most dedicated users.

Some Wikipedias release or plan to release regular snapshots. The German Wikipedia is released twice a year as a DVD, in collaboration with Directmedia Publishing, and the Polish Wikipedia has released one DVD of content.

Wiktionary is a project to create a multilingual free content dictionary in every language. This means each project seeks to use a particular language to define all words in ''all'' languages. It actually aims to be much more extensive than a typical dictionary, including thesauri, rhymes, translations, audio pronunciations, etymologies, and quotations. The project started in December 2002, and as of January 2008 is available in over 100 languages with over 3,000,000 entries in all. The largest language edition is French, followed by English, Vietnamese and Turkish. All four of them have more than 150,000 entries each, while 8 languages in total have more than 100,000 entries each. 61 other languages have at least 1,000 entries.

Wiktionary has been collaborating with the Wikimedia Commons. Many sound files have been uploaded to Commons, to provide Wiktionary and other projects with examples of pronunciation.

Wikiversity is a project dedicated to learning materials and learning communities, as well as research. It was set up as a Wikimedia project (in &quot;beta&quot; phase), on 15th August, 2006, with the English and German Wikiversities, as well as the multilingual co-ordination hub. Since then, these have been joined by the French, Greek, Italian and Spanish Wikiversities. Despite what its name may suggest, Wikiversity is not limited to university (or tertiary) level materials, but is open to materials and communities of all learner levels. The way it can facilitate learning activities and communities is still being explored, but is centered around the model of 'learning by doing', or 'experiential learning'.

Wikimedia Commons was launched in September 2004 to provide a central repository for free photographs, diagrams, maps, videos, animations, music, sounds, spoken texts, and other free media. It is a multilingual project with contributors speaking dozens of languages, that serves as a central repository for all Wikimedia projects.

The project is growing rapidly. In October 2007, it reached [[commons:Commons:Press releases/2M|two million]] multimedia files, less than a year after reaching [[commons:Commons:Press releases/1M|one million]]. Wikimedia Commons received an honorary mention for Digital Community at the 2005 Prix Ars Electronica awards in May 2005.

The project has two community-driven mechanisms for highlighting quality contributions: [[commons:Commons:Featured pictures|Featured pictures]] which acknowledge the cream of the crop, and [[commons:Commons:Quality Images|Quality images]], which recognise well-composed creations by Wikimedia editors. Since 2006 it has run a [[commons:Commons:Picture of the Year|Picture of the Year]] competition, which invites the wider Wikimedia community to share in the celebration of the inspiring free content imagery. Two pages, [[commons:Commons:Meet our photographers|Meet our photographers]] and [[commons:Commons:Meet our illustrators|Meet our illustrators]], showcase a selection of the highly skilled contributors who choose to use free content licenses and donate their work to the Wikimedia Commons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The penicillin nucleus ==
The pharmacophore (part of a molecule that confers pharmacological activity) of penicillins is called the penicillin nucleus.  It contains a [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Penicillins#The β-lactam ring|β-lactam ring]].

== The β-lactam ring ==
The penicillin nucleus found in all penicillins contains a so-called β-lactam ring.  This is a four-membered cyclic amide that is unstable in acidic or alkaline conditions.  The small ring us under a great deal of strain, making the normally unreactive amide group more susceptible to hydrolysis, resulting in ring-opening to form open-chain compounds.

Image:Clavulanic-acid-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;ball-and-stick model of clavulanic acid&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== β-lactamase inhibitors ==
β-Lactamase is an enzyme produced by certain penicillin-resistant bacteria.  It inactivates penicillin antibiotics by disrupting their β-lactam ring.  Once way to protect penicillins against β-lactamase is to modify their side chains − methicillin and flucloxacillin are examples of penicillins whose side chains make them β-lactamase resistant.  Another tactic is to protect vulnerable penicillins with a ''β-lactamase inhibitor''.  These compounds, such as clavulanic acid, are not antibiotics, but they allow penicillin antibiotics to do their job by inhibiting β-lactamase.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fields ==

Fields in SuperCard are used to store text.


=== Field Properties ===
Fields have Style properties.

Text is an intrinsic property of a field. In fact, the text property of a field doesn't need to be named when getting or setting it. In fact, this can seem counter intuitive when compared to other languages and programming environments. To get or set the text of a field, you simply get or put a literal string or a variable into or out of the field. See the examples below under Field Syntax.

=== Field Syntax ===

==== Getting the contents of a field ====
It might seem like you should be able to simply do the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
-- WARNING!! Incorrect Code!
get field [name of field]
put it into [variable name]
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, fields either belong to cards or backgrounds, so you must specify this when getting or setting the text in a field:

&lt;pre&gt;
get [cd/card/bg/background] field [name of field]
put it into [variable name]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
put [cd/card/bg/background] field [name of field] into [variable name]
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Putting (i.e. setting) the contents of a field ====
Just as when getting the contents of a field, you must specify card or background when putting data in:

&lt;pre&gt;
put [literal string/variable name] into [cd/card/bg/background] field [name of field]
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Looping through the fields of a card or background ====
&lt;pre&gt;
repeat with x = 1 to the number of [cd/card/bg/background] fields
[code to work with fields]
-- example [cd/card/bg/background] field x
end repeat
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Chufa''' (''Cyperus esculentus'' L. var. ''sativus'') consists of the tuberous roots of an African plant of the sedge family. Chufa &quot;nuts&quot; are very popular in Spain and Mexico, and are also known also as  tiger nuts, earth almonds, and earthnuts.

They are often utilized as an ingredient for a drink, [[Cookbook:Horchata|horchata]]. The &quot;nuts&quot; are also consumed widely as a snackfood.

Chufa has a brown, bumpy exterior, and has a chestnut like flavor. It can be found in many Latin markets and natural food stores. 

Chufa can be properly stored for up to a year in a cool, dark place, when tightly wrapped.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A wooden boat is a vessel constructed of wood generally intended to transport one or more persons (and their corresponding cargo) across a body of water.  While not always a requirement, most wooden boats are first constructed by assembling a frame, then adding strips or sheets of wood to the frame.

My name is Lauren Batho and I'm just finishing the first year of my Master's in School and Clinical Child Psychology at OISE. I'm interested in attention, particularly how working memory abilities are related to attention, ADHD, and interference on children's performance. My thesis will examine the irrelevant speech effect (ISE) for inattentive and attentive children, and how it is related to their working memory capacity.

Peace out.

	In the last thirty years, mindfulness-based interventions have gained tremendous popularity in the fields of behavioral medicine and clinical psychology (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). The impressive body of research literature examining the efficacy of interventions focusing specifically on the development of mindfulness practices and skills continues to grow (Baer, 2003; Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, &amp; Walach, 2004). In addition, mindfulness practices are now being integrated within conventional clinical approaches such as process-experiential (Dalziel, 2007) and cognitive behavioral therapies (Segal, Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002). This paper discuses the roots of this practice and the history of its integration within clinical practice. The first section acknowledge the place of mindfulness within Buddhism and indigenous knowledges. The second section focuses on the history of the development and empirical validation of the first structured mindfulness-based intervention to be scientifically appraised. The third section focuses on recent advances in the field. 
Acknowledging the multiple roots of mindfulness  
Mindfulness is presented within psychology and behavioral medicine as a secular practice with Buddhist roots (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). What are thought to be the earliest surviving records of the teachings of the Buddha are contained in the Pali Cannon (Tipitaka). These were first passed down orally until around 100BCE, when they were committed to text (Robinson, Johnson, &amp; Bhikkhu, 2005).  By 250 BCE, the text was organised in three sets of teachings: The Vinyana consists of the precepts and directions for living for the monks and nuns; the Suttas consists of the discourses given by the Buddha; and the Abhidhamma consists of seven volumes about the working of the mind and consciousness. Many traditions of Buddhism emerged as a result of differing interpretations of the Buddha’s teachings. The two most commonly known schools are the Theravada or The Way of the Elders and Mahayana or The Greater Vehicle. 	
The first teaching of the Buddha consists in the Four Noble Truths, which focus on human experience and the liberation from suffering through awakening. 1) There is dukkha (suffering), 2) The cause of dukkha is craving, 3) To cease suffering, one relinquishes that craving, 4) The path towards cessation of suffering is the Noble Eighfold path of right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. It is said that the Buddha based the following 45 years of teaching upon this foundation. There are many forms of meditation practices in Buddhism. Mindfulness meditation refers to the cultivation of moment-to-moment awareness. Cultivating mindfulness allows for a recognition of the transitory nature of all experience (e.g., thoughts, emotions, sensations) and for the development of a different relationship to these experiences (e.g., instead of tensing up in response to painful sensations leading to exacerbation of pain, allowing oneself to explore these sensations).
The roots of mindfulness practice are not limited to Buddhism. It is interesting to note that there are descriptions of spiritual practices that seem very similar to mindfulness practice throughout other cultures and religions. For instance, Maori Elder Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann (2002) speaks of Dadirri in the following ways: 
What I want to talk about is a special quality of my people.  I believe it is the most important.  It is our most unique gift.  It is perhaps the greatest gift we can give to our fellow Australians.  In our language this quality is called Dadirri. Dadirri is an inner, deep listening and quiet, still awareness.  Dadirri recognises the deep spring that is inside us.  We call on it and it calls to us.  This is the gift that Australia is thirsting for.  It is something like what you call ‘contemplation’.  A big part of Dadirri is listening (cited in Atkinson, 2002). 

	Practices similar to mindfulness are also part of the many ceremonies of indigenous people on the North American continent (Carbone, 2000, personal communication).  
Integration of mindfulness within clinical practice 
Theoretical discussions of the integration of mindfulness into psychotherapy can be found as early as the 1960s, with the well-known works Psychotherapy East and West (Watts, 1960) and Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism (Suzuki, Fromm &amp; DeMarino, 1960). The earliest clinical application discussed in the research literature is found in an article by Gary Deatherage (1975) who described five cases in which mindfulness meditation as an adjunct to psychotherapy  had been beneficial. In is only in the late 1970s however, that a structured mindfulness-based intervention appeared thanks to the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn (1982; 1990).
Don Ferren reported a personal communication with F. Urbanowski regarding the  ground-breaking work of Jon Kabat-Zinn (Ferren, 2003) Urbanowski stated that in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn used to practice meditation and yoga in the faculty conference room of the University of Massachusetts Medical Centre, where he worked. After a while, a number of doctors asked Kabat-Zinn to teach them. Their personal experience led them to believe that a number of their patients might benefit from these practices. In response, Kabat-Zinn developed a structured ten week mindfulness based stress reduction program (MBSR now refined to an 8-week program) and started evaluating its effectiveness. His first published study focused  primarily with groups of patients with intractable chronic pain (1982).
The traditional MBSR program involves 8 weekly 2-hour group sessions as well as a full day silent retreat. During the training, participants learn formal mindfulness exercises and are expected to set aside time for practice, 45 minutes a day, 6 days a week. The exercises are designed to help participants augment their awareness of moment-to-moment experience, including sensations, feelings, thoughts, while cultivating compassion and love. In addition to the mindfulness exercises, participants are invited by the group leader to reflect on deepening and integrating one’s mindfulness practice in daily life, so it transforms one’s way of life, can support choices that are healthier and life-enhancing. According to the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society, founded in 1995 at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center to organize the growth of MBSR program around the world, over 17000 individuals have already taken part in this intervention (CFM, 2007). 
MBSR continued to be the most well-researched mindfulness-based intervention.  A meta-analytic review of the MBSR research literature found a moderate effect size of training for studies using pre-post single group or between group designs (Baer, 2003). Individuals diagnosed with cancer who participate in MBSR experience a decrease in their level of mood disturbances and stress-related symptoms (Speka, Carlson, Goodey, &amp; Angen, 2000), an improvement in the quality of their sleep (Shapiro, S.L., Bootzin, R.R., Figueredo, A.J., Lopez, A.M., &amp; Schwartz, G.E., 2003) as well as an increase in their quality of life  (Carlson, Speca, Patel, &amp; Goddey, 2003). Individuals experiencing chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982) and fibromyalgia (Kaplan,  Goldenberg, &amp; Gavlin-Nadeau, 1993) also experience significant long-lasting physical and mental health benefits (Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, &amp; Sellers, 1987).
With regard to specific mental health issues, individuals with anxiety disorders (e.g., panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder) find considerable relief from anxiety and depressive symptoms from participating in the program (Kabat-Zinn,  Massion, Kristeller, Peterson, Fletcher, Pbert, 1992). They also report that the improvement in their condition is maintained at three-year follow-up (Miller, Fletcher, &amp; Kabat-Zinn, 1995). The MBSR program has also been offered to individuals with binge eating disorder resulting in decreased binges frequency as well as improvements in depressive and anxious symptomatology (Kabat-Zinn, Massion, Kristeller, Peterson, Fletcher, Pbert, L., et al., 1992; Kristeller, &amp; Hallet, 1999) 
Recent development in mindfulness-based interventions
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy.  Segal, Williams, and Teasdale (2000) adapted the traditional MBSR training to group cognitive therapy to reduce relapse risk of individuals diagnosed with major depression. Their program, MBCT, is structured in much the same way as MBSR. However, while both MBSR and MBCT involve didactic components focusing on the nature and impact of stress and various aspects of mindfulness practice, the MBCT program goes further and includes discussions of themes that have direct relevance to cognitive therapy (e.g., tendency towards judgment and consequences of judgment; emotions are the consequences of the pairing of situation and interpretation). MBCT has been shown to be an effective way to prevent depressive relapse in individuals who have had multiple major depressive episodes (Ma,  &amp; Teasdale, 2004; Teasdale, Moore, Hayhurst, Pope, Williams, &amp; Segal, 2002; Teasdale, Segal,  Williams, Ridgeway, Soulsby, &amp; Lau, 2000).
Mindfulness-based wellness education. The MBSR and MBCT programs were designed for clinical populations. The latest structured mindfulness-based intervention, Mindfulness-Based Wellness Education  was designed by  Mackenzie, Soloway and Poulin (2006) for non-clinical populations, in particular, individuals working in human services professions. These professions are known for their high rates of burnout and staff turnover. Its short-term effectiveness has been demonstrated with a group of  teachers in training and its longer term benefits are currently being examined (Poulin, in progress).

Thank you! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 23:44, 8 May 2007 (UTC)
: I don't know if you'll get this (I'm not so sure how to use this yet). Yes, this is a class project.
::Yes, I got the message, thank you for the reply! Does your professor have a username here that I can use for contact, or does the professor have an email address I can use? I would really like to get in touch, to make sure your project gets off to a good start.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi everyone!

I'm Lisa C., and I'm going into my second year of the PhD program in Counselling Psychology (Registration Stream) this coming September.  My research interests are in the area of intimate relationships and couples counselling.  Currently, I am editing a version of my masters thesis on the relationship between experiences of romantic love, gender (including trans) and sexual orientation.  I am also working on a research study on the history of LGBT research, specifically how language in reference to those in the LGBT community has changed in the literature from the early 1980's to the current day.

As for hobbies, I enjoy traveling, gardening, painting, decorating, surfing the web and engaging in social networking on facebook... although, between school and caring for my 14 month old son, I don't have much time for such ventures!  Therefore, I would have to include going for long walks with the stroller, playing peek-a-boo, playing with megablocks, tickle fights, going to the kiddie park, watching sesame street etc, etc, as part of my interests outside the world  of academia!

Good luck to you all in this course!</text>

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.

Thanks for your efforts this term.  I was just wondering if there is any way we could get some feedback/comments as a class on this project?  I feel like we've put so much work into this and I have no idea as to whether we have met expectations, etc.  It sort of feels like being left hanging because I have no idea what you think about what we've done here.  Is there any way that perhaps you could post some feedback/comments on this message board before the grades are submitted to the registrar's office?
Thanks in advance,

==URGENT - PLEASE READ==

Hi everyone... Please do not change the names of our chapters, which are links on our main page, without adhering to the following procedure.  Basically what happens if you just change the name of the link is that a new page is created and all the contents of the previous chapter/link name are lost.  So, the best thing to do is to copy and paste the contents of the chapter into word, then change the chapter/link name, click on it, and paste the chapter contents back in.  If you are not entirely confident of this procedure, please refrain from changing chapter/link names on our main page and have someone do it who is.  Anyone who is urgent to make changes to our main page (who is not clear on what I am talking about) can email me at lcouperthwaite@oise.utoronto.ca or post a message here.  Thanks! --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 18:01, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

Sorry, I'm not that technologically savvy.  If it is not possible, then we will just have to let Michel know given that I think that this is what he stated he wanted as an 'introduction' to each chapter - Krisgass

== Idea for a new structure ==

I think today is the day we were going to decide on a structure for the book and work on creating linkages, etc.

I was looking over the content posted up to now (noon on Tuesday) and I was thinking that maybe we'd like to break the book into 4 sections, which could then be subdivided into chapters.

After the initial introduction, I was thinking the sections would go:

1. Early Contributions to the Field of Psychology
   a. Philosophical Roots of Psychology
   b. Pseudoscientific Schools of Thought
   c. Establishment of the field/Wundt.
2. Models of Development
   a. Attachment
   b. Personality Development AND Personality Testing
   c. Cognitive Development
   d. Social Development
   e. Moral Development
   f. Controversies about Human Development INCLUDING Nature/Nurture Debate
3. Models of Learning, Intelligence, and Assessment
   a. Learning Theory
   b. Theories of Intelligence
   c. Models of Assessment
   d. Research on Attention
4. Mental &quot;Disorder&quot;: Identification, Treatment, and Controversy
   a. DSM and other diagnostic systems and controversy
   b. Clinical treatment: Key Figures, models of treatment, effectiveness
   c. Specific Disorders

I think this outlines includes everything except Edward K. Strong and vocational testing (it's only a paragraph though, so we could probably just cut it) and the Attention section, which is very large, but I was having a hard time fitting it in. There's a few places I could see it sort of fitting, but it's so large, it will overwhelm everything else. Should we give it its own section?

Anyway, this was just an idea. I thought it might give us a starting point for our discussion tonight. --[[User:Jtheule|Jtheule]] 16:10, 12 June 2007 (UTC)


:It sounds pretty good to me, I think... EXCEPT for the part on &quot;Development of the field of Psychology&quot; because that is way to sparse to be its own section.  We are missing stuff about the physiological roots of psychology (i.e. Darwin, Broca, etc)... to have a section like that we should also probably have a sub-sections on Freud, Behaviorism, the cognitive revolution, etc.  I'm not sure how we do this because a lot of these things are elaborated upon in other sections.  For example, I know the part on attention has a lot about behaviorism and there is stuff on Freud in various sections, and there's info on the cognitive revolution within the &quot;Models of Development&quot; section.  So... I'm not sure that we should make only  &quot;Philosophical Roots of Psychology&quot;, &quot;Pseudoscientific Schools of Thought&quot; and &quot;Establishment of the field/Wundt&quot; under such a huge &quot;section&quot; of Development of the Field of Psychology... I think the whole wikibook undertakes to display this development.  Maybe we need to talk about the development of the field of psychology in the introduction and say that this is displayed throughout the paper in various sections... also touch on the point that this project is far from all inclusive, and probably elude to this being a &quot;mosaic&quot; of ideas and that it therefore is like a patchwork quilt, without everything necessarily flowing from one section to the next.  Just some ideas... looking forward to talking about this more tonight. --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 18:25, 12 June 2007 (UTC)


::I really like the newly proposed structure.  Here are some of my suggestions: I am wondering if we could include the attention section and the vocational section under a category called &quot;Special Topics&quot;.  Also, I am wondering if we need a foreword before each section that will describe what the reader can expect to read about?--[[User:Aregina|Aregina]] 00:15, 13 June 2007 (UTC)


::The linked pages have been created based on the proposed structure &amp; discussion. Lisa and I will continue to move text to these sections, if anyone wants to work on the sections that have already been moved! Go ahead! And if there is anything that is not quite right with the work done, please step in!--[[User:Ppoulin|Ppoulin]] 10:53, 13 June 2007 (UTC)


:::All text have now been moved into the new sections.  Writing of introductions to each section can now begin!  Let's make this flow now and I think we will be finished (although I think this will have to continue to remain a work in progres for other classes)... --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 15:31, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

== opps! ==

I just realized, after doing some extensive editing and adding of new info that I was not &quot;logged in&quot;.  Now I am wondering how many other times I may have contributed things to the wikibook this way.  For the record, activity today from IP address 74.117.144.205 was from me!  For others who may have done the same at some point and wish to receive credit for their work, perhaps you may want to add a note like this for Michel's awareness.  Thanks everybody...
--[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 21:17, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the heads up on this issue. I just noticed I did the same thing. So, just for the purpose of identifying contributions, I just posted under Freud, which came up as IP address 74.112.162.158. I also need to examine what other parts of the book this was an issue for me this weekend. --[[User:Jpereira|Jpereira]] 05:14, 12 June 2007 (UTC)Jessica Pereira

::Me too... I think I was logged off by accident.  I just posted under Human Development  - Longstanding Questions, which came up as IP address  69.158.97.34.  Thanks for alerting me to the issue.--[[User:Aregina|Aregina]] 07:04, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

::: I have this problem too!!! I posted the following sections: Existential therapy &amp; key figures, Gestalt therapy &amp; key figures, &amp; Solution Focused Brief Therapy &amp; Key Figures. My IP address is 74.99.40.187. Sorry for the confusion! --[[User:Abuxton|Abuxton]] 00:11, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

== To complete or not? ==

I think we're all struggling with the idea of how to complete this project in any satisfactory way in the week we have left.

I was wondering whether we might want to take a whole different approach.

It's my understanding that another section of this course will be taught in the fall. 

I was thinking that maybe we'd design our project to be taken over by them. Over successive generations of this course that may actually result in a real History of Psychology textbook being created! It would of course have both negative and positive effects on future classes (e.g., it would give them a starting place, but would also restrict their choices of topic somewhat--there's still lots to be covered though!). The idea of this book going through different groups also seems very &quot;wiki&quot; to me. Any thoughts? The idea would of course be subject to Michel's approval, but would help us deal with issues of not covering a broad enough scope. --[[User:Jtheule|Jtheule]] 23:48, 7 June 2007 (UTC)


:I think this is a fantastic idea! --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 23:52, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:I second this idea. An evolving wiki is what is supposed to happen, right? Although I think there is a different instructor for the course in the Fall term. --[[User:Abuxton|Abuxton]] 17:14, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:I definitely think that that is a good idea. I think that the professors name is Richard Volpe. He has taught the course before I believe so he may already have an outline he is used to following. However, running this by him may be successful so it is worth a shot. If not, I would recommend in the future to maybe only attempt this project during terms running from sept-april. It is a good idea and has been an interesting project but I think that a summer school class goes by so quick that it is difficult to grasp, learn, and complete such a project fully in 5 or 6 weeks.--[[User:Mattinaj|Mattinaj]] 17:57, 8 June 2007 (UTC)


:I think you all are doing a great job, and this is a good idea if the intent is to allow another class to continue where you left off. If you want I can make a PDF version of what you all have done so far (when you're finished that is, no point to doing one now when you're gonna continue editing it), just leave a message on my talk page. It could be interesting just to see the result of all your hard work in an easy to see (and static) format!

== Decision made on June 5th regarding completing the project == 

The last day to submit contributions to the main text is Tuesday June 12 by the beginning of the class. We will have a discussion about the structure of the text during that class and spend the last few days focusing on structuring / tying &amp; tidying things up.

If you have any suggested structure, bring something concrete so we can compare notes and make some decisions.  --[[User:Ppoulin|Ppoulin]] 00:43, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== ADHD Section ==

Hi everyone,

I had written some stuff on ADHD when it was in the &quot;linked&quot; page. I notice that it has been unlinked and included in the text, but the content I had written is gone too. I take no offense to that, but wanted to check in that that was intentional and not just the by-product of it being moved into the main text. Can someone just clarify that they will write that section and then I'll move on and go do something else? --[[User:Jtheule|Jtheule]] 23:59, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi... you should be able to go back in the history and recover. Maybe someone can help you with this in class on Tues? I see some things have been added recently, so maybe this is ok now?  Let me know and I can try to help in class if needed.  --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 21:21, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi. I'm one of the people who wrote in the ADHD section, and I just asked the other two people, and none of us have deleted your section (so, definitely not intentional!).  As Lisa said, I'm sure it can be recovered by looking through the history, and when you find it, please feel free to integrate as needed it into what's there now.--[[User:Pigondan|Pigondan]] 18:10, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

== Structure of the main page ==

I suggest adding a third header in the &quot;Clinical&quot; subsection called: biopsychosocial. This would allow for integrative material to be added there as opposed to be forced into a &quot;biological&quot; or &quot;psychological&quot; category. --[[User:Ppoulin|Ppoulin]] 00:22, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

== Opinions about assigning Homework in Psychotherapy ==

This section has been developed due to a discussion I had with a fellow classmate about the use of homework in therapy. My own opinion is that homework to clients throughout therapy, and encouraging compliance, is beneficial to the client. Coming from a CBT perspective, I have made use of many homework assignments that have been mutually agreed upon and devised by myself and clients. Anyone else's view about this issue would be welcome. --[[User:Mattinaj|Mattinaj]] 00:16, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

:I certainly encourage individuals to engage in therapy-related activities outside sessions (e.g., take time to do mindfulness exercise, journal experience). My approach is bridges mindfulness-based clinical care &amp; process experiential therapy. However, I don't give &quot;homework&quot; and I do not see &quot;compliance&quot; as necessarily a &quot;good thing.&quot; Homework and checking compliance can set the therapist up as &quot;parent&quot; or &quot;teacher.&quot; I.e., &quot;Did you do your homework?&quot; And can start setting up the client as having done something &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;letting the therapist down&quot; for not having completed homework.  I can see that in short term therapy focusing on a very specific issue, that this would not be detrimental and the homework could be beneficial. But in longer therapy, these dynamics can be detrimental.--[[User:Ppoulin]]

:: Much of my clinical training and experience in the provision of psychotherapy has been within the cognitive-behavioral fold too, and certainly homework assignments have been an integral part of the treatment programs in which I’ve been involved.  Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) is the dominant paradigm in correctional and forensic psychiatric settings when the explicit aim of treatment is a reduction in criminal, particularly violent, behavior (although psychopharmacology is obviously also an element, often as an adjunct to CBT, in cases involving psychiatric disorders as well as impulse and aggression control difficulties).  For example, in the treatment of sexual offenders, foci for homework assignments include the identification of thinking errors, the enhancement of empathy, elucidation of pathways to offence behaviors, and social skills development.  CBT for sexual offenders follows a fairly standardized model in North America, Europe, and Australasia with homework (which might be more appropriately but less therapeutically labeled ‘cell work’ for offenders participating in programs while incarcerated) frequently providing the source of much in-session discussion.  In group settings I’ve found that offenders seem better able to grasp the issues when things are more concretely considered; the group’s scrutiny of homework presentations often greatly facilitates this process.  Unfortunately, process variables have been somewhat neglected in evaluation research in this area and relatively little attention has been given to the impact of homework on outcome or the possible role of homework as a mediating or moderating variable.  I’ll have a look at the broader psychotherapy literature and see if I can prepare a paragraph or two with a historical slant for inclusion in the project. --[[User:LHobbes|LHobbes]] 17:59, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

::: In regard to the second posting in this discussion, I agree that “homework” and “compliance” are not “necessarily” a good thing in that ‘homework’ without therapeutic benefit and a patient’s ‘compliance’ (instead of investment and engagement in the therapy process) would not be expected to predict positive outcomes.  If a patient doesn’t see the benefit of a ‘between session’ undertaking (whether a written assignment encouraging reflection on an issue or experience, or an in vivo experiment such as inviting a colleague out for a coffee) the undertaking is unlikely to have the effect that the therapist desires.  But this seems more a failure of the therapist to effectively ‘collaborate’ with the patient and ensure that any therapeutic work (done during or between sessions) is mutually agreed upon (see first posting in this discussion).  I found one study that showed that patients’ follow-through on therapists’ recommendations during therapy varied according to the degree of ‘match’ between the patient’s problem and the recommendation, the difficulty level of the recommendation, and the degree to which the recommendation drew on the client’s strengths (Conoley et al., 1994).  These three variables seem like a good set for guiding therapists when they are devising self-help assignments with their patients.  The other point I wanted to comment on here concerned the dynamics you mention.  I agree that the dynamics you describe (“set the therapist up as &quot;parent&quot; or &quot;teacher.&quot; I.e., &quot;Did you do your homework?&quot;… setting up the client as having done something &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;letting the therapist down&quot; for not having completed homework”) are likely counterproductive in most psychotherapeutic contexts.  But I don’t see an unavoidable link between these dynamics and the use of self-help assignments in therapy.  I also don’t see why the use of self-help assignments that are agreed upon and carried out in between therapy sessions “could be beneficial” in short term psychotherapy but would necessarily be “detrimental” in longer term psychotherapy.  I appreciate we’re being pretty general here (space and time preclude more specific consideration of presenting problems and concerns of patients) but why the presumed difference in effectiveness as a function of therapy length? --[[User:LHobbes|LHobbes]] 18:45, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

:I agree fully with this last post. In line with what I stated at the beginning of this discussion, I would argue that homework assignments, and compliance with homework would be beneficial if mutually devised and agreed upon. Any attempts on the therapists part to force tasks on the client (within or outside of the therapy session), would likely result in a poor response on the clients part and be detrimental to the therapeutic relationship. Furthermore, the idea of being the teacher or parent may come about if a therapist presents him/herself as this. However, if the therapist is successful in creating a safe space, and does not take the &quot;expert&quot; role necessarily, and discusses options with the clients and reviewing possible pro's and con's, I do not see this process leading all clients to feel inferior and subordinate. And finally, I am too a bit confused why you believe that homework may be successful for short term rather than longer term therapy. My guess would be that it may be more successful in longer term therapy as it would allow the client and therapist to form a stronger bond before getting involved in tasks outside of session.--[[User:Mattinaj|Mattinaj]] 18:06, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:: Regarding the shrot vs long term therapy comment, I was referring to the risk / benefits of transference / countertransferance that can arise with therapist becoming more directive with regard to homework in the long run. Of course, this happens with or without homework and agreement on extra-therapy work does not have to be done in a directive manner. --[[User:Ppoulin|Ppoulin]] 11:38, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:: Rich dicussion! I don't disagree with homework. On the contrary, I find that engagement with therapeutic actions outside the therapy room can be very beneficial. Individuals can be encouraged to take charge of their process and become more autonomous. I simply have some caution... --[[User:Ppoulin|Ppoulin]] 11:38, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

==Cognitive and Social Development: Same or Different?==
Students of both cognitive and social development have recently tried to bridge the two sub-disciplines. This trend has been influenced by the notion that cognitions and emotions are inextricably linked, and thus cannot be studied in isolation of each other. However, at which point did the study of social and cognitive development diverge into two distinct areas of focus? Should they continue to be different? Can we attribute this divergence to the &quot;cogntiive revolution&quot;, and if so, is it up to the &quot;cognitivists&quot; to bridge the gap? --[[User:Leef|Leef]] 00:21, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

:Interesting question.  Although I risk over-simplifing the differences (in theory, methodologies, etc.) between these two areas, my view is that the two (social and cognitive psychology) do share common ground, as represented by the general approach to the study of the individual in a social context known as social cognition.  Social cognition is concerned with the types and content of information stored in memory, how this information is represented and organized, the influence that such information has on perceiving and interpreting social information, and how new information is integrated with existing knowledge and memories (Bodenhausen &amp; Lambert, 2003; Sherman, Judd, &amp; Park, 1989).  The approach has generated a considerable body of research that has greatly advanced understanding of the way people function as active social perceivers.  Importantly, all individuals have limited cognitive resources (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991; Muraven, Tice, &amp; Baumeister, 1998) so some processing must be automatic (that is, beyond conscious awareness or at least conscious control, Bargh, 1994, 1999), involving heuristic strategies (mental short cuts and rules of thumb) based on pre-existing knowledge (Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 2003; Macrae, Milne, &amp; Bodenhausen, 1994) to offset the demands of engaging in systematic, effortful processing.  In conjunction with motivations (Higgins &amp; Molden, 2003), the content and organization of prior knowledge and memories is a key determinant, through the generation of expectancies (Hamilton &amp; Garcia-Marques, 2003) and hypothesis-confirming biases (Darley &amp; Gross, 1983), of what is attended to and how it is appraised.  Given the active role of the social perceiver in this essentially subjective process, it is unsurprising that errors of interpretation and judgment can result (Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980; Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974).

:Having read this over I appreciate that I have neatly neglected the developmental aspect of your question, Jon.  I only go into as much detail as I have because a number of clinical disorders and maladaptive behaviours have been productively considered from the social cognition (and cognitive science) approach (e.g., Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994; Ingram, 1986; Huesmann, 1998; Wenzel &amp; Rubin, 2005).  The chief relevance of my comments to your initial question lie in the possible value of including social cognition and cognitive science as an approach (or approaches, depending on how sharply one chooses to distinguish between the two) that has contributed to theory and treatment in the psychotherapy section on which we're working.--[[User:LHobbes|LHobbes]] 00:03, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

== Class Discussion on Structure and Direction of our Wikibook ==

=== Definition of C. Psych ===

Although I do not remember anybody following up on this discussion, I was curious about the term C. Psych. Instead of C. Psych meaning a Ph.D in Clinical Psychology, I found out that as one of our classmates pointed out, it stands for
  
==&gt; Certified (Registered) Psychologist in Ontario

As such, those of us in the Counselling Psychology Program, who meet criteria to register as a psychologist would have this label as well. I do not believe there are any other psychology programs that prepare students to register, but if anybody else knows of any I would interested to know?--[[User:Mattinaj|Mattinaj]] 18:16, 8 June 2007 (UTC) 


=== Lost Client Centered Info while Formatting ===

I had originally wrote quite a bit under client centered therapy and carl rogers, which was linked to another page. I no longer see the link and notice that everything has been put into one full wiki book. Unless I missed it I wonder if by accident somebody erased the whole section? If so, is there a way to retrieve it and then cut and paste it?--[[User:Mattinaj|Mattinaj]] 21:13, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

=== General info re face-to face discussion ===

Hi everyone, I've tried to represent the endpoint of our discussion in class tonight here. These aren't necessarily my opinions, but are the consensus (I think--please correct me where I'm wrong).

One important step for the implementation of the other steps is that everyone post everything they have immediately. If you're going to write something, but haven't had a chance, an outline indicating the topic of each paragraph may be helpful.
:Quite an impressive overview, thnx! Just for our records: this discussion took place on May, 24, 2007. --[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] 05:31, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

=== Title/guiding theme ===

It was suggested we change the title of our Wikibook to: ''A History of Psychology: People, Concepts, and Applications.''

It was further suggested, that rather than having a a guiding question or theme to direct our book, we use this title and the structure it implies.

::I like this new title much better than the original one, I say we keep it.--[[User:JaneM|JaneM]] 23:43, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

::The new title gives a better understanding as to what this book is really about and I think it would be a very good change for the sake of the reader.--[[User:Nylanm|Nylanm]] 00:31, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

=== Structure of book ===

It was suggested we use the new title of the book to structure it. This means that each section would have a people, concepts, and applications subsection.

I'm not sure how this fits, but I have written down that we should organize book by &quot;people&quot; and within each section we should organize the information chronologically.

We would also put a short introduction at the beginning of each chapter (the people who worked on this chapter could discuss this) and a &quot;why we chose this question/discussion question&quot; at the end of each section. We could discuss the importance of this information to us personally on the Discussion page.

There was some concern though that the three-part structure above, does not fit all sections well (e.g., diagnostics). Michel pointed out though that we will still receive credit for sections we eventually choose to delete.

==== Linked pages ====

We will also &quot;bring in&quot; all linked pages. We may choose to link out lots of pages at the end, but for now it seems that this is an easier way to monitor the book.

::Great idea!! I personally didn't even know that we had linked pages until this issue came during our class discussion.--[[User:JaneM|JaneM]] 23:46, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

==== References ====

Overall, we agreed to put a reference section at the end of the book. All references will go in together.

I think we decided to use APA style rather than footnote (someone please confirm).

Also, not all sections have citations or references at all. Everyone should put the references and citations they used in the text as soon as they have a chance.

:Yes I agree that we should use APA style referencing.  Perhaps we can add a page to the table of  contents entitled References (as a direct link).  Perhaps I will do that now:)--[[User:Jhieminga|Jhieminga]] 00:07, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

::So do we need to transfer the references that we put in the text to the References page or is the &quot;editing committe&quot; going to do it?--[[User:JaneM|JaneM]] 23:47, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

::For referencing conventions in wiki please see [[Talk:Applied_History_of_Psychology#Referencing_question|Referencing_question]] on this page. --[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] 23:50, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

=== Introduction &amp; &quot;work in progress&quot;===

The introduction needs to be rewritten. It was suggested that it specifically comment that this is a &quot;work in progress&quot; and that the gaps are a result of this being a student project representing the interests and knowledge of the class.

Further, it should not be written until the book is more filled-out.
:Work in progress can be indicated by such neat wikibooks tool as Wikibook Development Stages, see [[Help:Development stages]].
:''Example'': beside the title of a section/chapter on the main page  we can put '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage|25%|May 25, 2007}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' (meaning that as of May 25, 2007 the section is 25% complete), which will be represented as such icon: {{stage|25%|May 25, 2007}} (meaning actually the same). :Here is a full table of development stages: {{stages}}:-- just change the percent number in the code above, which may have one of the following values: 0--25--50--75--100. For some examples of how it looks in real life :), see, for instance, such projects as [[Social Psychology]] (in its inception for the last two years) or [[Introduction to Sociology]] ([[Featured books|featured book]], a very well developed--yet still incomplete!!--project).  Hope this helps --[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] 06:13, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

=== Formatting Team ===

Everyone seems to be all for a formatting team of about 3 classmates. In exchange for reduced expectations for content contributions, they would determine an appropriate and consistent format for the book and implement it.

Some specific tasks for them include: standardizing the bulletting and bolding, and noticing gaps in the book and indicating them (in the text of the book itself).

I think this team would be responsible for ensuring the other structure, etc. suggestions get put into practice. (Can someone else please confirm this impression?)
:And here is a ''caveat'': if these three individuals will be the only persons who will know the formatting conventions for the whole project, we will inevitably face a pretty weird situation when the text that will be continuously produced by the 'writers' will necessarily have to be reformatted by the editors. Instead, I would propose the idea that actually was also expressed during our meeting: developing a universal formatting conventions for the overall project (and this, indeed, might be the work for a number of 'designers' or might also be a group decision by all team members), familiarizing everyone with our 'style', and using it while producing the text. That would save a lot of time and energy, I believe. In this case, I guess, the point of discussion in this section should be Formatting Conventions rather than Formatting Team... --[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] 05:47, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

::I think that we could have a team responsible for formatting (i.e. three classmates) yet still have the formatting conventions known to all.  That way, we could try our best to stick to the agreed-upon format, but the &quot;formatting team&quot; would be the experts and ensure things are corrected.  Thus, such a team would inherently need to be made up of perfectionists!  I'm sure we have lots of those in this class... this is, afterall, graduate school! --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 23:54, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

Our plan is to go through and make the book look consistent.  In the interest of time (only 2 weeks left)we thought we would come up with a structure ourselves that was consistent. However, if anyone does not like a change we make let us know and we will alter the book again another way.  Similarly, if anyone has any suggestions for how they think it should look let us know.  --[[User:Jhieminga|Jhieminga]] 00:27, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

'''Formatting Guidelines'''
*Paragraphs will be separated by a blank line and will not be indented.
*Long quotes (more than 30 words) will be placed in a separate paragraph and indented once.
*Any lists (including timelines) will be formatted with bullets. For timelines, the date will be bolded.
*All references will be in APA format, and listed at the end of the book. Referencing will be done throughout the document in the form (Author, Year) and if using a direct quotation, (Author, Year, p. #).
*The chapters will be organized into different general sections, and under each section will be the specific topics. For instance, Models of Human Development (3) is the chapter, with Personality Development (3.1) as the section, and Sigmund Freud (3.1.1) as the topic.
*Subheadings in each section will be in bold.
*All information will be on the main page.

=='''When did the concept of &quot;Childhood&quot; begin? What impact has it had on psychology?'''==
Developmental and child psychologists focus on childhood developments and experiences. However, it is important to consider what we mean by &quot;childhood&quot;, and how we treat children in our culture. Historically, notions of childhood have evolved, and have therefore impacted the way society treats children. I argue that the way a culture treats its children reflects and impacts the way in which that culture treats other vulnerable members. --[[User:Leef|Leef]] 00:21, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
Another question is how psychology has influenced the concept of childhood in our society. The emphasis on how childhood influences later experiences has had a particular impact on our society's attitude toward childhood. --[[User:Leef|Leef]] 00:21, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

::In Phillipe Aries’ article from &quot;Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life&quot;, he states that “there was no place for childhood in the medieval world” because it does not appear or exist in medieval art. Aries engages in “iconography” – the study of drawings or figures. He observed medieval art and found that actual children were absent, but in their place stood deformations of children – mainly smaller scaled men.  Aries theorizes that the reason for the absence of children in medieval art is because of parental indifference due to the high infant mortality rate. Aries argues that it was in the 17th century when childhood was discovered because portraits of children became more common, especially the nude child. He points out the image of the “putto” or the “putti” cherubs – the precursor to the child nude. 

::Some flaws in Aries’ claims are as follows:
::a. He ignored other medieval sources.
::b. Medieval art focused on status as documents for the person’s position – and therefore children were at a lower rank and not painted.
::c. He assumes a modern concept that he can recognize. The failure of the theory is our fault that we do not know about medieval childhood because we were not there.
::d. He stops at the 17th century and the 18th is a crucial part in the theory and depiction of childhood.
::e. He read the art with an answer already in his mind.

::I think that Aries did bring a lot of awareness, despite his flaws. He emphasizes changes over time and place, as well as shifts in attitude with social history. He was very groundbreaking in his claims.  He brought forth many ideas that are still debated and researched today. --[[User:LisaCouper|LisaCouper]] 18:38, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

==Skinner==

I had the opportunity to hear Skinner's daughter and her husband speak on the topic of Verbal Behaviour at the ABA conference in San Diego a few weeks ago.  It was extremely interesting to hear about the making of his book from the perspective of his daughter who herself is a behaviour analyst.  She showed many original handwritten drafts of Skinner's letters to Keller regarding the book he took so many years to write entitled Verbal Behavior.  She also showed charts that Skinner made comparing himself to Darwin and his writing of the Origin of Species.  For example, Darwin took from 1830 to 1859 (29years) to write Origin of the Species and Skinner took from 1934 to 1957 (22years) to complete Verbal Behavior.  The underlying process of Darwin's book was Uniformitarism requiring millions of years and Skinners underlying process of VB was uniform relations (from lab) requiring time to evolve.  Darwin's book covered the continuity of life and Skinner's the continuity of behaviour etc.

From the few personal reflections Skinner's daughter made on her childhood it sounded as though Skinner was a very caring and concerned father.  For example, he moved his research to be near a school he thought would be best for his 2 daughters he raised his daughters himself for a year while his wife traveled the world.  She spoke highly of her father and her childhood negating any preconceived notion that I may have had that Skinner was a workaholic and a man who analyzed his daughters behaviour as if they were an experiment.  These preconceived notions of mine came from his research that he did entitled The Baby Tender which he had published in a womens magazine called Lady's Home Journal.  The Baby Tender which was designed to enclose heat in his daughters crib using plexiglass windows and to protect her from getting a limb stuck in between the bars of the crib (both concerns of his wifes).  He was very proud of his invention but confusion between the the Baby Tender and the 'Skinner box' inevitably occurred a controversy Skinner never formally addressed (perhaps because it was an outrageous accusation that had no truth).  Notable his daughter Deborah has no ill feelings or bad memories of this experience and did not try to kill herself because of it.  Sounds like an E True Hollywood story!!!--[[User:Jhieminga|Jhieminga]] 23:35, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

==Piaget==

Based on our discussion in class this evening we sketched out Affect as stages related to Piaget's Intelligence stages.  It it implied that you must have attained the previous stage prior to moving on to the next stage of affect.  However, I would questions that a person could be missing a stage of affect and still display characteristics of further stages.  For example,  we sketched out that one moves from no object relations (momentary interests)to sympathy (others have feelings) to having will and finally to idealogy.  Could a person who lacks sympathy and does not appear aware or care about others feelings not have will and ideology?  Just a thought.  Any further thoughts?--[[User:Jhieminga|Jhieminga]] 23:35, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

:Piaget's stage model has been criticized for underestimating children's abilities (for example, child are less egocentric than he believed), and for not taking into account contextual factors that could influence a child's development (such as culture and heredity). There is also research that indicates that not all adults reach the formal operations stage. Thus, there are many reasons why Piaget's stage model (both for cognitive development and affect) does not hold for all individuals. I agree that it is possible for a person who lacks sympathy to have will and ideology. Also, even at the highest stage of affect (ideology, such as belief in a religion) it is possible that those individuals have not reached the formal operations stage, and thus display illogical reasoning and disregard for others' feelings. I've learned to look at Piaget's model as a general description of development that is not attained in full (or even in sequence) for many individuals, but is interesting nonetheless for contributing to discussions of development and education. --[[User:Lpbatho|Lpbatho]] 17:04, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

==Treatment effectiveness==
I just read the section on treatment effectiveness, really great by the way, and something came to mind.  This actually came up as a discussion question in class but I wonder what other people's opinions are.  Would you continue using a treatment that was not empirically valid or had no empirical research on it when treating clients?  In my line of work, (ABA for children with autism) I would say no.  Parents claim that alternative therapies with no research behind them often work, and are the cause of the behaviour change of their child, not the comprehensive behaviour intervention programs developed by myself and the rest of the clinical team.
What do people think about &quot;fad&quot; or &quot;trendy&quot; treatments?  Some that come to mind for treating children with autism include water therapy, GFCF (Gluten free, casein free) diets, vitamin/mineral supplements, holding therapy, dolphin therapy and other animal therapies, floor time play, sensory integration, auditory integration, the Son Rise method, yoga therapy, and the list goes on...
If clients/parents think these treatments are working is it ethical for us as practitioners to continue to use them?

:This is a very interesting question. Many people who are experiencing suffering will rely on a number of approaches to support their recovery or that of their children. I do think that we have a role to play in supporting individuals to make informed choices, I also feel that we should be cautious about adopting practices that are not supported by research, but I disagree with saying that we should only rely on EBT... some approaches lend themselves well to a randomized control design but others do not and shouldn't necessarily be discarded because of that (although the onus is on us to carefully weight the reasons why we would or would not adopt or continue to use these approaches). 

:I focus here on the fact that many people will rely on traditional forms of medicines that are part of their culture or that they have been exposed to. Roy Moodley focuses his work on the integration of traditional healing in counselling and psychotherapy (see Moodley &amp; West, 2005). Premature termination and poor outcome can result from lack of sensitivity to the various ways of healing that our clients value. In some cases, integrating these forms of healing is a crucial ingredient to recovery for individuals and their community (e.g., use of ceremony for some indigenous peoples' recovery / healing).

:A number of psychologist have taken the time to train in various forms of traditional healing (e.g., Aryurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy). These individuals are sough after by many who want this integrated form of care or even by psychologists/psychiatrists/physicians who have clients who do not respond well to &quot;conventional&quot; therapy. Some of the treatments they integrate are time-tested (for what this is worth), but may not lend themselves well to &quot;our&quot; standards. Others have a large body of research supporting their utilization but such research is often not recognized by &quot;western-trained&quot; individuals because of conflicting epistemologies/ontologies (e.g., large body of  litterature on acupuncture). --[[User:Ppoulin|Ppoulin]] 12:30, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

For an interesting perspective on research methodologies, check out Linda Tuhiway Smith's book: Decolonizing methodologies: Research and indigenous people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''metal match''', or 'firesteel' has become synonymous with so called 'artificial flints' which are metal rods of varying size composed of ferrocerium, an alloy of iron and mischmetal.  Mischmetal is an alloy primarily of cerium that will generate sparks when struck.  Iron is added to improve the strength of the rods.  Small shavings are torn off the rod with either a supplied metal scraper, a piece of hacksaw blade, or, commonly, the back of a knife ground at a suitable angle. These shavings then ignite at high temperatures, and they are much more effective than their historical equivalent.

While it takes practice and properly prepared tinder to create a sustained fire, the modern firesteel is considered by survival instructors and serious outdoorspeople to be one of the most reliable ways of making fire in severe conditions.  Two good examples of firesteel are made by Light My Fire and Blastmatch.  The sparks produced by these products are extremely hot, {{units|3000 C°|5500 F°}}, and easily light toilet paper or small pieces of wood or commercial tinder products.

Traditionally a flint and steel were used; however, the flint was not the important part.  With a proper striker, you can get sparks using any hard, non-porous rock that has a sharp edge, even petrified wood.  The spark comes from chipping small pieces of steel off the striker; finely divided metals ignite immediately in air, with steel burning at yellow-white heat.

Charpaper can be used as an intermediate step between the striking and the tinder.  Charpaper is traditionally made from cotton that has been processed into charcoal. You can make charpaper by taking several patches of cotton denim (from an old pair of jeans for example) and laying them one atop another inside a small tin (such as the ones in which Altoids are packaged).  Drill a {{units|3 mm|1/8 inch}} diameter hole in the lid of the tin.  Then throw it into a campfire.  It should smoke, but not ignite, as not enough oxygen can get into the tin.  Once it stops smoking, you can carefully remove it from the fire and let it cool.  You should have several charpapers inside, ready for the ''next'' fire you light.

When a spark comes into contact with charpaper, it makes the charpaper glow, but the charpaper will not ignite. After the charpaper glows, you put it against your tender and blow.  This works much better than attempting to get a spark to stay on the tinder.  Igniting the tinder from the glowing charpaper takes practice.  Too much oxygen and the tinder is consumed without bursting into flame; not enough oxygen, and it simply doesn't light.  But if you get it just right, it will burst into flames rather suddenly.  Be ready for this, as you will then be holding a burning wad of tinder in your hands.  Place it in your pre-laid fire immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SuperCard's send command is the prescribed way to send a URL to a browser:

&lt;pre&gt;
on mouseUp
  send [URL] to program [name of browser] with &quot;GURLGURL&quot; without reply
end mouseUp
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
on mouseUp
  send &quot;http://supercard.us&quot; to program &quot;Safari&quot; with &quot;GURLGURL&quot; without reply
end mouseUp
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem with this method is that your program shouldn't assume that the user wants a URL opened with Safari, or any other specific browser for that matter.

Fortunately, you can load a URL in the user's default browser by using SuperCard's shell function:

&lt;pre&gt;
get shell (&quot;open http://supercard.us&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't want to hard code the URL, you can grab it from a field:

&lt;pre&gt;
on mouseUp
  put [cd/card/bg/background] field [name of field] into [name of variable]
  get shell(&quot;open &quot; &amp; [name of variable])
end mouseUp
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
on mouseUp
  put bg field FieldURL into theURL
  get shell(&quot;open &quot; &amp; theURL)
end mouseUp
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Topic 1 - Algebra=

==Introduction==

The aim of this section is to introduce candidates to some basic algebraic concepts and applications. Number systems are now in the presumed knowledge section.

== Sequences and Series==

A series is a sum of numbers. For example,


&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+...&lt;/math&gt;


A sequence is a list of numbers, usually separated by a comma. The order in which the numbers are listed is important, so for instance,


&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...&lt;/math&gt;


===Finite and Infinite Sequences===
A more formal definition of a finite sequence with terms in a set S is a function from {1,2,...,n} to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for some n ≥ 0. 

An infinite sequence in S is a function from {1,2,...} (the set of natural numbers)

===Arithmetic===

Arithmetic series or sequences simply involve addition.

     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

Is an example of addition, where ''1'' is added each time to the prior term.

The formula for finding the ''n''th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_n = u_1 + (n - 1)d.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; u_n &lt;/math&gt; is the nth term, &lt;math&gt; u_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the first term, d is the difference, and n is the number of terms 


====Sum of Infinite and Finite Arithmetic Series====

An infinite arithmetic series is an infinite series whose terms are in an arithmetic progression. Examples are 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + · · ·.

The sum (Sn) of a finite sequence is:

&lt;math&gt; S_n=\frac{n}{2} \cdot ( 2u_1+(n-1)d)=\frac{n}{2} \cdot ( u_1+u_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Geometric Sequences and Series==

===Sum of Finite and Infinite Geometric Series===

The ''n''th term of a geometric sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u_n = u_1\cdot r^{n - 1}&amp;. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; S_n=\frac{u_1( r^n-1)}{r-1}=\frac{u_1( 1-r^n)}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum of all terms (an infinite geometric sequence):
If -1 &lt; r &lt; 1, then

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{u_1}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

==Exponents==

&lt;math&gt;a^x = b &lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt; log_a \cdot b &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a^x = e^{x \cdot\ln a}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Laws of Exponents===

The algebra section requires an understanding of exponents and manipulating numbers of exponents.  An example of an exponential function is &lt;math&gt;a^c&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' is being raised to the &lt;math&gt;c^{th}&lt;/math&gt; power.  An exponent is evaluated by multiplying the lower number by itself the amount of times as the upper number.  For example, &lt;math&gt;2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8&lt;/math&gt;.  If the exponent is fractional, this implies a root.  For example, &lt;math&gt;4^\frac{1}{2}=\sqrt{4} = 2&lt;/math&gt;.  Following are laws of exponents that should be memorized:
* &lt;math&gt;a^ma^n=a^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(ab)^m = a^mb^m&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a^m)^n = a^{mn}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}&lt;/math&gt;

==Logarithms==

===Laws of Logarithms===

&lt;math&gt; \log_b(xy) = \log_bx + \log_by \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \log_b(\frac{x}{y}) = \log_bx - \log_by &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \log_bx^y = y\log_bx \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Change of Base formula:

: &lt;math&gt; \log_b(a) = \frac{\log_c(a)}{\log_c(b)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, this result implies that all logarithm functions (whatever the base) are similar to each other.  So to calculate the log with base 2 of the number 16 with a calculator:

: &lt;math&gt; \log_2(16) = \frac{\log(16)}{\log(2)}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Binomial Theorem==

The Binomial Expansion Theorem is used to expand functions like &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n&lt;/math&gt; without having to go through the tedious work it takes to expand it through normal means

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n = _nC_0x^ny^0+_nC_1x^{n-1}y^1 + _nC_2x^{n-2}y^2 + ... + _nC_nx^0y^n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For this equation, essentially one would go through the exponents that would occur with the final product of the function (&lt;math&gt;x^ny^0+x^{n-1}y^1+x^{n-2}y^2+...+x^0y^n&lt;/math&gt;). From this &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; comes in as the coefficent, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; equals the row number of the row from Pascal's Triangle, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the specific number from that row.

Ex. &lt;math&gt;7_5=35&lt;/math&gt;

===Pascal's Triangle===
                   1                      =Row 0
                 1   1                    =Row 1
               1   2   1                  =Row 2
             1   3   3   1                =Row 3
           1   4   6   4   1              =Row 4
         1   5  10  10   5   1            =Row 5

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Topic 2 - Functions and Equations=

==Introduction==

The general aim of this section is to explore the notion of function as a unifying theme. Additionally, candidates should be able to apply functional methods to a variety of situations. Use of a GDC (Graphing Display Calculator) is expected.

==Concept of a Function==

===Composite Functions===

A composite function is a function made up of multiple parts, or steps. Before encountering composite functions, you will have seen functions of the form f(x), g(x) and so on. A composite function has another function inside it, and could for example be written as f(g(x)), or g(f(x)). These are said, &quot;f of g of x&quot; and &quot;g of f of x&quot;. f(g(x)) means that the function 'g' is applied to 'x', and then following this, the function 'f' is applied to the output of the function 'g'.
For example, if g(x)=2x+3, and f(x)=x^2, and the composite function was f(g(x)), 'x' would have 'g' applied, and become '2x+3'. '2x+3' subsequently has 'f' applied, and becomes (2x+3)^2.

f(g(x)) does NOT equal g(f(x)).

===Inverse Function===
The inverse function, is as its name signifies, the inverse of a function, shown as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; (f(x)^-1). This is accomplished by substituting &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for one another within the equation, and evaluating the function to where you aim to get the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; variable alone, again.

Examples:



Ex.1

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=x^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x)=(y)^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}=y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;(x)=\sqrt{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;




Ex.2

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x-2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=3x-2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x)=3(y)-2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x+2=3y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x+2}{3}=y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;(x)=\frac{x+2}{3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==The Graph of a Function==

===Horizontal and Vertical Asymptotes===
An asymptote can be described as a line that represents the end behavior of a function. While they may be crossed, they may not be crossed at an infinite number of points. They can be horizontal, vertical, or oblique (diagonal).

For instance, if you look at a visual representation of &lt;math&gt;y=1/x&lt;/math&gt; you will see that while the graph approaches the x-axis, the line &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; it will never touch the line.

===Exponents of the Variables===
When dealing with a function, it s always a good idea to take a look at the highest power the variable(s) are to, among other things. For example, for the equations of &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; the behaviors of these functions differ greatly. With &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt; the function extends from negative infinty from Quadrant III to positive infinity in Quadrant I. While with the function of &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; the function extends from Quadrant II to Quadrant I.

==Transformations of Graphs==

==The Reciprocal Function==
 X ----&gt; 1/x, i.e. f(x) = 1/x is defined as the reciprocal function.

Notice that:

- f(x) = 1/x is meaningless when x = 0
- the graph of f(x) = 1/x exists in the first and third quadrants only
- f(x) = 1/x is symmetric about y = x and y = -x
- f(x) = 1/x is asymptotic (approaches) to the x-axis and to the y-axis

(Source: Mathematics for the international student, Mathematics SL, International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme by John Owen, Robert Haese, Sandra Haese, Mark Bruce)

==The Quadratic Function==
Standard Form

&lt;math&gt;y = ax^2 + bx + c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Vertex or Turning Point Form

&lt;math&gt;y = a(x-h)^2 + k\,\!&lt;/math&gt; , where (h,k) is the vertex

&lt;math&gt;(h,k) = (\frac{-b}{2a},\frac{4ac-b^2}{4a})&lt;/math&gt;
===Axis of Symmetry===

-b/(2a)

===Roots of the equation===

&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

Where b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-4ac is the discriminant. It can also be written as Δ.


When Δ&gt;0, the equation has 2 distinct, real roots.

When Δ=0, the equation has 2 repeated real roots.

When Δ&lt;0, the equation has no real roots (only imaginary roots).

==Exponential Function==
In mathematics, the exponential function is the function e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;, where e is the number (approximately 2.718281828) such that the function e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; equals its own derivative. The exponential function is used to model phenomena when a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. The exponential function is also often written as exp(x), especially when x is an expression complicated enough to make typesetting it as an exponent unwieldy.

The graph of y = e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; is upward-sloping, and increases faster as x increases. The graph always lies above the x-axis but can get arbitrarily close to it for negative x; thus, the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. The slope of the graph at each point is equal to its y coordinate at that point. The inverse function is the natural logarithm ln(x); because of this, some older sources refer to the exponential function as the anti-logarithm.

Sometimes the term exponential function is used more generally for functions of the form cb&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;, where the base b is any positive real number, not necessarily e.

==Logarithmic Function==

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Topic 3: Circular Functions and Trigonometry=
==Introduction==

==Circle==

===Radian Measure===

===Length of an arc===

The length of an arc is equal to s=r(theta), where r= radius, (theta)=inscribed angle in radians, and s=the length of the arc.

This formula is synonymous with the formula for the circumference of a circle where (theta)=2(pi).

===Area of a Sector===
A = (1/2)(θ)(r(squared)) where r is the radius.

==Cosine and Sine (relative to Unit Circle)==

sinθ=y
cosθ=x
tanθ=y/x
CAST Beginning from the IV section will let you know which are positive (Cosine, All, Sine, Tangent)

==Double Angle Formulae==

sin2(θ)= 2sin(θ)cos(θ)  &lt;br /&gt;

cos2(θ)= cos^2(θ)-sin^2(θ)= 2cos^2(θ)-1=1-2sin^2(θ)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using flint and steel to light a fire is somewhat difficult.  In order to use a flint and steel, you take a hard, sharp-edged rock in one hand and the steel striker in the other.  The &quot;flint&quot; can be any hard, sharp rock, such as flint, jasper, or quartz.  The striker can be any piece of high-carbon steel, such as a knife blade, though strikers made specifically for this purpose work much better.  

The other essential item needed for starting a fire with flint and steel is a char cloth.  A char cloth is a piece of partially burned cotton cloth.  It can be made by cutting  pieces of cotton into 1-inch squares, placing them in small a metal container (such as an Altoids tin), and placing that in a fire.  If the cotton cannot get much oxygen, it will char rather than burn.  Remove the tin from the fire when it quits smoking.

Before you begin, lay your fire so that when you ignite the tinder with the flint and steel, you can place it in the fire and get it going.  Once the tinder is lit, it's too late to lay the fire, as the tinder will burn for only half a minute or so.

Place the char cloth on  the flint even with a sharp edge, but not covering it.  Hold the striker loosely in the right hand (assuming you are right-handed) and strike it against the flint (held in the other hand) as if you were trying to shave the striker with the rock.  Flint is harder than steel, so it will indeed shave a piece of steel off the striker.  When this piece of red-hot steel is shaved from the striker, it will fly off and hopefully land on the char cloth.  You may need to repeat this several times before a spark does actually land on the char cloth, but when it does, the char cloth will catch the spark and begin to glow itself.  You then take the glowing char cloth and set it against your tinder.  Raw cotton and oakum work especially well as tinder.  Blow on it gently until you get a flame.  If you don't blow hard enough, the ember will not ignite the tinder.  If you blow too hard, you will burn through the tinder without igniting it.  Once it flames up, place it in the fire you have already laid.

      <comment>/* Topic 5: Vectors */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Topic 4: Vectors=

==Introduction==

Vectors can be described mathematically by using Trigonometry. 
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[image:Vector_example.PNG|Sample Vector]]&lt;/div&gt;
We can define a vector to be an ordered pair consisting of a '''magnitude''' and a '''direction'''. In this diagram, ''r'' is the magnitude of this vector and &amp;theta; is the direction. Notice, now, that we have moved horizontally ''r'' cos(&amp;theta;) and vertically ''r'' sin(&amp;theta;). These are called the ''x-component'' and the ''y-component'', respectively. 

We can also write a vector conveniently in terms of the x and y component. We write &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; for vectors. In some texts, you may see the vector written sideways, like (''x'', ''y''), but when you write it will help ''greatly'' to write them downwards in columns. In print we commonly bold vectors, but since you probably don't have a pen that writes in bold print, underline your vectors, i.e. write &lt;u&gt;v&lt;/u&gt;, or put a tilde underneath your vectors or place an arrow pointing right overtop of your vector.

==Length of a vector==
The distance formula can be used to find the magnitude, r, of a vector given its components with the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\|\mathbf{a}\right\|=\sqrt{{a_1}^2+{a_2}^2+{a_3}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Where a1, a2, and a3 are the three components of the vector.

==Vector equality==

Two vectors are said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction.  However if we are talking about bound vector, then two bound vectors are equal if they have the same base point and end point.

For example,  the vector '''i''' + 2'''j''' + 3'''k''' with base point (1,0,0) and the vector '''i'''+2'''j'''+3'''k''' with base point (0,1,0) are different bound vectors, but the same (displacement) vector.

== Scalar multiplication ==
For scalar multiplication, we simply multiply each component by the scalar. We commonly use Greek letters for scalars, and Roman letters for vectors.


So for a scalar value of &amp;lambda; and a vector '''v''' defined by ''r'' and &amp;theta;, the new vector is now &amp;lambda;''r'' and &amp;theta;. Notice how the direction does not change.

==== Example ====
Say we have &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and we wish to double the magnitude. So, &lt;math&gt;2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Addition of vectors ==

Simply, to add two vectors, you must add the respective x-components together to obtain the new x-component, and likewise add the two y-components together to obtain the new y-component.

=== Example ===
Say we have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{v_2}=\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and we wish to add these. So, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2}=\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Magnitude ===
The ''magnitude'' of a vector is its length in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

== The dot product==
The ''dot product'' of two vectors is defined as the sum of the products of the components. Symbolically we write
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2  \end{pmatrix} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2&lt;/math&gt;

For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}=3-10=-7&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product of two vectors has an alternate form:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

The angle &amp;theta; then is important, as it shows that the dot product of two vectors is related to the angle between them. More specifically, we can calculate the dot product of two vectors - if the dot product is zero we can then say that the two vectors are perpendicular.

For example, consider simply
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}=1-1=0&lt;/math&gt;
Plot these vectors on the plane and verify for yourself that these vectors are perpendicular.

== Vectors of 3D-lines ==
Cartesian equation: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{x-a}{l}=\tfrac{y-b}{m}=\tfrac{z-c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
where a, b, and c  are the coordinates on the vector line.

Vector equation: r = &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is to capture quotes - those gems of wisdom to be inserted at appropriate points in the volumes.

&quot;No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of our knowledge.&quot; (Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet).


&quot;I have yet to find a person, however senior his position, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.&quot; 

Charles Schwab

&quot;Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education — and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.&quot;
Ivan Illich, Deschooling Society

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''&quot;I believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.&quot;'''''&lt;br&gt;-[[John Dewey]], [[Wikisource:My Pedagogic Creed|My Pedagogic Creed]] (1897)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;More important than the curriculum is the question of the methods of teaching and the spirit in which the teaching is given&quot; Bertrand
Russell (Ref?? anyone?)

== Re:Wikijunior ==

Wikijunior doesn't allow fiction, but we have been willing to explore things like allegory, teaching a lesson using metaphores. A generic children's book wouldn't be acceptable on Wikijunior, but a &quot;fable&quot; or a narrated textbook of some sort might be. What kinds of ideas do you have? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:31, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

== Alphabetical Tag ==

Hello Jkauf, how are you? I'm glad to see your project is ramping up for the new semester again. It's always a pleasure to watch you and your students work.

The {{tlx|alphabetical}} tag on your book is part of an organizational effort here at Wikibooks. It serves a dual purpose: Allowing books to be found by name at [[WB:ABC]], and allowing us to count the number of books we have here at wikibooks. This template puts books into a category based on the first letter of it's title, and we can count all the books in all categories to get a rough count. Due to technical limitations, we don't have any better way of counting our books here. Here's the current count calculated in this way: [[Template:NUMBEROFBOOKS|{{NUMBEROFBOOKS}}]]. Keep in mind that the MediaWiki software was originally designed for Wikipedia, not Wikibooks, and so it doesnt offer all the features that a book-based site would like.

The {{tlx|Alphabetical|F}} tag should exist somewhere on the front page of your book, not in any sub-pages. This is because we obviously only want to  count the book once, and not count every page in the book as being a separate book. [[User:Dallas1278]] was interested in getting involved here and was following my advice in alphabetizing pages. Any mistakes he made in this were likely caused by my failure to really explain the task. Once he got started, he was off like a rocket.

Anyway, Please don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or if you need anything. A lot can happen around here between semesters. Good luck with your work this semester and again, I'm here if you need any help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:10, 26 August 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Peer Review Pages ==

Hello jkauf, I'd be happy to make any and all changes you need, and I can try to do them all by Sunday if necessary. My bot is set up so it can make multiple changes to a page at once. That way I can reduce the number of edits I need to make, and still do everything you need done. Of course, I can make changes separately too, if that's how it has to be done.

I'll take a look at that page you sent me and start setting up my bot to perform the task. I should have it ready to deploy within a day or two. Let me know when you know the rest of the edits to make. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:21, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

Hello Jaime,

I hope you don't mind sending the steps or process in doing a &quot;peer review&quot; for the first article. Thanks a lot! [[User:Teachtheworld|Teachtheworld]] ([[User talk:Teachtheworld|talk]]) 03:42, 14 February 2009 (UTC)

Actually, I had completed two (12.1.1, 6.1.4  ) by the due date, and signed up for three others ( 9.4.3, 10.3.2, 6.4.3 ) for extra credit.  They are all now completed.  I print off the articles and review template, and write it out by hand.  I find this better and more effective.  They are now completed.  I had not emailed you about my extra credit, because I had not finished them. I will email you them now.  I wasn’t aware we could not sign up for articles before completing the review, because for the assigned reviews we could.  I signed up for them yesterday, so I could hand write the reviews after work. I did not someone tagging the ones I was working on. They are now typed, completed, and posted.  I was under the assumption we had until Sunday to complete them.  Sorry if I did it wrong.  [[User:Aartz001|Aartz001]] ([[User talk:Aartz001|talk]]) 19:00, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi Jamie, 
Actually, I was able to do the peer review already....one of the wikis administrators helped me figure it out. Should I go ahead and signed the next article? Thanks a lot, Jamie...[[User:Teachtheworld|Teachtheworld]] ([[User talk:Teachtheworld|talk]]) 01:10, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi Jamie,
You left me a response to my article that it looked great but that you were concerned about if the picture was copyrighted. Just wanted to let you know that it is not copyrighted because I got it from the website that Dr. Kidd posted (flicker, creative commons) on the how to use this book page of websites that have pictures free of copyright. Maybe I should cite the picture as being from creative commons just to cover myself? 
Thanks,

== Re:Editor Status ==

I'll get on it today and try to fix this ASAP. Sorry it hasn't been resolved yet! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:13, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

== RE:Discussion pages problems ==

The MediaWiki software has a lot of tools that can be used to avoid spam and stuff like that. Unfortunately, even innocuous changes can have negative effects in unforseen places. Let me double-check that no major settings have been changed since yesterday. I'll let you know what I find. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:02, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
:Okay, found the problem and got it fixed. The problem was that your page accidentally matched a pattern from our spam blacklist. [[User:Darklama]] removed the offending pattern from the blacklist, and you should be able to edit the page again like normal. Sorry for the inconvenience! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:12, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

[[Image:Al Foil.JPG|right|thumb|A roll of foil]]

'''Aluminium foil''', also ''aluminum foil'' (USA), ''al-foil'', ''tin foil'', is a thin sheet of [[w:Aluminium|aluminium]] that can be used as a wrapping or pliable cover in [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], [[Cookbook:Barbecuing|barbecuing]], [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] and as insulation. It is available in rolls of varying widths, lengths, and thicknesses.

When barbecuing foods that would dry out or scorch in direct contact with flame, wrapping in foil helps to retain moisture and flavour. Whole [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] may be wrapped in foil with a thin coating of oil on the fish, and a sprinkling of dried herbs and spices, before placing on the barbecue. Whole potatoes can be individually wrapped in foil before tossing into the hot coals, for later retrieval.

In baking and roasting, foil can be used to wrap or cover food to protect it from direct heat in the oven. It can also be punctured, allowing excess moisture to escape if required.

Aluminium foil is not suitable for use in [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave ovens]].

== Group activities ==

Most unicycling games are either not as fun or impossible to play by yourself. Unicycling clubs are excellent places to play these games.

=== Basketball ===

Basketball is an excellent activity to do on a unicycle because, unlike on a bicycle, your hands are completely free.

Unicycle basketball is exactly like regular basketball except on a unicycle. If you have a choice you will want to use either a 24&quot; or a 20&quot; unicycle. You will also want to play on a durable court(hardwood can potentially get beaten up) and an overhanging hoop is also a good thing so you do not run into the pole.
Here is a clip that shows [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240basketbal-TV5 basketball on unicycles] (French).

=== Street hockey ===

Street hockey is another excellent game to play on a unicycle. All you need is a puck or (more usually) a tennis ball, some street or ice hockey sticks, some unicycles (preferably 20&quot;) and some friends.

=== Jousting ===

This is a good activity to do on a unicycle as you only need two people. The only bad thing about jousting is the high potential for getting hurt. To avoid this you will want to do it on a soft area with padding on the jousting poles and possibly some form of armor.

When you have everything set up all you need to do is pick up your jousting poles, mount your unicycle and CHARGE! If you manage to knock your opponent off(without any serious injuries to you or your opponent please) and are able to continue riding your unicycle you win.

Like I said before, this is a potentially dangerous game. Do not hit your opponent in the head or neck as this could result in serious injuries. You also want to use fairly short poles so they are more controllable. 

=== Gladiators ===

This is a fun game if you have a lot of people to do it with. Have everyone line up in a circle and mount their unicycles. Once everyone is on their respective unicycle it is pretty simple. DO NOT FALL OFF! The last one standing (or unicycling) wins! The only real rules in this game is to make sure that no one gets hurt. Do not use any violence to knock your opponent off. Simply push or pull them off their unicycles.  Winning is not nearly as important as having a good time and not obtaining any serious injuries.

More creative ways of dismounting someone include lodging sticks in their spokes, tickling them and pulling the quick release on their saddle.

=== Racing ===

Racing is an excellent activity to do on a unicycle. The only problem is when you get different size wheels racing. To compensate for this you may want to give unicyclers with bigger wheels some form of time penalty.

== Individual Activities ==

Just because you can't find anyone else to unicycle with does not mean you can't have a good time.

=== Walking Your Dog ===

Walking your dog can be a very enjoyable activity on your unicycle(presuming you have a dog and it is not too obese to walk) and also attracts a lot of attention from the neighbours(whether you want that attention or not). Walking your dog is also really good practice because chances are he(or she) will not cooperate. You will be pulled in all directions and it will take a lot more energy and effort to stay balanced. You also run the really high risk of face planting. You may need to get stitches afterwards. Also, be careful of crushing a banana.
[http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240dogride This video] shows 'walking' a cute dog on unicycle

=== Obstacle Courses ===

Setting up an obstacle course is another excellent way to practice and have fun at the same time. You can use any kind of obstacle you want. Hills, ledges and jumps are very popular but you can also put up cones(pine cones, rocks, etc. work too) that you have to go around or through. Be creative!

&lt;font color=red&gt;WARNING&lt;/font&gt; Do not try to set up an obstacle course on a road you may get crushed by your opponent (a banana) i had this happen to me.

=== Muni/hiking or biking trails ===

If you have any trails or other areas where you can ride your unicycles they can make a nice change from riding around town and can be a fun challenge if you ride on rough terrain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

'''Rene Descartes''' (March 31, 1596 – February 11, 1650) was a highly influential mathematician, scientist and philosopher. Descartes is widely considered to be the 'Father of modern Philosophy'. His most influential work is ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' ('First Philosophy being metaphysics). Descartes advocates a method of radical doubt, now labeled Cartesian doubt, whereby the reader, or meditator, begins to doubt all external objects of sense perception and focus only on what the mind 'clearly and distinctly' perceives to be true. Descartes discovers the now well known proposition 'I think, therefore, I am' (known as ''cogito ergo sum''). Descartes unique idea was to start from axiomatic principles that could not be doubted, and proceed to discover truths and certainty from these axioms. He argued that the mind and rational thought, not experience, is the source of all knowledge. This is why Descartes is know seen as a 'Rationalist'. His method is opposed to a more Newtonian or Aristotelean principle of deriving the axioms from the objects of sense experience.</text>

;Example
Take the example of the [[w:Megalodon|Megalodon]] in the field of Paleontology. From only a handful of teeth and vertebrae, paleontologists &quot;tell&quot; us that the Megalodon was, basically, a 20m long Great White with similar structure and behavioral patterns. The teeth of a Megalodon are similar in shape to that of a Great White so it has been assumed that it's morphology and behavior are similar (although because the teeth are larger, it's prey would be larger). While this may be accurate, it may also be completely wrong (there is strong support for the theory that Megalodon and great whites are not related, the latter being a descendant of the broad-tooth Mako shark). The only real clue that we have towards the size and behavior is that many bones of large whales have been found with tooth marks almost identical to that of the Megalodon, as sharks have full cartilaginous skeletons. However, there is no evidence, other than its similarity to the great white's, that the teeth and vertebrae even came from a shark and not some other animal which happened to have similar dentition and spinal structure.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

This book is intended as a guide to the topics of computability and complexity in theoretical computer science for the mid-level undergraduate student.
It assumes a working knowledge of discrete math, and uses Perl for all example programs.

The emphasis of the work so far has been on formal languages, particularly the Chomsky hierarchy, and on the machines that correspond to that hierarchy.
The major areas that need filling out are the section on reducibility, and the sections on time and space complexity.  Adding more language classes outside the Chomsky hierarchy would also improve the formal languages section, and adding information about the pumping lemmas to the sections on [[../Formal Languages/Chomsky Hierarchy/Regular Languages/|Regular Languages]] and the [[../Formal Languages/Chomsky Hierarchy/Context Free Languages/|Context Free Languages]] would improve those sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Formal Languages =

Central to ideas of complexity in computer science is the concept of formal languages.  A formal language is a collection of words, which are strings of finite length drawn from a finite alphabet of symbols.

While each word in a language must be finite, a language may contain words of arbitrary length, and thus may contain an infinite number of words.  An example of such a language is the collection of all strings drawn from the alphabet {''a,b''} which contain an equal number of ''a''s and ''b''s.  This language thus contains any string of the form &lt;math&gt;a^nb^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol ''a'' repeated ''n'' times.  Since ''n'' can be any positive integer, there must be an infinite number of words in this language.

Many formal languages have associated with them a generative grammar, which is a set of replacement rules containing three types of symbols: &amp;epsilon;, which signifies the empty string (a string of length 0), non-terminal symbols, which are symbols not in the alphabet of the language, and terminal symbols, which are in the alphabet of the language.  By convention, non-terminal symbols are usually capital letters, while terminal symbols (and thus the alphabet of the associated formal language) are usually lower-case letters.  The grammars also include a non-terminal symbol called the start symbol, which is what the replacement rules assume is present before any replacements happen.  By making choices about which replacement rule to apply when, the start symbol can be converted into any word in the language associated with that grammar and into no other words, which is why the grammar is said to generate the language.  How these replacement rules can be formed depends on the language class involved, and each set of restrictions on the grammar creates a class of generative grammars.  Not every class of formal languages has a class of generative grammars associated with it.

The other object often associated with language classes is recognizing machines.  How these machines operate and what their restrictions are depends on the language class they correspond to, but a machine is said to recognize a language if, when given any word in that language as an input, the machine always &quot;accepts&quot; the word, and never &quot;accepts&quot; a word that is not in the language.  Not all formal language classes have a type of recognizing machine associated with them, but most languages studied by computer scientists do.

There are a number of classes of different languages, each based on the complexity of the languages it contains.  The best known language classes are the four classes of the [[/Chomsky Hierarchy/]], which were defined by Noam Chomsky in his 1959 paper &quot;On Certain Formal Properties of Grammars&quot; [[../References and Further Reading/|1]].  Information on other language classes can be found in the chapter [[/Other Language Classes/]].

In summary:
* An &lt;b&gt;alphabet&lt;/b&gt; is a finite collection of symbols.
* A &lt;b&gt;word&lt;/b&gt; is a string of finite length whose symbols are drawn from an alphabet.
* A &lt;b&gt;formal language&lt;/b&gt; is a collection of words.

* A &lt;b&gt;generative grammar&lt;/b&gt; is a set of replacement rules that allow you to create any word in the language (and no other words) from a start symbol.
* A &lt;b&gt;recognizing machine&lt;/b&gt; is a machine that &quot;accepts&quot; any word in the language (and no other words).

* A &lt;b&gt;language class&lt;/b&gt; is a set of languages that are of similar complexity, so they have similar types of generative grammar and similar types of recognizing machines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Chomsky Hierarchy =

The Chomsky hierarchy is a collection of four classes of formal languages, each of which is a proper subset of the classes above it, and each of which corresponds to both a generating grammar and to a recognizing machine.  This hierarchy developed primarily from the works of [[wikipedia:Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and [[wikipedia:Marcel-Paul_Sch%C3%BCtzenberger|Marcel-Paul Schutzenberger]] in the late 1950s on mechanistic linguistics and formal languages.  The various levels of the hierarchy have proven useful in both theoretical computer science, as they connect to Alan Turing's work on algorithms and computability, and in compiler design.

Each level of this hierarchy consists of a class of formal languages, a class of generative grammars, each of which produces a language in the associated class, and a class of machines, each of which recognizes a language in the associated class.  At each level of the hierarchy, the rules for the generative grammar become more restrictive, making each class of languages a subset of the classes above it.  Those four classes, from most restrictive to least restrictive, are:
* [[/Regular Languages/]]
* [[/Context Free Languages/]]
* [[/Context Sensitive Languages/]]
* [[/Unrestricted Languages/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Regular Languages =

Regular languages are the most restricted, and the simplest, languages in the Chomsky Hierarchy.  Languages in this class are usually described like mathematical sets, with a description in curly brackets.  Any word that matches that description is part of the language, and any word that doesn't match the description isn't part of the language.

Informally, the class of regular languages is those languages which can be described by characters from its alphabet with concatenation, parentheses, the &amp;cup; (or) operator, and the * operator.  An example would be &lt;math&gt;\{(b \cup (ab))*\}&lt;/math&gt;, the language containing any number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s, where every &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is followed by a &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.

It should be noted that any finite language, which is a language comprised of some finite sequence of words &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, \ldots , w_n&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as &lt;math&gt;\{w_1 \cup w_2 \cup \ldots  \cup w_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  As a result, every finite language is regular.  The converse of this, however, is not true.  The example language given earlier, &lt;math&gt;\{(b \cup (ab))*\}&lt;/math&gt;, contains an infinite number of words, and is regular.

An alternative, though equivalent, definition of the regular languages is those languages which can be generated by a regular grammar.  A regular grammar is a set of rules which, starting from an initial symbol, replace &quot;non-terminal symbols&quot; (symbols which are not in the alphabet of the language) with &quot;terminal symbols&quot; (symbols which are in the alphabet of the language) through replacement rules that replace each non-terminal symbol with either a terminal symbol, a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal symbol, or ε (the empty string).  As an example, the language &lt;math&gt;\{(b \cup (ab))*\}&lt;/math&gt; above can be described by the following grammar (let S be the starting symbol):
* S -&gt; ε
* S -&gt; aB
* S -&gt; b
* S -&gt; bA
* A -&gt; aB
* A -&gt; b
* A -&gt; bA
* B -&gt; bA
* B -&gt; b
Note that by making different choices with which rules to apply when, this grammar can produce, from a starting string of &quot;S&quot;, the empty string or a string of ''a''s and ''b''s with every ''a'' followed by a ''b''.  This is exactly the same as the words matching the set notation above, making the languages produced by the two methods identical.

== Finite Automata ==
Finite automata are machines that consist of a finite number of states, and transition between those states based only on the current state and a character input.  When the input has all been consumed, the machine either &quot;accepts&quot; or &quot;rejects&quot; the string of inputs, based on the final state of the machine.  These machines happen to correspond exactly with regular languages, with the set of strings accepted by any finite automaton being a regular language, and with every regular language having a machine that accepts all and only strings from that language.  For this reason we say that the class of regular languages is equivalent to the class of languages recognized by finite automata.

=== DFAs &amp; NFAs ===
There are two types of finite automata, deterministic and non-deterministic.  A deterministic finite automaton, or DFA, makes one transition per character in the input, and contains a transition from each state for each character in the alphabet.

A non-deterministic finite automaton, or NFA, can consume either one or no characters per transition, does not need a transition for each character from each state, and can have more than one possible transition for a specific input and a specific state.  These properties allow the NFA to contain computation branches.  If any computation branch generated by a string accepts, the machine accepts that string, and only rejects if no branch accepts.  Since DFAs are more restrictive than NFAs, every DFA is also an NFA, and any NFA can be converted into a DFA, so the set of languages recognized by all NFAs and DFAs is the same, and the two machines are equivalent.

For either type, the automaton can be specified completely by its set of states, its alphabet, the set of transitions, the start state, and the accepting states.

== Limitations ==
Not all languages are regular.  Take the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, whose words contain some number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s followed by an equal number of &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s.  The only memory that a finite automaton has is its current state, so it can count a number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s no larger than the number of states it possesses.  Since the language contains all words of this type, the words can have an arbitrarily large number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s, so for any machine, there must be some strings whose number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s it cannot store.  If it cannot store the number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s, then it cannot compare the number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s, and so cannot verify that any string is a member of the language.  As a result, there is no finite automaton that recognizes this language, and so it cannot be a regular language.

== Examples ==
The code below is a sample DFA emulator in Perl.  Given the description of a machine and an input string, it simulates the machine processing the input string, and shows whether the machine accepts or not.

The syntax is: progname.pl DFAFile inputFile, where DFAFile is a text file containing the DFA instructions, and inputFile is a text file containing the input string.  Some sample inputs, including a set of DFA instructions, can be found under [[ ../sample DFA inputs/ ]]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Sample DFA inputs =

These examples are for use with the perl DFA emulator provided at the bottom of [[ ../Regular Languages/ ]].  That page also contains a description of what a DFA is and how it works.

The specifications for a machine that accepts all strings ending in b:
 :States:
 q1 q2 q3
 :Start State:
 q1
 :Accept States:
 q3
 :alphabet:
 a b
 :rules:
 q1 a q2
 q1 b q3
 q2 a q2
 q2 b q3
 q3 a q2
 q3 b q3

Some sample words:

this accepts:
 b a b a b
this rejects:
 a a b b a a b a

 (the empty string)

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Context Free Languages =

Context free languages are the second most restricted class of languages in the Chomsky Hierarchy.  Languages in this class can be described by a set of generation rules using 'non-terminal' symbols and 'terminal symbols', where the terminal symbols are the alphabet of the language.  These rules replace non-terminal symbols with strings of terminals or non-terminals, or with an empty string.  It is common practice to use capital letters for the non-terminal symbols, and lower-case letters for the symbols in the alphabet (and thus for the terminal symbols).  This set of replacement rules is called a context-free grammar.  A language is context free if there is a context-free grammar which generates every string in the language (and no other strings) from a starting non-terminal symbol.

As an example, consider the following grammar:
* S -&gt; ε (ε here stands for the empty string)
* S -&gt; A
* A -&gt; aAb
* A -&gt; ab
From the starting symbol S, this grammar can generate either the empty string or a word composed of any number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s followed by an equal number of &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s.  You may recall from the section on [[../Regular Languages/]] that this language, which can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, is not part of the class of regular languages, but we now see that it is context-free.

Note, in the example, that the grammar provides a choice with what rule to apply to both S and A non-terminals.  It is these choices that allow the grammar to generate all the strings in a language, and not just a single string.

== Pushdown Automata ==
The class of context free languages is the same as the class of languages recognized by machines called pushdown automata.  A pushdown automaton (PDA) is a non-deterministic machine comprised of a finite number of states with transitions between them, much like an NFA (see [[../Regular Languages/]]), but with the addition of a stack of unlimited size.  As part of its transitions, the machine can pop the top item off of the stack and use its contents as part of its transition, and can also push a new item onto the stack.  Its transitions can be written as {A,x,y} -&gt; {B,z}, where A and B are the from and to states, x is the next input character, y is what is popped off the stack, and z is what is placed on the stack.  Any of x, y, or z can be ε, meaning that nothing is placed or consumed as part of that transition.

=== Abilties ===
The addition of the stack provides a functionally limited but arbitrarily large amount of memory to the machine, enabling it to recognize more complex languages than finite automata.  As above, the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^nb^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a context-free language, and so there is a PDA which recognizes it.  It can do this by adding an item to the stack for each &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; in the string, thus storing a count of them, and removing an item from the stack for each &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.  If the number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s is the same, the stack will empty when there are no more &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s, and so the two numbers can be effectively compared.  For a more detailed example of a machine to recognize this language, see the sample machine below.

If a PDA simply doesn't use the stack, it is the same as an NFA and thus equivalent to a DFA, so any languages recognized by a finite automaton can be recognized by a PDA as well.  Because of this, and because there are non-regular languages which are context-free, the class of regular languages is a proper subset of the class of context-free languages.

== Limitations ==
As with the regular languages, there are many languages which are not context-free.  The stack on the PDA, while it provides infinite storage capacity, is still a stack, and so only the last element placed on it can be access at any given time.  Accessing earlier elements requires removing and thus losing the later elements, since there is no other stack on which to place them.  The PDA is also limited in that it must consume the input characters in the order in which they are received, and cannot access them again, except by placing them on the stack.

These limitations make it impossible for a PDA to recognize the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^nb^nc^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.  By using the stack, a PDA can count the number of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s, and compare them to the number of &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s, but in doing so, it must consume its record of the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s, so the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;s cannot be compared in the same way.  The machine cannot create a record of the &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;s to compare with the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;s without obscuring the count of the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;s, so that method is equally unsuccessful.  In short, the lack of any sort of random or direct access to the memory of the PDA prevents it from recognizing this and many other languages, and since no PDA can recognize them, they cannot be context-free languages.

== Examples ==
The code below is a sample PDA emulator in Perl. Given the description of a machine and an input string, it simulates the machine processing the input string, and shows whether the machine accepts or not.

The syntax is: progname.pl PDAFile inputFile, where PDAFile is a text file containing the TM instructions, and inputFile is a text file containing the input string.  Some sample inputs, including a set of PDA instructions for a machine to recognize &lt;math&gt;\{a^nb^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found under [[../sample PDA inputs/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Context Sensitive Languages =

Context sensitive languages are those languages whose strings can be generated by a context sensitive grammar.  This type of grammar is similar in form to a context free grammar (see [[../Context Free Languages/]]), but instead of rules of the form A -&gt; X, where A is a non-terminal symbol and X is a string of terminals and non-terminals, a context sensitive grammar contains rules of the form X -&gt; Y, where  X and Y are strings of terminals and non-terminals, with the constraint that Y be at least as long as X.  There is an exception to this rule, that if S is the starting symbol, and S never appears on the right side of a transition, then the transition S -&gt; &amp;epsilon; is allowed.  This makes it possible for a grammar to generate the empty string.

An example of such a grammar is:
* S -&gt; &amp;epsilon;
* S -&gt; aSBC
* S -&gt; aBC
* CB -&gt; BC
* aB -&gt; ab
* bB -&gt; bb
* bC -&gt; bc
* cC -&gt; cc

This grammar generates the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^nb^nc^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, a language which is not context free.

An alternative definition for a context sensitive grammar is a grammar where each of transitions has the form YAZ -&gt; YXZ, where A is a non-terminal, and X, Y and Z are all strings of terminals and non-terminals (Y and Z may empty).  Because Y and Z remain unchanged, this fills the same function as a transition A -&gt; X, but can use the context of A as a requirement for the transition.  In [[../../../References and Further Reading/|1]], Noam Chomsky shows that these two definitions are equivalent, and produce the same languages.

Any context free grammar is also a context sensitive grammar under the second definition which only uses empty contexts, so the set of context free languages is a subset of the set of context sensitive languages.  Sine, in the example above, a context sensitive grammar can produce the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt; while a PDA cannot, the context free languages must be a proper subset of the context sensitive languages.


== Linear Bounded Automata ==
The class of context sensitive languages is equivalent to the class of languages that can be recognized by linear bounded automata.  A linear bounded automaton (LBA) is a deterministic machine based on a state, a &quot;tape&quot; that contains the input string, and a read/write head that moves left and right along the tape.  The machine compares its current state and the symbol on the tape at the head's position with a finite number of rules to determine its next state, what symbol to write on the tape, and which direction (left/right) to move the tape head in.  Similarly to both finite automata and pushdown automata, linear bounded automata accept or reject an input based on whether they halt in an accept state or not.  An LBA halts when there are no rules for its current combination of state and character being read.

The only other restriction on an LBA is that the tape must be finite, with a size linearly derived from the size of the input string.  For example, if a particular machine uses tapes 2*s+5 long, where s is the size of the input, then when processing a string of size 10, it would have a tape of length 25.

=== Abilities ===
This design gives the LBA a great deal of computational freedom, and so it can recognize any languages who's space requirements for string recognition grow linearly.  One example is the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}d^{n}|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This language can be recognized in space s+1, meaning that it only requires the section of the tape it was written on, plus a single blank character at the end.  This is because unlike a PDA or DFA, an LBA need not deal with the input in sequence - it can (and does in the sample machine available below) mark off the characters in sets, first an 'a', then a 'b', then a 'c', then a 'd', and repeat.  It will not accept if it does not exhaust all character types on the same run.

This language cannot be recognized by DFAs and PDAs, because they would have to count and store the number of 'a's as they went by.  A DFA could only remember a number of 'a's equal to or fewer than its number of states, and so could not check the number of 'b's in an arbitrarily long string.  A PDA could store the number of 'a's on the stack, but would necessarily destroy that information when comparing them to the 'b's, and thus could not compare it to the number of 'c's.

=== Looping ===
Note that while it is possible for an LBA to enter an infinite loop, since there is only a finite tape, a finite number of symbols to put on it, and a finite number of states it can be in, the total number of conditions for a given machine and input is finite.  That means that any infinite loop must, within a finite number of steps, return to a set of conditions it has already encountered.  Also, since LBAs are deterministic, a machine that repeats its set of conditions will continue to repeat the loop it has just traversed indefinitely.  These two statements show that an LBA is caught in an infinite loop (and thus will never accept or reject) if and only if it repeats its total conditions (including state, head position, and tape contents). Since &lt;math&gt;S \cdot T \cdot A^T&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of possible conditions, where S is the number of states, T is the size of the tape, and A is the size of the alphabet, any machine that runs through more than S*T*A^T steps must repeat a set of conditions, and thus be in an infinite loop.   While this number may be quite large, it provides a definite, finite-time method of determining whether a given LBA will loop on a given input.  The similar but more advanced Turing Machine (see [[../Unrestricted Languages/]]) will have no such method.

== Examples ==

The code below is a sample LBA emulator in Perl. Given the description of a machine and an input string, it simulates the machine processing the input string, and shows whether the machine accepts or not.

The syntax is: progname.pl LBAFile inputFile, where LBAFile is a text file containing the LBA instructions, and inputFile is a text file containing the input string.  Some sample inputs, including a set of LBA instructions for a machine to recognize &lt;math&gt;\{a^nb^nc^nd^n|n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found under [[../sample LBA inputs/]]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Unrestricted Languages =

As the name implies, the class of unrestricted languages is the least restrictive class in the Chomsky Hierarchy, and is the set of languages generated by unrestricted grammars.  Unrestricted grammars are grammars composed of a finite number of rules of the form A -&gt; B, where A and B are strings of terminal and non-terminal symbols, and A is not the empty string.  The languages produced by these grammars are also referred to as recursively enumerable, as a recursive function could theoretically generate all the strings in them, although not necessarily in a finite time.

== Turing Machines ==
Equivalent to the class of unrestricted languages is the class of languages recognized by a Turing machine.  A Turing machine (TM) is identical to an LBA (see [[../Context Sensitive Languages/]]), with one exception: a Turing machine's tape is infinite.  In its standard form, the Turing machine's tape has a left endpoint but continues indefinitely to the right.  Other infinite models for the tape, such as a tape infinite in both directions, or multiple infinite tapes, are equivalent to the standard form.

The Turing Machine is the most powerful machine in the hierarchy, with the power to emulate any of the other machines.  It is equivalent in power to most programming languages, although computers only contain finite memory, while a true Turing Machine has infinite memory.

=== Universal Turing Machine ===
Turing Machines can also be programmed as something called a Universal Turing Machine (UTM), a single TM (meaning a single set of states, rules, and alphabet) that can accept as input another TM encoded as a string, together with an input string.  The Universal Turing Machine can then emulate the other TM running the input string.  This universal emulation of its own class is a property not shared by any other machine in the hierarchy.  Some of them can be programmed to emulate a specific subset of their class, but none of them can emulate any given member of their class.

=== Looping ===
However powerful they may be, they do have limitations.  One of the most obvious limitations is that unlike LBAs, a TM has an infinite number of conditions, due to the infinite tape.  This means that the TM can not only loop, it can be in an infinite running, non-halting pattern that never loops.  As an example, consider a naively programmed TM designed to take as input a positive integer &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and to determine if the square root of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is rational by calculating it and printing it out on the tape.  If that machine is given the number 2 as input, it will never complete printing the irrational number &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and so will run forever.

== Examples ==

The code below is a sample TM emulator in Perl. Given the description of a machine and an input string, it simulates the machine processing the input string, and shows whether the machine accepts or not.

The syntax is: progname.pl TMFile inputFile, where TMFile is a text file containing the TM instructions, and inputFile is a text file containing the input string.  Some sample inputs, including a set of TM instructions for a machine to multiply two numbers, can be found under [[../sample TM inputs/]]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

These examples are for use with the perl TM emulator provided at the bottom of [[ ../Unrestricted Languages/ ]].  That page also contains a description of what a TM is and how it works.

This machine accepts strings of the form &lt;math&gt;\{\_^{+}1^{+}\_1^{*}\_^{*}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  It creates a new string of ones whose size is the multiple of the sizes of the original two, then it halts and accepts.  In essence, it is a multiplying machine.  If only one string of ones is present, then the size of the resulting string will be zero.&lt;BR&gt;
Note that with this TM emulator, new tape sections are initialized to _, so _ is essentially a blank character.

These accept:&lt;BR&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Other Language Classes =
The language classes in the [[../Chomsky Hierarchy/]] do not represent an exhaustive list of the possible language classes.  There are many other classes that have been defined since, many of which are defined primarily by a machine that recognizes them, and not by a simple or well-defined grammar.

One example of such a class is the [[/Counting Languages/]].

''Note: There should be more examples here.

For a much larger list of language classes, see [[wikipedia: Complexity class]].

== Definition ==
The set of counting languages is the set of languages that can be generated by a counter automaton, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) (see [[../../Chomsky Hierarchy/Regular Languages/|Regular Languages]]) with a finite number of infinite counters.  These counters can be incremented or decremented during state transitions, and their statuses can be used to determine transitions.

== Position in the Hierarchy of Language Classes==
If the counters are unused, a counter automaton is equivalent to a DFA, so the regular languages are a subset of the counting languages.  There are also [[../../Chomsky Hierarchy/Context Free Languages/|context free languages]] that are counting languages (such as {a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; | n ≥ 0}), context-free languages that are not counting languages (Chomsky says so but never gives an example), and context-sensitive (but not context-free) languages that are counting languages (such as {a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;ccc | n,m ≥ 0}).  A linear bounded automaton (see [[../../Chomsky Hierarchy/Context Sensitive Languages/|Context Sensitive Languages]]) can emulate a counter automaton by assuming that the counters cannot reach values greater than the length of the input string, and thus can store the counter information in an amount of space linearly based on the size of the input string.  The rest of the CA is essentially a DFA, which LBAs can also emulate in linear space. Linear space plus linear space is still linear, so the counting languages are a subset of the context-sensitive languages, and intersect but are not nested with the context-free languages.

== Example ==
The code below is a sample CA emulator in Perl. Given the description of a machine and an input string, it simulates the machine processing the input string, and shows whether the machine accepts or not.

The syntax is: progname.pl CAFile inputFile, where CAFile is a text file containing the CA instructions, and inputFile is a text file containing the input string.  Some sample inputs, including a set of CA instructions for a machine to recognize &lt;math&gt;\{a^{n}b^{m}a^{n}b^{m}ccc|n,m \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found under [[../sample CA inputs/]].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Computability Theory is the branch of computer science concerned with determining whether a certain problem is solvable. Problems can be thought of as very basic situations or questions.

In this day and age we are surrounded by advanced computers which work at dizzying speeds; it is easy to assume that given enough memory or processing power a computer could compute any problem. However, through mathematics we can prove that there are certain problems which simply do not have clear solutions. For example: when given the problem &quot;What is the last digit of Pi?&quot; it is impossible to find a solution because Pi is infinitely long. 

When measuring the &quot;difficulty&quot; of computing a solution, a concept known as &quot;Automata Theory&quot; can be helpful both for calculations as well as comprehension of the problem. Automata Theory will be covered further on in this book - it is a central component in understanding complexity. 

==Automata Theory==

When discovering what may or may not be computable, it is helpful - and indeed, perhaps necessary - to construct models which express the logic behind our computation. Models allow us to plot out exactly how a problem was answered, and allows us to examine every step of the process.

Automata are one kind of model, we can think of them as a kind of machine which represents a problem (such as what is 2 + 2) and then when given some input ( 4 ) runs through a series of steps and either accepts the input as valid, or denies it. This idea (does the input match the given constraints?) is very powerful - and when used sequentially can solve all computable problems.

Automata theory was influenced by the functionalist philosophical movement. Rather than considering mathematics as utilizing numbers which in turn represent values, functionalists preferred to think of numbers as merely being symbols which were manipulated by various rules. When we examine Automata you will see many letters rather than numbers - this is because we are regarding the letters as symbols which themselves hold no inherent importance, and are simply manipulated by the rules we supply. This concept will being to make more sense as you grow more comfortable working with Automata.

[[Image:An_automat_accepting_the_language_a(bc)*d.png|thumb|250px|right|An automata which expresses a(bc)*d]] The image shown at right is an example of an Automata. It accepts -AKA returns 'true' - if the input matches the constraints a(bc)*d (one 'a' followed by any number of 'bc's and then a single 'd'). 

Let's examine this image. Each circle is known as a state, each state is given a name qN where n is the identifying number. If we imagine Automata as representing our own mental arithmetic, we can think of each state as being what step in our logical thought pattern we are in. The arrows which point to the different circles are known as &quot;transitions&quot; and lead from one state to another if certain conditions are met. Depending on what kind of Automata you are working with these conditions may vary. In the example given, the only constraint is that our model sees the specified character at the point in the input currently being examined.

For a(bc)*d, the first thing we should check is whether or not the input contains an 'a' at the beginning. If we see an a, we move to the second state. ....

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Decidability =

This section discusses the decidability of problems run on Turing machines (TMs).  For the definition of a Turing machine, see [[../../Formal Languages/Chomsky Hierarchy/Unrestricted Languages/|Unrestricted Languages]].

== Turing Recognizability ==
Those languages for which there is a Turing machine that will always halt and accept in a finite amount of time for any string in the language are called Turing recognizable languages.  Note that it need not be possible to make a machine that halts and rejects all strings not in the language - the machine may loop.  Continuing the previous example, the language composed of all {strings giving instructions (with some specific encoding) on how to produce and print as a decimal a number with a finite number of decimal places} is Turing recognizable.  If a machine is given a correct input, it can follow the instructions, print the number, finish, and accept.  If it is given instructions that don't make sense, it can reject.  But if it is given instructions that look right, and follows them, it will run forever.

== Decidability ==
There are some languages for which a Turing machine can be written that will halt on all input, either to accept or reject.  These languages are called decidable languages, and TMs that always halt on any input are called Deciders.  One example of a decidable language is the language whose words each consist of a stringified LBA together with an input string, where the LBA halts on that input.  A TM can be written to emulate an LBA, recording the number of steps it makes, and accept if it accepts, reject if it rejects, and reject if it exceeds a certain number of steps (what that number of steps is and how it guarantees that the LBA will loop forever are explained in the chapter on [[../../Formal Languages/Chomsky Hierarchy/Context Sensitive Languages|Context Sensitive Languages]]).  All decidable languages are also by definition Turing recognizable.

== The Halting Problem ==
Perhaps the most important undecidable problem for a TM is known as the halting problem.  A universal Turing machine (UTM) cannot always accurately predict whether a given TM will halt or run forever on a given input.  Clever programming of the UTM can sometimes predict the answer, but the only solution for all problems is to emulate the machine on the input.  Unfortunately, if the emulated machine runs forever, so will the UTM, and will never halt and reject.  It has been proven that no TM can be written that can decide the halting problem, so the language consisting of stringified TMs with input strings, where the machine halts on that input string is a Turing recognizable language, but is not decidable.

== Non-Recognizability ==
Not all languages can even be recognized.  Take, for example, the inverse of the halting problem, the language whose words consist of a stringified TM with an input string, where the TM does not halt on that input.  If that language was Turing recognizable by some TM 'S', then a UTM 'T' could be designed to emulate S, and to also emulate the TM being fed to S.  Eventually, one of the two will halt, and thus T will be a decider for the halting problem, which we know doesn't exist, so the language is not Turing Recognizable.  Furthermore, since every Turing Machine can be encoded as a unique string under some encoding, and there are a countably infinite number of strings, but an uncountably infinite number of languages, there must be an uncountably infinite number of languages to which there is no corresponding TM, and thus are not Turing Recognizable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Computational Complexity =

Complexity theory is a central field of theoretical computer science and has had large impact on all of computer science. Complexity theory tries to find out how many resources (time, space, energy,...) are needed to perform a particular task or to solve a particular problem. It tries to classify problems into ''complexity classes'' such that problems in the same class have similar requirements on the resources needed to solve them. For instance, all problems belonging to the complexity class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; have, by definition, an algorithm that solves them relatively fast, that is, in polynomial time.

When we speak of solving a particular problem, we might have in mind the problem of deciding whether a given input graph is connected. This problem can be formalized in a mathematical way as the set
&lt;math&gt;L = \{ G | G \text{ is connected} \}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the set of all connected graphs. We say that an algorithm ''solves'' a problem &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if it returns ''yes'' if the input is a member of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and ''no'' if not. In our example, the algorithm solving &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; would read some input graph, compute something, and then just say ''yes'' if it has found out that the input graph is connected.
What is beautiful about this framework is that the set &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' the problem that we want to analyze.

Given a problem &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, natural questions are:
* How fast is the fastest algorithm that solves &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;?
* How much space (e.g. hard drive) does the best algorithm solving &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; need?
* If I do not have much space (on ancient mobile phones, say), can I still find an algorithm for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;? Do I then still have the fastest possible?
* Assume that you have a very hard problem &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, for which you just cannot figure out how to solve it efficiently? Can you ''prove'' that it cannot be solved efficiently?

&lt;p&gt;
We can classify all the computational problems into 2 categories, that can be solved by algorithms and that cannot be solved. Although some problems can be solved, we may not be able to solve them in reasonable amount of time. The problems which can be solved are classified in to P and NP. There are other classifications also, but we shall concentrate on P and NP. These classifications are known as complexity classes.  Generally speaking, the class P contains problems which can be solved in a reasonable amount of time and NP contains those which cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The complexity class P&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The complexity class P contains problems that can be solved in a bounded time. The algorithms for solving such problems are bounded by a polynomial function of the input size. The complexity has two parts, a fixed part and a variable part. The fixed part will not depend on any thing else, it is a constant for a given algorithm, but the variable part varies across different instances of the same problem, for e.g. we know that the time taken by a sorting algorithm to sort ten numbers is not the same as the time taken for sorting hundred numbers. Usually the time/space taken by an algorithm will depend on the size of the input to a problem. We can express the time/space taken by an algorithm as the sum of a constant and a polynomial function of the input size. The problems, whose algorithms to solve them, has a complexity that can be expressed as a polynomial, belong to class P. Obviously P stands for polynomial.

A ballistic trajectory is an orbit that intersects the surface of the earth. Once in the trajectory, a ballistic missile will travel large distances around the earth before impacting with the target.

In order to get to the moon, a satellite or rocket needs to escape the Earth's gravity (a hyperbolic orbit). Once in the area of influence by the moon's gravity, the satellite needs to have enough velocity to enter into a stable orbit around the moon.

# Have two people stand on either end of the flag, holding a corner in each hand. 
# Fold the flag in half twice, length-wise. 
# Beginning at the striped end, fold one corner into the opposite side of the flag, forming a triangle. 
# Repeat this triangular folding until only a small strip of the star field shows. 
# Tuck this strip into the triangle. 

Be sure to keep the flag from touching the ground while folding.

'''Flag protocol''' defines the proper placement, handling and use of flags. Some countries have added certain protocols into their law system while others prefer to have &quot;guidelines&quot; without civil or criminal consequences attached. 

;General guidelines:
General guidelines are accepted practically universally.

Much of the flag protocol is derived from common sense. That is, using it as a table cover or wrapping paper are inappropriate uses. It should be treated with ''respect''. Many countries consider signing a flag disrespectful, adding a border would be more appropriate. Pinning or sewing items to a flag would also be ill advised.

;On a mast or pole:
The flag of honor, that is the nation's flag in most cases, is flown on the center mast if possible. It is also correct to fly the flag on its own right. To an observer it would be on the far left. If more than three flags are used, the proper position is as far left from the point of view of an observer. An additional flag may be placed on the right side, but is not necessary. 
  
When two poles are crossed, the position of honor is the flag that ends on the left side from the point of view of an observer (the pole will therefore end on the right).

In a semicircle, the position of honor is the center. If a full circle is used outside an entrance to an arena or stadium, the position of honor is directly opposite the entrance. If used to line the walls of the arena, the flag should be placed directly opposite the entrance.

;Hanging:

When flown horizontally, as from a flag pole, the flag should be oriented so that the canton is closest to the top of the pole. If hung against a wall, the canton should be placed in the upper-left corner from the point of view of the observer.

When hung vertically, flags should be rotated so the canton is again closest to the top of the pole. If the flag is displayed against a wall, the canton should again appear in the upper-left corner, which incidentally requires that the flag be both rotated and 'flipped' from its horizontal orientation.

;Other places:
On a vehicle the flag should be affixed securely to the front right of the chassis.

When placed with a podium or at a place of worship the flag should be hang directly behind or on a pole to the right of the speaker, from the point of view of the audience.

When carried in single file the flag of honor leads.

;Multiple flags:
When flags of many nations are flown the flag of the hosting country should be placed on the left with the rest following in alphabetical order using the language of the host country.

=Connotations of The Text=

'''''Catullus 11''''' is an untitled poem by Catullus, typically believed to be the last of the Lesbia poems. The meter is Sapphic strophe.
'''''Catullus 11''''' also touches on the historical events occurring at the time it was written. The various geographical references in the poem can easily be interpreted as the known borders of the Roman Empire during Catullus's lifespan.

We should add a kogo/czego/co/czegoś/czymś table. When native speakers are asked about declensions, frequently they run a list of these off their tongue and don't realise that this doesn't help the polish learner at all, since the mapping between question words and declensions, and between question words and prepositions is probably very non-[[:w:one-to-one|1:1]]. I meant to memorise the kogo/czego table but haven't got around to it yet... [[User:Boud|Boud]] 12:11, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

Could someone add a mention of &quot;bliski&quot; (close, near to) to the page?  Or if it's not regarded as a preposition, add a note explaining why? &quot;Near&quot; is regarded as a preposition in English, see http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict1&amp;Strategy=*&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=near where it says &quot;'Near' may properly be followed by 'to' before the thing approached; but more frequently 'to' is omitted, and the adjective or the adverb is regarded as a preposition.&quot; [[User:Kgoess|Kgoess]] ([[User talk:Kgoess|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kgoess|contribs]]) 21:49, 12 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Determination from 3 Observations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Astrodynamics}}

According to basic geometry, any three points can be fit by an elipse. This means that if we have at least three observations of a satellite's position, we can determine the entire orbit. However, the process is not an easy one. 

== RADAR ==
{{Wikipedia|Radar}}
RADAR is one of the powerful tools available to observers on earth. A radar installation can determine the position and the velocity of a satellite, with the position being in the topocentric-horizon coordinate system. Once the radar observation has been made, the coordinates can be transformed into the geocentric-equatorial system as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} = \bold{r}_e + \bold{p}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the position vector from the center of the earth to the radar installation, and '''p''' is the position vector of the satellite from the radar installation.

== Determination from a Position and Velocity Vector ==

A radar installation can measure the position and the velocity of the satellite in a single observation. However, this observation is typically going to be made using the polar variety of the topocentric-horizon system (azimuth and elevation). The position of the satellite is given in terms of a line-of-sight vector, '''&amp;rho;''', and the velocity vector is the derivative of that, '''&amp;rho;' ''' We can find the distance from the center of the earth (converting to the geocentric-horizon system) by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} = \bold{r}_e + \bold{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

And we can find the velocity vector '''v''' by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{v} = \bold{\rho}' + \bold{\omega}_e \times \bold{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''&amp;omega;'''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular velocity vector of the earth.

Once we have the '''v''' and '''r''' vectors in the geocentric-equatorial system, we can find all the classical orbital elements.

== Determination from 3 Position Vectors ==

If we have three observations, with each observation representing a position vector, we can determine the orbit of the satellite. We assume that all three position vectors are coplanar, because if they are not it is not a proper orbit and these equations will not yield proper results. 

Given three position vectors, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, we can apply the '''gibbsian method''' to determine the orbit.

=== Gibbsian Method ===

For the gibbsian method, we first construct three new vectors, '''N''', '''D''', and '''S''' (not to be confused the '''S''' unit vector from the topocentric-horizon system). We construct these three new vectors as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{N} = r_3\bold{r}_1 \times \bold{r}_2 + r_1\bold{r}_2\times\bold{r}_3 + r_2\bold{r}_3\times\bold{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{D} = \bold{r}_1\times\bold{r}_2 + \bold{r}_2\times\bold{r}_3 + \bold{r}_3\times\bold{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{S} = (r_2 - r_3)\bold{r}_1 + (r_3 - r_1)\bold{r}_2 + (r_1 - r_2)\bold{r}_3&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can find our ''p'' and ''e'' quantities from these vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \bold{D} = \bold{N}&lt;/math&gt;

'''N''' and '''D''' always have the same direction, so:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{N} \cdot \bold{D} = ND&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{N}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{S}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can determine the unit vectors from the perifocal coordinate system, '''P''', '''Q''', and '''W''' from the three vectors we already have:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{Q} = \frac{\bold{S}}{S}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{W} = \frac{\bold{N}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{P} = \bold{Q} \times \bold{W}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we have the ''p'' and ''e'' values, and we also have the necessarily perifocal unit vectors to define the orbit.

=== Determining Velocity Vectors ===

If we have the three position vectors, we can determine three corresponding velocity vectors at each position. If we have the '''D''', '''N''', and '''S''' vectors, we can define a new vector '''B''' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{B} = \bold{D} \times \bold{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

Where the ''i'' subscript corresponds to one of the three position vectors. We can also form a scalar value ''L'', in order to make the calculations easier:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{DN}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now that we have our 4 vectors and the scalar ''L'', we can find the velocity at position ''i'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{v}_i = \frac{L}{r_i}\bold{B} + L\bold{S}&lt;/math&gt;

== Determination from 3 Observations ==

Radar observations aren't always available, but optical observations typically are. Optical measurements are typically made with the right ascension and declination coordinate system, so we will have 6 values: &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. We can define three unit vectors '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{L}_i = \begin{bmatrix}\cos(\delta_i)\cos(\alpha_i) \\ \cos(\delta_i)\sin(\alpha_i) \\ \sin(\delta_i) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

With the '''L''' vectors, we can find the geocentric-equatorial position vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r}_i = \rho_i \bold{L}_i + \bold{r}_e&lt;/math&gt;

Dotting this equation with itself gives us a second equation:

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 = \rho^2 + r_e^2 + 2 \rho \bold{L} \cdot \bold{r}_e&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve these two equations to find the two unknowns &amp;rho; and ''r''. With ''r'', we can find the position vector '''r''' along the direction of the vector '''L'''.

=== Finding the Velocity Vector ===

We can define the derivative of the '''L''' vectors using the Lagrange interpolation formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{L}' = \frac{2t-t_2-t_3}{(t_1-t_2)(t_1-t_3)}\bold{L}_1 + 
                   \frac{2t - t_1 - t_3}{(t_2-t_1)(t_2-t_3)}\bold{L}_2 + 
                   \frac{2t-t_1-t_3}{(t_3-t_1)(t_3 - t_2)}\bold{L}_3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{L}'' = \frac{2}{(t_1-t_2)(t_1-t_3)}\bold{L}_1 + 
                    \frac{2}{(t_2-t_1)(t_2-t_3)}\bold{L}_2 + 
                    \frac{2}{(t_3-t_1)(t_3 - t_2)}\bold{L}_3&lt;/math&gt;

We can use these values to find:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{v} = \rho' \bold{L} + \rho \bold{L}' + \bold{r}_e&lt;/math&gt;

== Differential Orbit Correction ==

We've seen that with a small number of observations we can determine the complete orbit of a satellite. However, the initial measurements that we have taken can be prone to errors. Any errors that we have in our measurements are made all the more large and glaring because we have relied on so few observations. However, if we increase our number of observations, we can use new values to improve our original &quot;estimate&quot; of the orbit. To do this, we use a method called '''differential orbit correction'''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Roots of polynomials ==
The relations between the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial equation; the occurrence of the non-real roots in conjugate pairs when the coefficents of the polynomials are real.

== Complex numbers ==
=== Square root of minus one ===
&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-1} = i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; i^2 = -1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Square root of any negative real number ===
&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-2} = \sqrt{2 \times -1} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{2} \times i = i\sqrt{2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-n} = i\sqrt{n} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== General form of a complex number ===
&lt;math&gt; z = x + i y \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y \,\!&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers

=== Modulus of a complex number ===
&lt;math&gt; |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Argument of a complex number ===

The argument of &lt;math&gt; z \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the positive x-axis and a line drawn between the origin and the point in the complex plane (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane])

&lt;math&gt; \tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \arg{z} = \theta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \arg{z} = \tan^{-1}{ \left ( \frac{y}{x} \right ) } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Polar form of a complex number ===
&lt;math&gt; x+ iy = z = |z|e^{i\theta} = \left ( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \right ) e^{i\theta} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; e^{i\theta} = \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; z = |z|e^{i\theta} = |z| \left ( \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta} \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; e^{i\theta} = \frac{z}{|z|} = \frac{x + iy}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Addition, subtraction and multiplication of complex numbers of the form x + iy ===
In general, if &lt;math&gt; z_1 = a_1 + ib_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z_2 = a_2 + ib_2 &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; z_1 + z_2 = (a_1 + a_2) + i(b_1 + b_2) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 - a_2) + i(b_1 - b_2) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; z_1 z_2 = a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2 + i(a_2 b_1 + a_1 b_2)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Complex conjugates ===
&lt;math&gt; \mbox{If } z = x + iy \mbox{, then } z^* = x - iy \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; zz^* = |z|^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Division of complex numbers of the form x + iy ===
&lt;math&gt; \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{z_1}{z_2}\frac{z_2^*}{z_2^*} = \frac{z_1 z_2^*}{|z_2|^2} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Products and quotients of complex numbers in their polar form ===
If &lt;math&gt; z_1 = (r_1,\mbox{ } \theta_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z_2 = (r_2,\mbox{ } \theta_2) &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; z_1 z_2 = (r_1 r_2,\mbox{ } \theta_1+\theta_2) &lt;/math&gt;, with the proviso that &lt;math&gt; 2 \pi &lt;/math&gt; may have to be added to, or subtracted from, &lt;math&gt; \theta_1 + \theta_2 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \theta_1 + \theta_2 &lt;/math&gt; is outside the permitted range for &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; z_1 = (r_1,\mbox{ } \theta_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z_2 = (r_2,\mbox{ } \theta_2) &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \left ( \frac{r_1}{r_2} ,\mbox{ } \theta_1 - \theta_2 \right ) &lt;/math&gt;, with the same proviso regarding the size of the angle &lt;math&gt; \theta_1 - \theta_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Equating real and imaginary parts ===
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } a + ib = c + id \mbox{, where } a \mbox{, } b \mbox{, } c \mbox{ and } d \mbox{ are real, then } a = c \mbox{ and } b = d \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Coordinate geometry on Argand diagrams ===
If the complex number &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the point &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and the complex number &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the point &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in an Argand diagram, then &lt;math&gt;|z_2 - z_1| = AB \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\arg{(z_2 - z_1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and the positive direction of the ''x''-axis.

=== Loci on Argand diagrams ===
&lt;math&gt;|z| = k&lt;/math&gt; represents a circle with centre &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|z-z_1| = k&lt;/math&gt; represents a circle with centre &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|z-z_1| = |z-z_2|&lt;/math&gt; represents a straight line — the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the points &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{arg }z = \alpha&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''half'' line through &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; inclined at an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to the positive direction of &lt;math&gt;Ox&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{arg}(z-z_1) = \alpha&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''half'' line through ''the point'' &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; inclined at an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to the positive direction of &lt;math&gt;Ox&lt;/math&gt;

== De Moivre's theorem and its applications ==
=== De Moivre's theorem ===
&lt;math&gt;\left ( \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta} \right )^n = \cos{n\theta} + i\sin{n\theta} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== De Moivre's theorem for integral ''n'' ===
&lt;math&gt; z + \frac{1}{z} = 2 \cos{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; z - \frac{1}{z} = 2i \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exponential form of a complex number ===
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } z = r(\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta})\mbox{, } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{then } z = re^{i\theta} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{and } z^n = \left ( re^{i\theta} \right )^n = r^ne^{ni\theta} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \frac{e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{e^{i\theta}-e^{-i\theta}}{2i} &lt;/math&gt;

=== The cube roots of unity ===
The cube roots of unity are &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w^2&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt; w^3 = 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 1 + w + w^2 = 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and the non-real roots are

&lt;math&gt; \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;


=== The n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; roots of unity ===
The equation &lt;math&gt; z^n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; has roots

&lt;math&gt; z = e^{\frac{2k \pi i}{n}} \mbox{ where } k = 0,1,2, \dots,(n-1) &lt;/math&gt;

=== The roots of z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = α where α is a non-real number ===
The equation &lt;math&gt; z^n = \alpha &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \alpha = re^{i\theta} &lt;/math&gt;, has roots

&lt;math&gt; z = r^{\frac{1}{n}}e^{\frac{i(\theta+2k\pi)}{n}} \mbox{ where } k = 0,1,2, \dots,(n-1) &lt;/math&gt;

== Hyperbolic functions ==
=== Definitions of hyperbolic functions ===
&lt;math&gt; \sinh{x} = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \cosh{x} = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; \tanh{x} = \frac{ \sinh{x} }{ \cosh{x} } &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cosech}{x} = \frac{1}{ \sinh{x} } &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{sech} = \frac{1}{ \cosh{x} } &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \coth{x} = \frac{1}{ \tanh{x} } &lt;/math&gt;

=== Hyperbolic identities ===
&lt;math&gt; \cosh^2{x} - \sinh^2{x} = 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 1 -  \tanh^2{x} = \operatorname{sech}^2{x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \coth^2{x} - 1 = \operatorname{cosech}^2{x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Addition formulae ===
&lt;math&gt; \sinh{(x+y)} = \sinh{x}\cosh{y} + \cosh{x}\sinh{y} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \cosh{(x+y)} = \cosh{x}\cosh{y} + \sinh{x}\sinh{y} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Double angle formulae ===
&lt;math&gt; \sinh{2x} = 2\sinh{x}\cosh{y} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\cosh{2x} &amp; = \cosh^2{x} + \sinh^2{x} \\
&amp; = 2\cosh^2{x} -1 \\
&amp; = 1 + 2\sinh^2{x}
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Osborne's rule ===
Osborne's rule states that:

:to change a trigonometric function into its corresponding hyperbolic function, where a product of two sines appears, change the sign of the corresponding hyperbolic form

Note that Osborne's rule is an ''aide mémoire'', not a proof.

=== Differentiation of hyperbolic functions ===
&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \sinh{x} = \cosh{x} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cosh{x} = \sinh{x} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \tanh{x} = \operatorname{sech}^2{x} &lt;/math&gt;




&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \sinh{kx} = k\cosh{kx} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \cosh{kx} = k\sinh{kx} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tanh{kx} = k\operatorname{sech}^2{kx} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Integration of hyperbolic functions ===
&lt;math&gt; \int \sinh{x} \, dx = \cosh{x} + c &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int \cosh{x} \, dx = \sinh{x} + c &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int \operatorname{sech}^2{x} \, dx = \tanh{x} + c &lt;/math&gt;




&lt;math&gt; \int \tanh{x} \, dx = \ln{\cosh{x}} + c &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int \coth{x} \, dx = \ln{\sinh{x}} + c &lt;/math&gt;

=== Inverse hyperbolic functions ===
==== Logarithmic form of inverse hyperbolic functions ====
&lt;math&gt; \sinh^{-1}{x} = \ln{\left ( x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \right )} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \cosh^{-1}{x} = \ln{\left ( x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \right )} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \tanh^{-1}{x} = \frac{1}{2}\ln{\left ( \frac{1+x}{1-x} \right )} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Derivatives of inverse hyperbolic functions ====
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sinh^{-1}{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cosh^{-1}{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tanh^{-1}{x} = \frac{1}{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;




&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sinh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cosh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tanh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}} = \frac{1}{a^2-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Integrals which integrate to inverse hyperbolic functions ====
&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}} \, dx = \sinh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}} + c&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-a^2}} \, dx = \cosh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}} + c&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{a^2-x^2} \, dx = \tanh^{-1}{\frac{x}{a}} + c&lt;/math&gt;

== Arc length and area of surface of revolution ==
=== Calculation of the arc length of a curve and the area of a surface using Cartesian or parametric coordinates ===
&lt;math&gt; s = \int^{x_2}_{x_1} \sqrt{ 1 + \left ( \frac{dy}{dx} \right )^2 } dx = \int^{t_2}_{t_1} \sqrt{ \left ( \frac{dx}{dt} \right )^2 + \left ( \frac{dy}{dt} \right )^2 }  dt &lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; S = 2 \pi \int^{x_2}_{x_1} y \sqrt{ 1 + \left ( \frac{dy}{dx} \right )^2 } dx = 2 \pi \int^{t_2}_{t_1} y \sqrt{ \left ( \frac{dx}{dt} \right )^2 + \left ( \frac{dy}{dt} \right )^2 }  dt &lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Standard classes diagram obsolete? */ Now fixed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Comment by Kevin S. Van Horn ==
Isn't the diagram at the end in error? There's no instance of MonadPlus IO.

:Hmm... worth asking the wikibook at haskell dot org list. Maybe somebody can go fix it -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:31, 20 May 2007 (UTC)

I took the text discussing Haskell classes vs. OO classes out of its &quot;note&quot; box because it doesn't display properly on the Safari and Firefox web browsers -- the note box overlaps the table of contents, rendering the paragraph unreadable. -- Kevin S. Van Horn, 1 July 2007.

== Typeclasses /= Interfaces ==

Be carefull to compare typeclasses to (Java-)interfaces.

I think it is the best way to make people understand typeclasses,
by comparing it to structures in other languages, but those people who are 
coming from object-oriented languages might be confused about 
the &quot;force to implement&quot; functions, defined in a typeclass.

So I would say typeclasses are more (or equal) to abstract classes in java.
I think this would make things easier for java programmers, becoming good Haskell experts :-)

Btw: I am not able to do this minor change in the article. Why can i only edit the Introduction-Part of the article?

:Sure, go ahead. (Though keep in mind that we also want most of the text to be independent of other languages. That's because analogies can be more harmful than learning the concept from scratch).
:You should be able to edit any part, look for [edit] links.
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 08:12, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Rock, paper, scissors ==

Should they be deriving Ord? --[[Special:Contributions/83.226.119.163|83.226.119.163]] ([[User talk:83.226.119.163|discuss]]) 18:24, 17 March 2011 (UTC)

&quot;Obviously x and y must be of the same type because you can't add different numbers together.&quot;

That's a pretty confusing statement. It sounds like we're trying to tell the reader that 1 + 2 is impossible, because 1 and 2 are different numbers. The author must have meant different numeric types, but even that is not obvious because most other programming languages let you do that.

== Merge proposal ==

Merger rationale: &quot;Classes and types&quot; always looked a bit too short, and now that class constraints are informally introduced very early in the book there is very little reason for the content of this page to remain autonomous. Since there will likely be a few more pages on type classes in this part of the book, merging them will also contribute for a smoother structure. Finally, the proposal has this page as destination because &quot;Classes and types&quot; is a better final title than &quot;Class declarations&quot; (the latter can live on as a redirect). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 15:25, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

== Deriving ==

&quot;You can only use deriving with a limited set of built-in classes.&quot;  This is no longer true, see section 7.5.3 here: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.2/html/users_guide/deriving.html#deriving-typeable

This is a topic that doesn't need to be in the core of a &quot;Learning Haskell&quot; book, but it certainly belongs in the appendix.

== Standard classes diagram obsolete? ==

In the Standard classes section is a very nice diagram. In it, no dependency is shown between Eq and Ord. Yet the immediately preceding section, Class inheritance, describes how there ''is'' a dependency between those two classes. I suspect this may be due to the diagram coming from an old edition of the Haskell Report? [[User:Gwideman|Gwideman]] ([[User talk:Gwideman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gwideman|contribs]]) 01:33, 8 February 2013 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

== Algorithms from THE BOOK ==

I like the idea of this book very much!  I have added quicksort which I think fits in this category.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 10:45, 11 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the place for the discussion of the project How to write a good book for children?--[[User:Huskii|Huskii]] 17:29, 10 May 2007 (UTC)\/


== Fiction/Non-Fiction ==

A fictional book can be pure imagination, or it can include a bit of reality. fictional book have many different genres such as adventure or mystery. A fictional book can be funny or seriouse,sad or happy. the beauty of a fictional book is that it can be anything you want it to be. fiction is usualy more populare with children than non-fiction. if you are interested in writting a fictional book you may want to read fictional books such as harry potter,dear canada, or any book by eva ibbostson.--[[User:Sunshine 12|Sunshine 12]] 13:37, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

When writing about an animal even in a fiction book you have to do your research about it because then it will be easier to write if you know more about what you are writing! Don't be afarid to ask for help too. --[[User:Skirtsz18|Skirtsz18]] 13:53, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
:Also, if you write false information about the animal, children will use that information later and find out that they are wrong. --[[User:Tigerpeach|Tigerpeach]] 13:58, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Language ==

language of a book depends on what type of book you are writting. if you are writting a non-fiction language should be more formal. fictional books language can more lose.some writers even make up words and younger children enjoy it.--[[User:Sunshine 12|Sunshine 12]] 13:53, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Genre ==

It is really important to include a genre because if not, the kids will be very clueless and consequently it will get the reader( a child) confused. Also, genre also helps to classify your story and to make it stand out. For example, if you are going to write a fantasy book, it must embed something from the realms of imagination, for example, a unicorn, some magic or magical creatures. But, even though it is in the genre of fantasty, there still must be some truth in the story like a human emotion or a moral, which will bump your story up a level.
*--[[User:Lady aquarius23|Lady aquarius23]] 13:22, 29 May 2007 (UTC)
:I think the genre should be adventure because most kids llike books that are that genre.--[[User:Siar8|Siar8]] 13:39, 29 May 2007 (UTC)
:i agree because kids will get confused and they will know what they are about and i think that if kids know what they are reading they will understand what they are reading better.--[[User:Mexico9|Mexico9]] 13:41, 29 May 2007 (UTC)
Mystery is an exciting genre many people have fun writing about. Some things you need to include when writing a mysery is a crime, supests, a at least one witness. Have fun writing!--[[User:Skirtsz18|Skirtsz18]] 13:38, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
Adventure is also something that can be made up or true and it is what many kids are interested in. --[[User:Tigerpeach|Tigerpeach]] 13:31, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
Mystery is something that children will want to keep reading because of cliff hangers and exciting moments. --[[User:Tigerpeach|Tigerpeach]] 13:48, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
:Many children love mystery books because of the bone chilling excitments! --[[User:Puppies12|Puppies12]] 13:54, 31 May 2007 (UTC)puppies12

== Photos and Illustrations ==

Photos and illustrations can both be useful and harmful.Today, I'll be talking about the harmful and bad things about photos and illustrations. Well, if you add an photo or an illustration people could get confused and not get your point and then that would be a problem. I would want to find out if there is anyway I could add a photo or an illustration that would not confuse the reader.--[[User:Pendragonking|Pendragonking]] 13:58, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Theme ==

There can be mulitiple theme in one book. Each theme links to one and another. Even though they are completely different, they all have something in common. For example, &quot;Angel Square&quot;  one of the main theme/genre was mystery, but it lead to violence.--[[User:Moneybunny|Moneybunny]] 13:45, 31 May 2007 (UTC)


== multilingual books ==
I think we should translate the books in different langauges so people all around the world can read it.
Writting in differnet langauges can help people understand the book who dont know how to read english or do but not very well. We should help others too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

Most Poles while introducing themselves would simply shake their hands and pronounce their names. There are two types of questions, though, that as a foreigner you need to know to be able to react properly if a curious Pole wants to know your name.

* '''imię''' /eemye/- first name
* '''nazwisko''' /nazveesko/- last name


1. '''jak się nazywasz?'''/yak she nazivash/- &quot;what's your name&quot;; usually implies both first &amp; last name although is used colloquially to ask about the last name

* '''nazywać się'''(''infinitive'')- to be called

conjugation:       
                     singular                            plural
                1.(ja)nazywam się                  1.(my)nazywamy się
                2.(ty)nazywasz się                 2.(wy)nazywacie się
                3.(on/ona/ono)nazywa się           3.(oni/one)nazywają się

eg.
   &quot; - jak się nazywasz?&quot;
   &quot; - nazywam się ...&quot; &quot;
   &quot; - miło mi /meewo mi/&quot; (nice to meet you)

In a formal setting the question will be:

   &quot; - Jak się Pan/Pani nazywa?&quot; - What is your name Sir/Madam?


2. a.'''Jak masz na imię?''' /yak mash na eemye?/- literally &quot;what have you got as a name?&quot;- asks specifically about the first name

b.'''Jak Ci na imię?'''/yak chy na eemye/- literally &quot;what your name?&quot;-paradoxally, sounds even more eloquent than the other two types above, even though there is no verb...

* '''mieć'''(''infinitive'')/myech'/- to have

conjugation :
                      singular                            plural
                1.(ja)mam                          1.(my)mamy 
                2.(ty)masz /mash/                  2.(wy)macie /mache/
                3.(on/ona/ono)ma                   3.(oni/one)mają /majõ/                    

eg.
   &quot; - Jak Ci na imię?&quot;
   &quot; - Mam na imię Kasia.&quot;
   &quot; - A jak on ma na imię? (And what is his name?) 
   &quot; - Aleksander.

==What is an Annotated Bibliography?==

A bibliography is a list of books or resources that one creates and consults when preparing a research paper or project. An ''annotated'' bibliography includes both a Works Cited entry (also known as a Bibliography Entry) and a summary or critique of the source. The information given in the annotation will (1) summarize the information source and (2) Explain why this source is included in the bibliography. 

Imagine you are writing a paper that is similar in subject to a paper you wrote a few years ago.  You want to locate a specific article, but you can't remember which article from that paper is the one you are looking for.  You have all the information to locate the article, but now you have to search through ten articles to find the correct one.  By including an annotation in your bibliography, you won't have to locate every article again.  Your annotation, which is a review, becomes a guide to help you locate the specific article or book you used before.

Also, you might be reading a paper and notice a quote that interests you, or that would help you in your own research.  If the author of that paper has attached an Annotated Bibliography, you would be able to read information about the source, and to find out how this source could be of use to you in your own work.

==What is Generally Included in the Annotation?==

Start your bibliography entry just like a normal works cited entry. At the end of the normal citation include:
* Between 2 to 4 sentences that summarize the sources main idea.
* Between 1 or 2 sentences that relate the article to your paper either indicating how that information is useful to your research or how the information will be used.  

The information within your annotation may include:
* A brief '''description''' of content.
* The main '''purpose''' of the source.
* The '''intended audience''':  Who the information seems to be targeting.
* The '''relevance''' of the information provided to your paper's subject matter.
* If the source includes anything special (Diagrams, Charts, Quotes, Good Pictures).
* A '''warning'''. You may want to mention if the source you are looking at is weakly written, biased to a point of view, or if it is lacking in any way.

==General Formatting of an Annotated Bibliography==

You may have a professor ask for an Annotated Bibliography paper.  The rules on an Annotated Bibliography layout are not set in stone.  So make sure to ask your professor if they have any specific preferences or refer to your academic disciplines rules pertaining to citation of research.  For instance: You may be asked to include an introduction explaining your research. Also, you may begin your first annotation on a new page.  This again is a teacher preference or even more broadly a preference of your academic discipline.

If you follow the layout below, you will be on your way.  But make sure to ask your teacher or refer to your academic disciplines rules for citation prior to turning in your annotated bibliography.

Your Name&lt;br&gt;
Instructors Name&lt;br&gt;
Class Title/Section&lt;br&gt;
Calendar Date&lt;br&gt;

Title of Your Annotated Bibliography (This should be centered on the page)

Introduction (If required)&lt;br&gt;

Beginning of Your First Bibliographic Entry&lt;br&gt;
* entries should be alphabetized by the first word in the entry
* each citation should be completed in accordance to your academic discipline's rule for citation

==Annotation Styles==

There are several styles of annotation, with two major styles being: MLA style and APA style; your professor may require you to use one of them or another one specific to your field of study. MLA stands for the Modern Language Association,and APA stands for the American Psychological Association. Both are used to emphasize different information. For instance, in the APA, psychology is the major interest so they emphasize dates since recent research tends to make older research obsolete. In contrast, MLA emphasizes page numbers because specific articles use the exact wordings of texts, which articles in psychology journals rarely do. No matter what style your teacher requires, be sure to follow the guidelines for documenting your research.

In terms of determining which annotation style to use in creating your annotated bibliography, you should refer to your instructor or even more broadly to your discipline of academic study.  Different aspects of academia have different ways of citing sources for research, and it is important that you are aware of which form of citation your discipline uses prior to completing your annotated bibliography.

'''MLA ANNOTATION STYLE'''

Besides providing a correct citation for the article intended for use in your research, each entry for an annotated bibliography, completed in MLA format, can contain up to three paragraphs, that each serve a specific purpose.  The first paragraph works to summarize the material in the article being annotated.  While the second paragraph will attempt to provide an evaluation of the annotated text.  Sometimes the first and second paragraph discussed here can be combined into one paragraph, depending upon the conciseness of the annotation.  The final paragraph in an annotation in MLA format describes how the article being annotated works specifically with your intended area of research.

This brief description only provides an example of how to set up a MLA annotated bibliography entry; it should be noted that the overall purpose of an annotation entry is to provide a concise overview of the article be annotated and how it relates to you specified area of research interest.

'''APA ANNOTATION STYLE'''

When creating an annotated entry for an annotated bibliography formatted in APA, each entry should contain two paragraphs.  The first paragraph, much like an entry in MLA format, should assess and summarize the article intended for research.  While the second paragraph should work to evaluate the strengths of the article's method, presentation, and data analysis.  

What makes an annotated bibliography entry different in APA format than that of one in MLA format is that in an APA annotated entry the importance of the source to your desired area of interest is not stated.  The purpose of an APA annotation entry is to evaluate the credibility of the article, as opposed to its personal significance to you as a researcher.

==General Layout Checklist for an Annotated Bibliography==

Does your Annotated Bibliography follow these style cues?

*Are all lines of your bibliography double spaced?
*Have you included any extra line spacing?  You shouldn't!
*Is your class information at the beginning of the paper and aligned left?
*Is your title centered?
*Does the first line of of each works cited entry begin to the far left?
*Are all following lines (the second, third, fourth...) indented 4 spaces?
*Do you have page numbers?  You should.  They should be located at the top of the page in the right hand corner.
*Is your name on every page?  It should be located within a header located on the top of the page in the right hand corner.
*Is your bibliography alphabetized?
*Have you used the correct format (APA, MLA)?

It should be noted that this checklist is not all encompassing, and that if you have any questions about what you should include in your annotated bibliography you should refer to you instructor or academic discipline's rules for citation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Catullus=

*Forgive me for taking the liberty to create your talkpage but I noticed your recent contribution to [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus]] project that I'm currently working on. Thank you for your input! I appreciate you respecting my layout scheme as well as tagging the poem's status, presumably from my user page? :D Anyway, if you'd like to become a more permanent part of the project leave a message on my talk page. 

I also noticed you are studying the Oxford Latin course? I am too, in conjunction with Cambridge as you can get a more rounded feel for the language. And I'm also learning Ancient Greek from Athenaze. Cool eh? Anyway, I'll wrap up now and I hope to hear from you!

Many thanks, [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 19:08, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

*More contributions! 43 and 11. Good stuff there, I hope you don't mind me re-arranging it so I can keep my standard universal layout. Your points are there tho, just not where you put them :P.

Can I consider you officially involved now? That is 3 or 4 poems you've added. Thanks again. [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 12:06, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry about making a mess of the layout, I'm trying to keep it standard but I keep on forgetting various things. :D I'm honoured that you think me officially involved as most of the stuff I've added I've just copied and pasted from somewhere. On that note, I notice that wikisource has extra poems that wouldn't be hard to write notes for. Is there such a thing as an inter-project collaboration on a given topic? I've never heard of it, but i think it could be useful as alot of the projets duplicate information.

:I was also wondering if you ever work on the latin or ancient greek parts of this project. I posed some questions about teaching styles on wikiversity a while ago but no-one replied. Most of the pages are lists of grammer rules and explanations without much connection between the exercises. This is unusual for text books, which usually have stories and related history (such as Dicaeopolis in Athenaze, Quintus in Oxford, and Caecilius in Cambridge). If this doesn't interest you then just ignore it, but I was wondering what you would think about doing something similar with wikibooks Latin or maybe even Catullus? Thanks again for inviting me to get involved! [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 08:33, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

*I'd like to keep this WikiBook as a separate entity, although you can of course copy text from Wsource to save you time. The difference is, we're duplicating material ''for the better.''
The language work I'm doing is cross-linking vocab. help to Wiktionary, See [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/3]], [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/51]] for examples of model, comprehensive texts.
I'm glad someone else is here tbh, its quite a lot of work for one person! I see your online right now :D Good stuff on the meter too. 
*I've featured you in the project news on my [[User:Alakazam38|user]] page. :D
[[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 11:38, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:I saw the cross linked vocab. Good idea! I'm not sure I understand what you're saying about duplicated material, but I think you're saying you don't want this wikibook to nothing more than copied from other projects? I'm online, but not for long. I had an edit conflict with the metre so I hope I didn't delete any of your work. I didn't check if anyone was editing it before I started. *oops* And I've only included English examples, I don't have any certified scansions of latin and I don't trust my own work. I thought the English might be useful to see how it can be applied in a way that sounds natural, though. I've also heard of a metre that Catullus used that was called &quot;limping iambic&quot; or something? It went something like v-|v-|v-|v-|-v and had an emphasis on the last -v but i can't find any sources for it. Do you know what I'm talking about? [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 11:53, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:(wow, second edit conflict in as many minutes!)

:Thanks for the project news! :D [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 11:53, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

===Our Project===

*What I mean is that I know that we're basically copying material from Wsource, but because the author has been dead for over a 100 years it's free reign stuff. What makes it ''our'' material is our comprehensive annotations. Therefore, we will have a lot of duplicated material but much more ''original'' material that we can call our own.
*If you put a &lt;pre&gt;{{inuse}}&lt;/pre&gt; when you start editing, that way, if I come across it, I'll know you're there. 
*Yes Catullus does use Limping Iambics, its in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/8|Poem 8]]. I'll write up the meter when I get a chance. I'm also thinking of adding some other appendices, perhaps a glossary and some credit to us too :P. [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 12:26, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:Ah right. I understand. And I'll try to remember to use the &lt;pre&gt;{{inuse}}&lt;/pre&gt; thing on pages. Great work on the metre! :D [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 11:16, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

===New Team Member!===

Just thought I'd tell you that a new member, [[User:Puellamala]] has joined our project. I hope us three, and any others will be able to collaborate to make this book the best we can! [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 19:07, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:Yay! This is becoming quite a collaboration! [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 11:09, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

*Do you use Instant Messenger of any kind? If so, what is your addy? :D
*Good work! I've added a couple of extra notes to [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/93|Poem 93]] and it's all done! :D [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 17:12, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

*Write a bit about yourself in the [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/Authors|authors]] section! :D [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 19:09, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

:I don't use any inatnt messanger, sorry. But this talk page is proving effective. Thanks for your work on 93! [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 10:37, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

*Good work on 50! The layout is practically spot on! :D I made a template for everyone's benefit. Check it out [[User:Alakazam38#Template|here.]]

:Thanks! that's really useful! I've been copying the layout from another poem and changing the content each time. I like the new signature by the way. [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 06:39, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

==Preface==

*I like very much what you've added to the preface, though I dont like that picture of Catullus - simply because he wouldnt have looked like that. He was Roman, and Romans shaved. So I've removed it. The preface will be one of those things that will have to be redrafted again and again because it is the first thing people will read. So its got to be good. But you've provided some excellent starting material. I especially like your image you put in, though I'd like to find out how to position such things. So thanks for that input, but be prepared to see it chopped and changed eventually. We've got a good basis to work on and that's a start.

*Don't forget to credit yourself in the authors section.

*Yep, any partcular things about syntax or language worthy of notice goes in the COTT. Any ''scansion'' worthy of attention can have it's own note. See [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/94|Poem 94]] for an example. I ''do'' like my signature too :P

&lt;b&gt;[[User:Alakazam38|&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;ak&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gold&quot;&gt;az&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;scarlet&quot;&gt;am&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;silver&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Alakazam38|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:23, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:Cheers. With images, I generally copy and paste the code from somewhere else and add in the image name and subtitle. Most of the things are somewhat self explanitory and can be fiddled around with using the preview button till they look right. The image of Catullus was the only one I could find on Commons, hopefully something else will appear soon. 

:I'll get round to writing about myself eventually...

:Thanks for the grammar answer. I noticed tat on a certain site, there were scanned versions of Catullus's poems. Do you know if scansion is covered by copyright or not? Thanks [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 09:03, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

*No scansion is nothing to do with copyright. It's a poetic meter and once a poem is tagged as it, then that's it, it can only have one form, due to the rules. The Latin scansion stays the same whoever tranlates it. If something is ambiguous it is most likely 'syllaba anceps'' at the end of meters.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 1===

*'''''dicebas - you used to say'''''

The use of the Imperfect Tense here &quot;used to&quot; implies that she has changed from what she used to say. It also hints at a disapproving tone from Catullus himself, angry and disappointed that she has gone back on a promise to him.

*'''''solum te nosse Catullum - you knew only Catullus''''

This is a repitition of the idea in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/70|Poem 70]] that Catullus is the only one in Lesbia's life. As the poem progresses, we learn this is not what it seems.

===Line 2===

*'''''nec prae me velle tenere Iovem -  and not hold Jupiter over me'''''

This is an exaggeration by Catullus, suggesting that Lesbia would choose him over a god. This emphasises the disappointment that he feels and the reader begins to understand Lesbia's fickle personality. It also picks up on [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/70|Poem 70]] where he says that she claimed to prefer to marry him over Jupiter.

===Line 4===

*'''''pater ut gnatos diligit - as a father loves his sons'''''

This is a reference to 'pietas'. It is a belief in the male support throughout the family. The grandfather supports the son and grandson, while being supported by them and the same principles for the son and grandson.

===Line 8===

*'''''cogit amare magis, sed bene velle minus - forces a lover to love more but to like less'''''

Catullus is angry at Lesbia for cheating on him but he is still involuntarily in love with her.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Functions ==
=== Domain and range of a function ===
In general:

*&lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is called the '''image''' of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.
*The set of permitted &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; values is called the '''domain''' of the function
*The set of all images is called the '''range''' of the function

=== Modulus function ===
The '''modulus''' of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt; |x| &lt;/math&gt;, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; |x| =  \begin{cases} x &amp; \mbox{for } x \ge 0 \\ -x &amp; \mbox{for } x &lt; 0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

== Differentiation ==
=== Chain rule ===
The '''chain rule''' states that:

If &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Product rule ===
The '''product rule''' states that:

If &lt;math&gt; y = uv &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; are both functions of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} (uv) = u \frac{dv}{dx} + v \frac{du}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative way of writing the product rule is:

:&lt;math&gt; (uv)' = uv' + u'v \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quotient rule ===
The '''quotient rule''' states that:

If &lt;math&gt; y = \frac{u}{v} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; are functions of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left ( \frac{u}{v} \right ) = \frac{ v \frac{du}{dx} - u \frac{dv}{dx} }{v^2} &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative way of writing the quotient rule is:

:&lt;math&gt; \left ( \frac{u}{v} \right )' = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} &lt;/math&gt;

=== ''x'' as a function of ''y'' ===
In general,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{ \frac{dx}{dy} } &lt;/math&gt;

== Trigonometric functions ==
=== The functions cosec ''θ'', sec ''θ'' and cot ''θ'' ===
&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cosec}{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sin{\theta}} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \cot{\theta} = \frac{1}{\tan{\theta}} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Standard trigonometric identities ===

&lt;math&gt; \cot{\theta} = \frac{ \cos{ \theta } } {\sin{ \theta } } &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \sec^2{\theta} = 1 + \tan^2{\theta} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cosec}^2{\theta} = 1 + \cot^2{\theta}  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Differentiation of sin ''x'', cos ''x'' and tan ''x'' ===
&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left ( \sin{x} \right ) = \cos{x} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left ( \cos{x} \right ) = -\sin{x} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left ( \tan{x} \right ) = \sec^2{x} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Integration of sin(''kx'') and cos(''kx'') ===

In general,

&lt;math&gt; \int \cos{kx}\ dx = \frac{1}{k} \sin{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int \sin{kx}\ dx = - \frac{1}{k} \cos{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;

== Exponentials and logarithms ==
=== Differentiating exponentials and logarithms ===
In general,

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{when}\ y = e^{kx},\ \frac{dy}{dx} = ke^{kx} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int e^{kx}\ dx = \frac{1}{k} e^{kx} + c &lt;/math&gt;

=== Natural logarithms ===
If &lt;math&gt;y=\ln{x}&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} &lt;/math&gt;


It follows from this result that

:&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{1}{x}\ dx = \ln{x} + c &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\ dx = \ln{f(x)} + c,\ \mbox{provided}\ f(x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

== Integration ==
=== Integration by parts ===
&lt;math&gt; \int u \frac{dv}{dx}\ dx = uv - \int v \frac{du}{dx}\ dx &lt;/math&gt;

=== Standard integrals ===
&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{dx}{a^2 + x^2} = \frac{1}{a} \tan^{-1}{ \left ( \frac{x}{a} \right ) } + c &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}} = \sin^{-1}{ \left ( \frac{x}{a} \right ) } + c &lt;/math&gt;

=== Volumes of revolution ===
The volume of the solid formed when the area under the curve &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, between &lt;math&gt; x = a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = b &lt;/math&gt;, is rotated through 360° about the &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;-axis is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \int_a^b y^2\ dx &lt;/math&gt;


The volume of the solid formed when the area under the curve &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, between &lt;math&gt; y = a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y = b &lt;/math&gt;, is rotated through 360° about the &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;-axis is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \int_a^b x^2\ dy &lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical methods ==
=== Iterative methods ===
An '''iterative''' method is a process that is repeated to produce a sequence of approximations to the required solution.

=== Numerical integration ===
'''Mid ordinate rule'''

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b y\ dx \approx h \lbrack y_{\frac{1}{2}} + y_{\frac{3}{2}} + \ldots +  y_{n-\frac{3}{2}} +  y_{n-\frac{1}{2}} \rbrack &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{where}\ h = \frac{b-a}{n} &lt;/math&gt;


'''Simpson's rule'''

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b y\ dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \lbrack \left ( y_0 + y_n \right ) + 4\left ( y_1 + y_3 \ldots + y_{n-1} \right ) + 2\left ( y_2 + y_4 + \ldots + y_{n-2} \right )  \rbrack&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{where}\ h = \frac{b-a}{n}\ \mbox{and}\ n\ \mbox{is even}&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: intergral → integral using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Series and limits ==

Two important limits:


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \left ( x^k e^{-x} \right ) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;       for any real number k


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \left ( x^k \ln{x}  \right ) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;   for all k &gt; 0




=== The basic series expansions ===
 &lt;math&gt;( r= 0,1,2,\cdots)&lt;/math&gt; 


&lt;math&gt;e ^x = 1+ x + {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^3 \over 3!} + {x^4 \over 4!} + \cdots +{x^r \over r!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;  


&lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - {x^3 \over 3!} + {x^5 \over 5!} - \cdots + \left (-1 \right )^r {x^{2r+1} \over (2r+1)!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^4 \over 4!} - \cdots + \left (-1 \right )^{r+1} {x^{2r} \over (2r)!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^n = 1 + nx + {n(n - 1) \over 2!} x^2 + \cdots +  \; {\ n \choose  r} \;  x^r + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; (r= 1,2,3, \cdots)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln (1 + x) = x - {x^2 \over 2} + {x^3 \over 3} - \cdots + (-1)^{r+1} {x^r \over r} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

=== Improper intergrals ===

The integral :&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\,&lt;/math&gt; is said to be improper if 

# the interval of integration is infinite, or;
# f(x) is not defined at one or both of the end points x=a and x=b, or;
# f(x) is not defined at one or more interior points of the interval &lt;math&gt;a \le x \le b&lt;/math&gt;.

== Polar coordinates ==
[[Image:Polar to cartesian.svg|right|thumb|250px|A diagram illustrating the relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates.]]

&lt;math&gt;x = r \cos \theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;y = r \sin \theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;r^2 = x^2 + y^2,\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = {y \over x}&lt;/math&gt;

=== The area bounded by a polar curve ===

For the curve &lt;math&gt;r = f(\theta),\,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\alpha \le \theta \le \beta.\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;A = \int_\alpha^\beta {1 \over 2} r^2 d\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''''r''''' must be defined and be non-negative throughout the interval &lt;math&gt;\alpha \le \theta \le \beta. \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical methods for the solution of first order differential equations ==

=== Euler's formula ===

&lt;math&gt; y_{r + 1} = y_r + hf( x_r, y_r )\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== The mid-point formula ===

&lt;math&gt; y_{r + 1} = y_{r - 1} + 2 h f( x_r , y_r )\,&lt;/math&gt;  

=== The improved Eular formula ===

&lt;math&gt;y_{r + 1} = y_r + {1 \over 2} ( k_1 + k_2 )\,&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt;k_1 = h f ( x_r , y_r)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;k_2 = h f ( x_r + h , y_r + k_1 ).\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Second order differential equations ==

=== Euler's identity ===

&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x,\, x \in \Bbb {R}\,&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;x = \pi,\,&lt;/math&gt; substituting into the identity gives 

  &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}=-1\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>I have added a note clarifying when maximum power transfer conditions are desirable and when not. This is often a source of confusion for students.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Circuit Theory/Page}}

== Maximum Power Transfer ==

Often we would like to transfer the most power from a source to a load placed across the terminals as possible. How can we determine the optimum resistance of the load for this to occur?

Let us consider a source modelled by a Thévenin equivalent (a Norton equivalent will lead to the same result, as the two are directly equivalent), with a load resistance, ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. The source resistance is ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the open circuit voltage of the source is ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'':

[[Image:Maximum Power Transfer Circuit.svg|center]]

The current in this circuit is found using Ohm's Law:

::&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{v_s}{R_s+R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage across the load resistor, ''v&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', is found using the voltage divider rule:

::&lt;math&gt;v_L=v_s \,\frac{R_L}{R_s + R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

We can now find the power dissipated in the load, ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;P_L=v_Li=\frac{R_L \, v^2_s}{\left(R_s+R_L\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We can now rewrite this to get rid of the ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the top:

::&lt;math&gt;P_L=\frac{v^2_s}{ \left(\frac{R_s}{\sqrt{R_L}}+\sqrt{R_L}\right)^2} = 
\frac{v^2_s}{ R_s \left(\frac{\sqrt{R_s}}{\sqrt{R_L}}+\frac{\sqrt{R_L}}{\sqrt{R_s} }\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the source resistance is not changeable, then we obtain maximum power by minimising the bracketed part of the denominator in the above equation. It is an elementary mathematical result that &lt;math&gt;x+x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is at a minimum when ''x=1''. In this case, it is equal to 2. Therefore, the above expression is minimum under the following condition:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{R_s}}{\sqrt{R_L}}=1&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the condition that:

::{|style=&quot; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|align=&quot;left&quot;|&lt;math&gt;R_L=R_s \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

{{TextBox|We will get maximum power out of the source if the load resistance is identical to the internal source resistance. This is the '''Maximum Power Transfer Theorem'''. }}

===Efficiency===

The efficiency, ''&amp;eta;'' of the circuit is the proportion of all the energy dissipated in the circuit that is dissipated in the load. We can immediately see that at maximum power transfer to the load, the efficiency is 0.5, as the source resistor has half the voltage across it. We can also see that efficiency will increase as the load resistance increases, even though the power transferred will fall.

The efficiency can be calculated using the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{P_L}{P_L+P_s}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the power in the source resistor. This can be found using a simple modification to the equation for ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'':

::&lt;math&gt;P_s=\frac{v^2_s}{ R_L \left(\frac{\sqrt{R_s}}{\sqrt{R_L}}+\frac{\sqrt{R_L}}{\sqrt{R_s} }\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The graph below shows the power in the load (as a proportion of the maximum power, ''P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'') and the efficiency for values of ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' between 0 and 5 times ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''.

[[Image:Maximum Power Transfer Graph.svg|center]]

It is important to note that under conditions of maximum power transfer as much power is dissipated in the source as in the load. This is not a desirable condition if, for example, the source is the electricity supply system and the load is your electric heater. This would mean that the electricity supply company would be wasting half the power it generates. In this case, the generators, power lines, etc. are designed to give the lowest source resistance possible, giving high efficiency. The maximum power transfer condition is used in (usually high-frequency) communications systems where the source resistance can not be made low, the power levels are relatively low and it is paramount to get as much signal power as possible to the receiving end of the system (the load).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Making_fuzz_stick.jpg|thumb|left|Making a fuzz stick with a pocket knife]]
[[Image:Finished_fuzz_stick.jpg|thumb|right|The finished product]]
A fuzz stick is a small piece of wood which has had slices cut in the sides to create small shavings.  Ideally, the shavings should remain attached to the stick, but if they are accidentally removed, they can still be used.  Because the shavings are thin, they are easy to ignite.  Because they are attached, they in turn ignite the larger host stick.

To make a fuzz stick safely, choose a piece of dry wood, preferably a dry, dead stick from an evergreen tree.  The stick should be about the size of a pencil, or perhaps a little larger.  Place one end of the stick against a firm surface, such as a log or a rock, hold the upper end with your left hand, and hold the knife in the right.  Carefully slice into the stick with a downward, diagonal motion, maintaining even pressure.  Stop before the knife reaches the center of the stick.  Take another slice a little higher up, and repeat until the stick is covered with the slices of &quot;fuzz.&quot;  Turn the stick over and make more shavings on the other side.  This is far easier to do with a sharp knife and with a soft wood such a pine, fir, spruce or hemlock.  Be sure that you are always slicing away from your fingers.  Think at all times about where the knife blade will go if the shaving breaks off, or the knife slips.  Make sure that your hand, foot, leg, companions, etc. are not in the path!

Make several fuzz sticks and use them as the first layer of kindling, positioning them atop the tinder.  In some cases, the fuzz sticks themselves can be used as tinder.

== Ground-Track Maps ==

[[Image:ISS Expedition 15 patch.png|thumb|The NASA logo for the ISS Expedition 15, showing a ground track map.]]



== Effects of Earth's Rotation ==

The earth rotates with respect to the orbit, which means that the orbital plane is essentially stationary in space while the earth rotates. The sine wave formed by the ground track is displaced by the number of degrees each orbit by the number of degrees that the earth rotates during the orbital period. The image below shows a satellite ground track through two of earth's rotations:

[[Image:Satellite Orbital Elements ISS Groundtrack.png]]

== Launch Inclination and Latitude ==

It should be apparent that the point and orientation of launch heavily affects the orientation of the satellite's orbit. A satellite is launched from a point A on the surface of the earth. The launch latitude and longitude are given by ''L'' and &amp;lambda; respectively. The satellite is launched with an azimuth angle of &amp;beta;.

The satellite's orbit passes through the equator on the ground-track map (the ascending node) at point B with an inclination angle from the equator of ''i''. We can calculate ''i'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(i) = \sin(\beta) \cos(L)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see from this result that a direct orbit must have a launch azimuth between 0&amp;deg; and 180&amp;deg;. A retrograde orbit must have a launch angle between 180&amp;deg; and 360&amp;deg;. 

We can see that satellites cannot be put into an equatorial orbit if the launch site is not on the equator. We can also see that a launch site cannot obtain an orbital inclination smaller than the launch latitude. For that reason, launch sites closer to the equator have a larger range of possible orbits. A launch site directly on the equator can put a satellite into any orbit.

{{TextBox|'''Example: USA Launch Sites'''

The United States has a series of launch sites in southerly states: Florida and Texas are the most well known, but there are plans for a new launch site in New Mexico as well. Launch sites in Florida have a latitude of 25&amp;deg;}}</text>

A '''Handspring''' is a tricking/gymnastics move in which you flip halfway, place your hands on the ground, spring off your hands continuing the flip that you started, and land back on your feet. Either a front handspring or a back handspring can be done. 

==Steps==
*A front handspring is done while moving forward. You run, throw your hands into the ground while doing a forward rotation, then spring off your hands onto your legs, while keeping your legs straight. [[http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=2028449283 Front Handspring Video]]

*A back handspring is done differently. It can be performed out of a roundoff or while stationary. First, you bend your legs about halfway, pulling your arms backward. Then you jump up and back off of your legs while flinging your arms over your head backward. As your hands hit the ground behind you, your body should be in an arc. That action should put enough momentum into your legs to flip you over  and bring you back onto your feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many foods that can be wrapped in foil and dropped into a bed of coals for cooking, but potatoes spring to mind immediately.  Corn on the cob is also very good.  Simply wrap them in foil, place them in a bed of coals, and take them out after a while.  It's that easy.

A tasty dessert can be made by coring an apple, stuffing it with marshmallows and a few pieces of cinnamon candy (such as Red Hots), wrapping it all in foil, and placing it in a bed of coals.  Take it out after about 15 minutes and check that the marshmallow has melted.  If it has, the apple is ready to eat.

You can also wrap vegetarian burger, thin slices of potato, carrot, and other veggies in foil.  Add  a tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of salt (if desired), some pepper, and some garlic powder, seal, and place it in the coals.  Check it after 30 minutes or so.  When the potato is soft, it is ready to eat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Simmering is a cooking technique where food is cooked in liquid that is almost hot enough to boil.   Simmering allows the outdoor chef to cook foods longer to soften them without overcooking them and without using excess fuel.  On a backpacking trip, this is especially important, as fuel is generally carried in the pack (and more fuel equals more weight).

Tough vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, turnips, and dried vegetables (such as beans and peas) are ideal candidates for simmering.  Simply fill a pot with water (about half way), and add the vegetables.  When the water begins to bubble, back off the heat (turn down a camp stove, or raise the pot higher over an open fire).  Soup mixes are also ideal for simmering.

== Eccentric Anomaly ==
[[File:Eccentric and true anomaly.PNG|thumb|The eccentric anomaly, ''E'', is the angle measured at the geometric center of the orbit between the periapsis and the projection of the satellite position on an auxiliary circle of radius ''a''.]]

Because the position of an orbiting body is not directly related to it's true anomaly additional angular parameters must be introduced to determine the time of flight.
The eccentric anomaly is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan\frac{E}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\tan\frac{\nu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
The trajectory equation in terms of eccentric anomaly is:
:&lt;math&gt;r = a(1-e\cos E)&lt;/math&gt;

The mean anomaly is the angle that an orbiting body would travel in a certain time if it were in a circular orbit whose radius is the semi-major axis of its orbit. Recall the formula for mean motion:
:&lt;math&gt;M = nt = t\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}&lt;/math&gt;

The relation between eccentric and mean anomaly is expressed in Kepler's equation:
:&lt;math&gt;M = E-e\sin E&lt;/math&gt;

== Time of Flight ==
From Kepler's Equation, the time since periapsis is:
:&lt;math&gt; t = \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}}(E-e\sin E)&lt;/math&gt;
More generally:
:&lt;math&gt; t - t_0 = \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}}(E-E_0-e\sin (E-E_0))&lt;/math&gt;


==Non-Elliptical Trajectories==
===Hyperbolic Trajectory===
Kepler's equation for a hyperbolic trajectory is:
:&lt;math&gt; M = e\sinh H - H&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''H'' is the hyperbolic anomaly and is analogous to eccentric anomaly:
:&lt;math&gt;\tanh H = \sqrt{\frac{e-1}{e+1}}\tan \frac{\nu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these equations make use of hyperbolic sine and tangent functions.

===Parabolic Trajectory===
The time since periapsis for a parabolic trajectory can be expressed via Barker's Equation:
:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{p^3}{\mu}}\left(D+\frac{D^3}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Where the parabolic anomaly, ''D'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;D=\tan\frac{\nu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Rectilinear Trajectory===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{astrodynamics}}

== The Kepler Problem ==
While Kepler's equation is easy to solve for time, there is no general solution for the reverse problem. To determine eccentric anomaly (and thus spacecraft position) at a given time, generally an iterative numerical method is used, such as Newton's method:
:&lt;math&gt; x_{k+1}=x_{k}-\frac{F(x_k)}{F'(x_k)}&lt;/math&gt;
Where
:&lt;math&gt;F(E) = E - e \sin(E) - M(t)&lt;/math&gt;
The iteration takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;E_{k+1}=E_{k} - \frac{ E_{k} - e \sin(E_{k}) - M(t) }{ 1 - e \cos(E_{k})}&lt;/math&gt;
For most elliptical orbits an initial guess of ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''M'' is sufficient; for orbits with eccentricities greater than 0.8, ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &amp;pi; may be used. Better initial guesses are possible, but are not generally required. The iterative process is repeated until required accuracy conditions are achieved, for example:
:&lt;math&gt; |E_{k+1}-E_k|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;
Where &amp;delta; is the desired accuracy.

The quote about Microsoft's XPS document format, &quot; This format has already gained the support of many industry heavyweights and is poised to become a great format for archival purposes,&quot; seems like it was pulled from an advertisement without any actual comparison to PDF.

== other formats ==

Should we say something here about formats that are designed to be relatively human-readable in a plain text editor -- and so are nearly as future-proof as plain ASCII text -- and yet allow slightly more formatting flexibility than ASCII text?
I'm thinking of HTML, XHTML, LaTeX, TeX, YAML, [[w:Creole (markup)|Creole]], and reStructuredText.
I suspect that more documents are produced in those formats than in ODT, PDF, or XPS.

** I agree. Wikitext (esp Creole) has been my format of choice for some time, being easy to read, easy to generate &quot;printable&quot; formatted documents, and long-term good because it's UTF-8 text</text>

'''Aioli''' is a [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]-like sauce used in some [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European cuisines]], and common as a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] spread.

The key to the savoury flavour of aioli is the [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] / [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] emulsion. The same principle is at work in [[Cookbook:Hummus|hummus]].

'''''Senecio''''' is a genus of the daisy family (Family [[../Asteraceae/]]) that includes ragworts and groundsels.  Though of late the genus has been reviewed and split up, it still contains a vast number of species (about 1,500) of extremely wide form including leaf succulents, stem and tuber succulents, annuals, perennials, aquatic forms, climbers, shrubs and small trees. Some species produce natural pesticides (especially alkaloids) to deter or even kill animals that would eat them.

==Description==
The flower heads are normally rayed, completely yellow, and the heads are borne in branched clusters.

'''Ragwort''' ('''''Senecio jacobaea''''') is a very common wild flower in the family [[../Asteraceae/]] that is found throughout Europe, usually in dry, open places, and has also been widely distributed as a weed elsewhere. 

(For the North American species, see ''[[../Packera obovata/]]''.)

Alternative names include Cushag, Tansy Ragwort, St. James-wort, Ragweed, Stinking Nanny/Ninny/Willy, Staggerwort, Dog Standard, Cankerwort, Stammerwort and Mare's Fart. In the western US it is generally known as &quot;Tansy Ragwort&quot;, or even more confusingly &quot;Tansy&quot;, though its resemblance to the true tansy is superficial at best. This is a potentially dangerous misuse of names, since the true tansy has been used for culinary purposes.

Ragwort contains many different alkaloids, making it poisonous to animals. In theory it is also toxic to humans but the dose required would be enormous. Alkaloids which have been found in the plant are acetylerucifoline, (Z)-erucifoline, (E)-erucifoline, 21-hydroxyintegerrimine, integerrimine, jacoline, jaconine, jacobine, jacozine, riddelline, retrorsine, senecivernine, senecionine, seneciphylline, spartioidine, and usaramine.

Ragwort is of concern to people who keep horses, cattle, goats, and sheep. In areas of the world where ragwort is a native plant, such as Britain and continental Europe, documented cases of proven poisoning are rare. In other areas the plant may become much more invasive and constitute a problem. Although horses do not normally eat ragwort due to its bitter taste, if the growth is particularly dense or if it has been picked and dried out, and it is taken while grazing, the result, if a large quantity is consumed, can be irreversible cirrhosis of the liver. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. Animals may also resort to the consumption of Ragwort when there is shortage of food. In rare cases they can even become addicted to it. Sheep, in marked contrast, eat small quantities of the plant with relish and without apparent harm. They seem to profit slightly from eating it, according to some reports the alkaloids kill worms in the sheep's stomach.

The danger of Ragwort is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect. The toxin does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage DNA and gradually kill cells. About 3-7% of the body weight is sometimes claimed as deadly for horses, but an example in the scientific literature exists of a horse surviving being fed over 20% of its body weight. However, because of the mode of poisoning is through affecting DNA molecules, very small amounts are unlikely to cause harm as they will be below the threshold to cause damage. The toxic breakdown products can also be metabolised by the liver before damage occurs. The effect of low doses is also lessened by the destruction of the original alkaloids by the action of bacteria in the digestive track before they reach the bloodstream. There is no known antidote or cure to poisoning, but at least one example is known from the scientific literature of a horse making a full recovery once consumption has been stopped.

Honey collected from Ragwort has been found to contain small quantities of jacoline, jaconine, jacobine, jacozine, senecionine, and seneciphylline. However these are unlikely to cause harm since the quantities consumed are below the harm threshold.
In the United Kingdom, Common Ragwort ''(Senecio jacobaea)'' is one of the five plants named as an ''injurious weed'' under the provisions of the Weeds Act 1959. The word ''injurious'' in this context indicates that it could be harmful to agriculture not that it is dangerous to animals, as all the other ''injurious weeds'' listed are non-toxic. Under the terms of this act, a land occupier can be required by the Secretary of State (DEFRA) to prevent the spread of the plant. However, the growth of the plant is not made illegal by the act and there is no statutory obligation for control placed upon landowners in general.

==Description==
The plant is biennial or perennial. The stems are erect, straight, have no or few hairs, and reach a height of 0.3-2.0 meters. The leaves are pinnately lobed and the end lobe is blunt. The many names that include the word &quot;stinking&quot; (and Mare's Fart) arise because of the unpleasant smell of the leaves. The hermaphrodite flower heads are 1.5-2.5 cm diameter, and are borne in dense, flat-topped clusters; the florets are bright yellow. It has a long flowering period lasting from June to November. 

==Growing Conditions==
Sunny locations, adaptable to a wide range of soils.

==Varieties==
Two subspecies are accepted:
* ''Senecio jacobaea'' ssp. ''jacobaea'' - the typical plant, with ray florets present.
* ''Senecio jacobaea'' ssp. ''dunensis'' - the ray florets are missing.

==Ecology==
Ragwort can be found along road sides and waste grounds, and grows in all cool and high rainfall areas. 

The Ragwort is native to the Eurasian continent. In Europe it is widely spread, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. In Britain it is listed as a weed. In the USA it has been introduced, and is present mainly in the North West and North East: California, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

In South America it grows in Argentina, in Africa in the north, and on the Asian continent in India and Siberia. It is widespread weed in New Zealand and Australia.  In many Australian states ragwort has been declared a noxious weed.  This status requires landholders to remove it from their property, by law.

Pollination is by a wide range of bees, flies, moths and butterflies. Over a season, one plant may produce 2,000 to 2,500 yellow flowers in 20- to 60-headed, flat-topped corymbs. This number of seeds produced may be as large as 75,000 to 200,000, although in its native range in Eurasia very few of these would grow into new plants and research has shown that most seeds do not travel a great distance from the parent plant.

==Uses==
From medieval times to the mid 20th century, Ragwort was used against inflammations of the eye, for sore and cancerous ulcers, rheumatism, sciatica and gout, for painful joints. According to some, it would relieve the pain of bee stings.

All applications should be external only, never internally, and only under professional supervision.

With the large range of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are known to inhibit or reduce cell division, some researchers hope to use them to slow down or arrest the growth of cells in cancer.

In ancient Greece and Rome a supposed aphrodisiac was made from the plant; it was called satyrion.

The leaves can be used to obtain good green dye, as yellow dye is obtained from the flowers, as can be done for brown and orange.

== Part 4 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;But I've still better things about children. I've collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, 'most worthy and respectable people, of good education and breeding.' You see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing children, and children only. To all other types of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of children themselves in that sense. it's just their defencelessness that tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden- the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease, and so on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Ivan's collection is a set of stories, accounts, and anecdotes of evilness. Predominantly, his collection focuses on the stories of tortured and abused children. Throughout this discussion Ivan never cites or refers to any of his sources, although he does employ a few quotes in his monologue that the reader can assume came from one of these stories. His knowledge of quotes from these stories is indicative perhaps that he has spent some time studying these stories.

Ivan mentions here that the people who are the most evil towards children are often viewed as being perfectly respectable to other adults. These people appear to just be normal, although they have a certain penchant for torturing children. Notice that these people stand in stark contrast to the people that Ivan discussed earlier, the prisoners and criminals who showed love to children. The way people act towards children is often far different from the way people act towards other adults. Often, as Ivan will discuss below, it is easier for people to be cruel towards children than it is to be cruel to other adults.

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of cruelty- shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor child's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand what's done to her, should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to dear, kind God'! I say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I'll leave off if you like.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Ivan discusses the story of a young girl who is tortured and abused by her parents. The abuse started out as physical abuses: beating, thrashing, and kicking. However, the abuse generally graduated to &quot;more refined&quot; abuse. Ivan says this line, which he will reference several times again:

:''Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand what's done to her, should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her?''

The child does not even understand the abuse, and may not even realize that this treatment is not normal treatment. Ivan even refers to her tears as being &quot;unresentful&quot;, indicating that the child does not even fault her abusers. Ivan also makes another statement that is going to serve as the basis for much of his future discussions:

:''Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil.''

Without knowledge of good and evil, man would not have been on earth as we know it, but instead would be living in the paradise of Eden for all eternity. With the knowledge of good and evil, however, evils such as the abuse of young children are not only possible but actually inevitable.

== Part 5 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Nevermind. I want to suffer too,&quot; muttered Alyosha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so characteristic, and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities. I've forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator of the People! There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates, one of those men- somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then- who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure, are convinced that they've earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on his property of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor neighbours as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys- all mounted, and in uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general's favourite hound. 'Why is my favourite dog lame?' He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog's paw. 'So you did it.' The general looked the child up and down. 'Take him.' He was taken- taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that morning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his dependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front of them all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought from the lock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy, autumn day, a capital day for hunting. The general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked. He shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry.... 'Make him run,' commands the general. 'Run! run!' shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... 'At him!' yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the child. The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother's eyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of administering his estates. Well- what did he deserve? To be shot? To be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;To be shot,&quot; murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale, twisted smile.&lt;/p&gt;}} 

Alyosha is the perfect literary counter-point to Ivan. While Ivan is educated and atheistic, Alyosha is compassionate and religious. When Ivan offers to stop telling these stories about children, Alyosha responds &quot;Nevermind. I want to suffer too&quot;. To caring and compassionate Alyosha, even hearing stories about tortured children is tantamount to suffering.

This story is about a military man and an owner of some land who retires from the service. He is convinced of his own power over his own subjects, and hunts with his team of dogs. One day, a child throws a stone and injures the paw of one of the man's hunting dogs. In response, the man strips the child naked, and let's his dogs tear the child apart in front of his mother. 

Ivan asks, almost rhetorically, &quot;What did he deserve?&quot; To which Alyosha replied &quot;To be shot.&quot; Even though Alyosha blurts this out without thinking, it is uncharacteristic of someone who is supposed to embody christ-like love. 

{{-}}

== Part 6 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Bravo!&quot; cried Ivan delighted. &quot;If even you say so... You're a pretty monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha Karamazov!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;What I said was absurd, but-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;That's just the point, that 'but'!&quot; cried Ivan. &quot;Let me tell you, novice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without them. We know what we know!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;What do you know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I understand nothing,&quot; Ivan went on, as though in delirium. &quot;I don't want to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind long ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Why are you trying me?&quot; Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. &quot;Will you say what you mean at last?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to. You are dear to me, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up to your Zossima.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Ivan is happy about Alyosha's statement, because it does serve as some justification to his arguments. Even with an argument restricted to children, he has gotten Alyosha to abandon Jesus's second commandment. 

Ivan's statement &quot;I understand nothing&quot; is very reminiscent of Socrates, and helps to serve as an example both of Ivan's learning, and of his arrogance. 

When Ivan says &quot;I won't give you up to your Zossima&quot;, he is saying that he wants to prevent Alyosha from becoming a full monk at the monestary.
{{-}}

== Part 7 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to its centre, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on purpose. I am a bug, and I recognise in all humility that I cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity them. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level- but that's only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can't consent to live by it! What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause follows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?- I must have justice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite time and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have believed in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise again, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely I haven't suffered simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the soil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my own eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace his murderer. I want to be there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are built on this longing, and I am a believer.&quot;}}

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;But then there are the children, and what am I to do about them? That's a question I can't answer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions, but I've only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is so unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It's beyond all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among men. I  understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no such solidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must share responsibility for all their fathers' crimes, such a truth is not of this world and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that the child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn't grow up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, I am not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the universe it will be when everything in heaven and earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: 'Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.'&quot;}}

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;When the mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears, 'Thou art just, O Lord!' then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I can't accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take my own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child's torturer, 'Thou art just, O Lord!' but I don't want to cry aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether. It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to 'dear, kind God'! It's not worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them? Is it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of harmony, if there is hell?&quot;}}

{{-}}

{{LeftHalf|&quot;I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don't want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a  price. I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her forgive him for herself, if she will,
let her forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother's heart. But the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don't want harmony. From love for humanity I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;That's rebellion,&quot; murmered Alyosha, looking down.&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 8 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,&quot; said Ivan earnestly. &quot;One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, I challenge your answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature- that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance- and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;No, I wouldn't consent,&quot; said Alyosha softly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood of a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for ever?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;No, I can't admit it. Brother,&quot; said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing eyes, &quot;you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and He can forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocent blood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is built the edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, 'Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; on the contrary I've been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring Him in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in the foreground. Do you know, Alyosha- don't laugh I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I'll tell it to you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You wrote a poem?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Oh, no, I didn't write it,&quot; laughed Ivan, and I've never
written two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first reader- that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?&quot; smiled Ivan. &quot;Shall I tell it to you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I am all attention.&quot; said Alyosha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;My poem is called The Grand Inquisitor; it's a ridiculous
thing, but I want to tell it to you.}}</text>

== Part 8 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the
destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it. Yet
what was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers alone,
able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these
impotent rebels for their happiness those forces are miracle,
mystery and authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the
example for doing so. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the
pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee, &quot;If Thou wouldst know whether
Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself down, for it is written: the
angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself, and Thou
shalt know then whether Thou art the Son of God and shalt prove then
how great is Thy faith in Thy Father.&quot; But Thou didst refuse and
wouldst not cast Thyself down. Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and
well, like God; but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods? Oh,
Thou didst know then that in taking one step, in making one movement
to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have lost all
Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against
that earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise spirit that
tempted Thee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like
Thee? And couldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could
face such a temptation? Is the nature of men such, that they can
reject miracle, and at the great moments of their life, the moments of
their deepest, most agonising spiritual difficulties, cling only to
the free verdict of the heart? Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would
be recorded in books, would be handed down to remote times and the
utmost ends of the earth, and Thou didst hope that man, following
Thee, would cling to God and not ask for a miracle. But Thou didst not
know that when man rejects miracle he rejects God too; for man seeks
not so much God as the miraculous. And as man cannot bear to be
without the miraculous, he will create new miracles of his own for
himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft, though he
might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou didst
not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking and
reviling Thee, &quot;Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou
art He.&quot; Thou didst not come down, for again Thou wouldst not
enslave man by a miracle, and didst crave faith given freely, not
based on miracle. Thou didst crave for free love and not the base
raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him for ever.
But Thou didst think too highly of men therein, for they are slaves,
of course, though rebellious by nature. Look round and judge;
fifteen centuries have passed, look upon them. Whom hast Thou raised
up to Thyself? I swear, man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou
hast believed him! Can he, can he do what Thou didst? By showing him
so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him, for
Thou didst ask far too much from him- Thou who hast loved him more
than Thyself! Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less of
him. That would have been more like love, for his burden would have
been lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now
rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the
pride of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting and
barring out the teacher at school. But their childish delight will
end; it will cost them dear. Mankind as a whole has always striven
to organise a universal state. There have been many great nations with
great histories, but the more highly they were developed the more
unhappy they were, for they felt more acutely than other people the
craving for world-wide union. The great conquerors, Timours and
Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth
striving to subdue its people, and they too were but the unconscious
expression of the same craving for universal unity. Hadst Thou taken
the world and Caesar's purple, Thou wouldst have founded the universal
state and have given universal peace. For who can rule men if not he
who holds their conscience and their bread in his hands? We have taken
the sword of Caesar, and in taking it, of course, have rejected Thee
and followed him. Oh, ages are yet to come of the confusion of free
thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having begun to build
their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course, with
cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet and
spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon the beast
and raise the cup, and on it will be written, &quot;Mystery.&quot; But then, and
only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come for men. Thou
art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while we
give rest to all. And besides, how many of those elect, those mighty
ones who could become elect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and
have transferred and will transfer the powers of their spirit and
the warmth of their heart to the other camp, and end by raising
their free banner against Thee. Thou didst Thyself lift up that
banner. But with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor
destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we shall persuade them
that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us
and submit to us. And shall we be right or shall we be lying? They
will be convinced that we are right, for they will remember the
horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them.
Freedom, free thought, and science will lead them into such straits
and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble
mysteries, that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will
destroy themselves, others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one
another, while the rest, weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our
feet and whine to us: &quot;Yes, you were right, you alone possess His
mystery, and we come back to you, save us from ourselves!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 9 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take
the bread made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without
any miracle. They will see that we do not change the stones to
bread, but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from
our hands than for the bread itself! For they will remember only too
well that in old days, without our help, even the bread they made
turned to stones in their hands, while since they have come back to
us, the very stones have turned to bread in their hands. Too, too well
will they know the value of complete submission! And until men know
that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to blame for their not knowing
it?-speak! Who scattered the flock and sent it astray on unknown
paths? But the flock will come together again and will submit once
more, and then it will be once for all. Then we shall give them the
quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by nature.
Oh, we shall persuade them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst
lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them
that they are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that
childlike happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and
will look to us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the
hen. They will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and
will be proud at our being so powerful and clever that we have been
able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions. They
will tremble impotently before our wrath, their minds will grow
fearful, they will be quick to shed tears like women and children, but
they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter and
rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes, we shall set them to
work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their life like a
child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance. Oh, we shall
allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will love us
like children because we allow them to sin. We shall tell them that
every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission, that we
allow them to sin because we love them, and the punishment for these
sins we take upon ourselves. And we shall take it upon ourselves,
and they will adore us as their saviours who have taken on
themselves their sins before God. And they will have no secrets from
us. We shall allow or forbid them to live with their wives and
mistresses, to have or not to have children according to whether
they have been obedient or disobedient- and they will submit to us
gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of their conscience,
all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer for all.
And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will save them
from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present in
making a free decision for themselves. And all will be happy, all
the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over
them. For only we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There
will be thousands of millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand
sufferers who have taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of
good and evil. Peacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire
in Thy name, and beyond the grave they will find nothing but death.
But we shall keep the secret, and for their happiness we shall
allure them with the reward of heaven and eternity. Though if there
were anything in the other world, it certainly would not be for such
as they. It is prophesied that Thou wilt come again in victory, Thou
wilt come with Thy chosen, the proud and strong, but we will say
that they have only saved themselves, but we have saved all. We are
told that the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holds in her hands
the mystery, shall be put to shame, that the weak will rise up
again, and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her
loathsome body. But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the
thousand millions of happy children who have known no sin. And we
who have taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up
before Thee and say: &quot;Judge us if Thou canst and darest.&quot; Know that
I fear Thee not. Know that I too have been in the wilderness, I too
have lived on roots and locusts, I too prized the freedom with which
Thou hast blessed men, and I too was striving to stand among Thy
elect, among the strong and powerful, thirsting &quot;to make up the
number.&quot; But I awakened and would not serve madness. I turned back and
joined the ranks of those who have corrected Thy work. I left the
proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness of the humble.
What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will be built
up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock who at a
sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile
on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For if anyone
has ever deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall burn
Thee. Dixi.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 10 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with
excitement; when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly
moved and seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but
restrained himself. Now his words came with a rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;But... that's absurd!&quot; he cried, flushing. &quot;Your poem is in
praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him- as you meant it to be. And who
will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand it?
That's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church.... That's Rome,
and not even the whole of Rome, it's false-those are the worst of
the Catholics the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!... And there could not
be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor. What are these sins
of mankind they take on themselves? Who are these keepers of the
mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of
mankind? When have they been seen? We know the Jesuits, they are
spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you describe? They are not
that at all, not at all.... They are simply the Romish army for the
earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of
Rome for Emperor... that's their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery
or lofty melancholy about it.... It's simple lust of power, of
filthy earthly gain, of domination-something like a universal
serfdom with them as masters-that's all they stand for. They don't
even believe in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere
fantasy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Stay, stay,&quot; laughed Ivan. &quot;how hot you are! A fantasy you say,
let it be so! Of course it's a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you
really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is
actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain? Is
that Father Paissy's teaching?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;No, no, on the contrary, Father Paissy did once say something
rather the same as you... but of course it's not the same, not a bit
the same,&quot; Alyosha hastily corrected himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;A precious admission, in spite of your 'not a bit the same.' I
ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile
material gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by
great sorrow and loving humanity? You see, only suppose that there was
one such man among all those who desire nothing but filthy material
gain-if there's only one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten
roots in the desert and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to
make himself free and perfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity,
and suddenly his eyes were opened, and he saw that it is no great
moral blessedness to attain perfection and freedom, if at the same
time one gains the conviction that millions of God's creatures have
been created as a mockery, that they will never be capable of using
their freedom, that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to
complete the tower, that it was not for such geese that the great
idealist dreamt his dream of harmony. Seeing all that he turned back
and joined- the clever people. Surely that could have happened?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{-}}
== Part 11 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Joined whom, what clever people?&quot; cried Alyosha, completely
carried away. &quot;They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and
secrets.... Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their secret. Your
Inquisitor does not believe in God, that's his secret!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It's perfectly
true, it's true that that's the whole secret, but isn't that
suffering, at least for a man like that, who has wasted his whole life
in the desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of
humanity? In his old age he reached the clear conviction that
nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any
tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly, 'incomplete,
empirical creatures created in jest.' And so, convinced of this, he
sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the dread
spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and
deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and
yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they
are being led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way
think themselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name of
Him in Whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his
life long. Is not that tragic? And if only one such stood at the
head of the whole army 'filled with the lust of power only for the
sake of filthy gain'- would not one such be enough to make a
tragedy? More than that, one such standing at the head is enough to
create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with all its armies
and Jesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that I firmly
believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood at
the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such
even among the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that
accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is
to be found even now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing
not by chance but by agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for
the guarding of the mystery, to guard it from the weak and the
unhappy, so as to make them happy. No doubt it is so, and so it must
be indeed. I fancy that even among the Masons there's something of the
same mystery at the bottom, and that that's why the Catholics so
detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity of the idea,
while it is so essential that there should be one flock and one
shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea I might be an author
impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;You are perhaps a Mason yourself!&quot; broke suddenly from Alyosha.
&quot;You don't believe in God,&quot; he added, speaking this time very
sorrowfully. He fancied besides that his brother was looking at him
ironically. &quot;How does your poem end?&quot; he asked, suddenly looking down.
&quot;Or was it the end?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{-}}
== Part 12 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased
speaking he waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His
silence weighed down upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened
intently all the time, looking gently in his face and evidently not
wishing to reply. The old man longed for him to say something, however
bitter and terrible. But He suddenly approached the old man in silence
and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips. That was all his
answer. The old man shuddered. His lips moved. He went to the door,
opened it, and said to Him: 'Go, and come no more... come not at
all, never, never!' And he let Him out into the dark alleys of the
town. The Prisoner went away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And the old man?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his
idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;And you with him, you too?&quot; cried Alyosha, mournfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Why, it's all nonsense, Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of
a senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why
do you take it so seriously? Surely you don't suppose I am going
straight off to the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His
work? Good Lord, it's no business of mine. I told you, all I want is
to live on to thirty, and then... dash the cup to the ground!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the
blue sky, and the woman you love! How will you live, how will you love
them?&quot; Alyosha cried sorrowfully. &quot;With such a hell in your heart
and your head, how can you? No, that's just what you are going away
for, to join them... if not, you will kill yourself, you can't
endure it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;There is a strength to endure everything,&quot; Ivan said with a
cold smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;What strength?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;The strength of the Karamazovs- the strength of the Karamazov
baseness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption,
yes?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Possibly even that... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall
escape it, and then-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That's
impossible with your ideas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;In the Karamazov way, again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;'Everything is lawful,' you mean? Everything is lawful, is that
it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase, which so offended
Muisov- and which Dmitri pounced upon so naively and paraphrased!&quot;
he smiled queerly. &quot;Yes, if you like, 'everything is lawful' since the
word has been said, I won't deny it. And Mitya's version isn't bad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

== Part 13 ==

{{LeftHalf|&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Alyosha looked at him in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;I thought that going away from here I have you at least,&quot; Ivan
said suddenly, with unexpected feeling; &quot;but now I see that there is
no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula,
'all is lawful,' I won't renounce- will you renounce me for that,
yes?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;That's plagiarism,&quot; cried Ivan, highly delighted. &quot;You stole that
from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it's time we were
going, both of us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the
restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;Listen, Alyosha,&quot; Ivan began in a resolute voice, &quot;if I am really
able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them,
remembering you. It's enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I
shan't lose my desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as
a declaration of love if you like. And now you go to the right and I
to the left. And it's enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I
don't go away to-morrow (I think I certainly shall go) and we meet
again, don't say a word more on these subjects. I beg that
particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you specially, never speak
to me again,&quot; he added, with sudden irritation; &quot;it's all exhausted,
it has all been said over and over again, hasn't it? And I'll make you
one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want to 'dash the
cup to the ground,' wherever I may be I'll come to have one more
talk with you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of
that. I'll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look
at you, to see what you'll be by that time. It's rather a solemn
promise, you see. And we really may be parting for seven years or ten.
Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without
you, you will be angry with me for having kept you. Good-bye, kiss
me once more; that's right, now go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was
just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had
been very different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow
through Alyosha's mind in the distress and dejection of that moment.
He waited a little, looking after his brother. He suddenly noticed
that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder looked lower
than his left. He had never noticed it before. But all at once he
turned too, and almost ran to the monastery. It was nearly dark, and
he felt almost frightened; something new was growing up in him for
which he could not account. The wind had risen again as on the
previous evening, and the ancient pines murmured gloomily about him
when he entered the hermitage copse. He almost ran. &quot;Pater Seraphicus-
he got that name from somewhere- where from?&quot; Alyosha wondered. &quot;Ivan,
poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?... Here is the hermitage.
Yes, yes, that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he will save me- from him
and for ever!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Several times afterwards he wondered how he could, on leaving
Ivan, so completely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that
morning, only a few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and
not to give up doing so, even should he be unable to return to the
monastery that night.}}</text>

== The Grand Inquisitor ==

== Who Is This Book For? ==

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will cover three chapters from the book '''The Brothers Karamazov''': '''Rebellion''', '''The Grand Inquisitor''', and '''The Devil'''. These three chapters center around the character Ivan, and represent some of the most powerful critiques of organized religion. Of particular interest here is Roman Catholicism.

It may be possible for this annotated text to eventually be expanded to cover additional chapters from the book. However, considering its size, it is unlikely that the entire book will ever be annotated here. Besides the three covered initially, there are several other important chapters worth annotating.

== How Will This Book Be Arranged? ==

The three chapters presented in this annotation are not subdivided into sections. However, for the sake of clarity, this book will divide the chapters into individual component pieces, at places where there is a logical breaking point.

The first section of the book will contain some basic information about '''The Brothers Karamazov''', including information about the author, information about the plot, and information about the characters. The second section of the book will contain the annotations, complete with the full text of the passages. The full text will appear in shaded boxes on the left of the page, and discussion and annotation will appear in plain text on the right side of the page.

== Where To Go From Here? ==

Readers who have not yet read ''The Brothers Karamazov'' are encouraged to read it in its entirety. The full text can be found at wikisource: [[Wikisource:The Brothers Karamazov]].</text>

==Operational summary==
The netfilter framework, of which {{wp|iptables}} is a part of, allows the [[w:system administrator|system administrator]] to define rules for how to deal with network [[w:packet|packet]]s.  Rules are grouped into ''chains''&amp;mdash;each chain is an ordered list of rules.  Chains are grouped into ''tables''&amp;mdash;each table is associated with a different kind of packet processing.

Each rule contains a specification of which packets match it and a ''target'' that specifies what to do with the packet if it is matched by that rule.  Every network packet arriving at or leaving from the computer traverses at least one chain, and each rule on that chain attempts to match the packet.  If the rule matches the packet, the traversal stops, and the rule's target dictates what to do with the packet.  If a packet reaches the end of a predefined chain without being matched by any rule on the chain, the chain's ''policy'' target dictates what to do with the packet. If a packet reaches the end of a user-defined chain without being matched by any rule on the chain or the user-defined chain is empty, traversal continues on the calling chain (implicit target RETURN). Only predefined chains have policies.

Rules in iptables are grouped into chains. A chain is a set of rules for IP packets, determining what to do with them. Each rule can possibly dump the packet out of the chain (short-circuit), and further chains are not considered. A chain may contain a link to another chain - if either the packet passes through that entire chain or matches a RETURN target rule it will continue in the first chain. There is no limit to how many nested chains there can be. There are three basic chains (INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD), and the user can create as many as desired. A rule can merely be a pointer to a chain.

===Tables===
There are three built-in tables, each of which contains some predefined chains. It is possible for extension modules to create new tables. The administrator can create and delete user-defined chains within any table.  Initially, all chains are empty and have a policy target that allows all packets to pass without being blocked or altered in any fashion.

* '''filter table''' &amp;mdash; This table is responsible for filtering (blocking or permitting a packet to proceed).  Every packet passes through the filter table.  It contains the following predefined chains, and any packet will pass through one of them:
** ''INPUT chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets destined for this system go through this chain (hence sometimes referred to as ''LOCAL_INPUT'')
** ''OUTPUT chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets created by this system go through this chain (aka. ''LOCAL_OUTPUT'')
** ''FORWARD chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets merely passing through the system (being [[w:routing|routed]]) go through this chain.

* '''nat table''' &amp;mdash; This table is responsible for setting up the rules for rewriting packet addresses or ports.  The first packet in any connection passes through this table: any verdicts here determine how all packets in that connection will be rewritten.  It contains the following predefined chains:
** ''PREROUTING chain'' &amp;mdash; Incoming packets pass through this chain before the local routing table is consulted, primarily for DNAT (destination-[[w:network address translation|NAT]]).
** ''POSTROUTING chain'' &amp;mdash; Outgoing packets pass through this chain after the routing decision has been made, primarily for SNAT (source-[[w:network address translation|NAT]]).
** ''OUTPUT chain'' &amp;mdash; Allows limited DNAT on locally-generated packets

* '''mangle table''' &amp;mdash; This table is responsible for adjusting packet options, such as [[w:quality of service|quality of service]].  All packets pass through this table.  Because it is designed for advanced effects, it contains all the possible predefined chains:
** ''PREROUTING chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets entering the system in any way, before routing decides whether the packet is to be forwarded (FORWARD chain) or is destined locally (INPUT chain).
** ''INPUT chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets destined for this system go through this chain
** ''FORWARD chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets merely passing through the system go through this chain.
** ''OUTPUT chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets created by this system go through this chain 
** ''POSTROUTING chain'' &amp;mdash; All packets leaving the system go through this chain.

In addition to the built-in chains, the user can create any number of user-defined chains within each table, which allows them to group rules logically.

Each chain contains a list of rules.  When a packet is sent to a chain, it is compared against each rule in the chain in order.  The rule specifies what properties the packet must have for the rule to match, such as the  [[w:TCP and UDP port|port number]] or [[w:IP address|IP address]].  If the rule does not match then processing continues with the next rule.  If, however, the rule does match the packet, then the rule's ''target'' instructions are followed (and further processing of the chain is usually aborted).  Some packet properties can only be examined in certain chains (for example, the outgoing network interface is not valid in the INPUT chain).  Some targets can only be used in certain chains, and/or certain tables (for example, the ''SNAT'' target can only be used in the POSTROUTING chain of the nat table).

===Rule targets===
The target of a rule can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of the built-in targets &lt;tt&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;DROP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;QUEUE&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;RETURN&lt;/tt&gt;.  When a target is the name of a user-defined chain, the packet is diverted to that chain for processing (much like a [[w:subroutine|subroutine]] call in a [[w:programming language|programming language]]).  If the packet makes it through the user-defined chain without being acted upon by one of the rules in that chain, processing of the packet resumes where it left off in the current chain.  These inter-chain calls can be nested to an arbitrary depth.

The following built-in targets exist:

;&lt;tt&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target causes netfilter to accept the packet.  What this means depends on which chain is doing the accepting.  For instance, a packet that is accepted on the INPUT chain is allowed to be received by the host, a packet that is accepted on the OUTPUT chain is allowed to leave the host, and a packet that is accepted on the FORWARD chain is allowed to be routed through the host.

;&lt;tt&gt;DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target causes netfilter to drop the packet without any further processing.  The packet simply disappears without any indication of the fact that it was dropped being given to the sending host or application.  This frequently appears to the sender as a communication timeout, which can cause confusion (though dropping undesirable inbound packets is often considered a good security policy, because it gives no indication to a potential attacker that your host even exists).

;&lt;tt&gt;QUEUE&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target causes the packet to be sent to a queue in [[w:user space|user space]]. An application can use the [[w:libipq|libipq]] library, which also is part of the netfilter/iptables project, to alter the packet. If there is no application that reads the queue, this target is equal to DROP.

;&lt;tt&gt;RETURN&lt;/tt&gt;
:According to the official netfilter documentation, this target has the same effect of falling off the end of a chain: for a rule in a built-in chain, the policy of the chain is executed. For a rule in a user-defined chain, the traversal continues at the previous chain, just after the rule which jumped to this chain.

There are many extension targets available.  Some of the most common ones are:

;&lt;tt&gt;REJECT&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target has the same effect as 'DROP' except that it sends an error packet back to the original sender. It is mainly used in the INPUT or FORWARD chains of the filter table. The type of packet can be controlled thorough the '--reject-with' parameter. A rejection packet can explicitly state that the connection has been filtered (an ICMP connection-administratively-filtered packet), though most users prefer that the packet will simply state that the computer does not accept that type of connection (such packet will be a tcp-reset packet for denied TCP connections, an icmp-port-unreachable for denied udp sessions or an icmp-protocol-unreachable for non-tcp non-udp packets). If the '--reject-with' parameter hasn't been specified, the default rejection packet is always icmp-port-unreachable.

;&lt;tt&gt;LOG&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target logs the packet.  This can be used in any chain in any table, and is often used for debugging (such as to see which packets are being dropped).

;&lt;tt&gt;ULOG&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target logs the packet but not like the LOG target. The LOG target sends information to the [[w:Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] log but ULOG [[w:multicast|multicast]]s the packets matching this rule through a [[w:netlink|netlink]] [[w:Internet socket|socket]] so that userspace programs can receive these packets by connecting to the socket

;&lt;tt&gt;DNAT&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target causes the packet's destination address (and optionally port) to be rewritten for [[w:network address translation|network address translation]].  The '--to-destination' flag must be supplied to indicate the destination to use.  This is only valid in the OUTPUT and PREROUTING chains within the nat table.  This decision is remembered for all future packets which belong to the same connection, and replies will have their source address and port changed back to the original (ie. the reverse of this packet).

;&lt;tt&gt;SNAT&lt;/tt&gt;
:This target causes the packet's source address (and optionally port) to be rewritten for [[w:network address translation|network address translation]].  The '--to-source' flag must be supplied to indicate the source to use.  This is only valid in the POSTROUTING chain within the nat table, and like DNAT, is remembered for all other packets belonging to the same connection.

;&lt;tt&gt;MASQUERADE&lt;/tt&gt;
:This is a special, restricted form of SNAT for dynamic IP addresses, such as most [[w:Internet service provider|Internet service provider]]s provide for [[w:modem|modem]]s or [[w:DSL|DSL]].  Rather than change the SNAT rule every time the IP address changes, this calculates the source IP address to use by looking at the IP address of the outgoing interface when a packet matches this rule.  In addition, it remembers which connections used MASQUERADE, and if the interface address changes (such as reconnecting to the ISP), all connections NATted to the old address are forgotten.

===Connection tracking===
One of the important features built on top of the netfilter framework is connection tracking.  Connection tracking allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets which may make up that connection.  NAT relies on this information to translate all related packets in the same way, and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful firewall.

Connection tracking classifies each packet as being in one of four states: &lt;tt&gt;NEW&lt;/tt&gt; (trying to create a new connection), &lt;tt&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/tt&gt; (part of an already-existing connection), &lt;tt&gt;RELATED&lt;/tt&gt; (related to, but not actually part of an existing connection) or &lt;tt&gt;INVALID&lt;/tt&gt; (not part of an existing connection, and unable to create a new connection).  A normal example would be that the first packet the firewall sees will be classified &lt;tt&gt;NEW&lt;/tt&gt;, the reply would be classified &lt;tt&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/tt&gt; and an [[w:Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] error would be &lt;tt&gt;RELATED&lt;/tt&gt;.  An ICMP error packet which did not match any known connection would be &lt;tt&gt;INVALID&lt;/tt&gt;.

The connection state is completely independent of any ''TCP state''. If the host answers with a SYN ACK packet to acknowledge a new incoming TCP connection, the TCP connection itself is not yet established but the tracked connection is - this packet will match the state ESTABLISHED.

A tracked connection of a ''stateless protocol'' like UDP nevertheless has a connection state.

Furthermore, through the use of plugin modules, connection tracking can be given knowledge of application layer protocols and thus understand that two or more distinct connections are &quot;related&quot;.  For example, consider the [[w:File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] protocol.  A control connection is established, but whenever data is transferred, a separate connection is established to transfer it.  When the ip_conntrack_ftp module is loaded, the first packet of an FTP data connection will be classified &lt;tt&gt;RELATED&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;NEW&lt;/tt&gt;, as it is logically part of an existing connection.

iptables can use the connection tracking information to make packet filtering rules more powerful and easier to manage.  The &quot;conntrack&quot; match extension allows iptables rules to examine the connection tracking classification for a packet.  For example, one rule might allow &lt;tt&gt;NEW&lt;/tt&gt; packets only from inside the firewall to outside, but allow &lt;tt&gt;RELATED&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/tt&gt; in either direction.  This allows normal reply packets from the outside (&lt;tt&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/tt&gt;), but does not allow new connections to come from the outside to the inside.  However, if an FTP data connection needs to come from outside the firewall to the inside, it will be allowed, because the packet will be correctly classified as &lt;tt&gt;RELATED&lt;/tt&gt; to the FTP control connection, rather than a &lt;tt&gt;NEW&lt;/tt&gt; connection.

==iptables==
iptables is a [[w:user space|user space]] application program that allows a system administrator to configure the netfilter tables, chains, and rules (described above).  Because iptables requires elevated privileges to operate, it must be executed by user [[w:Superuser|root]], otherwise it fails to function.  On most Linux systems, iptables is installed as &lt;tt&gt;/sbin/iptables&lt;/tt&gt;.  The detailed syntax of the &lt;tt&gt;iptables&lt;/tt&gt; command is documented in its [[w:man page|man page]], which can be displayed by typing the command &quot;&lt;tt&gt;man iptables&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

===Common options===
In each of the iptables invocation forms shown below, the following common options are available:

;&lt;tt&gt;-t ''table''&lt;/tt&gt;
:Makes the command apply to the specified ''&lt;tt&gt;table&lt;/tt&gt;''.  When this option is omitted, the command applies to the ''filter'' table by default.
;&lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt;
:Produces verbose output.
;&lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt;
:Produces numeric output (i.e., port numbers instead of service names, and IP addresses instead of [[w:domain name|domain name]]s).
;&lt;tt&gt;--line-numbers&lt;/tt&gt;
:When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule, corresponding to that rule's position in its chain.

===Rule-specifications===
Most iptables command forms require you to provide a rule-specification, which is used to match a particular subset of the network packet traffic being processed by a chain.  The rule-specification also includes a target that specifies what to do with packets that are matched by the rule.  The following options are used (frequently in combination with each other) to create a rule-specification.

;&lt;tt&gt;-j ''target''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--jump ''target''&lt;/tt&gt;
:Specifies the target of a rule.  The target is either the name of a user-defined chain (created using the &lt;tt&gt;-N&lt;/tt&gt; option), one of the built-in targets, &lt;tt&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;DROP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;QUEUE&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;RETURN&lt;/tt&gt;, or an extension target, such as &lt;tt&gt;REJECT&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;LOG&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;DNAT&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;SNAT&lt;/tt&gt;.  If this option is omitted in a rule, then matching the rule will have no effect on a packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented.

;&lt;tt&gt;-i [!] ''in-interface''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--in-interface [!] ''in-interface''&lt;/tt&gt;
:Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be received (only for packets entering the INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING chains). When the '!' argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a '+', then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.

;&lt;tt&gt;-o [!] ''out-interface''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--out-interface [!] ''out-interface''&lt;/tt&gt;
:Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets entering the FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains). When the '!' argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a '+', then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.

;&lt;tt&gt;-p [!] ''protocol''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--protocol [!] ''protocol''&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches packets of the specified protocol name.  If '!' precedes the protocol name, this matches all packets that are not of the specified protocol.  Valid protocol names are &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Internet Control Message Protocol|icmp]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[w:User Datagram Protocol|udp]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Transmission Control Protocol|tcp]]&lt;/tt&gt;... A list of all the valid protocols could be found in the file /etc/protocols.

;&lt;tt&gt;-s [!] ''source''[/''prefix'']&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--source [!] ''source''[/''prefix'']&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches IP packets coming from the specified source address.  The source address can be an IP address, an IP address with associated [[w:network prefix]], or a hostname.  If '!' precedes the source, this matches all packets that are not coming from the specified source.

;&lt;tt&gt;-d [!] ''destination''[/''prefix'']&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--destination [!] ''destination''[/''prefix'']&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches IP packets going to the specified destination address.  The destination address can be an IP address, an IP address with associated [[w:network prefix]], or a hostname.  If '!' precedes the destination, this matches all packets that are not going to the specified destination.

;&lt;tt&gt;--destination-port [!] [''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;[:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--dport [!] [''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;[:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches TCP or UDP packets (depending on the argument to the &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; option) destined for the specified port or the range of ports (when the &lt;tt&gt;''port'':''port''&lt;/tt&gt; form is used).  If '!' precedes the port specification, this matches all TCP or UDP packets not destined for the specified port or port range.

;&lt;tt&gt;--source-port [!] [''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;[:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--sport [!] [''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;[:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''port''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches TCP or UDP packets (depending on the argument to the &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; option) coming from the specified port or the range of ports (when the &lt;tt&gt;''port'':''port''&lt;/tt&gt; form is used).  If '!' precedes the port specification, this matches all TCP or UDP packets not coming from the specified port or port range.

;&lt;tt&gt;--tcp-flags [!] ''mask comp''&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches TCP packets having certain TCP protocol flags set or unset.  The first argument specified the flags to be examined in each TCP packet, written as a comma-separated list (no spaces allowed).  The second argument is a comma-separated list of flags which must be set within those that are examined.  The flags are: SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, URG, PSH, ALL, and NONE.  Hence, the option &quot;&lt;tt&gt;--tcp-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST SYN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; will only match packets with the SYN flag set and the ACK, FIN and RST flags unset.

;&lt;tt&gt;[!] --syn&lt;/tt&gt;
:Matches TCP packets having the SYN flag set and the ACK,RST and FIN flags unset.  Such packets are used to initiate TCP connections.  Blocking such packets on the INPUT chain will prevent incoming TCP connections, but outgoing TCP connections will be unaffected.  This option can be combined with others, such as &lt;tt&gt;--source&lt;/tt&gt; to block or allow inbound TCP connections only from certain hosts or networks.  This option is equivalent to &quot;&lt;tt&gt;--tcp-flags  SYN,RST,ACK SYN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  If the '!' flag precedes the &lt;tt&gt;--syn&lt;/tt&gt;, the sense of the option is inverted.

:''This section is under construction.''

===Invocation===
 iptables { -A | --append | -D | --delete } ''chain rule-specification'' [ ''options'' ]

This form of the command adds (&lt;tt&gt;-A&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--append&lt;/tt&gt;) or deletes (&lt;tt&gt;-D&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--delete&lt;/tt&gt;) a rule from the specified chain.  For example to add a rule to the INPUT chain in the ''filter'' table (the default table when option &lt;tt&gt;-t&lt;/tt&gt; is not specified) to drop all [[w:User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] packets, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -A INPUT -p udp -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;

To delete the rule added by the above command, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -D INPUT -p udp -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;

The above command actually deletes the first rule on the INPUT chain that matches the rule-specification &quot;&lt;tt&gt;-p udp -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  If there are multiple identical rules on the chain, only the first matching rule is deleted.

 iptables { -R | --replace | -I | --insert } ''chain rulenum rule-specification'' [ ''options'' ]

This form of the command replaces (&lt;tt&gt;-R&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--replace&lt;/tt&gt;) an existing rule or inserts (&lt;tt&gt;-I&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--insert&lt;/tt&gt;) a new rule in the specified chain.  For instance, to replace the fourth rule in the INPUT chain with a rule that drops all [[w:Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] packets, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -R INPUT 4 -p icmp -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;

To insert a new rule in the second slot in the OUTPUT chain that drops all TCP traffic going to port 80 on any host, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;

 iptables { -D | --delete } ''chain rulenum'' [ ''options'' ]

This form of the command deletes a rule at the specified numeric index in the specified chain.  Rules are numbers starting with 1.  For example, to delete the third rule from the FORWARD chain, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -D FORWARD 3&lt;/tt&gt;

 iptables { -L | --list | -F | --flush | -Z | --zero } [ ''chain'' ] [ ''options'' ]

This form of the command is used to list the rules in a chain (&lt;tt&gt;-L&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--list&lt;/tt&gt;), flush (i.e., delete) all rules from a chain (&lt;tt&gt;-F&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--flush&lt;/tt&gt;), or zero the byte and packet counters for a chain (&lt;tt&gt;-Z&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--zero&lt;/tt&gt;).  If no chain is specified, the operation is performed on all chains.  For example, to list the rules in the OUTPUT chain, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -L OUTPUT&lt;/tt&gt;

To flush all chains, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -F&lt;/tt&gt;

To zero the byte and packet counters for the PREROUTING chain in the ''nat'' table, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -t nat -Z PREROUTING&lt;/tt&gt;

 iptables { -N | --new-chain } ''chain''
 iptables { -X | --delete-chain } [ ''chain'' ]

This form of the command is used to create (&lt;tt&gt;-N&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--new-chain&lt;/tt&gt;) a new user-defined chain or to delete (&lt;tt&gt;-X&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--delete-chain&lt;/tt&gt;) an existing user-defined chain.  If no chain is specified with the &lt;tt&gt;-X&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--delete-chain&lt;/tt&gt; options, all user-defined chains are deleted.  It is not possible to delete built-in chains, such as the INPUT or OUTPUT chains in the ''filter'' table.

 iptables { -P | --policy } ''chain target''

This form of the command is used to set the policy target for a chain.  For instance, to set the policy target for the INPUT chain to DROP, use this command:

:&lt;tt&gt;iptables -P INPUT DROP&lt;/tt&gt;

 iptables { -E | --rename-chain } ''old-chain-name new-chain-name''

This form of the command is used to rename a user-defined chain.

== ipset ==
ipset is used to set up, maintain and inspect so called &quot;IP sets&quot; in the Linux kernel.  In IP set usually contains a set of IP addresses, but can also contain sets of other network numbers, depending on its &quot;type&quot;.

Any entry in one set can be bound to another set, allowing for sophisticated matching operations.

A set can only be removed (destroyed) if there are no iptables rules or other sets referring to it.

===Commands===

These options specify the specific action to perform. Only one of them can be specified on the command line unless otherwise specified below. For all the long versions of the command and option names, you need to use only enough letters to ensure that ipset can differentiate it from all other options. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-N ''setname type type-specific-options''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--create ''setname type type-specific-options''&lt;/tt&gt;
Create a set identified with setname and specified type. Type-specific options must be supplied. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-X [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--destroy [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
Destroy the specified set, or all sets if none or the keyword &quot;:all:&quot; is specified. Before destroying the set, all bindings belonging to the set elements and the default binding of the set are removed. If the set is still referenced, nothing is done. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-F [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--flush [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
Delete all entries from the specified set, or flush all sets if none or the keyword &quot;:all:&quot; is given. Bindings are not affected by the flush operation. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-E ''from-setname to-setname''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--rename ''from-setname to-setname''&lt;/tt&gt;
Rename a set. Set identified by to-setname must not exist. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-W ''from-setname to-setname''&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--swap ''from-setname to-setname''&lt;/tt&gt;
Swap two sets as they referenced in the Linux kernel. iptables rules or ipset bindings pointing to the content of from-setname will point to the content of to-setname and vice versa. Both sets must exist. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-L [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--list [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
List the entries and bindings for the specified set, or for all sets if none or the keyword &quot;:all:&quot; is given. The -n, --numeric option can be used to suppress name lookups and generate numeric output. When the -s, --sorted option is given, the entries are listed sorted (if the given set type supports the operation). 

;&lt;tt&gt;-S [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--save [''setname'']&lt;/tt&gt;
Save the given set, or all sets if none or the keyword :all: is specified to stdout in a format that --restore can read. 

;&lt;tt&gt;-R&lt;/tt&gt;
;&lt;tt&gt;--restore&lt;/tt&gt;
Restore a saved session generated by --save. The saved session can be fed from stdin. 

When generating a session file please note that the supported commands (create set, add element, bind) must appear in a strict order: first create the set, then add all elements. Then create the next set, add all its elements and so on. Finally you can list all binding commands. Also, it is a restore operation, so the sets being restored must not exist. 

'''-A, --add setname IP''' 
Add an IP to a set. 

'''-D, --del setname IP''' 
Delete an IP from a set. 

'''-T, --test setname IP'''
Test whether an IP is in a set or not. Exit status number is zero if the tested IP is in the set and nonzero if it is missing from the set. 

'''-T, --test setname IP --binding to-setname''' 
Test whether the IP belonging to the set points to the specified binding. Exit status number is zero if the binding points to the specified set, otherwise it is nonzero. The keyword :default: can be used to test the default binding of the set. 

'''-B, --bind setname IP --binding to-setname''' 
Bind the IP in setname to-setname. 

'''-U, --unbind setname IP''' 
Delete the binding belonging to IP in set setname. 

'''-H, --help [settype]''' 
Print help and settype specific help if settype specified. 
At the -B, -U and -T commands you can use the token :default: to bind, unbind or test the default binding of a set instead of an IP. At the -U command you can use the token :all: to destroy the bindings of all elements of a set.   

'''OTHER OPTIONS'''

The following additional options can be specified: 

'''-b, --binding setname''' 
The option specifies the value of the binding for the -B binding command, for which it is a mandatory option. You can use it in the -T test command as well to test bindings. 

'''-s, --sorted''' 
Sorted output. When listing sets, entries are listed sorted. 

'''-n, --numeric''' 
Numeric output. When listing sets, bindings, IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format. By default the program will try to display them as host names, network names or services (whenever applicable), which can trigger slow DNS lookups. 

'''-q, --quiet''' 
Suppress any output to stdout and stderr. ipset will still return possible errors. 
  
'''SET TYPES'''
ipset supports the following set types:   

'''ipmap'''

The ipmap set type uses a memory range, where each bit represents one IP address. An ipmap set can store up to 65536 (B-class network) IP addresses. The ipmap set type is very fast and memory cheap, great for use when one want to match certain IPs in a range. Using the --netmask option with a [[w:Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing|CIDR]] netmask value between 0-32 when creating an ipmap set, you will be able to store and match network addresses: i.e. an IP address will be in the set if the value resulted by masking the address with the specified netmask can be found in the set. 

Options to use when creating an ipmap set: 

--from from-IP 
--to-IP 
Create an ipmap set from the specified range. 
--network IP/mask 
Create an ipmap set from the specified network. 
--netmask CIDR-netmask 
When the optional --netmask parameter specified, network addresses will be stored in the set instead of IP addresses, and the from-IP parameter must be a network address. 

'''macipmap'''

The macipmap set type uses a memory range, where each 8 bytes represents one IP and a MAC addresses. A macipmap set type can store up to 65536 (B-class network) IP addresses with MAC. When adding an entry to a macipmap set, you must specify the entry as IP%MAC. When deleting or testing macipmap entries, the %MAC part is not mandatory. 

Options to use when creating an macipmap set: 

--from from-IP 
--to-IP 
Create a macipmap set from the specified range. 
--network IP/mask 
Create a macipmap set from the specified network. 
--matchunset 
When the optional --matchunset parameter specified, IP addresses which could be stored in the set but not set yet, will always match. 
Please note, the set and SET netfilter kernel modules always use the source MAC address from the packet to match, add or delete entries from a macipmap type of set.   

'''portmap'''

The portmap set type uses a memory range, where each bit represents one port. A portmap set type can store up to 65536 ports. The portmap set type is very fast and memory cheap. 

Options to use when creating an portmap set: 

--from from-port 
--to-port 
Create a portmap set from the specified range. 
  
'''iphash'''

The iphash set type uses a hash to store IP addresses. In order to avoid clashes in the hash double-hashing, and as a last resort, dynamic growing of the hash performed. The iphash set type is great to store random addresses. By supplyig the --netmask option with a CIDR netmask value between 0-32 at creating the set, you will be able to store and match network addresses instead: i.e. an IP address will be in the set if the value of the address masked with the specified netmask can be found in the set. 

Options to use when creating an iphash set: 

--hashsize hashsize 
The initial hash size (default 1024) 
--probes probes 
How many times try to resolve clashing at adding an IP to the hash by double-hashing (default 8). 
--resize percent 
Increase the hash size by this many percent (default 50) when adding an IP to the hash could not be performed after probes number of double-hashing. 
--netmask CIDR-netmask 
When the optional --netmask parameter specified, network addresses will be stored in the set instead of IP addresses. 
Sets created by zero valued resize parameter won't be resized at all. The lookup time in an iphash type of set approximately linearly grows with the value of the probes parameter. At the same time higher probes values result a better utilized hash while smaller values produce a larger, sparse hash.   

'''nethash'''

The nethash set type uses a hash to store different size of network addresses. The IP &quot;address&quot; used in the ipset commands must be in the form IP-address/cidr-size where the CIDR block size must be in the inclusive range of 1-31. In order to avoid clashes in the hash double-hashing, and as a last resort, dynamic growing of the hash performed. 

Options to use when creating an nethash set: 

--hashsize hashsize 
The initial hash size (default 1024) 
--probes probes 
How many times try to resolve clashing at adding an IP to the hash by double-hashing (default 4). 
--resize percent 
Increase the hash size by this many percent (default 50) when adding an IP to the hash could not be performed after 
An IP address will be in a nethash type of set if it is in any of the netblocks added to the set and the matching always start from the smallest size of netblock (most specific netmask) to the biggest ones (least specific netmasks). When adding/deleting IP addresses to a nethash set by the SET netfilter kernel module, it will be added/deleted by the smallest netblock size which can be found in the set. 

The lookup time in a nethash type of set is approximately linearly grows with the times of the probes parameter and the number of different mask parameters in the hash. Otherwise the same speed and memory efficiency comments applies here as at the iphash type.   

'''ipporthash'''

The ipporthash set type uses a hash to store IP address and port pairs. In order to avoid clashes in the hash double-hashing, and as a last resort, dynamic growing of the hash performed. An ipporthash set can store up to 65536 (B-class network) IP addresses with all possible port values. When adding, deleting and testing values in an ipporthash type of set, the entries must be specified as &quot;IP%port&quot;. 

The ipporthash types of sets evaluates two src/dst parameters of the set match and SET target. 

Options to use when creating an ipporthash set: 

--from from-IP 
--to-IP 
Create an ipporthash set from the specified range. 
--network IP/mask 
Create an ipporthash set from the specified network. 
--hashsize hashsize 
The initial hash size (default 1024) 
--probes probes 
How many times try to resolve clashing at adding an IP to the hash by double-hashing (default 8). 
--resize percent 
Increase the hash size by this many percent (default 50) when adding an IP to the hash could not be performed after probes number of double-hashing. 
The same resizing, speed and memory efficiency comments applies here as at the iphash type.   

'''iptree'''

The iptree set type uses a tree to store IP addresses, optionally with timeout values. Options to use when creating an iptree set: 
--timeout value 
The timeout value for the entries in seconds (default 0) 
When adding an IP address to a set, one may add it with a specific timeout value using the syntax IP%timeout-value.

'''''Halyomorpha halys''''', the '''brown marmorated stink bug''', is an agricultural pest that can cause widespread damage to fruit and vegetable crops. In Japan it is a pest to soybean and fruit crops. In the U.S., the brown marmorated stink bug feeds on a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and other host plants beginning in late May/early June including peaches, apples, green beans, soybeans, cherry, raspberries, and pears. It is a sucking insect that uses its stylet to pierce the host plant in order to feed. This feeding results, in part, in the formation of small, necrotic areas on the outer surface of fruits but ranges from leaf stippling, cat-facing on tree fruits, seed loss, and transmission of plant pathogens.

The bug is native to China and Japan, and is believed to have &quot;hitched a ride&quot; to North America as a stowaway in packing crates from China or Japan. The first documented specimen was collected in Allentown, Pennsylvania, during the fall of 1996. In 1999, the brown marmorated stink bug was first recovered in New Jersey from a black light trap run by the Rutgers Cooperative Extension (RCE) Vegetable IPM program in Milford, New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rce.rutgers.edu/stinkbug/ |title=Monitoring for the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug |publisher=[[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2002, it was again collected from black light traps located in Phillipsburg and Little York and found on plant material in Stewartsville. It is now documented and established in many counties in the tri-state area (New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York) on the eastern coast of the United States. This agricultural pest has already reached large parts of Western Maryland and West Virginia, and studies continue to establish just how extensive the infestation may go.

==Description==
It looks similar in appearance to other native species of shield bugs including ''[[../Acrosternum/]]'', ''[[../Euschistus/]]'', and ''[[../Podisus/]]'', except that several of the abdominal segments protrude from beneath the wings and are alternatively banded with black and white (visible along the edge of the bug even when wings are folded) and a white stripe or band on the next to last (4th) antennal segment. The adults are approximately ⅝ in long and he underside is white or pale tan, sometimes with grey or black markings. The legs are brown with faint white banding.

==Symptoms and Signs==
The most economically important damage is necrotic areas on the outer surface of fruits but also ranges from leaf stippling, cat-facing on tree fruits, seed loss, and possibly the transmission of plant pathogens

==Ecology==
The brown marmorated stink bug survives the winter as adults by entering houses and structures when fall evenings start to turn cold. Adults can live for several years and look for buildings to overwinter in that shield them from the elements. They will work their way under siding, into soffits, around window and door frames, under roof shingles and into any crawl space or attic vent which has openings big enough to fit through. Once inside the home they will go into a state of hibernation where they wait for winter to pass, but often the warmth inside the home causes them to become active, especially in winter months, and they will fly clumsily around light fixtures. They leave a powerful scent behind on everything they land on, including the buildings where they hibernate, and this odor is one of the reasons they will return year after year; it is a beacon to other stinkbugs that this location is a good hibernation nest.

The stinkbug's ability to emit a vile odor through holes in its abdomen is a defense mechanism meant to prevent it from being eaten by birds and lizards. However, simply jostling the bug, cornering it, scaring or injuring it, or attempting to remove one from one's home can &quot;set it off,&quot; and the odor is extremely powerful, unpleasant, and long-lasting. It can make a whole room uninhabitable until aired out, and some people are even allergic to the smell. Squashing it is a surefire way of expelling its noxious odor, and most times the best way of extracting one from the inside of a home is to allow it to walk onto something like a newspaper and then simply taking it outside. The stink glands are located on the underside of the thorax, between the first and second pair of legs.

==Host plants==
*''[[../Acer/]]'' (Maple)
*''[[../Abelia/]]'' 
*''[[../Arctium/]]'' (burdock)
*''[[../Buddleia/]]''
*''[[../Catalpa/]]''

*''[[../Pyrus/]]'' (pear)
*''[[../Rosa/]]''
*''[[../Rubus/]]'' (raspberry)
*''[[../Vitis/]]'' (grape)

==Control==   
Control methods have yet to be established for agricultural situations.

== *storna in Russian ==
Russian word for *storna is ‘''сторона''’. Although ‘''страна''’ also exists, it is only a loanword borrowed from Old Church Slavonic. ‘''Сторона''’ means ''a side'', while ‘''страна'''’ means ''a country''.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Limited Types ==

When a type is declared {{Ada/kw|limited}} this means that objects of
the type cannot be assigned values of the same type.
An Object &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; of limited type &lt;tt&gt;LT&lt;/tt&gt; cannot be copied into an object
&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; of same type &lt;tt&gt;LT&lt;/tt&gt;.

Additionally, there is no predefined equality operation
for objects of a limited type.

The desired effects of declaring a type limited
include prevention of shallow copying. Also, the (unique)
identity of an object is retained:
once declared, a name of a variable of type &lt;tt&gt;LT&lt;/tt&gt; will
continue to refer to the same object.

The following example will use a rather simplifying type &lt;tt&gt;Boat&lt;/tt&gt;.

      {{Ada/keyword|type}} Boat {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|limited}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
      {{Ada/keyword|function}} Choose
        {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Load  {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         Speed {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|)}}
         {{Ada/keyword|return}}  Boat{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
      {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Set_Sail {{Ada/delimiter|(}}The_Boat {{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} {{Ada/keyword|out}} Boat{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

When we declare a variable to be of type &lt;tt&gt;Boat&lt;/tt&gt;, its name will denote
one boat from then on. Boats will not be copied into one another.

The full view of a boat might be implemented as a record such as

      {{Ada/keyword|type}} Boat {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|limited}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}
         Max_Sail_Area {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         Max_Freight   {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         Sail_Area     {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         Freight       {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The &lt;tt&gt;Choose&lt;/tt&gt; function returns a &lt;tt&gt;Boat&lt;/tt&gt; object depending on the parameters
&lt;tt&gt;Load&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Speed&lt;/tt&gt;.
If we now declare a variable of type Boat we will be better off Choosing an initial Boat 
(or else we might be dropping into uninitialized waters!). But when we
do so, the initialization looks suspiciously like assignment which is not available with limited types:

   {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Travel {{Ada/delimiter|(}}People {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Positive{{Ada/delimiter|;}} Average_Speed {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
      Henrietta {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Boat {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}}   {{Ada/--|assignment?}}
         Choose
           {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Load  {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} People {{Ada/operator|*}} Average_Weight {{Ada/operator|*}} 1{{Ada/delimiter|.}}5{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
            Speed {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} Average_Speed {{Ada/operator|*}} 1{{Ada/delimiter|.}}5{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
   {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
      Set_Sail {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Henrietta{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|end}} Travel{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Fortunately, current Ada distinguishes initialization from copying. Objects of a limited
type may be initialized by an initialization expression on the right of the delimiter
{{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}}.

(Just to prevent confusion: The Ada Reference Manual discriminates between ''assignment'' and ''assignment statement'', where assignment is part of the assignment statement. An initialisation is of course an assignment which, for limited types, is done ''in place''. An assignment statement involves copying, which is forbidden for limited types.)

Related to this feature are [http://www.adacore.com/2007/05/14/gem-1/ aggregates of limited types] and
“constructor functions” for limited types.
Internally, the implementation of the &lt;tt&gt;Choose&lt;/tt&gt; function will return
a limited record. However, since the return type &lt;tt&gt;Boat&lt;/tt&gt; is limited,
there must be no copying anywhere. Will this work?
A first attempt might be to declare a &lt;tt&gt;result&lt;/tt&gt; variable local
to &lt;tt&gt;Choose&lt;/tt&gt;, manipulate &lt;tt&gt;result&lt;/tt&gt;, and return it.
The &lt;tt&gt;result&lt;/tt&gt; object needs to be “transported” into the calling environment.
But &lt;tt&gt;result&lt;/tt&gt; is a variable local to &lt;tt&gt;Choose&lt;/tt&gt;.
When &lt;tt&gt;Choose&lt;/tt&gt; returns, &lt;tt&gt;result&lt;/tt&gt; will no longer be in scope.
Therefore it looks like &lt;tt&gt;result&lt;/tt&gt; must be copied but this is not permitted
for limited types. There are two solutions provided by the language:
extended return statements (see {{Ada/2005/RM|6|5|title=Return Statements}})
and aggregates of limited types. The following body of &lt;tt&gt;Choose&lt;/tt&gt;
returns an aggregate of limited type &lt;tt&gt;Boat&lt;/tt&gt;, after finding the
initial values for its components.

      {{Ada/keyword|function}} Choose
        {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Load  {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         Speed {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Sailors_Units{{Ada/delimiter|)}}
         {{Ada/keyword|return}}  Boat
      {{Ada/keyword|is}}
         Capacity {{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|constant}} Sailors_Units {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Capacity_Needed {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Load{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
         {{Ada/keyword|return}} Boat{{Ada/delimiter|'}}
           {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Max_Freight   {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} Capacity{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
            Max_Sail_Area {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} Sail_Needed {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Capacity{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
            Freight       {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} Load{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
            Sail_Area     {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      {{Ada/keyword|end}} Choose{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The object that is returned is at the same time the object that is to have
the returned value. The function therefore initializes &lt;tt&gt;Henrietta&lt;/tt&gt;
''in place''.

In parallel to the predefined type  {{Ada/package|Ada|Finalization}}&lt;tt&gt;.Controlled&lt;/tt&gt;,
Ada provides the type &lt;tt&gt;Limited_Controlled&lt;/tt&gt; in the same package. 
It is a limited version of the former.

== Initialising Limited Types ==

A few methods to initialise such types are presented.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Limited_Private_Samples {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Uninitialised  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Preinitialised {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};

   {{Ada/kw|type}} Dynamic_Initialisation {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
     Hook: Void := Constructor (Dynamic_Initialisation'{{Ada/kw|Access}});
     Bla : Integer;  {{Ada/comment|any needed components}}
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Needs_Constructor {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
     I: Integer;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Limited_Private_Samples;

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Limited_Private_Samples {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Constructor (Object: {{Ada/kw|access}} Dynamic_Initialisation) {{Ada/kw|return}} Void {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Object.Bla := 5;  {{Ada/comment|may be any value only known at run time}}
     {{Ada/kw|return}} ({{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}});
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Constructor;
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Constructor (X: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Dynamic_Initialisation {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     {{Ada/kw|return}} (Hook =&gt; ({{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}}),
             Bla  =&gt; 42);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Constructor;
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Constructor (X: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Needs_Constructor {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     {{Ada/kw|return}} (I =&gt; 42);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Constructor;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Limited_Private_Samples;

  {{Ada/keyword|with}} Limited_Private_Samples{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
  {{Ada/keyword|use}}  Limited_Private_Samples{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
  
  {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Try {{Ada/keyword|is}}
  
    U{{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Uninitialised{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}   {{Ada/--|very bad}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Preinitialised{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}  {{Ada/--|has initial value (good)}}
   
    D1{{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Dynamic_Initialisation{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}  {{Ada/--|has initial value (good)}}
    D2{{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Dynamic_Initialisation {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Constructor {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}0{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}  {{Ada/--|Ada 2005 initialisation}}
    D3{{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Dynamic_Initialisation {{Ada/keyword|renames}} Constructor {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}0{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}  {{Ada/--|already Ada 95}}
  
    {{Ada/--|I: Needs_Constructor;  -- Illegal without initialisation}}
    N{{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Needs_Constructor {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Constructor {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}0{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}  {{Ada/--|Ada 2005 initialisation}}
  
  {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
  
    {{Ada/keyword|null}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
  
  {{Ada/keyword|end}} Try{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
 
Note that D3 is a constant, whereas all others are variables.

Also note that the initial value that is defined for the component of Preinitialised is evaluated at the time of object creation, i.e. if an expression is used instead of the literal, the value can be run-time dependent.

 X, Y: Preinitialised;

In this declaration of two objects, the initial expression will be evaluated twice and can deliver different values, because it is equivalent to the sequence&lt;ref&gt;
{{Ada/2005/Cite RM|3|3|1
|      title = Object Declarations
|        par = 7
|         id = 
|      quote = Any declaration [...] with more than one &lt;tt&gt;defining_identifier&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to a series of declarations each containing one &lt;tt&gt;defining_identifier&lt;/tt&gt; from the list, [...] in the same order as the list.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;:

 X: Preinitialised;
 Y: Preinitialised;

So X is initialised before Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''GVC Frameworks''' evolved from projects implemented by GVC [http://www.global-village.net[Global Village Consulting]] for over 10 years. One of the most recent projects that use these frameworks is [http://www.gvcsitemaker.com[GVC.SiteMaker]], an Open Source CMS that allows non-technical users to create highly customized websites and web databases.

The following are some of the main frameworks included in this release:

• '''GVCEOFExtensions''' – Provides loads of Enterprise Objects Frameworks (EOF) additions and custom qualifiers.

• '''GVCEOFValidation''' – Provides enhancements to standard EOF validation, including code-free, customizable, localizable validation messages and more extensive validation.

• '''GVCFoundation''' – Contains Foundation extensions such as Boolean, Date, BigDecimal, String, NSArray.

• '''GVCEOPrototypes''' – Contains standard set of Enterprise Objects (EO) prototypes that can be used for multiple frameworks and WebObjects applications. It currently supports prototypes for DB2, FrontBase, JDBC, MySQL and Oracle databases.

• '''GVCGenericObjects''' – Contains classes designed for easy lookup, localization and archival of objects.

• '''GVCSecurity''' – Contains classes that provide security or different access rights for users or groups in a WebObject’s application.

• '''GVCVirtualTables''' – Contains classes that provide a virtual representation of database tables which can be accessed via Key Value Coding (KVC).

• '''GVCKerberos''' – Contains a simple wrapper class around some of the functionality in the WedgeTail JSCI Kerberos classes. It implements a very simple Kerberos authentication of a user ID and password.

• '''GVCMail''' – Contains convenience classes for sending email messages and support for fault tolerant sending of bulk messages.

• '''GVCWOExtensions''' – Contains extensions to WOApplication, WOComponent, WODirectAction, WOSession and other AppServer classes. 

• '''GVCJNDIAdditions''' – Extends the JNDI adaptor to support secure communication with an LDAP server. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides a mechanism for ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the transferred data.

The GVC Frameworks were developed in parallel with Project Wonder so you will find a lot of duplication in the extensions to Foundation, EOF, and WO areas.  But there is a lot of unique stuff too and alternative implementations of things like localization.  Eventually this might all get merged into Wonder, but that is a lot of effort and we are busy now.

I recommend making this into PDF format, but I don't know how. [[User:Icelandic Hurricane|Icelandic Hurricane]] 21:30, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

This language course is maybe the most professional and well-planned language course on all of Wikibooks! I have tried in vain to get people to develop goals and a curriculum before writing something in a lesson. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 15:51, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

The syntax of this language seems to be based on that of Japanese. Just thought I should add that, as I speak Japanese. From what I understand, this language is not even real, but I do admit that the course is well planned. The editors have done splendidly here. [[Special:Contributions/74.133.179.182|74.133.179.182]] ([[User talk:74.133.179.182|talk]]) 03:37, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
: What do you mean with &quot;not real&quot;? Miskito is an indigenous language of Nicaragua and Honduras, and it is the second most spoken language in Nicaragua (next to Spanish). [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 09:34, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
::Hi there. Yes, it is a real language indeed. 
::It has been quite heavily relexicalized from English but that does not make it any less real. As it happens, English was heavily relexicalized from French, and as the Japanese-speaking anonymous contributor must surely know, for that matter Japanese was very heavily relexicalized from Chinese. If that is what she or he is bothered by, then we can say Miskito is at least as real as English and Japanese. Lol.
::I should also correct anonymous' other assertion. Miskito syntax is not &quot;based on&quot; Japanese (of course). There is some degree of ''typological'' affinity, but the affinity is not all that great either considering some notable differences. If your native language is not a verb final language, and you learn one (like Japanese), and then you encounter another verb final language, you will notice the resemblance, because of where you are looking from. This is a bit like a person of white race thinking that all Africans look the same. It is only true from where you are looking! :) --[[User:A R King|A R King]] ([[User talk:A R King|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/A R King|contribs]]) 11:03, 27 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is this book about? ==
The work on Marc Segar's survival guide stopped early in Marc Segar's life. Marc Segar's survival guide does not say anything about managing a job, getting married, or raising kids. The aim of this book is to collaboratively write an updated survival guide for autistic people. Right here on this page. Feel free to start right here by clicking on &quot;edit this page&quot; and start writing!

Marc Segar's list of &quot;typical&quot; behaviours of people is interesting[1]. It does not mean that these behaviours are desirable, nor does it necessarily mean that they are helpful for atypical people, other than for understanding how they are different from a majority of people. What I find much more helpful is what typical and atypical people have in common, because that is going to be the basis of mutual understanding, when it happens.

First of all, only few people are good in all these things Marc Segar lists. To use the list to value oneself against what is normal may be harmful rather than useful. If the [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/hypothesis.en.html Monotropism hypothesis] is right to some degree, the difficulties for autistic people are multitasking - to think of all these rules all the time is extremely stressing for single-minded people. Lots of typical people feel the same, even if their capacity to multi-task may be better than those labelled as autistic. Besides, if you are a male and try to assimilate with normals in order to get a girlfriend, there might be a risk of becoming a nice guy syndrome.

The key for understanding other people and being understood is to understand that what people feel often matters much more than how they look, dress or behave. People's empathy labels them attracted to what feels good, and pushed away from what feels bad. That means people like you more if you feel good, and like you less when you feel bad. Thus working towards yourself feeling good rather than pleasing other people's norms is the key for social interaction. If you work on feeling good for yourself, other people might pick up on it. On the other hand, if you feel insecure trying to pretend to be someone else, people feel that as well and might turn away after some time.

These talks by Dinah Murray might also be helpful: [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/tampere2005/tampere2005.html Finding and maintaining a niche] and [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/autscape2005/autscape2005.html Creating social space for autism], and here is a [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/links.en.html list of links] from the [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/ Autism and Computing] website.

It is worth noting that the question &quot;what is normal anyway&quot; keeps re-occurring when talking about psychology in general, and that question may possibly be answered in the works of five- time New York teacher of the year [http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/ John Taylor Gatto] and author [http://www.thomhartmann.com/german-school.shtml Thom Hartmann].  The central premise behind these works is the fact that the compulsory school system is designed to &quot;socialise&quot; children into the work force by making them docile, predictable, willing to take the word of leaders as truth, and dependent upon others for a sense of self worth.  This goes a long way towards explaining neurotypical behaviour, and why neurodivergents don't fit in:  Neurodivergents simply fail to be socialised this way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
The following is an attempt to continue Marc Segar's book  [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/marc2.en.html ''A survival guide for people with Asperger Syndrome''].  It is done in the same style as this book because the rationale behind that style appears to be sound.  The sections are designed to be small and specific enough to allow people with possibly conflicting perspectives to collaborate in its development by adding new sections, while preserving the &quot;structural integrity&quot; of the thoughts contained within each section.

It is becoming increasingly obvious that every autie has a different life experience that every other autie can learn from, and everyone is therefore encouraged to contribute to this work by adding new sections in a brainstorming fashion, though it is worth bearing in mind that the rules in Marc's book are clear, unambiguous, constructive, and typically promote Positive Mental Attitude (PMA).  Those rules, however, aren't always explained, which may be a problem in this work since other collaborators typically need to understand the reasoning before being able to build upon the ideas.

This book will probably not make much sense if you haven't read Marc's guide and see the value in it. Be aware that Marc seems to have spent much of his life working not only on this problem, but on how to express the things he has learned properly. His work is quite difficult to live up to.

It should be noted that this book is NOT intended to be an instruction manual to teach autistic spectrum people how to become non-autistic.  It is designed to be used in many different ways, particularly in ways not yet envisaged, in the same way that a map shows how to get from any of many different locations to any of many other locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A note to professionals ==
In the 60 years since autism was first &quot;discovered&quot;, remarkably little has been established about it, and virtually all of the &quot;discoveries&quot; ultimately come from autistic spectrum people themselves.

The fact that social skills training is now being used as a treatment is due in no small part to the line at the end of Marc Segar's survival guide, which this book is based on, and which reads &quot;autistic people have to understand scientifically what non-autistic people already understand instinctively&quot;.

I fear that this line may have been misinterpreted, or not articulated properly.  The idea of social skills training is based on the interpretation &quot;autistic people have to understand scientifically what non-autistic people LEARN instinctively&quot;, and it entirely misses the interpretation that autistic spectrum people may need to understand scientifically how non-autistic people instinctively learn.

I'm not sure whether Marc Segar understood this before he died, but I am absolutely sure that he was very close to it, since he left clues in his guide referring to &quot;solving the puzzle&quot; and how non-autistic people think.

Perhaps a good example of the impact autistic spectrum people have had on this world is the fact that &quot;the autism problem&quot; is so intractable.  Autistic spectrum people are the most likely people to &quot;solve&quot; it and from this perspective, it is impossible to do so without knowing what the non-autistic world is.  It strikes me that perhaps the wrong question is being asked.  What we should be studying is what non-autistic people have that autistic spectrum people do not.  Knowing this appears to be part of any practical &quot;solution&quot; anyway.

To this date, Marc Segar's guide is the only thing I have found on the internet that actually talks about how non-autistic people think in any constructive way.  The majority of the self help material available today is locked away under copyright with steep license purchasing fees to access, and I find it deeply offensive that Marc Segar's work probably contributed to the development of it all.  Even more so that this document might be used that way.

This book is licensed under the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]] and [[WB:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] license and as such, people are free to do what they want with it, however if, as a professional, you find yourself using the material here, I ask that you not only make links to or copies of this document available to your clients, but links to or copies of Marc Segar's survival guide as well.

I sincerely doubt that should I purchase any of the self help material, any of it will be as useful to me as Marc Segar's guide.  There is clearly far more information contained in it than it may at first seem, and this is in part what this book is about.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Ways to maintain self esteem =
* See also the &quot;worrying&quot; section in Marc Segar's Survival Guide.  In particular, learning to laugh at yourself, and to recognise your mistake, apologise and just move on can save many a bad situation.
* The single best way to reinforce self esteem is to know where to go to be safe from making mistakes that have ongoing consequences, and to know that you can get there.  These can be places, behaviours, or frames of mind.
* Having a reliable visualised understanding of the environment you are in that you can fall back on in times of distress can help a great deal to pacify overwhelming negative thoughts, and help you plan ways out of bad situations.
* If your failures keep haunting you, knowing that you have learned as much as you can from them can help that stop.
* Non-autistic people learn from experience this way anyway, so worrying excessively about possible future failure is probably overkill.
* Faking self esteem can have its merits:
** It means that you will be less of a target for social predators.
** Being less of a target means your self esteem has more time to rebuild naturally.
** A person who is supremely confident has no need to prove oneself and therefore has no need for ego.  This is directly at odds with the idea that ego helps a great deal in the competition phase mentioned in the section &quot;the art of self confidence&quot;.
** A person who is supremely confident settles conflicts so that every party wins as much as possible and therefore has no need for aggression.
** A person who is supremely confident has little to be scared of and therefore displays their more positive emotions rather than their negative ones.
* There are also some thoughts about emotions in relation to maintaining one's self esteem. 
** It is necessary to let some negative emotions &quot;radiate&quot;.  If you don't permit yourself to do this sometimes, things can reach a boiling point and explode inappropriately.
** Although autistic people seem to be incapable of reading the emotions of others, the emotions they express are VERY readable by others.  The confusion others have in reading those emotions are in the fact that the emotions often don't make sense.
** Fear and anger are emotions that are communicated across species, and between autistic and non autistic people.  They are &quot;reliable emotions&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Related closely to the study of genetics, evolution observe the changes in heredity and genes of an organism from one generation to the next. This can be best exemplified in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms leading to more complex living beings such as animals and humans. 

Evolution occur with the slight changes in the genes called mutations. Organisms have the innate ability to survive. Therefore, mutation occurs in order to satisfy natural selection where only favorable traits that will be beneficial for survival can be passed down to future generations.
Another mechanism for evolution is called the genetic drift. This process occur independently which produces random changes in the traits of a population. This is the mechanism that is responsible for the emergence of new species.

Since biochemistry studies the mutations that occur in the genes as well as the relationship between a certain gene, cell, or biological molecule from another, the study of biochemistry work collaboratively with genetics to produce evolution trees that enable scientists to see relationships of one organism from another as well as how closely related they are.

Evolution refers to the processes that have transformed life on Earth from its earliest forms to the vast diversity that characterizes it today. Darwin addressed the diversity or organisms, their origins and relationships, their similarities and differences, their geographical distribution and their adaptation to their surround environments. 

Life originated about 3.5 billion years ago, the first form of life was most likely a membrane-closed cell containing self-replication [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] molecule. Speculation supposes the components of the first cell may have been produced near thermals vents of the sea bottom or other areas of high temperature where atmospheric molecules such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are present. One famous experiment that demonstrated biological molecules could have been formed from inorganic components is the Miller-Urey Experiment. The two scientists recreated the environment of early earth in a flask and found that the monomer basis of [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] were formed.

==Pre-Biotic Theories==

Pre-biotic theories attempt to explain the origins of life, more specifically the creation of complex organic chemical structures from that of inorganic chemicals. The earliest chemical explanations have stemmed from Oparin’s book, The Origin of Life. Oparin’s theory was notable for setting a starting point as an experimentally provable pre-biotic theory. Most biochemical based pre-biotic theories stem from modifications or revisions of Oparin’s original theory. The Miller-Urey Experiment simulated the conditions set by Oparin's hypothesis and provided verifiable data in support of the pre-biotic theory.

=== Oparin's Theory ===
Oparin's theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Oparin | first = Aleksandr Ivanovich | year = 1964 | title = The Chemical Origin of Life  publisher = C.C. Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the evolution of life from inorganic matter is called the Pre-Biotic Theory. According to Oparin, early atmosphere was very different from today's atmosphere. The atmosphere was very chemically reductive, consisting of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water. Through the action of unfiltered solar radiation, as the earth's atmosphere was less protective, the reductive chemicals would react. These reactions would chemically attack one-another, forming organic molecules which would gather due to various molecular interactions, forming a &quot;primeval soup&quot;. Within the &quot;primeval soup&quot; organic molecules would form coacervates, assorted chemical compounds attracted through[[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic forces]]; such coacervates would allow semi-closed systems in which basic organic metabolisms could form. Chemical reactions would increase in complexity and size, eventually forming [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]]. These reactions were hypothesized to be the origins of modern protein structures. However, there are several problems with Oparin's theory. Oparin stated that the atmosphere was strongly reductive, as oxidative attack would have destroyed more complex amino acids. However, without oxidizing gases, no ozone layer would have blocked up excess solar radiation which would eventually split the nitrous gasses into their respective components. To some extent, the containment that a coacervate would provide is sufficient, but it is not a complete explanation or solution to the pre-biotic theory.

=== The Early Earth ===
* '''Atmospheric Contents'''
Earth's early atmosphere was quite different from the way it is today. The hypothesis is that Earth's atmosphere has evolved many times to lead the its present atmosphere. Today's atmosphere consists mainly of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen. The most popular theory about the early atmosphere is that it contained very little oxygen, and was composed mainly of ammonia, methane, hydrogen, and water. With the aid of nature's forces of lighting, erupting volcanoes, and UV irradiation, the atmosphere was able to evolve.The early atmosphere was believed to contain large amounts of hydrogen which would explain how the atmosphere evolved through oxygen reduction. The Miller-Urey experiment was able to test this hypothesis. Using only the elements that were thought to be contained in the atmosphere and electric sparks to imitate lightning, the experiment proved that it was possible for Earth's atmosphere to evolved into what it is today.The Miller-Urey experiment paved the road towards the formation of living organisms throughout the atmospheric evolution. The experiment resulted in gaseous and water phases. The gaseous phase produced carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, while the water phase contained various compounds like aldehydes, amino acids, and hydroxy acids. This showed that the hypothesis that abiotic production of biomolecules could be possible. As more detailed experiments were tested, data showed that polypeptides and RNA-like molecules could be produced with this atmosphere.There is also evidence that life could have developed only in the early times. Some chemicals reactions like those involving amino acids would require very little oxygen be present. The early atmosphere would also explain the existence of anaerobic life forms. Many experiments have led to the conclusion that the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has increased overtime.

In 2006, an alternative source of organic compounds was proposed: outer space. Studies from the Stardust space mission brought back tiny particles of dust from the tail of a  comet which contained a variety of organic compounds.  

* '''Primordial Sea/Soup'''
The Primordial sea is the collection of all the oceans on Earth that were thought to be the beginning to the development of multicellular organisms. As early earth was evolving, many organic molecules existed and were unable to replicate itself. However, since multicellular organisms were thought to have not existed at that time, organic molecules were able to somehow provide the proper environment for chemical evolution. Complex polymers were able to form in such environments as well, but this formation was not a simple process. The Primordial soup refers to the Miller-Urey experiment as well, since it involved making an ocean that was thought to exist in early times.&lt;!--  --&gt;

=== The Miller-Urey Experiment ===
In 1953, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey (at that time at the University of Chicago), constructed an experiment within Urey’s Lab to simulate the early earth conditions that were postulated to have existed by the Oparin hypothesis. The experiment consisted of a closed system with both a liquid phase and an “atmosphere” phase (See figure below). Within the “atmosphere” bulb were NH3, CH4, and H2 gases (ammonia, methane, and hydrogen respectively), thought to have been common in the earth’s early atmosphere due to extensive volcanic activity. The liquid phase contained water that was boiled to produce water vapor. This vapor would flow into the gas container and would be exposed to electrical sparks produced by electrodes. These sparks served to simulate the frequent lightning thought to have been familiar on the early earth. The gasses in this bulb were constantly cycled through the system using a condenser to simulate rain. The compounds would be removed from the “atmosphere” stage and would be collected back in the liquid phase, serving as a representation of the primordial sea. The experimental conditions were maintained for long lengths of time, sometimes extending to as long as a week or more. Samples were periodically taken from the “sea” phase for analysis.

Analysis of the samples taken from the system revealed the presence of organic compounds that had formed. The panel of compounds discovered included HCN, aldehydes, hydroxy acids, amino acids and simple nucleotides; among these were alanine and glutamic acid. The gas phase was found to contain high concentrations of both CO and CO2 as well. The presence of these compounds led Miller and Urey to conclude that the organic compounds that are necessary to early life and proto-life could form abiotically in a strongly reducing environment under the conditions hypothesized to have existed on the early earth.

=== RNA World Hypothesis ===

''Main Article'': [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/RNA_World_Hypothesis RNA World Hypothesis].

 biochemical theory is a mutual dependence between [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]] that encode genetic information and the enzymes that catalyze their replication. However, RNA or Related precursors may have been the first genes and catalysts, preceding both [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] and proteins. [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]] developed over time from a primordial soup of the early Earth.  Nucleotides were one of the components of this atmosphere, and eventually sequenced spontaneously into an early form of RNA.  RNA was discovered to have catalytic properties with the possibility of storing genetic information and self replication. Mutations over time could have enhanced these self replicating properties of RNA and perpetuate them further. Therefore, more RNA molecules formed and evolved exponentially to create more efficient peptide sequences and ways of replication. Soon, new variants of self replicating RNA developed, again through mutations, with the ability to catalyze the condensation of amino acids into peptides. Eventually, one of these peptides would form and assist the self replicating ability of RNA generating increasingly efficient self replicating systems. The fact that ribosomes, RNA molecules, not proteins, catalyze the formation of [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|peptide bonds]] is consistent with this theory. DNA has the complementary sequence to RNA, and so it is thought to have evolved from RNA and took over its function of conserving the genetic information.  DNA took over RNA's role as the storage of genetic information because its structure is more stable than that of RNA. These characteristics lead to the hypothesis that RNA led to DNA and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] formation.

=== RNA, DNA, and Proteins: The Evolution of Biochemical Diversity ===

RNA, not DNA, is believed to be the first genetic material. These primitive RNA, however short and simple, were able to duplicate themselves, catalyze the process, as well as splice their own introns. As RNA grows more in size and complexity, it acquires the ability to fold itself. The rate of mutations also increases as the fidelity of RNA becomes lower due to the ever-growing complication. Because of RNA's domination in the field of inheritable information, this predated era is known as 'RNA World'. 

[[Image:RNA basic structure.JPG|right|380px|Two alcohol groups on RNA make it susceptible to hydrolysis.]]

RNA shows great durability, which is crucial for genetic information is not to be degraded. However, as DNA came into existence, RNA's stability paled in comparison. The ribose ring of RNA contain two alcohol functional groups, making RNA more vulnerable to base-catalyzed hydrolysis, while DNA only has one, which in turn increases its stability. The reverse transcription of RNA into DNA is carried out using a specific [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] much similar to that which HIV virus uses to turn its viral RNA back into DNA and integrate it into the host's genetic components.

Using knowledge of biochemistry, geneticists also discovered that DNA can specialize, with different functions taking up different portions of genes. Some contain codes for message relaying, while others may have information on reproduction, etc. Specialization not only makes a cell more efficient, but also predictable. In application of genetics such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|medicine]], researchers have been able to identify the genes responsible for corresponding vulnerabilities, ranging from physiologically to psychologically. A genome then can serve as a historical record, tracking a species change as it moves through time.

While DNA becomes the blueprint, proteins assume the role of cellular activity regulator and conductor. When two [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] are derived from two different genes with similar sequence, they are '''homologs'''. Homologs can be further divided into two subunits, '''paralogs''', when those proteins occur in the same species, and '''orthologs''', when they take place in different species. By studying these occurrence, scientists can determine the path of evolution that different species have taken, as these finding are very valuable when constructing phylogeny.

== Distinguishing Features of Living Organisms ==

** '''Complex Internal Structures, there is a high degree of chemical complexity and microscopic organization.''' Thousands of molecules allow cells to maintain a very intricate interal structure, which include long polymers, each with characteristic sequences of subunits, its unique 3D strucutre and specific selection of binding sites.
**'''Systems are able to maintain equilibrium by extracting, transforming and using energy from the environment.''' This enables organisms to do mechanical, chemical and osmotic work.
**'''Reproduction, with defined function of organism's components, organisms are interacting with one another''' The interplay between organism have allowed changed in components that cause coordination and compensation to necessary adaptation to environment.
**'''Mechanisms for sensing and responding to alterations in organism environments''' A constant adjusting of internal chemistry in order to adapt to change in their local enivorment for better survival.
**'''Ability for precise self-replication and self-assembly'''Construction of entirely complete genetic material in each and every individual cell unique to the organism.
**'''A capability to evolve over time ''' This fundamental unity of the living organism is reflected at the molecular level in similarities of gene sequences and protein structures.

=== Emergence of Polymers ===

While the Miller-Urey experiment did provide a possible origin for organic monomers like [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], there was no evidence of complex polymers in the samples collected during the experiment. 

Several scientists have postulated that the creation of some polymers (i.e. polypeptides and small [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]) may have been facilitated by hot clay or sand poking out of the primordial sea. Other theories predict that the formation of the polymers was aided by mineral or metal catalysts in this sand or clay.

Researchers have tested this hypothesis by dripping small amounts of amino acid- or nucleic acid-rich solutions onto hot clay or sand. In many cases, the monomers would spontaneously link to form polymers, in the absence of a catalyst. However, the polypeptides formed in this process were often cross-linked and tangled and did not resemble current day proteins. Nevertheless, some of these molecules had minor catalytic capabilities, and may have participated in some reactions in this early earth.

=== The Protocell and Protobionts ===

Protobionts primitively resemble a version of a cell, sans the &quot;life&quot; part of the equation. Protobionts were a collection of organic molecules and other abiotic products contained in a membrane-like structure. The membrane was commonly composed of an aggregate of hydrophobic molecules that would arrange in a bilayer, similar to the phospholipid [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|bilayer]] of a plasma membrane. These membranous structures likely formed in the same manner as micelles form in aqueous solution. 

Protobionts have been generated in a laboratory setting as well in the form of liposomes. These liposomes are remarkable in that the hydrophobic bilayer that surrounds the inner solution is usually selectively permeable. This selective permeability allows the liposome to store an internal solutions that varies from the surrounding media. Due to this permeability, and diffusion some of these liposomes are even able to maintain a gradient across this hydrophobic bilayer. Some of these liposomes have been seen to split into smaller bodies, although perfect replication is not observed. Liposomes are considered to be a possible model for the protocell.

=== First Cells Used Inorganic Chemical Fuels ===
The earliest cells arose in a reducing atmosphere (no oxygen) and most likely obtained energy from abundant inorganic fuels present on the early Earth.

Most likely, the primitive unicellular organisms gradually acquired ability to derive energy from compounds from the environment however, through evolutionary years organisms started to use energy to synthesized more of their own precursors molecules. Thus, organisms became less dependent upon the external sources.

For example, photosynthesis occurred through the development of pigments capable of converting light energy or &quot;fix&quot; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into organic compounds. This evolutionary change allowed plants to become more self-efficient in surviving in their environment.

Since the atmosphere of early Earth consisted on little to almost no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the earliest cells were anaerobic, organisms that do not depend upon the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, with the rise of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, produced by the photosynethetic bacteria, the atmosphere became progressively richer in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a powerful oxidant and deadly poisons to anaerobics. Advantages of aerobic organism over their anaerobic counterparts in the rich O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; environment, led to the dominance of aerobic organisms in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rich environments. This proposed time of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rich environment develop suggest a support of Darwin's Theory of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; for the aerobic organisms were able to prosper in the environment due to their adaptive evolution.

==Molecular Anatomy ==
Studying biological evolution has allowed biochemists to trace information of molecular anatomy.
Molecular anatomy reveals evolutionary relationships. Molecular phylogeny is consistent with, yet more precise than classical macroscopic phylogeny. Molecular structures and mechanisms are remarkably similar from the simplest to the most complex organisms. DNA sequences are said to be homologous when two genes share sequencing similarities and the proteins they encode are called homologs. The homologous genes are said to be paralogous if they occur within the same species and the proteins they produce are called paralogs. Usually, paralogs have similar three-dimensional structure, but acquire different functions during evolution. On the other hand, two homologous genes found in different species are said to be orthologous and their protein products are othologs. Usually, orthologs are found to have the same function. Thus, functions of gene products can be guessed from the genomic sequence. The differences between homologous genes can be a rough measurement of how far two species have diverged during evolution. The larger the number of sequence differences, the earlier the divergence in evolutionary history.

==Darwin: On the Origin of Species==

Charles Darwin's Evolution Theory stated &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; under selective pressure, led to the idea of natural selection. Darwin claimed that mutant cells and its progeny would survive and prosper in new environments whereas wild-type (unmutated cells) cells should starve and be eliminated.

1)	Species were not created in their present forms, but have evolved from ancestral species, this is not dependent upon natural selection.

2)	Natural Selection is a mechanism for evolution which details that a population of organisms can change over time as a result of individuals with certain heritable traits considered favorable for their environment, are able to leave more offspring than other individuals.

=== Natural Selection ===
According to Charles Darwin, natural selection is a phenomenon by which organisms with favorable hereditary traits become successful and dominant in survival and reproducing. Organisms with traits that are unsuitable for survival are unfavored by nature and therefore die out. This process acts on the phenotype, or the appearance of the organism. The phenotypes that an organism have acquired are a result of random mutations in its genetic code, or genotype. This means that the entire course of life on earth was directed by random mutations in the genetic code of countless organisms and that these mutations are acted upon by nonrandom environmental forces that favor a particular trait. Overall, this mechanism allows the possibility of the emergence of new species of organisms that may adapt to their environments and thrive. In conclusion, the process of natural selection favors genes that have survival value for organisms in ever changing environments.
Christopher Exley from Keele University praised Darwin's idea of natural selection as a force of nature. He emphasized in his paper, &quot;Darwin, Natural Selection and the Biological Essentiality of Aluminium and Silicon,&quot; that natural selection is important in biochemical evolution as it is in speciation and that it also defined the essentiality of elements such as aluminium and silicon. Despite the fact that aluminium and silicon are both abundant in Earth, aluminium has no essential role in the biological system while silicon is considered essential biologically. Silicon participated in natural selection partially by helping aluminium to be selected out of the biological system in unreactive form through reacting with aluminium to form HAS (hydroxyaluminosilicates), which protects the biological system against toxicity of aluminium. This significantly reduced the biological availability of aluminium as well as its biological reactivity with the biooragnic compounds, leaving aluminium out of the biochemical evolution (non-participation in natural selection). Therefore, natural selection, as a force of nature, defines that silicon, which reacts with bioinorganic compounds such as metals to keep the biological system safe, is essential while aluminium has no essentiality in the biological system due to lack of biological availability.

=== Mutations ===

In DNA replication, mistakes, known as genetic mutations, always occur, which causes changes in the DNA sequence.  
Imperfections in replication leads to changes in the DNA, producing genetic mutations. Genetic mutations can be extremely harmful if they are passed down through reproductive cells because the mutations can cause certain functions in the body, such as enzymatic reactions, to not occur.  However, even though mutations are unwanted, they allow cells to evolve and become stronger. Mutations allow cells to do things that they were not able to do before. Occasionally a mutation better equips an organism or cell to survive in its environment. Hence, even though it is a mutant, if it is trying to survive in a new environment and there is an abundant amount of it, it will be able to survive in that environment better than the wild type cells, which will cause the wild type to die off and become limited.  The mutant cell would have a selective advantage over the other unmutated &quot;wild type&quot; cells. Eventually, the wild type cells would starve and be eliminated. Sometimes, genes accidentally create a second copy of itself during DNA replication due to a mutation.  The second copy is not necessary, and mutations to this gene will not be damaging. Thus, this allows the gene to have a new function while keeping the old one. As this occurs numerous times, another unexpected mutation occurs to the second copy and causes sequencing and the protein formed from this sequence to be altered.  For example, as a hexokinase gene went through DNA replication, it faced a mutation, which created a duplication of it.  That duplicate gene encountered another error, causing it to form a copy of the original gene and a copy of a mutated duplicated gene that can have different abilities.  In some cases, these mutations actually help the formation of a new gene to evolve.  DNA has evolved a plenty through time because of mutations.  Moderate amounts of mutations allow DNA to grow and have variation, which accounts for the diversity of organisms.

&lt;h4&gt;Types of Mutations&lt;/h4&gt;
There are two basic categories of mutations that occur during DNA replication.  They are:

*'''Point Mutations''', in which a single nitrogen base is changed.  For example, given the sequence: GATTACA.  A point mutation may result in this combination: GATAACA.  Usually, the point mutations only change a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Pyrimidine|pyrimidine]] base with another [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Pyrimidine|pyrimidine]] base, or a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Purines|purine]] with another purine.  These mutations are known as transition point mutations, and are far more common than their counterpart, the transversions, which change a purine for a pyrimidine, and vice versa.  The transition mutations are also grouped into nonsense, missense, and silent mutations.  ''Nonsense mutations'' involve the accidental coding of a stop sequence, which can lead to a far shorter protein that originally planned.  ''Missense mutations'' cause coding for a completely different protein, and ''silent mutations'' are ones in which the protein in unaffected.  They can code for the same or different amino acid, but one that doesn't affect the structure and function of the molecule as a whole.

*'''Frameshift Mutations''', in which an addition or a deletion of a nitrogen base causes a shift of frame for the protein synthesis.  For example, if the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|ribosome]] is loading the molecule three nitrogen base pairs at a time, and originally it plans on separating the following as such: /GAT/TAC/A.  A frame shift would either look like this, with an addition, /AGA/TTA/CA, or with a deletion, /ATT/ACA.

&lt;h4&gt;Pros of Mutations&lt;/h4&gt;

*Mutants can acquire different specificity that may be more advantageous or better suited for their environment, and therefore lead to a higher survival rate along with propagation of that mutation in the species gene pool.  Introducing a fertile mutant into a species allows for a wider range of genetic differences than increases the virility of such.
&lt;h4&gt;Cons of Mutations&lt;/h4&gt;
*Mutations in DNA may be harmful or even lethal because defects may occur and may cause deletions or denaturazation of enzymes or other necessary specificities required for living, resulting defectives may render incapability of completing proper functions. For example, many human genetic diseases are due to mutations in the DNA. Mutations in DNA may be harmful and even lethal.  In the bacteria Escherichia coli, E.coli, when a point mutation is made in specific strains of DH5-alpha cells, the bacteria become dominant lethal, which causes the growth to completely cease and terminates the cells.  It is said that many errors in replication can cause diseases such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Heme group/Hemoglobin/Sickle disease
|sickle cell anemia]]
, in which a point mutation causes the cells to be misshapen and cluster and inhibit proper blood flow, resulting in severe pain throughout the body.  UV radiation or exposure to carcinogens, can cause the occasional mutations to accumulate and cause cancer.  It is said the mutation accumulation in the body is also a contributor to the aging process.

* Inheritable mutations allow organisms to become more suited for survival in an ecological niche and prosper in reproduction towards preferential selected traits. The process of mutations and natural selection is based on the theory of Darwinism evolution, which states that the fundamental similarities among all living organisms deriving from the very beginning, the first single cell.

==Genomes==
The sequence of the genome, the complete genetic endowment of an organism gives biochemists an enormously ri9ch and ever increasing treasury of information that can be used to analyze evolutionary relationships and refine evolutionary theory. Through evolution, structures, processes, and mechanisms are reflected in the changing genomes of evolving organisms. Therefore, comparison of whole genomes of species in each phylum class are leading to clarification and identification of genes critical to the fundamental evolutionary changes in the body plan and development. 

With sequences as quantitative comparison is possible and therefore will lead to better insight into the evolutionary process where similarities are often found among living organisms and difference will shed light upon the genetic reasons for diversity among the organisms.
By identifying pathways (sets of enzymes) encoded in genome, can allow biochemists and geneticists to learn more about the genetic material of organism as well as deduce from the genomic sequence alone the organism's metabolic capabilities. 

The genome for 100s of bacteria, 40 archaea, and numerous eukaryotic micro-organisms are already known, and expanding.

=== Genomics ===
When the sequence of a genome is fully determined, and each gene is assigned a function, molecualar geneticists can group genes according to processes, and thus find what fraction of the genome is allocated to each of a cell's activities. In general, the more complex an organism, the greater proportion of its genome is involved in the regulation of cellular processe.

Genes in E. coli, A. thaliana and H. sapiens consists of
* 40+% unknown function
* ~10-4% transporters
* ~6-2% encode proteins and RNA

With the newly acquired knowledge of the complete genome of organism from different branches of phylogentic tree provides insights into evolution that eventually benefit human medicine.

==In Vitro Evolution==

Also known as SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment), in vitro evolution is the study of RNA &amp; DNA nucleotides and its natural selection on a microscopic scale. Study of RNA and DNA functions are carried out by putting together a mix of nucleotides and observing them outside of a cell (as opposed to the inside, which is referred to as in vivo evolution). The sample is put under conditions so as to promote survival competition between the nucleotides in the sample, this &quot;competition&quot; is usually in regard to the survival of a specific property of the nucleotide. The nucleotides that are shown to have dominant survival are subsequently amplified. 

In vitro evolution has several purposes, the main one being the creation of a nucleotide or protein to perform specific functions. SELEX has also been used to predict the evolution of nucleotides with the assumption that stimulating a sample of nucleotides can procure what would be evolutionary fit. Adaptive mutations are induced and are used either to predict the evolutionary course of a sequence of nucleotides or and/or to optimize a molecule such as a protein to better perform a specific function. For example, it can be used to increase the binding affinity of an antibody, and it can also be used to predict the development of drug resistance.

The methodology of conducting in vitro evolution studies is constantly changing. Initially mutagenesis was procured via induction at the nucleotide level. However single point mutation of nucleotides through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was rather difficult because in some cases only a small fraction of an amino acid sample were accessible by this method. Mutagenesis done on the codon-level, such as the use of trinucleotide phosphoramidites, yield more practical results in that it is less cumbersome. An example of the efficacy between PCR and Codon-level mutagenesis can be drawn: in a situation where degeneracy is being introduced to a codon, 32 sequences of nucleotides are made whereas with codon-level mutagenesis only 20 are made. Amplification of the sample with the higher combination of sequence (PCR) become a burden later on when the excess nucleotides grow exponentially.

Vital to the utility of in vitro evolution is the ability to separate desirable mutations from a large mutant population. Generally, achieving mutations towards a given function requires rapid isolation of the individual proteins using techniques based on that desired function.  Separation and screening are both valuable techniques used to assay libraries.  Simple screening can be useful, but because significant and specific mutations require extensive mutant libraries, higher-throughput methods are required to reliably find individuals with the needed mutations.  Thus, selections are often more useful because they can evaluate a larger quantity of mutants. 

Intro Vitro evolution was first introduced by Sol Spiegelman in the 1960s. He extracted RNA from the Qخ² virus. Instead of using the traditional in vivo method of replication, Spielgeman used the extracted enzymes, RNA Q-b replicase (a viral RNA molecule) to synthesis RNA in the test tube. RNA begins to replicate without cellular reproduction. Through Spiegelman’s experiment, Darwin’s evolution theory of survival of the fittest proved to apply not only to organism but to molecule as well. The RNA coded to best fit into under the optimization condition will continue to multiple while the less competitive ones would die off from the limited resource of nucleotide in solution. As a result after several replication processes, the original 4,500 nucleotides bases have shrunken to a short 218 nucleotide bases, since shorter RNA stranded tends to replicate faster. The shorten RNA chain is denoted as the Spiegelman Monster.

There is much debate whether or not in vitro evolution can accurately portray the evolution which occurs in a cell (vivo evolution).  However, recent studies by Miriam Barlow and Barry G. Hall at the University of Rochester have shown that in vitro evolution have strong similarities to vivo evolution.  Their study took the evolution of the TEM-1 ß-lactamase gene in vitro and compared its evolutionary path to the naturally occurring evolution.  The results of their study found that a large majority of the amino acid substitutions from vivo evolution were also found in the vitro evolution.  The conclusion of the study is that in vitro evolutionary techniques can be used with confidence to predict the future evolution in genes.

Although in vitro research can serve as informative research on the molecular level, many proteins and cells work interdependently. Thus, in a test tube, many interactions and functions are not the same as in an organism as a whole.

==Theory of the Acquisition of Mitochondria==
See main article [[Structural Biochemistry/The Endosymbiotic Theory]]

One key difference between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells are the presence of organelles in eukaryotic cells. Organelles are membrane bound “bodies” found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that carry out specific functions.

One popular theory of how these organelles were obtained is the endosymbiosis theory. This theory seeks to provide an explanation for the appearance of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells. The central idea behind this theory is as follows:

One prokaryotic cell ingests (or is infected by) another prokaryotic cell. Each prokaryotic cell fails to destroy or digest the other cell. As a result, the smaller of the two cells remains alive inside the larger cell. In the case of mitochondria, the smaller of the two prokaryotic cells (an aerobic prokaryote) would have provided the host cell with a means of utilizing oxygen, while simultaneously gaining nutrients that are taken in by the host cell. This presents a symbiosis, where both a host and its symbiotic partner contribute to the wellbeing of each individual within the partnership.

A “secondary endosymbiosis” seeks to explain the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts in plant cells and some protists.

Support for this theory include the presence of a double lipid bilayer (membrane) in mitochondria, and the presence of mitochondrial DNA.

* Whereas Eukaryotic cells acquired capacities for photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation from endosymbiotic bacteria, multicellular organisms developed specialized cell types that differentiated functions essential to organism’s survival.

=Connotations of The Text=

This poem is an dinner invitation to Catullus's friend, Fabullus.

===Line 3===

*'''''si - if...'''''

This is the catch for Fabullus - he will dine well if he does all the things about to be listed. It is put at the beginning of the line for emphasis.

===Line 4===

*'''''candida - white; fair''''' 

Can mean either beautiful or blonde as fair hair was a sign of beauty in Roman times.

===Line 5===

*'''''sale - salt'''''

This word means salt normally, but came to mean wit. This was because salt was used to add flavour the meat, and so in a literary terms the 'flavour' to words is wit.

*'''''cachinnis - laughs'''''

This word is probably derived from Greek since the letter '''ch''' was not a Latin sound. The harsh sound that comes from saying this word may reflect the sounds of the laughter described.

===Line 8===

*'''''plenus sacculus est aranearum - lit. - full the purse is of cobwebs''''''

The poem makes use of hyperbaton. This is the re-arranging of the word order to create emphasis and effect. Hyperbaton is particularly common in inflected languages, such as Latin and Ancient Greek where the word order does not matter. The joke here is still used today - cobwebs sprung up where nothing has been touched for a while - and Catullus is broke.

===Line 11===

*'''''unguentum - perfume; oil'''''

The reference to the &quot;oil&quot; or perfume, may be a subtle compliment to Catullus's girl. Both Roman men and women would wear perfume to make themselves smell more attractive.

==Connotations of The Text==

This poem is in hendecasyllabic metre. It regards a girl who has been compared in beauty to Catullus's love, &quot;Lesbia&quot;. As offensive as it sounds, it can be assumed that it was intended really as a compliment to Lesbia, rather than an insult to the girl adressed.

===Line 2===

*'''''nigris ocellis - dark eyes'''''

Dark eyes were considered a sign of beauty in Roman times.

*'''''nec... nec... - nor... nor...'''''

This poem uses liberal use of anaphora with phrases containing ''nec''. This emphasises the negativity of the girl from Formia.

===Line 5===

*'''''Formia'''''

Formia was a city not far from Rome. It could also be a subtle reference to the word &quot;formosa&quot; which means beauty.

===Lines 6-7=== 

*'''''provincia - country people'''''

There is an air of snobbery here, sneering at country people who Catullus deems to be ignorant of what real beauty is.

*'''''...bellam? ....comparatur?'''''

Ending these two lines with forceful questions shows the reader the passion that Catullus feels and clearly indicates his view on such a thing.

===Line 8===

*'''''insapiens et infacetum - stupid and tasteless'''''

The alliteration here emphasises his disgust at girls that people will label as 'beautiful' in the countryside.

==Overview==
*Paragangliomas are still sometimes called '''glomus tumors''' (not to be confused with glomus tumors of the skin) and '''chemodectomas''', but paraganglioma is the currently accepted and preferred term
*A rare neoplasm that can be found in the abdomen (85%), thorax (12%), and in the head and neck region (3%)
*Incidence estimated at 1:1,000,000
*Categorized as a [[Radiation_Oncology/Neuroendocrine|neuroendocrine tumor]]
*Usually considered benign and complete surgical removal results in cure.  However, in about 3-5% of cases they are malignant and have the ability to metastasize.  
*Most occur as single tumors.  When they occur in multiple sites they are usually found as a part of a heritable syndrome such as [[w:multiple endocrine neoplasia|MEN]] types II-A and II-B and [[w:Carney syndrome|Carney syndrome]].

==Inheritance==
*Familial paragangliomas account for ~25% of cases, are often multiple and bilateral, and occur at an earlier age.
*Mutations of the genes [[w:SDHD|SDHD]] (previously known as PGL1), PGL2, and [[w:SDHC (gene)|SDHC]] (previously PGL3) have been identified as causing familial head and neck paragangliomas. 
*Mutations of [[w:SDHB|SDHB]] play an important role in familial adrenal pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma (of abdomen and thorax), although there is considerable overlap in the types of tumors associated with SDHB and SDHD gene mutations.


==Pathology==
*Arise from the glomus cells, which are special chemoreceptors located along blood vessels that have a role in regulating blood pressure and blood flow.  
*The glomus cells are a part of the paraganglion system, composed of the extra-adrenal paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system, derived from the embryonic neural crest.  Thus, paragangliomas are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, and are closely related to pheochromocytomas.  Although all paragangliomas contain neurosecretory granules, only about 1-3% have clinical evidence of oversecretion.
*According to the WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors, paragangliomas are classified as having a neural cell line of origin.  In the categorization proposed by Wick, the paragangliomas belong to Group II.
*The main concentration of glomus cells are found are in the carotid body and the aortic bodies 
*Individual tumor cells are polygonal to oval and are arranged in distinctive cell balls, called Zellballen. These cell balls are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustenacular cells. 
*The paragangliomas appear grossly as sharply circumscribed polypoid masses and they have a firm to rubbery consistency.  They are highly vascular tumors and may have a deep red color.
*With IHC, the chief cells located in the cell balls are positive for [[w:chromogranin|chromogranin]], [[w:synaptophysin|synaptophysin]], [[w:neuron specific enolase|NSE]], [[w:serotonin|serotonin]] and [[w:neurofilament|neurofilamen]]; they are [[w:S-100 protein|S-100]] negative.  The sustenacular cells are S-100 positive and focally positive for [[w:glial fibrillary acid protein|GFAP]].  By histochemistry, the paraganglioma cells are argyrophilic, PAS negative, mucicarmine negative, and argentaffin negative.


==Clinical characteristics==
Paragangiomas are described by their site of origin and are often given special names:

* '''Carotid paraganglioma''' (carotid body tumor): Is the most common of the head and neck paragangliomas.  It usually presents as a painless neck mass, but larger tumors may cause cranial nerve palsies, usually of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve.  

* '''Glomus tympanicum''' and '''[[Radiation_Oncology/Paraganglioma#Glomus_Jugulare|Glomus jugulare]]''': Both commonly present as a middle ear mass resulting in tinnitus (in 80%) and hearing loss (in 60%).  The cranial nerves of the jugular foramen may be compressed, resulting swallowing difficulty.

* '''Vagal paragangliomas''': These are the least common of the head and neck paragangliomas.  They usually present as a painless neck mass, but may result in dysphagia and hoarseness.

* '''Other sites''': Rare sites of involvement are the larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, thyroid gland, and the thoracic inlet.


==Treatment==
*The main treatment modalities are surgery, embolization and radiotherapy.
*When radiation is given, doses are in the range of 45-50 Gy.
*For stereotactic radiosurgery, median margin dose (50% isodose) used is ~16 Gy


==Glomus Jugulare==
[[Image:Tumor_Glomus_Jugulare.jpg|thumb]]
===Overview===
*Typically considered slow-growing (estimated doubling time 4.2 years) benign tumors, &lt;5% malignant potential
*However, they are locally agressive neoplastic lesions, involving bony erosion and destruction of neurovascular structures 
*Commonly arise from the paraganglia of the jugular bulb
**Typically invade the tympanic cavity and jugular foramen 
**Can extensively invade petroclival region
**Can invade cavernous sinus above
**Can invade hypoglossal canal below
*Clinical presentation typically with tinnitus or hearing loss, but may also impact jugular foramen CNs
*Glasscock-Jackson Classification:

*Optimal treatment strategy is not clear, with multiple options:
**Surgery: primary option if brainstem compression, or in young patients with functional CN loss. Surgical morbidity not insignificant
**Fractionated RT: typical doses 45-55 Gy, mechanism of action likely related to fibrosis of feeding vessels and not direct glomus cell destruction. Complication rate low
**SRS: No long-term experience yet, but appears a good option due to high conformality. RT dose typically ~16 Gy at 50% margin isodose. Typically ~1/3 have volume shrinkage, and ~2/3 no change, &lt;10% further growth. Clinically ~50% may experience improvement
**Embolization: typically considered an adjunctive treatment to surgery or RT. Not adequate alone due to poor tumor coverage and frequent re-vascularization

==Summary of human GEP-NETs by site of origin and by symptom==
*The endocrine system is a communication system in which hormones act as biochemical messengers to regulate physiological events in living organisms. The nervous system performs the same functions using electrical impulses as messengers. The neuroendocrine system is the combination of those two systems, or more specifically, the various interfaces between the two systems. A GEP-NET is a tumor of any such interface.

==Aspirated versus unvoiced==
In the Korean dialect spoken by a native friend of mine (and according to literature such as [http://english-korean.com/projects/kaeps/il_phon.html this]), ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅈ, and ㅂ in initial position do not become aspirated at all.  They just become unvoiced.  I'm editing the text to reflect that.  If they are spoken with aspiration, they sound like ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅊ, and ㅍ. If somebody disagrees, let's discuss. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 04:39, 12 May 2007 (UTC)
:They ''are'' devoiced, but sometimes they have weak aspiration as well. (If you're not a trained phoneticist, you might not notice this, '''''especially''''' if you're a native speaker of Korean.) Nevertheless, I think your edit was in the right direction. --'''[[User:Kjoonlee|Kjoon]]'''[[User talk:Kjoonlee|lee]] 04:10, 29 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Compare Strings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Compare Strings =
You can use == to compare equality of string references. It might be a good idea to explain the String Pool and limitation of using only ==, and then what the differences are between equals and compareTo.  The main one being that equals will first do == to see if the string references are equivalent as this is extremely fast (compareTo probably does this to?), and if this fails, will then go on to do a lexical comparison, which is slow. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MattOates Matt Oates]
: Yes, someone please write an explanation, why I shouldn't just use == whenever I feel like it. [[User:CannibalSmith|CannibalSmith]] 12:04, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
:: Well, &quot;It is not really neccessary for a Java programmer to know byte code.&quot; - Strings are an exception. Strings are &quot;==&quot; if they are the same Reference. The Java Compiler will merge all optimize the constant pool and as a result all String literals with the same content will be merged into one constant pool entry. Newer versions of the JVM merge all constant String instances, so &quot;Hello World&quot; from class A is the same reference as &quot;Hello World&quot; from class B. BUT you can't use this magic if your Strings are created on the fly - e.g. by io/deserialisation or any kind of string manipulation. Let's see the Code
&lt;pre&gt;public class StringTest {

	public static String myString = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
	
	public static class A {
		public final static String myString = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
	}
	
	public static class B {
		public final static String myString = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Same class, same constant pool
		if (myString == &quot;Hello World&quot;) {
			System.out.println(&quot;References in the same class match&quot;);
		}
		// Different classes, runtime string pool
		if (A.myString == B.myString) {
			System.out.println(&quot;References across classes match&quot;);
		}
		// Manipulated Strings &lt;-&gt; No string pool
		String v = &quot;Hello &quot;.concat(&quot;World&quot;);
		if (v != myString) {
			System.out.println(v);
			System.out.println(myString);
			System.out.println(&quot;--&gt; See the difference - equals=&quot; + v.equals(myString));
		}
	}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
:: Output on sun java 1.6.0_06-b02 for linux (other implementations can differ)
&lt;pre&gt;References in the same class match

:: As you can see the first comparison used the same constant pool entry. The strings in A and B are merged during class loading/initialisation. But the created String can't match as it is a different string instance with the same content. Not sure how this can be presented without a long paragraph about the java bytecode and the jvm.... Also note that merging across classes and merging the constant pool are optional features, so none of the == compares is guaranteed to work. I'm damn sure that merging between classes wasn't a feature from the beginning. Hope this clarifies the confusion. Understanding the byte format, the compiler and the jvm helps a lot. Especially when it comes to Strings (jvm+bytecode), Generics (compiler, bytecode), Autoboxing (compiler) etc. The rule for == is simple: If you don't intend to check for the same reference - don't use it. Every &quot;equals&quot; implementation should start with &quot;if (this == o) {return true}&quot;. This is a requirement for java.util. Collections may break if a.equals(b) == false while a == b.

== Strings Cannot Be Garbage Collected? ==

I believe this statement on the page is incorrect:

&quot;Remember that no String objects are ever eligible for garbage collection. Once a String is created, it takes up memory until the JVM terminates.&quot;

Yes, Strings are immutable objects.

Yes, literal strings, and strings created at compile time via constant expressions, are interned, and interned Strings won't be garbage collected.

But... not all Strings are interned! 

And why shouldn't a non-interned String be eligible for garbage collection? If there are no references to it, it should be able to be garbage collected... and if it's not interned, then it certainly can be the case that nothing else points to it anymore.

In short: I'm pretty sure the statement is incorrect.

I'd really like to see some sort of reference, from Sun's website, or the JLS, indicating why Strings are *never* garbage collected. Otherwise, the statement should be replaced with something more accurate.

The code example is still valid; it does create a large number of temporary String objects that get thrown away quickly, and that does create a performance issue, mitigated a bit by generational garbage collection (since the temporary Strings don't live very long).  But I don't believe it counts as a memory leak.

:You are right about that the String objects are garbage collected. I made the change, see the page. Thanks.

'''''Udea rubigalis''''' is a pest insect of greenhouses, field crops, and landscape ornamentals, native to North America. They can cause heavy damage, particularly to greenhouse plants.

==Description==
Larvae (caterpillars) are yellow to green, with a white stripe on the back. Older caterpillars create webbing which ties leaves together for protection.

Adult is a small brown moth (wingspan about 3/4 inch). 

==Symptoms and Signs==
Tied leaves, heavy feeding damage.

==Ecology==
White eggs are laid on the leaves. Complete life cycle takes about 40 days.

'''''Ambrosia''''' is a genus of flowering plants from the sunflower family (Asteraceae), commonly referred to as '''Ragweeds'''. The name of this genus is derived from the Greek word for &quot;food of the gods&quot;.

==Description==
[[Image:Ambrosia chamissonis01.jpg|thumb|left|Silver Burr ragweed (''Ambrosia chamissonis'')]] 
These are annuals, perennials and shrubs and subshrubs with erect, hispid stems growing in large clumps to a height of 75 - 90 cm. The stems are basally branched. They form a slender taproot or a creeping rhizome.

The foliage is grayish to silvery green with bipinnatifid, deeply lobed leaves with winged petioles. But in the  case of ''Ambrosia coronopifolia'', the leaves are simple. The leaf arrangement is opposite at the base, but becomes alternate higher on the stem.

Ambrosia is a monoecious plant, i.e. it produces separate male and female flower heads on the same plant. The numerous tiny male, yellowish-green disc flower are about 3 mm in diameter. They grow in a terminal spike, subtended by joined bracts. The female, whitish-green flowers are 1-flowered and are inconspicuously situated below the male ones, in the leaf axils. The pappus is lacking.

After wind pollination, the female flowers develops into a prickly, ovoid burr with 9-18 straight spines. It contains one arrowhead-shaped seed, brown when mature, and smaller than a wheat grain. This burr gets dispersed by clinging to the fur or feathers of animals passing by. The seeds are an important winter food for many bird species.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Starr_031108-3169_Ambrosia_artemisiifolia.jpg|thumb|left|Annual Ragweed (''Ambrosia artemisiifolia'' ) - leaves]]
Ragweed occurs in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and South America. They prefer dry, sunny grassy plains; sandy soils; and to grow along river banks, along roadsides, disturbed soils, vacant lots and ruderal sites. Ragweed was far less common in the Eastern United States before dense European settlement/agriculture in the late 1700s.   

There are 41 species worldwide. They are very ordinary in appearance. Despite being all around, they are easily overlooked. Virtually no animal browses them. Many are adapted to the arid climates of the desert. Burrobush (''Ambrosia dumosa'') is one of the most arid-adapted perennials in North America. About 10 species occur in the Sonoran Desert.

Each plant is reputed to be able to produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season, and the plant is anemophilous (wind-pollinated). It is highly allergenic, as the greatest pollen allergen of all pollens, and the prime cause of hayfever. The plant blooms in the northern hemisphere from about mid August until cooler weather arrives. It usually produces pollen more copiously in wet seasons. Two species, ''Ambrosia artemisiifolia'' and ''A. psilostachya'' are considered among the most noxious to those prone to hay fever.

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Control==
[[Image:Starr_010222-9001_Ambrosia_artemisiifolia.jpg|thumb|Annual Ragweed (''Ambrosia artemisiifolia'')]]
Total eradication of ragweed is considered impossible, owing to the plant's frugality and tremendous seed-producing capability. As of 2005, there is no known safe biological remedy (e.g. beetle or worm) to be used against ragweed in the open. Mechanical and chemical methods are available and can be used to control its spread, although there is evidence that these are actually no more effective than leaving the weed alone, in the long run[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0040-9618%28197311%2F12%29100%3A6%3C333%3ARCTEOO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C&amp;size=LARGE].

The act of manually uprooting ragweeds, sometimes shown in the media for public awareness and propaganda purposes, is best avoided. It is ineffective, and skin contact may cause the onset of full-blown hayfever symptoms in persons with latent ragweed hyper-sensitivity.

Although the scythe and its motorized descendants have a reduced efficiency against ragweed, they remain indispensable tools, especially in populated areas and near delicate plantation, where herbicide use must be limited. Fighting ragweed with the scythe is a continuous process, because it is difficult to cut the plant right at the soil level, and the plant will regrow in two weeks (and often branch into three or four full-sized stems) if more than half an inch of the plant remains above the ground. Areas where ragweed has been reaped should be mowed down every three weeks to prevent regrowth.

It is considered important to control the spread of ragweed in large abandoned or uncultivated areas. Ragweed pollen can remain airborne for days and travel great distances, affecting people hundreds of miles away. One efficient method for large-scale ragweed extermination is chemical spraying. Because ragweed only reacts to some of the more aggressive herbicides, it is highly recommended to consult professionals when deciding on dosage and methodology, especially near urban areas. Some proven effective active ingredients include those that are gliphosat-based (Roundup, Gliphogan, Glialka), sulphosat-based (Medallon) and gluphosinat-ammonia based (Finale14SL). In badly infested areas usually 2 to 6.5 liters of herbicides are dispersed per hectare (equal to app. 0.2 to 0.7 US gallons per acre).

One especially effective method of controlling ragweed; cutting it, then burning it once the stalks have dried[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0040-9618(197311%2F12)100%3A6%3C333%3ARCTEOO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C] (standing, live ragweed won't burn) has become less popular because the smoke produced is seen as unacceptable pollution, as with the decline in leaf-burning and trash burning. But this method has the added benefit of killing off the stems so the plant does not grow back, which (as noted above) is otherwise almost inevitable.

==Allergen==
Common Ragweed (''Ambrosia artemisiifolia'') is the most widespread of this genus in North America. It attains a height of about a meter. Great Ragweed, Giant Ragweed or Horseweed, (''Ambrosia trifida''), may grow to four meters (13 feet) or more. 

Ragweed is a plant of concern in the global warming issue, because tests have shown that higher levels of carbon dioxide will greatly increase pollen production. On dry windy days, the pollen will travel many kilometers. When the humidity rises above 70%, the pollen tends to clump and is not so likely to become airborne.

Goldenrod is frequently blamed for hayfever, but simply happens to have a showy flower that blooms about the same time. Goldenrod is innocent, as it is entomophilous, i.e. insect pollinated. Its pollen is heavy and sticky, and cannot become airborne.

Some high mountain and desert areas of North America used to be refuges for severe hay fever sufferers, who would go to such areas for relief during the pollen season, but increased human activity such as building and other disturbances of the soil, irrigation, and gardening, have encouraged ragweed to spread to these areas as well. Today, no area in the United States is ragweed pollen free, and moving can only offer a degree of relief. The ragweed was accidentally imported to Europe during World War I, it had adapted to the different environment successfully and has greatly spread since the 1950s. Hungary is currently the most heavily affected country in Europe (and possibly the entire world), especially since the early 1990s, when abandonment of communist-style collective agriculture left vast fields uncultivated, which were promptly invaded by ragweed.

Anecdotal claims are made of honey giving some relief for ragweed pollen allergies, which is noteworthy because honeybees very rarely visit ragweed flowers, and even then only for pollen. However, during ragweed pollen shed, the pollen dusts every surface, and honeybees, being electrostatically charged, will accumulate some ragweed pollen. The pollen is frequently identified as a component of raw honey.
The major allergen protein has been identified [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16254437&amp;query_hl=19&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum] as Amb a 1, a 38 kDa nonglycosylated protein.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[File:Punjabi_gurmukhi_shahmukhi_devanagari.png|thumb|left|The word Punjabi in the Gurmukhi, Shahmukhi, and Devanagari scripts.]]
Punjabi is written either in the Gurmukhi script or in a form of the Arabic script known as Shahmukhi which is very similar to the script used for Urdu. Both scripts look different from the Latin script that the words you are reading now are written in.

==How many people speak this language?==
Approximately 100 million.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Primarily in the Punjab region which is now split between India and Pakistan.  It is also spoken across the world by a sizable number of people that have moved away from the Punjab region.

==What is the history of this language?==
Punjabi is a descendant of Sauraseni, which is a name for one of the languages spoken in Northern India in the medieval period. &lt;ref&gt;''India's culture through the ages'' by Mohan Lal Vidyarthi. Published by Tapeshwari Sahitya Mandir, 1952. Page 148: &quot;From the apabhramsha of Sauraseni are derived Punjabi, Western Hindi, Rajasthani and Gujerati [sic]...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Communication and Language Policy in India By Baldev Raj Nayar. Published by F. A. Praeger, 1969. Page 35. &quot;...Sauraseni Aprabhramsa from which have emerged the modern Western Hindi and Punjabi.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=psu The Sauraseni Pr?krit Language]. &quot;This Middle Indic language originated in Mathura, and was the main language used in drama in Northern India in the medieval period. Two of its descendants are Hindi and Punjabi.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Punjabi emerged as an independent language approximately in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languageinindia.com/dec2005/amritapritamsunwani2.html Language India]. Volume 5 : 12 December 2005. Editor: M. S. Thirumalai, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Punjabi shares a related history with the [[Wikijunior:Languages/Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Wikijunior:Languages/Urdu|Urdu]] languages, someone who speaks Punjabi can understand a lot of what someone speaking in Hindi or Urdu is saying and the same for the other way around.


==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
*ਆਲੂ (ālū) means potato
*ਦਿਲ (dil) means heart
*ਗਾਂ (gã) means cow

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==

==Introduction==
Buffer systems are systems in which there is a significant (and nearly equivalent) amount of a weak acid and its conjugate base—or a weak base and its conjugate acid—present in solution.  This coupling provides a resistance to change in the solution's pH.  When strong acid is added, it is neutralized by the conjugate base.  When strong base is added, it is neutralized by the weak acid.  However, too much acid or base will exceed the buffer's ''capacity'', resulting in significant pH changes.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{A}^- &lt;/math&gt;
|Consider an arbitrary weak acid, HA, and its conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, in equilibrium.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{A}^- + \hbox{H}^+ \rightarrow \hbox{HA}&lt;/math&gt;
|The addition of a strong acid will cause only a slight change in pH due to neutralization.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA} + \hbox{OH}^- \rightarrow \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{A}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|Likewise, the addition of a strong base will cause only a slight change in pH.
|}

Buffers are useful when a solution must maintain a specific pH.  For example, blood is a buffer system because the life processes in a human only function within a specific pH range of 7.35 to 7.45.  When, for example, lactic acid is released by the muscles during exercise, buffers within the blood neutralize it to maintain a healthy pH.

==Making a Buffer==
Once again, let's consider an arbitrary weak acid, HA, which is present in a solution.  If we introduce a salt of the acid's conjugate base, say NaA (which will provide the A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion), we now have a buffer solution.  Ideally, the buffer would contain equal amounts of the weak acid and conjugate base.

Instead of adding NaA, what if a strong base were added, such as NaOH?  In that case, the hydroxide ions would neutralize the weak acid and create water and A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions.  If the solution contained only A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, then a strong acid like HCl were added, they would neutralize and create HA.

As you can see, there are three ways to create a buffer:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1px&quot;
|+ '''Buffers'''
|
*1 HA + 1 A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*1 HA + ½ OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*1 A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + ½ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|
*1 B + 1 HB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
*1 B + ½ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
*1 HB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + ½ OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

All six of the combinations will create equal amounts of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

== Buffers and pH ==

To determine the pH of a buffer system, you must know the acid's '''dissociation constant'''.  This value, &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt; for a base) determines the strength of an acid (or base).  It is explored more thoroughly in the [[General Chemistry/Chemical Equilibria|Equilibrium]] unit, but for now it suffices to say that this value is simply a measure of strength for acids and bases.  The dissociation constants for acids and bases are determined experimentally.

{{Info|The pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of an acid is the negative logarithm of its acid dissociation constant. This is analogous to pH (the negative logarithm of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration).}}

The '''Henderson-Hasselbalch equation''' allows the calculation of a buffer's pH.  It is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{pH} = \hbox{pK}_a + \log \frac{[\hbox{A}^-]}{[\hbox{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For a buffer created from a base, the equation is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{pH} = \hbox{pK}_b + \log \frac{[\hbox{B}]}{[\hbox{HB}^+]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using these equations requires determining the ratio of base to acid in the solution.

The '''Rosaceae''' or rose family is a large family of plants, with about 3,000-4,000 species in 100-120 genera. Traditionally it has been divided into four subfamilies: Rosoideae, Spiraeoideae, Maloideae, and Amygdaloideae. These subfamilies are primarily diagnosed by the structure of the fruits, although this approach is not followed universally. Recent work has identified that the traditional four subfamilies are not all monophyletic, but the structure of the family is still awaiting complete resolution.

Identified clades include:

* Subfamily Rosoideae: Traditionally composed of those genera bearing small fruits, each of which is an achene or drupelet, and often the fleshy part of the fruit (e.g. Strawberry) is the hypanthium or the stalk bearing the carpels. The circumscription is now narrowed (excluding, for example, the tribe Dryadeae), but it still remains a diverse group containing 5 or 6 tribes and 20 or more genera. Rose, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, Potentilla, Geum.

* Subfamily Spiraeoideae: Traditionally those genera which bear non-fleshy fruits consisting of five capsules. Now perhaps to be restricted to Spiraea and Sorbaria and their respective allies.

* Subfamily Maloideae (or Pomoideae): Traditionally this includes those genera (apple, cotoneaster, hawthorn, pear, quince, rowan, whitebeam, etc.), whose fruits consist of five capsules (called &quot;cores&quot;) in a fleshy endocarp, surrounded by the ripened stem tissue. This fruit is called a pome. To these are added the woody genera Lindleya and Vauquelinia, which share a haploid chromosome count of 17 (x=17) with the pomiferous genera, Kageneckia, in which x=15, and the herbaceous genus Gillenia (x=9), which is the sibling to the remaining maloids.

* Subfamily Amygdaloideae (or Prunoideae): Traditionally those genera whose fruits consist of a single drupe with a seam, two veins next to the seam, and one vein opposite the seam. Now extended to include the five genera Exochorda, Maddenia, Oemleria, Prinsepia and Prunus (plum, peach, almond, cherry, apricot).

* Tribe Dryadeae: Fruits are achenes with hairy styles. Includes five genera (Dryas, Cercocarpus, Chamaebatia, Cowania and Purshia), most species of which form root nodules which host the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Frankia.

* Tribe Neillieae: Neillia (including Stephanandra) and Physocarpus.

Amongst these groups, Neillieae appears to be the sister group to Maloideae, and Dryadeae may be a sibling group to Rosoideae. Other genera, for example Kerria, appear not to belong to any of these groups.

==Purpose==
As part of your ongoing assessment of the victim, and in preparation for the arrival of any assistance you have called, it is important to keep a check on a victim's vital signs.

If possible, these recordings should be written down so that you can keep a record of any changes, and hand this over to the ambulance crew who take the victim from you.  Ideally, it should be recorded on a report, which should form part of every first aid kit.  Alternatively, you can write it on any piece of paper, or often first aiders end up writing on their protective glove.

==Assessments==
The vital signs you are looking to record relate to the body's essential functions. It starts with the airway and breathing already covered in basic life support (although you should look for additional detail) and continues with circulation, look of the skin, level of consciousness and pupil reaction.

===Breathing===
While maintaining an open airway, ensure that the victim is breathing and count the rate of breathing.  The easiest way to do this is to count the number of breaths taken in a given time period (15 or 30 seconds are common time frames), and then multiply up to make a minute.  The longer the time period, the more accurate it is, however you are likely to want the patient not to converse (as this disrupts their breathing pattern), and it is important not to tell them that you are watching their breathing, as this is likely to make them alter the pattern, so a shorter period is likely to be more useful and reduce worry for the patient. 

In addition to rate, you should note if the breathing is heavy or shallow, and importantly if it is regular.  If it is irregular, see if there is a pattern to it (such as breathing slowly, getting faster, then suddenly slower again). Note whether breathing is noisy (wheezing could be a sign of asthma, rattling (also called 'stridor') a sign of fluid in the throat or lungs).

===Circulation===
Whereas in the primary survey, we did not check the circulation of the victim to see if the heart was beating (we assumed that if the victim was breathing, their heart was working and if they were not breathing, their heart was also stopped), it is important in monitoring the breathing victim to check their circulation.

The two main checks are:
* '''Capillary Refill''' - The capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessel, and are responsible for getting blood in to all the body tissues.  If the blood pressure is not high enough, then not enough blood will be getting to the capillaries.  It is especially important to check capillary refill if the victim has suffered an injury to one of their limbs.  You check capillary refill by taking the victim's hand, lifting it above the level of the heart, and squeezing reasonably hard for about a second on the [[First Aid/Appendix A: Glossary#Nailbed|nailbed]].  This should move the blood out, and the nail bed will appear white.  If the pink colour returns quickly (and in a healthy victim, it may return before you even move your fingers away to look!), then this is normal.  Victims who have poor peripheral circulation, especially the elderly and hypothermia victims, may not demonstrate adequate capillary refill due to general lack of blood flow, making this test less valuable on these patients.  A normal time for the pink colour to return is less than two seconds.  If it takes longer than two seconds for colour to return, then this could indicate a problem and you should seek medical advice. 
*'''Pulse check''' - As a first aider, you can also check a victim's heart rate by feeling for their pulse.  There are three main places you might wish to check for a pulse:
[[File:Carotidian pulse and recovery position.jpg|thumb|Right|Checking for a carotid pulse.]]
**'''Radial pulse''' - This is the best pulse to look for a first aider, on a conscious victim, as it is non-invasive and relatively easy to find.  It is located on the wrist (over the radial bone).  To find it, place the victim's hand palm up and take the first two fingers of your hand (NEVER use your thumb, as it contains a pulse of its own) and on the thumb side of the victim's wrist you will feel a rounded piece of bone, move in from here 1-2cm in to a shallow dip at the side of the bone, and press your fingers in (gently), where you should be able to feel a pulse.   Taking a pulse here can be a skill that takes practice, so it is worth frequently testing this skill. Should there be no pulse in a victim who is pale and unwell, you are advised to seek medical assistance urgently.
**'''Carotid Pulse''' - This is in the main artery which supplies the head and brain, and is located in the neck.  This is best used on unconscious victims, or those victims where you are unable to find a radial pulse (because the carotid pulse, being closer to the heart, is stronger than the radial pulse).  To locate it, place your two fingers in to the indentation to the side of the windpipe, in line with the Adam's apple (on men), or approximately the location a Adam's Apple would be on women.
**'''Pedal Pulse''' - The pedal pulse can be found in several locations on the foot, and this is used when you suspect a broken leg, in order to ascertain if there is blood flowing to the foot.  

When measuring a pulse you should measure the '''pulse rate'''.  This is best achieved by counting the number of beats in 15 seconds, and then multiplying the result by four. You should also check if the pulse is regular or irregular.

===Skin===
Related to circulation, is the colour of the skin.  Changes in circulation will cause the skin to be different colours, and you should note if the victim is flushed, pale, ashen, or blue tinged.

It should also be noted if the victim's skin is clammy, sweaty or very dry, and this information should be passed on to the ambulance crew.

===Level of Consciousness===
You can continue to use the acronym '''AVPU''' to assess if the victim's level of consciousness changes while you are with them.  To recap, the levels are:
:'''A'''lert
:'''V'''oice induces response
:'''P'''ain induces response
:'''U'''nresponsive to stimuli

===Pupils===
Valuable information can be gained from looking at a victim's pupils.  For this purpose, first aid kits should have a penlight or small torch in them.

Ideally, the pupils of the eye should be equal and reactive to light, usually written down as PEARL.
:'''P'''upils
:'''E'''qual
:'''A'''nd
:'''R'''eactive to
:'''L'''ight

To check this, ask the victim to look straight at you with both eyes.  Look to see if both pupils are the same size and shape (be sensitive to those who may be blind in one eye, or may even have a glass eye, although they will usually tell you).

To check if they are reactive, take the penlight, and ask the victim to look at your nose.  Briefly (5 seconds or so) shield their eye with your hand from the light source where they are (sunlight, room lighting etc.), and then turn on the penlight, positioning it off to the side of their head.  Move the penlight in over their eye quickly, and watch to see the size change.  A normal reaction would be the pupil getting smaller quickly as the light is shone in to it.  Repeat on the other eye.

If both pupils are the same, and both react, note this on your form as PEARL, or else note down what you did, or did not see.

=Meters Used By Catullus=

Catullus uses many meters in his poetry. Some are quick and jumpy designed to reflect a jolly or happy tone in the poem it is featured. Others are slow and brooding, designed to emphasise a particular point and to create a slower, more thoughtful tone. ˘ ¯

===Dactylic Hexameter===

This meter is constructed as shown below:

¯  ¯ | ¯  ¯ | ¯  ¯ | ¯  ¯ | ¯ ˘ ˘ | ¯×

¯ ˘ ˘ |¯ ˘ ˘ |¯ ˘ ˘ | ¯ ˘ ˘| ¯ ˘ ˘| ¯×

Any spondee can be replaced by a dactyl. The fifth foot must be a dactyl and the 6th foot contains a long with the ''syllaba anceps'' (×) which is either long or short. This meter has a caesura in the middle, which cuts the 3rd foot in two. The caesura occasionally occurs in other feet.

When a word ends after the first syllable of the third foot, a '''masculine caesura''' is created.

{{Example|cūm lēctī iǔvěnēs, // Ārgīvaē rōbǒrǎ pūbîs -[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/64| &quot;Poem 64, Line 4&quot;]]}}

*The ''syllaba anceps'' has been shown with a circumflex (â).

When a word ends between the two breves of a dactylic third foot, a '''feminine caesura''' is created.

{{Example|sēd cōnūbǐǎ laētǎ, // sěd ōptātōs hǐměnaēôs -[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/64| &quot;Poem 64, Line 141&quot;]]}}

*The word &quot;hǐměnaēôs&quot; should be hyměnaēôs, the short 'I' is equivalent to the 'y' which has been replaced to show the meter.
*The ''syllaba anceps'' has been shown with a circumflex (â).

===Elegiac Couplets===

The meter is constructed as shown below:

¯  ¯ |¯  ¯ |¯  ¯ | ¯  ¯| ¯˘ ˘| ¯×

¯˘ ˘ |¯˘ ˘ |¯˘ ˘ | ¯˘ ˘| ¯˘ ˘| ¯×


¯  ¯ | ¯  ¯ | ¯ // ¯ ˘ ˘| ¯ ˘ ˘|×

¯ ˘ ˘ |¯ ˘ ˘ |¯ // ¯ ˘ ˘| ¯ ˘ ˘|×

The first is the dactylic hexameter, and the second is the pentameter. The first two dactyls have the opportunity of being turned into spondees. Then there must be a spondee, cut in two by the caesura followed by two dactyls and the ''syllaba anceps''.

{{Example|



Nūllī sē dīcīt // mǔlǐēr měǎ nūběrě māllê, 

quām mǐhǐ, nōn sī sē // Iūppǐtěr īpsě pětât. -[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/70| &quot;Poem 70, Lines 1-2&quot;]]}}

*The syllaba anceps has been shown with a circumflex (â).


An easy way to remember this is with the famous English elegiac couplet:

''In the Hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column,&lt;br&gt;
''In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.''

===Hendecasyllabic===

This translates literally to &quot;eleven syllables&quot;. It is a bouncy metre used for fun and light hearted poems such as [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/50|Poem 50]].

The meter is constructed as shown below:

– ˘ | – ˘ ˘ | – ˘ | – ˘ | – ×

˘ – | – ˘ ˘ | – ˘ | – ˘ | – ×

An English example was written by Tennyson:

{{Example|



''O you chorus of indolent reviewers,''&lt;br&gt;
''Irresponsible, indolent reviewers,'' &lt;br&gt;
''Look, I come to the test, a tiny poem'' &lt;br&gt;
''All composed in a metre of Catullus...''}}

===Galliambic===

The meter is constructed as shown below:

˘ ˘ – ˘ – ˘ – –// ˘ ˘ – ˘ ˘ ˘ ˘ ×

This meter is only used in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/63|Poem 63]].

{{Example|Ěgǒ mǔlǐěr, ěg&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt; ǎdǔlēscēns, // ěg&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt; ěphēbǔs, ěgǒ pǔêr - [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/63|&quot;Poem 63, Line 63&quot;]]}}

*The syllaba anceps has been shown with a circumflex (â).
*Elision has been shown with struck text (&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt;).

===Glyconic &amp; Pherecratean===

Stanzas in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/34|Poem 34]] and [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/61|Poem 61]] Combine Glyconic Lines:

– – – ˘ ˘ – ˘ –

– ˘ – ˘ ˘ – ˘ –

With a Pherecratean:

– – – ˘ ˘ – ×

– ˘ – ˘ ˘ – ×

This meter is as old as the 6th Century B.C. in the time of the Greek lyric poet, Anacreon.

===Greater Asclepiadean===

Catullus uses this meter only in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/30|Poem 30]]. The meter has no substitutions, and is made up of three choriambs.

The meter is constructed as shown below:

– – – ˘ ˘ – // – ˘ ˘ – // – ˘ ˘ – ˘ ×

===Iambic Senarius===

This meter is comprised of an iambic trimeter composed of six iambs. 
It only appears in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/4|Poem 4]] and  [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/29|Poem 29]].

The meter is constructed as shown below:

˘ – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ ×

===Iambic Tetrameter Catalectic===

This meter is composed of four pairs of iambs with the final syllable omitted. A caesura appears after the second iambic pair. This meter is only used in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/25|Poem 25]].

The meter is constructed as shown below:

˘ – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ – // ˘ – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ ×

===Iambic Trimeter===

This meter is three pairs of iambs, divided by a caesura in the middle f the third foot. Spondees can be substituted in place of iambs in the first and third feet.

The meter is constructed as shown below:

˘ – ˘ – ˘ // – ˘ – ˘ – ˘ –

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book describes mathematical formulation and developmental strategies in the analysis of genome and DNA sequencing. The volume will be of interest to online students of sequence statistics who explore mathematical structure of biological data especially in the analysis of chromosomes. With the exponential growth in the size of information-packed databases, the book was started by Odhiambo Siangla and covers properties of DNA and other measures of significance such as spectral analysis and criteria for entropy. The work encourages genomic biometry in a formulated interdisciplinary project.

      <comment>moved [[Survival Guide for People with Autism/Territorial theory]] to [[Autistic Survival Guide/Territorial theory]]: consistency with the book's target perspective</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Small introduction to the chapter ==
Not all &quot;normal people&quot; are &quot;normal&quot;. There are many different kind of people in a &quot;normal people&quot; population. In this chapter we will discuss the territorial people, which at most use language only to their advantage. Choose which example to further your understanding of this chapter. Until now: 1 example.

== Content ==
Example1: This example will explain how interaction in a video game can happen. The reason this is mentioned is because in the video game people can cooperate or choose to not cooperate and make it easy or difficult for the people on their team. So that's the reason. It's the option to be willing to help, or show one's ignorance. So we continue with the example below:
We are going to concentrate on only one team: team &quot;humans&quot;, which is &quot;supposed&quot; to teamwork.
This team has a base, where they can &quot;recover&quot; if they get hurt by their opponents. If they stay at the base forever, then they can't win, because to win they must go towards their opponents base and destroy (with their guns) specific buildings in order to win.
Now on to the practical part:
&quot;Humans&quot; team has 4 players: John, Michael, George and Jenny.
*John, is the cooperative type, but also wishes to convince the team that if there are 4 players at the base, 3 should go to their opponents base, and 1 should stay and defend their own base.
*Michael, is the cooperative type and wishes to go on offensive.
*George, is a base builder (although has many times acted in a very uncooperative way by hurting their own base and players by firing at them)
*Jenny, maintains and builds base buildings.
What happens:
#John, notices George's uncooperative behavior, communicates his frustration...
##and is ignored by George. John knows George doesn't wish to cooperate but ignores the fact, and still tries to convince George to cooperate. George, is the &quot;main role&quot; in this example , not wishing to cooperate or at least answer. George, (as of this example) did not wish to cooperate, but wished that none would bother of him being cooperative, and gets &quot;annoyed&quot; when people tell him what to do. In that case
#George chooses he doesn't like John, although is silent about it.
##John can't control feelings and &quot;swears&quot; and uses abuse words at George.
#'''now George takes this to his advantage, because as he sees it, John made a mistake by taking it too seriously, and now shows interest in replying, making John, feel emotionally damaged'''.
This is the end of the example, and one can say that John made the error of showing interest they would succeed, even while still knowing that at least 1 person on the team, did not wish to cooperate at all. Other solutions to the problem:
*John could instead ignore communication with the non cooperative person and only communicate with the people wishing to cooperate.

==Ingredients==
* 4 - 5 tbs. malted chocolate mix or Ovaltine (Ovomaltine), or dry malt extract &lt;ref&gt;Available from brewing supply stores or on-line.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 teaspoon cocoa powder
* 8 oz. hot water

==Procedure==

# Mix the Ovaltine and cocoa powder together. 
# Pound with a spoon until very fine, this will help eliminate the time of stirring. 
# Shake the Ovaltine and drinking powder for 10 seconds. This is called an instant hot chocolate mix. 
#Pour the mix into the water. Stir well. Top with whipped cream if desired and serve, sprinkled with cinnamon or chocolate powder, if desired. 

==Variations==

For a sweeter taste:
*1 tbs. of Hershey's Chocolate Mix 

#Add to the hot water, stir before adding the mix. (Thick version)

==Notes==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== absolute value ==

I don't understand &quot;The absolute value of a number is always positive or zero&quot;... can someone explain more?
:This is the way you should walk from zero up to the number's point or otherwise. Agree: you can't walk any &quot;minus-way&quot;. Negativity and positivity consider by themselves only the direction you can walk to or from or see the number's point from the zero point. Those directions are like the south and the north; the absolute value is like your way - you may walk not knowing the direction and still feeling the same tiredness:) [[User:JLincoln|JLincoln]] ([[User talk:JLincoln|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JLincoln|contribs]]) 00:06, 22 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure==
Ozone can be assigned two different Lewis structures, but neither one accurately represents the structure and bonding in the O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.

:[[Image:Ozone-resonance.png|center|400px|Canonical structures of ozone]]

Spectroscopic data indicates both O−O bonds in ozone are equal in length and strength.  The central oxygen atom is positively charged and the terminal oxygen atoms each carry partial negative charge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conditional Statements==
===If..Then..Else===

The simplest control structure is the if..then..else statement.
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if var1 = 0 then  
    writeln('var1 is 0!')  (*No semicolon before an 'Else' keyword*)
else if var1 = 1 then 
begin
    writeln('var1 is 1!');
    (*More code*)
end  (*No semicolon before an 'Else' keyword*)
else if var1 = 2 then 
begin
    writeln('var1 is 2!');
    (*More code*)
end  (*No semicolon before an 'Else' keyword*)
else 
begin
    writeln('var1 is not 0, 1, or 2!');
    (*More code*)
end;  (*Semicolon used to indicate the end of the If-then-else*)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Case===
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
Case var1 of
  1 : writeln('var1 is 1!');
  2 : Begin
    writeln('var1 is 2!');
    (*More code*)
  End;
  Else writeln('var1 is neither 1 nor 2!'); (*'else' can be used instead of the 'otherwise' keyword*)
end;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Loops==
===For===
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
For var1 := 0 to 12 do  (*For conditional with only one statement:*)
  writeln('var1 is ', var1);

For var2 := 12 downto 0 do Begin  (*For conditional with multiple statements:*)
  writeln('var2 is ', var2);
  (*More code*)
End;
&lt;/source&gt;
===While===
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
While var1 = 0 do (*While the condition is True, perform the following code*)
  writeln('woo, an infinite loop!');

While var2 = 0 do Begin (*While-do with multiple statements:*)
  writeln('aww, no infinite loop!');
  var2 := 1;
End;
&lt;/source&gt;
===Repeat..Until===
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
Repeat (*Repeat the following until the condition is True:*)
  writeln('var1 might be 0!');
  (*More code - Begin..End is not required between Repeat..Until*)
  (*Semicolon needed before the 'Until' keyword*)
Until var1 = 0;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Epidemiology==
*Represent 35% of bone sarcomas.
*Primary distribution in adolescents 
*When it occurs in older patients, usually associated with pre-existing condition such as [[w:Paget's_disease_of_bone|Paget's disease]], prior irradiation of bones, multiple hereditary exostosis, or polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
*Hereditary risk factors: 
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Retinoblastoma|Hereditary Retinoblastoma]] (Rb mutated in ~50% osteosarcomas)
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Li-Fraumeni|Li-Fraumeni syndrome]] (p53 mutated in 20-30%)
**Rothmund-Thomson syndrome
*Distribution:
**Distal femur/knee joint ~50%
**Proximal humerus ~25%
**Long tubular bones ~80-90%
**Hands/feet &lt;1%
*Lab findings generally not helpful, though serum alkaline phosphatase elevated in ~50%
*Clinical presentation: 
**Night pain
**Typically no effusion in the adjacent joint
**Pathologic fractures rare
*Metastatic disease: 
**Approximately 15-20% at diagnosis
**Overwhelmingly in the lung

==Histology==
*90% of osteosarcomas are ''conventional osteosarcomas''; these are intramedullary high grade tumors.  Subtypes include:
**osteoblastic
**chondroblastic
**fibroblastic
*10% include osteosarcoma of the jaw, surface osteosarcomas (paraosteal and periosteal)
*Radiation-induced osteosarcomas may be a linear function of radiation dose and alkylating agents. Risk for most childhood survivors &lt;1%, but higher with genetic predisposition (Retinoblastoma 7%, Ewings' 5%, other bone tumors 2%)

==Radiologic Findings==
*Classic appearance on plain x-ray is ''sunburst pattern'' which is a mixed lytic sclerotic pattern (vs &quot;onion skinning&quot; in Ewing's sarcoma)
**Increased intramedullary density due to tumor bone or calcified cartilage
**Area of radiolucency due to nonossified tumor
**Cortical destruction
**Extraosseous elevation (Codman's triangle) when tumor lifts the periostium leading to a rim of subperiosteal bone.

==Staging==
*Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bone/Staging|bone staging]] page

==Treatment==
*Biopsy should be performed by an orthopedic surgeon who will ultimately perform the resection
*Treatment is surgical resection, preferentially limb-sparing surgery (distal femur/proximal tibia, shoulder girdle/proximal humerus)
**Surgery alone historically leads to overall survival of &lt;20%.
*Adjuvant chemotherapy plays a key role in preventing distant mets; 4-agent regimens are favored
**Randomized trial by POG showed no difference between neoadjuvant chemotherapy -&gt; surgery -&gt; adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery -&gt; adjuvant chemotherapy; 5-year ERS was ~60%
*Adjuvant RT (including whole lung irradiation) does not appear to benefit survival 
**Prior to advent of effective chemo, whole lung xrt was often administered b/c of high rate of pulmonary failure.  Data is unclear as to whether there was any benefit to this practice
**Role for RT is mostly limited to life-threatening presentations where adequate surgical removal is unlikely, such as H&amp;N, spine, or pelvis
*Pelvic tumors are typically unresectable, and are treated with RT and chemotherapy
*For metastatic disease, aggressive course is typically advocated, consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by maximal resection of primary and mets, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy


===Primary Radiotherapy===
*'''Blokhin Cancer Center, Russia; 2003''' PMID 12583525 &quot;Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and local radiotherapy for high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremities,&quot; Mayo Clin Proc 2003; 78(2):147-55. 
**31 pts who refused surgery and underwent induction chemo + conventional xrt (median 60 Gy)
**Local control 56%, OS 61%
**Of pts who had local control, 86% had excellent limb function

*'''UC San Francisco; 1976''' PMID 1064887 &quot;The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma,&quot; Radiology. 1976; 120(1):163-5.
**70 pts w/ osteosarcoma receiving either primary xrt or surgery b/w 1950-74
**Conclusion:  xrt w/o chemo did not add palliative effect or improve OS in operative pt.


===Post-operative Radiation===
*'''Harvard; 2005''' (1980-2002) PMID 15667972 &quot;Radiotherapy for local control of osteosarcoma&quot; DeLaney TF, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005; 61(2):492-8.)
**Retrospective. 41 patients with osteosarcoma (head/face 41%, extremity 20%, spine 20%, pelvis 17%). 5 were radiation-induced. Median age 29. GTR 66%, STR 22%, biopsy 12%. If GTR, received RT for close or +margins. Median 66 Gy delivered (If gross disease &gt;=68 Gy; if SM+ 60-68 Gy, if close SM 55-60 Gy, if radiation-induced sarcoma 10-30 Gy). Some patients pre-op 20 Gy followed by post-op RT. Chemo 85%
**Outcome: 5-year LC 68%; GTR 78% vs. STR 78% vs. biopsy 22% (SS). 
**RT: No definitive dose response seen, but doses &gt;55 Gy w/ better local control (71% vs 54%)
**Conclusion: RT can help provide local control if widely negative margins not possible

===Whole Lung Irradiation===
*'''Peru; 1986''' PMID 3522504 &quot;Postoperative whole lung irradiation with or without adriamycin in osteogenic sarcoma,&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1986; 12(6):907-10.

=== Attention ===

Since I am the only one working on this project without any support from the community, I have decided to continue writing and improving the course on my website dedicated to learning languages. You can find the completed lesson 4 and improved other lessons at [http://www.learnlangs.com/RWP/Korean/ this new site]. There you will also soon find sound files for the words. I will not complete the course here and will retain the rights to further work I do on the course, so do not copy from my site. However, feel free to complete this course here on your own or use the same methodology for courses for other alphabets, as I have already suggested on the appropriate pages. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 20:05, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

:Hello, Junesun.  I hope your decision to stop working here is not set in stone.  Your work to date has been very helpful and this course would certainly improve more quickly with your help than without.  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 03:03, 13 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

== 9.1 Plant Structure and Growth ==

'''9.1.0 Outline the wide diversity in the plant kingdom as exemplified by the structural differences between bryophytes, filicinophytes, coniferophytes and angiospermophytes.'''

[This question does not feature in the AHL part but it is a part of core portion (Chapter 5 ecology and evolution 5.5.3)]

''Bryophytes'' (mosses and liverworts):
:*No roots, vascular system, or cuticle.
:*Rhizoids similar to root hairs.
:*Mosses with simple leaf-like structures.
:*Liverworts have flattened shape called a thallus.

''Filicinophytes'' (ferns):
:*Roots, leaves in fronds, and vascular system.
:*Cuticle on leaves.
:*Can form small trees but not woody.

''Coniferophytes'' (conifers):
:*Shrubs to very large trees.
:*Advanced vascular system.
:*Woody stems and roots.

''Angiospermophytes'' (flowering plants):
:*Highly variable in structure-tiny herbaceous to large trees
:*Roots, stems and leaves.
:*Advanced vascular system.
:*Can form woody tissue.


'''&lt;s&gt;13.1.2 Draw a diagram to show the external parts of a named dicotyledonous plant.&lt;/s&gt;'''

'''9.1.1 Draw and label plant diagrams to show the distribution of tissues in the stem and leaf of a dicotyledonous plant. 
[''Formerly 13.1.3 Draw plan diagrams to show distribution of tissues in the stem, root, and leaf of a generalized dicotyledonous plant.'']'''

'''9.1.2 Outline three differences between the structures of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants.'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ------ !! '''Dicotyledonous''' !! '''Monocotyledonous'''
|-
| '''Leaf Veins''' || Form a net-like pattern || Run parellel to each other
|-
| '''Vascular Bundles''' || In a ring near outside of stem || Spread through stem randomly
|-
| '''Stamens/Florals''' || In multiples of 4 or 5 || In multiples of 3
|-
| '''Roots''' || Branch off from other roots || Unbranched roots grow from stems
|}

'''9.1.3 Explain the relationship between the distribution of tissues in the leaves and the function of these tissues.
[''Formerly 13.1.4'']'''

:* Xylem: Bring water to replace losses due to transpiration, and inorganic minerals from the soil.
:* Phloem: Transports products of photosynthesis out of the leaf.
:* Stoma: A pore that allows CO2 for photosynthesis to diffuse in and O2 to diffuse out.
:* Guard Cells: this pair of cells can open or close the stoma and so control the amount of transpiration.
:* Upper Epidermis: a continuous layer of cells covered by a thick waxy cuticle. It prevents water loss from the upper surface even when heated by sunlight. 
:* Lower Epidermis: is in a cooler position and has a thinner waxy cuticle.
:* Spongy mesophyll: consists of loosely packed rounded cells with few chloroplasts. This tissue provides the main gas exchange surface so must be near the stomata in the lower epidermis.
:* Palisade mesophyll: consists of densely packed cylindrical cells with many chloroplasts. This is the main photosynthetic tissue and is positions near the upper surface where the light intensity is highest.

'''9.1.4 Identify modifications of roots, stems and leaves for different functions: bulbs, stem tubers, storage roots, and tendrils.'''

:* Bulb = stem modification consisting of enlarged bases of leaves; aids in food storage (e.g. onion)
:* Stem tuber = horizontally growing stem; aids in carbohydrate and starch storage (e.g. potato)
:* Storage root = specialized root for storing large volumes of carbohydrates and water (e.g. carrots)
:* Tendrils = leaf modification to aid in support and climbing; able to coil around objects during growth through a thigmotropic response (e.g. morning glory tendril)

'''9.1.5. State that dicotyledonous plant have apical and lateral meristems.'''
:* '''Meristem''': a plant's region where cells continue to divide and grow, often throughout it's life.

'''9.1.6 Compare growth due to apical and lateral meristems in dicotyledonous plants.'''

:* '''Apical meristem''' exists at the root and shoot tip, and is involved in plant elongation. 
:* '''Lateral meristem''' exists in cambium tissue. Growth in lateral meristem increases the thickness of the plant. 

'''9.1.7 Explain the role of auxin in phototropism as an example of the control of plant growth.'''

:* Auxin is a hormone that promotes elongation of cells in the stem. Auxin is synthesized by the tip of the stem, and is carried to the part of stem which receives less light. This will cause the elongation of that side, thus bending towards the bright side.

'''13.1.5 Outline four adaptations of xerophytes.'''

:* spines instead of leaves - reduce rate of transpiration
:* thick stems - contain high amounts of water storage tissue
:* thick waxy cuticle
:* vertical stems - absorbs sunlight late and early in the day but not midday when sun is too intense
:* wide branching and shallow root systems - absorb water closer to the surface that would be otherwise evaporated before reaching roots

'''13.1.6 Outline two structural adaptations of hydrophytes.'''

:* Air spaces in leaves - create buoyancy
:* Small amounts of xylem in stem and leaf
:* Stomata in upper epidermis
:* Waxy cuticle on upper surface of leaves

== 13.2 Transport in Angiospermophytes ==

'''9.2.1. Outline how the root system provides a large surface area for mineral ion and water uptake by means of branching and root hairs.
[''Formerly 13.2.1 Explain how root systems provide a large surface area for mineral ion and water uptake by means of branching, root hairs, and cortex cell walls.'']'''

Root hairs provide a large surface area for mineral ion and water uptake.  Cortex cells absorb ions that are dissolved in water, drawn in by capillary action through cortex cell walls.  Branching increases quantity and area roots can absorb ions from.

'''9.2.2 List ways in which mineral ions in the soil move to the root.
[''Formerly 13.2.2 Describe the process of mineral ion uptake into roots by active transport.'']'''

Plants absorb potassium, phosphate, nitrates, and other mineral ions from the soil.  Active transport pump ions into the roots.  Root hairs provide large surface area for ion uptake.

'''13.2.3 Explain the process of water uptake by root epidermis cells and its movement through symplastic and apoplastic pathways across the root to the xylem.'''

The cytoplasm of root cells usually have much higher total solute concentrations than water in the surrounding soil.  Thus, water diffuses into root cells by osmosis.  Water must cross the cortex of the root to enter the xylem via the symplastic and apoplastic routes.

:* '''Symplastic route''' - water moves from cell to cell by entering the cytoplasm and going through plasmodesmata(cytoplasmic connections)

:* '''Apoplastic route''' - water moves by capillary action through cortex cell walls until it reaches the endodermis. 90 % of water moves through the route this way.

'''13.2.4 State that terrestrial plants support themselves by means of thickened cellulose, cell turgor, and xylem.'''

'''13.2.5 Define transpiration'''

'''Transpiration''' - loss of water vapor from the leaves and stems of plants

'''13.2.6 Explain how water is carried by transpiration stream, including the structure of xylem vessels, transpiration pull, cohesion, and evaporation.'''

Transpiration causes a flow of water from roots to stem and leaves.  This movement is called transpiration stream.

:# Evaporation of water from spongy mesophyll cell walls of leaves
:# Evaporated water is replaced from xylem, pulled out of the xylem through mesophyll pores by capillary action
:# Low pressure is created inside xylem vessels when water is pulled out (transpiration pull).  Xylem vessels contain long, unbroken columns of water where the pressure is transmitted across.
:# To equalize the pressure, water travels up the vessels through its property of cohesion

'''13.2.7 State that guard cells open and close stomata to regulate transpiration.'''

'''13.2.8 Explain how abiotic factors affect the rate of transpiration in a typical terrestrial mesophyllic plant.'''

:* '''Light''' - The intensity of light increases or decreases the rate of evaporation of water from the top of leaves, causing an increase or decrease in the rate of transpiration.
:* '''Temperature''' - High temperatures increase the rate of evaporation of water from the top of leaves, resulting in an increase in the rate of transpiration.  Conversely, low temperatures decrease the rate of evaporation of water from the top of leaves, resulting in a decrease in the rate of transpiration.
:* '''Wind''' - High wind also increases evaporation by allowing more air molecules to collide with the water molecules on leaves, resulting in an increase in evaporation of water and transpiration.  Low wind results in more stagnant, saturated air around the stomata which decreases evaporation and transpiration.
:* '''Humidity''' - High humidity decreases the rate of evaporation and transpiration of a plant.

'''13.2.9 Outline the role of phloem in active translocation of biochemicals.'''

Phloem have sieve tubes that transport organic compounds.  Column cells develop into sieve tubes by breaking down nuclei and cytoplasm, making large pores in their end walls to allow a flow of sap.  The plasma membrane pump organic compounds into sieve tubes using ATP.  This creates a high concentration of solute causing water to diffuse in, resulting in a positive pressure gradient allowing organic compounds to be pumped anywhere in the plant.

'''13.2.10 Describe an example of food storage in a plant.'''

Potato Tuber
:* Leaves produce food by photosynthesis
:* Phloem in stems transport food to storage organs
:* Tuber grows and stores food

== 13.3 Reproduction in Flowering Plants ==

'''13.3.1 Draw the structure of a dicotledonous animal pollinated flower, as seen by the naked hand eye and hands lens.'''

'''13.3.2 Define pollination'''

'''Pollination''' - the transfer of pollen from anther to stigma

'''13.3.3 Distinguish between pollination, fertilization, and seed dispersal.'''

:* '''Pollination''' - transfer of pollen from anther to stigma
:* '''Fertilization''' - fusion of male and female gametes in the ovum
:* '''Seed dispersa'''l - the spreading out of seeds (fertilised ovules), contained within fruits (which develop from ovaries), by various means.

'''13.3.4 Draw the external and internal structure of a named dicotyledonous seed.'''

'''13.3.5 Describe the metabolic events in the germination in a typical starchy seed.'''
:# Absorption of water rehydrates living cells in seed
:# Plant growth hormone gibberellin produced
:# Stimulates production of amylase, catalyzing the digestion of starch to maltose
:# Maltose is transported to growth regions of seedling
:# Maltose converted to glucose
:## Used in cellular respiration until leaves can start photosynthesis above ground
:## Used to synthesize cellulose of other substances for growth

'''13.3.6 Explain the conditions needed for the germination of a typical seed.'''
:* '''Abundance of water''' - rehydrates dry tissue
:* '''Oxygen''' - aerobic cellular respiration before photosynthesis can occur
:* '''Suitable temperatures''' - Germination involves enzymatic activity in digestion of starch and cellulose synthesis. If temperatures :*fall outside of temperature ranges for these enzymes, germination does not occur. This causes seasonal germination in many places.
:*Seeds vary in their light requirements and,therefore, this factor need not be included

== Regarding any merge suggestions ==

Please note that this textbook is aimed at a very advanced undergraduate level of mechanics. The materials covered in this book (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, among many) are at least at the level of 4th year physics major in U.S. institutions and possibly graduate level (I haven't looked through thoroughly, but the Goldstein textbook is the classic graduate level textbook on this topic). 

Please do not suggest merge to another book aimed at either high school students or first year college students (i.e. handling only Newtonian mechanics). While there are some overlaps, these two are as different as differential calculus is from a course on partial differential equations. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 11:27, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

I apologize for the tone above: I looked over [[Mechanics]] module, to which merge was suggested, and it does not seem as low-level as it appeared at first. But I still think the merge was inappropriate. As noted on the [[Modern Physics]] project page, the textbook is meant for first three semesters of college. I notice that the [[Mechanics]] module mentions Lagrangian mechanics, but it cannot possibly cover it in any depth (Poisson brackets? Connections to quantum mechanics?) and still maintain its goal of being an introductory text. Note, this textbook is *not* an introduction to classical mechanics. This is *in depth* classical mechanics---students were supposed to have at least seen Newtonian mechanics for nearly half a semester and maybe even a semester of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (if this is meant to be a graduate level textbook).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Topic 12: Excretion===

====Excretion====
----

'''Outline the need for excretion in all living organisms.'''
:* The idea behind excretion holds true for all living organisms. If excess toxins, salts, and water builds up it may cause serious bodily harm to that organism. The kidneys make sure that this doesn’t happen and allow for normal bodily functions to continue. If not for this system the organism may also end up needing to spend excessive amounts of energy to filter out the toxins that could kill it.

'''State that excretory products in plants include oxygen and carbon dioxide, and in animals, they include carbon dioxide from respiration, and nitrogenous compounds.'''

Excretory products in plants include oxygen, and in animals they include nitrogenous compounds and carbon dioxide.

'''Discuss the relationship between the different nitrogenous waste products and habitat in mammals, birds, and reptiles'''
:* Any metabolism involving proteins and nucleic acids produces a nitrogen containing waste with the main waste product being Ammonia. The direct excretion of Ammonia, in one form or another, is the most biologically efficient way of disposing of waste. In fish ammonia can simply be excreted purely as it is extremely water soluble. Fishes mainly lose Ammonia through the epithelium of their gills as NH4+. Fresh water fishes also take up sodium as an exchange for the Ammonia. Animals, however, can not excrete pure Ammonia since it is too toxic to be excreted without first being diluted and terrestrial animals can’t dispose of it quickly enough. Thus mammals excrete urea, a product which is much less toxic than Ammonia and requires less water to be excreted which is important to terrestrial creatures where water is more scarce. Finally birds excrete Uric Acid as their form of Ammonia removal. It is much less soluble in water than Ammonia is, thus leaving much more water for the bird which is needed during long migration patterns. Uric acid can also precipitate, allowing for shelled offspring who are permeable to gas but not permeable to liquid, as Ammonia or Urea would be.

====The Human Kidney====
----
'''11.3.1 - Define Excretion'''
:* Excretion is the removal of waste products of metabolic pathways from the body

'''11.3.2 - Draw (and label) the structure of the kidney'''
:* Things to include - Cortex, Medula, Ureter, Renal Blood Vessels, and Pelvis

'''11.3.3 - Draw the structure of the glomerulus and associated nephron to show the function of each part'''
:*

'''11.3.4 - Explain the process of ultra-filtration'''
:* Blood pressure forces fluid from the capillaries of the Glomerulus across the Epithelium of the Bowman’s Capsule, and into the lumen of Nephron tubule. The porous capillaries act as a filter as they have membranes which are permeable to water and small solutes but not to blood cells or larger molecules. The efferent arteriole reabsorbs amino acids, glucose, water, and salts and NH2, excess water, and sodium chloride descend into the loop of Henle. There more water and sodium is absorbed and tubular excretion begins in distal convoluted tube. Large molecules which weren’t absorbed enter for excretion and the collecting duct takes it to the renal pyramid.
:* 15-20% of blood plasma is filtered into glomerulus, that exit through fenestrated blood capillaries (porous).  The basement membrane is a protein layer between the glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule that prevents blood cells and large proteins from entering the Bowman's Capsule. 

'''11.3.5 - Define osmoregulation'''

:*Osmoregulation - the control of water and solute levels

'''11.3.6 - Explain the reabsorption of glucose, water, and salts in the proximal convoluted tube'''
:* In the Proximal Convoluted Tubule there is selective re-absorption of water and salt, depending on how dehydrated the body is. In the presence of ADH, much more water is reabsorbed than when ADH isn’t present. Microvilli also helps to expand surface area to allow for more absorption. Filtration, on the other hand, is not selective at all as it is important that essential nutrients return to the body so sugar, vitamins, and other organic nutrients are reabsorbed into the filtrate. Some are actively transported (glucose, amino acids, sodium ions) and some are passively transported (H2O, potassium ions, chloride ions).

'''11.3.7 - Explain the roles of the Loop of Henle, medulla, collecting duct and ADH in maintaining the water balance of the blood'''
:* Water leaves the Nephron via Osmosis while in the descending limb of the Henle’s loop due to the increasing salt concentration of the medulla in the kidney. Blood will pass into the capillaries where it is removed and salt will diffuse into the filtrate. The ascending limb is impermeable to water, allowing various salts to leave. Fluid that leaves the loop is less concentrated than the tissue around it, and blood entering the medulla will lose water due to osmosis and pick up salt and urea through diffusion. The exact opposite happens in the ascending capillary. When a lack of water is detected in the kidney, ADH is released by the pituitary gland which increases permeability of the walls in the distal convoluted tube and the collecting duct. When ADH isn’t present, walls are impermeable and water is used to dilute urine.

'''Compare the composition of blood in the renal artery and renal vein, and compare the composition of the glomerular filtrate and urine'''
:* Renal Artery – Large molecules, More Toxins, Oxygenated, More Salt/Ions, More H2O, Less CO2, More Nutrients, Supplies Kidneys with O2
:* Renal Vein - Less Toxins, Deoxygenated, Less Salt, Less H2O, More CO2, Less Nutrients, Returns blood from Kidneys to heart, blood contains no wastes, with less O2, urea, salt/ions, and more CO2
:* Glomerular Filtrate: Small molecules, Amino acids, glucose, Na+ Cl, NH2, Urea, Nutrient excess, Nitrogenous waste, H+, H20, hormones, vitamins
:* Urine: Wastes: Urea, Na+, Cl, NH2, H2O, large molecules

'''Outline the structure and action of kidney dialysis machines'''
:* Blood enters machine from patient’s vein and runs through partially permeable tubules and into the dialysis chamber. The tube allows nitrogenous waste to diffuse from the blood and into the dialysis fluid. Urea diffuses through the membrane, as dialysis fluid contains none, removing it from the body. Water and solutes will then be added to the blood if necessary by diffusion from the dialysis fluid which runs across the semipermeable tubules containing the circulating blood.  The blood is then run through an air bubble trap before it is reintroduced to the vein.

===Cellular Respiration===
----

'''State that oxidation involves the loss of electrons from an element, whereas reduction involves a gain in electrons, and that oxidation frequently involves gaining oxygen or losing hydrogen, whereas reduction involves loss of oxygen or gain in hydrogen.'''

 Oxidation is loss. Reduction is gain. To remember this, there is the acronym OILRIG.
You can also think &quot;LEO the lion says GER&quot; (Lose Electrons: Oxidation; Gain Electrons: Reduction)

'''Outline the process of glycolysis including phosphorylation, lysis, oxidation, and ATP formation.'''

Glycolysis is a ten-step process:

1. Glucose is phosphorylated into glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase, turning one ATP into ADP in the process.

2. Glucose-6-phosphate is transformed into fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucoisomerase.

3. Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by phosphofructokinase, turning one ATP into ADP in the process.

4. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is lysed by aldolase into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAl).

5. Isomerase promptly transforms DHAP into a second molecule of PGAl.

6. Two molecules of PGAl are oxidized by 2 molecules of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, creating 2 NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The redox reaction provides the energy for triose phosphate dehydrogenase to attach a phosphate group to each PGAl, yielding two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG).

7. Two molecules of BPG are used to phosphorylate two molecules of ADP with the help of phosphoglycerokinase (substrate-level phosphorylation), yielding 2 ATP and two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate.

8. Two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate have their phosphate group relocated by phosphoglyceromutase, yielding two molecules of 2-phosphoglycerate.

9. Two molecules of 2-phosphoglycerate are transformed by enolase into two molecules of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through the removal of water.

10. Two molecules of PEP are used to phosphorylate two molecules of ADP with the help of pyruvate kinase, yielding 2 ATP and two molecules of pyruvate.

Glycolysis has a net yield of 2 ATP (4 produced minus 2 consumed), 2 NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and two pyrvuate molecules per glucose.

'''Draw the structure of the mitochondrion as seen in electron micrographs.'''

'''Explain aerobic respiration including oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the Krebs cycle, NADH + H+, the electron transport chain, and the role of oxygen.'''

Aerobic respiration strictly refers to the steps of cellular respiration known as the Krebs cycle, electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. These steps normally occur in eukaryotic cells after glycolysis has been carried out. The 3-carbon end products of glycolysis, pyruvate, are the starting points for aerobic respiration. Pyruvate first has its carboxyl group removed, creating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas as a waste product. Next, it is oxidized by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming acetate (a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compound) and NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The acetate is attached to coenzyme A to form the complex acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA enters the mitochondrial matrix and is fed into the Krebs cycle.

In the first step of the Krebs cycle, Acetyl CoA gives its acetate away to combine with oxaloacetate, a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound left over from the last cycle, to form citrate, a C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound. Coenzyme A exits the cycle to be recycled for further use. Citrate is converted to isocitrate, which then loses a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is then oxidized, reducing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and forming α-ketoglutarate (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). This in turn loses another CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is oxidized, reducing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and then the remaining molecule is attached to Coenzyme A to form succinyl CoA. Succinyl CoA is then used to phosphorylate a GDP to GTP. The GTP then phosphorylates an ADP to ATP. The remaining C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound, succinate, is oxidized yet again, this time reducing FAD to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and with the addition of water, forms malate. Malate is oxidized one last time, reducing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and forming oxaloacetate, the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound that started off the cycle. The Krebs cycle in total yields 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 ATP, 3 NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per pyruvate. The NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; go on to participate in the electron transport chain.

The electron transport chain takes place in multiprotein complexes imbedded within the phospholipid bilayers of mitochondria's inner membranes. In the electron transport chain, NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is oxidized back to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, giving two electrons to a flavoprotein, the first molecule in the complex. The flavoprotein then passes the electrons to ubiquinone (Q), which carry them to the first of many proteins in the cytochrome family that make up the rest of the electron transport chain. FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; actually gives its two electrons to Q (via an iron-sulfur protein), not the flavoprotein. The last step in the electron transport chain is when cytochrome a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives the electrons to oxygen. Oxygen, then, is the final acceptor of electrons in the chain, and once it is reduced, it quickly picks up two hydrogen ions and forms water, a waste product of aerobic respiration. At three points along the electron transport chain, the protein complexes use the energy provided by the electrons (via redox reactions) to pump H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. One of these points is the flavoprotein, before the electrons are handed off to Q. Therefore, for every NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that is oxidized, 3 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are pumped across the membrane, and for every FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is oxidized, only 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are pumped across.

The final stage of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which is made possible by the electron transport chain. All of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions pumped into the intermembrane space create a concentration and charge gradient across the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions want to diffuse back into the matrix. Through chemiosmosis, the diffusion of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; back into the matrix through specialized channel proteins provide the energy for ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. For every H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that diffuses back into the matrix, one ADP is phosphorylated to ATP.

'''Explain oxidative phosphorylation in terms of chemiosmosis.'''

Electrons are given to proton pumps that are embedded in the membrane between the matrix and inner membrane/cristae of the mitochondrion.  The pumps are reduced, giving them energy to pump protons into the inner membrane space.  The electrons are transferred along a chain of pumps, continuously losing energy.  The proton pumps create a high concentration gradient of protons (H+)inside the inter membrane space. Thus, protons diffuse back into the matrix through facilitated diffusion of ATP synthase (channel protein and enzyme).  As the protons pass along this protein channel, the kinetic energy of the protons causes the ATP synthase molecule to turn slightly, exposing active sites that create ATP by binding ADP with inorganic phosphate molecules.  The result is 36 ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation. 

'''Explain the relationship between the structure of mitochondrion and its function.'''

Mitochondrion have a large inner matrix, allowing for the Krebs cycle to occur.  After the Krebs Cycle is complete, the mitochondria has a fairly small inner membrane space where protons are pumped into.  Due to its size, diffusion of protons back into the matrix occurs quickly, resulting in ATP produced at a faster rate.  The inner membrane contains many electron transport chains of proton pumps and ATP synthase enzymes, allowing for much ATP to be produced.  The membranes are also structured to prevent the protons from diffusing though the membrane, forcing them to enter the matrix only through ATP synthase molecules.

'''Describe the central role of acetyl CoA in carbohydrate and fat metabolism.'''

Both carbohydrate and fat metabolism is accomplished by splitting the molecules into 2 carbon structures.  These structures are then attached to Coenzyme A, creating Acetyl CoA and allowing the molecules to pass into the inner matrix of the mitochondrion in order to complete the Krebs Cycle and chemiosmosis.

===Photosynthesis===
----

'''Draw the structure of a chloroplast as seen in electron micrographs'''

Chloroplast - 5 picometers

'''State that photosynthesis consists of light-dependent and light-independent reactions.'''

Light strikes on an antenna pigment in a thylakoid within a chloroplast in Photosystem 2.  The chlorophyll pigments in the thylakoid absorb light energy, raising electrons to a higher energy level.  The energy is passed along antenna pigments until it reaches a P680 molecule.  The energy excites an electron on the P680 molecule which is transferred to the reaction center and electron transport chain.  To replace the lost electron, an electron is taken from the photolysis of water, creating O2 as a byproduct.  As the electron passes along the chain, it gives energy to the protein pumps, causing the pumps to force protons into the confined thylakoid space.  These protons then diffuse out of the thylakoid through ATP synthase proton channels, producing ATP.  The lower energy electron can be recycled through Photosystem 2 by receiving light energy from Photosystem 1.  The electron is re-energized from light attained in Photosystem 1 and passes that energy to a P700 chlorophyll molecule, which passes an energized electron to another electron transport chain.  However, instead of using the energy from the electron to pump protons, it can use the energy and enzymatic activity to combine 2 electrons with NADP to create NADPH + H+.  If the plant needs more ATP, however, the electron from Photosystem 1 can return to Photosystem 2 to be used in phosphorylation.  This process is known as cyclical photophosphorylation.

'''Explain photophosphorylation in terms of chemiosmosis.'''

The process of photophosphorylation takes light energy and converts it to chemical energy in phosphate bonds of ATP molecules.  Light strikes on an antenna pigment in a thylakoid within a chloroplast in Photosystem 2.  The chlorophyll pigments in the thylakoid absorb light energy, raising electrons to a higher energy level.  The energy is passed along antenna pigments until it reaches a P680 molecule.  The energy excites an electron on the P680 molecule which is transferred to the reaction center and electron transport chain.  To replace the lost electron, an electron is taken from the photolysis of water, creating O2 as a byproduct.  As the electron passes along the chain, it gives energy to the protein pumps, causing the pumps to force protons into the confined thylakoid space.  These protons then diffuse out of the thylakoid through ATP synthase proton channels, producing ATP. 

'''Explain the light-independent reaction.'''

The light-independent reaction of photosynthesis occurs in the Calvin cycle, and utilizes the ATP and electron carriers produced in the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to sugars.  3 carbon dioxide molecules obtained from the surrounding atmosphere is combined with 3 Ribulos bisphosphate (RuBP)(C5) with the Rubisco enzyme to create Phosphoglycerate (P-C-C-C-P) (PGal). 1 ATP molecule is used, one electron carrier is oxidized (NADPH + H+ -&gt; NADP+), and an inorganic phosphate molecule is added to the molecule, resulting in 6 Triosphosphate (G3P).  1 G3P is stored while the others are converted back into RuBP using another ATP molecule so that it may be recycled. 

'''Explain the relationship between the structure of the chloroplast and its function.'''

The chloroplast contains thylakoids which have photosynthetic pigments embedded in the thylakoid membrane in clusters that absorb light and convert it into chemical energy.  Chloroplasts have a large space in the stroma and a small space inside the thylakoid which helps in ATP synthesis.  The thylakoid provides a confined space where protons may be pumped into and are forced to diffuse through ATP synthase channel proteins, creating ATP at a faster rate.  The thylakoids are pushed tightly together, meaning that light striking the chloroplasts will cause several light-dependent reactions to occur simultaneously, increasing energy and ultimately, sugars produced.

'''Draw the action spectrum of photosynthesis.'''

'''Explain the relationship between the action spectrum and the absorption spectrum of photosynthetic pigments in green plants.'''

The visible light spectrum (400-700 nanometers) is used by plants in photosynthesis.  If a plant is green, then it reflects green wavelengths of light and absorbs red, orange, some yellow, blue, indigo, and violet wavelengths of light.  This means that the absorption spectrum of photosynthetic pigments in green plants is high for low and high wavelengths of light, but not for middle wavelengths of light (green), which are reflected by the photosynthetic pigments and are not absorbed.

'''Explain the concept of limiting factors with reference to light intensity, temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide.'''

As light intensity, temperature, and concentration of carbon dioxide increase, so does the rate of photosynthesis.  However, there are limits on this seemingly linear relationship.  If temperature becomes too high, the rate of photosynthesis slows as the enzymes utilized in sugar production become denatured.  There is also a limit on the effects of increasing light intensity and carbon dioxide, because the plant can only create a certain amount of sugar at any one time, meaning there is not an infinite supply of protein pumps, enzymes, and thylakoids to undergo photosynthesis for high levels of carbon dioxide and light.

Key Points:

:*Photosynthesis increases as light increases
:*Photosynthesis reaches a plateau after a specific light intensity
:*Photosynthesis increases as temperature increases
:*There is an optimal temperature
:*Too high of temperature denatures/melts the chloroplasts and slows photosynthesis
:*Photosynthesis increase as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases
:*There is a maximum rate of photosynthesis in response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; []

'''Describe three methods used to measure the rate of photosynthesis.'''

:*Measure the Rate of Oxygen Production
::*because oxygen is a product of photosynthesis, one can measure the rate of photosynthesis through measuring oxygen by means of:
::*count the bubbles released under water
::*Measure the volume of oxygen produced released into a graduated cylinder
:*Measure the rate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake
::*because carbon dioxide is a reactant, the amount used over a given period of time will indicate the amount of photosynthetic activity occurring
::*to do so, use a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; probe which detects the current CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and calculate the difference
:*Measure the change in biomass

==Nerves==

'''Outline the general organization of the human nervous system including the CNS and the PNS'''
:* The brain, or central nervous system (CNS), is connected by the spinal cord to the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
:* The peripheral nervous system is divided into two categories:
::* Sensory input (afferent division) - senses external and internal environmental conditions.
::* Motor output (efferent division): Self explanatory. 
:::* Somatic nervous system - conscious, '''controlled response'''
:::* Autonomic nervous system - functions automatically. 
::::* Parasympathetic division - '''relaxed''' state.
::::* Sympathetic division - '''excited''' state.

The nervous system is divided into two main parts: the '''central nervous system''' (CNS), and the '''peripheral nervous system''' (PNS). The organs of the CNS, the brain and the spinal cord, are located within and protected by, respectively, the skull and the vertebral column. The PNS is composed of nerves that branch from the CNS and '''connect the CNS to the rest of the body'''. The CNS '''receives impulses from the nerves of the PNS and interprets them''', and transmits the corresponding signals back to the origin through the PNS, thus controlling the functions of the entire body. 

'''Draw the structure of a motor neuron'''

'''Define resting potential and action potential&quot;

Resting potential is the '''membrane potential energy of a neuron membrane when not conducting an impulse'''. The charge of a membrane during resting potential is '''-70 mV''', which means that the charge within the cell membrane is relatively negative to the outside charge. 

Action potential is the state of the cell membrane '''while conducting an impulse''', meaning the rapid depolarization and repolarization of the cell membrane. The charge on the membrane typically reaches up to +40 mV, meaning the i'''nside of the cell is positively charged relative to the outside.
'''


'''Explain how a nerve impulse passes along a non-myelinated neuron (axon).'''

In resting neurons, there exists an '''imbalance of ions inside and outside of the cell membranes'''. The important ions are K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ('''potassium''') and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ('''sodium'''). K+ is more concentrated inside the cell and therefore tends to diffuse out of the cell. It is this diffusion that '''causes the charge potential across the plasma membrane''' (in resting neurons it is about -70 mV). Na+ is more concentrated outside of the cell and thus tends to diffuse into the cell, but at a very slow rate due to the low permeability of the plasma membrane to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. '''Sodium-potassium pumps embedded in the plasma membrane work against both ions' diffusion gradients in order to preserve the gradients and the membrane potential'''.
 
When a graded nerve impulse traveling from a dendrite reaches '''threshold potential''' (usually about '''15 to 20 mV''' more positive than resting potential) and comes to the axon hillock, it '''triggers an action potential'''. Action potentials are non-graded events, '''meaning the amplitude of the potential remains more or less constant''' in all situations. When threshold potential is reached, v'''oltage-gated sodium and potassium channels at the axon hillock are stimulated'''. The sodium channels each have two gates, a fast-acting activation gate and a slow-acting inactivation gate. Normally the '''activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open'''. However, since it takes BOTH gates to be open for Na+ to freely move through the channel, normally these sodium channels are closed. The potassium channels have only one gate, which is slow acting and is normally closed. The voltage stimulus from the threshold potential cause''' all gates to reverse their position; if they were closed, they open, and if they were open, they close'''. The fast-acting sodium activation gates are the first to respond, opening and  allowing Na+ to diffuse freely into the neuron. This large, rapid influx of Na+ causes the charge potential across the plasma membrane to become positive. This is called '''depolarization'''. Most neurons will depolarize up to +40 mV, and it is this depolarization that '''leads to the action potential, or nerve impulse'''. By the time the voltage peaks, sufficient time has passed for the inactivation gates to close, preventing further Na+ from entering the cell. At the same time, the potassium gates finally open, which cause K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to rapidly diffuse out of the neuron along the charge gradient, increasing its negativity. This is the '''repolarization''' phase. The channel gates eventually return to their resting positions, but the slow-acting potassium gates take longer to close, which cause an excess of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to diffuse out of the cell, resulting in a temporary '''hyperpolarization''', or undershoot ('''membrane potential drops below resting potential'''). For a brief period following repolarization, both the sodium activation and inactivation gates remain closed, since the inactivation gates are slow-acting and take time to return to their open resting position. During this time, called the '''refractory period''', this particular region of the neuron is incapable of depolarization. Once the sodium inactivation gates are open again, the region will again be able to depolarize.

As the axon hillock of the neuron depolarizes, it stimulates the next region of the axon to depolarize since the membrane potential goes beyond threshold potential during depolarization to the action potential. In this manner, action potentials are triggered repeatedly, each time in successive regions further and further down the axon. Action potentials only travel in one direction; this is achieved through the effects of the refractory period. The regions immediately behind the location of an action potential cannot be stimulated to depolarize because they themselves have just recently depolarized and repolarized and cannot do so again until the refractory period has passed.



'''Explain the principles of synaptic transmission.'''

Synapses are the '''locations where a neuron communicates with either another neuron or another type of cell''', such as a muscle cell. The cell from which the nerve signal originates is the '''presynaptic cell''' and the cell receiving the signal is the '''postsynaptic cell'''. There are two types of synapses, electrical and chemical. Electrical synapses '''contain gap junctions''' that link the two cells and '''allow action potentials to travel between the two cells uninterrupted'''. Much more common are chemical synapses, which contain a '''narrow gap, called the synaptic cleft,''' separating the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. Action potentials cannot directly jump the gap, and instead the cells must rely on chemical signals to propagate the nerve impulse.

As an action potential reaches the end of an axon and the synaptic terminal, it '''depolarizes the presynaptic membrane'''. Here, voltage-gated calcium channels open and allow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to diffuse into the neuron. The sudden increase in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration causes '''synaptic vessels, filled with neurotransmitters, to fuse with the plasma membrane and release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft'''. Neurotransmitters can be any number of chemicals, including acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. These chemicals, once released, quickly diffuse across the synaptic cleft and reach the postsynaptic membrane. On the postsynaptic membrane are numerous specialized receptor proteins, which bind to specific neurotransmitters and open specific ion channels. Depending on the neurotransmitter that was received, ion channels may open up to let Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, or other ions to diffuse in or out of the cell. Depending on which channels were opened, the postsynaptic membrane will either depolarize or hyperpolarize. Depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane is called an '''excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)''', and hyperpolarization is called an '''inhibitory postsynaptic potential''' (IPSP). EPSPs make it easier for the postsynaptic cell to generate an action potential while IPSPs make it harder. The effects of EPSPs and IPSPs are cumulative, meaning that the effects of multiple EPSPs, IPSPs, or a combination of the two, will stack, a phenomenon known as summation. Summations can either be spatial, meaning the potentials overlap spatially (e.g. they are close together on the neuron), temporal, meaning the potentials overlap in time (e.g. multiple potentials within a very short period of time), or both. Back at the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitters that were released quickly disappear, either by simple diffusion or by enzymatic breakdown, such as when cholinesterase breaks down ACh. If the cleft has not been cleaned by the time the next action potential reaches the synapse, the neurotransmitters released by the potential will not be able to bind to the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and the effects of the signal will not be propagated to the postsynaptic cell.

==Muscles and Movement==

'''Outline the great diversity of locomotion in the animal kingdom as exemplified by the movement in an earthworm, swimming in a bony fish, flying in a bird, and walking in an arthropod.'''

An earthworm slides forward by contracting and expanding alternate segments of its body.  A bony fish beat tail from side to side creating a forward motion.  It controls it buoyancy using an air bladder that grows or shrinks in size to force the fish up or down in the water.  A bird flaps its wings up and down to create an upward force.  Once the bird is in the air, it glides using air currents, occasionally flapping its wings to maintain its altitude.  Arthropods extend and flex muscle segments in it legs to move forward.

'''Describe the roles of nerves, muscles and bones in producing movement or locomotion.'''

Bones provide the frame that holds up muscles.  Signals are sent from the locomotion center of the brain (medulla) along nerves which synapse with certain muscles.  This synapse causes myosin and actin filaments to slide over each other, causing the muscle to contract and resulting in locomotion.

'''Draw a diagram of the human elbow joint.'''

'''Outline the functions of the main structures in the human elbow joint.'''

:* bicep - flexor muscle, used to bend arm at the elbow
:* humerus bone - provides firm anchor for muscles
:* triceps - extensor muscle, used to straighten the arm
:* synovial fluid - lubricates the joint to reduce friction
:* capsule - seals the joint
:* tendon - attaches muscle to bone
:* radius - upper bone in forearm, transmits forces from bicep through forearm
:* ulna - lower bone in forearm, transmits forces from triceps through the forearm
:* ligament - tough cords of tissue, links bone to bone, prevents dislocation of the joint
:* cartilage - a layer of smooth and tough tissue that covers the ends of the bone where bones meet to reduce friction

'''Draw the structure of skeletal muscle fibers as seen in an electron micrograph.'''

'''Explain how skeletal muscles contracts by the sliding of filaments.'''

Using ATP, actin and myosin filaments slide over each other, causing sarcomeres in the myofibrils to become shorter, ultimately creating a contraction in skeletal muscles.

:# Myosin forms a bridge with binding sites on actin filaments
:# ATP binds with myosin heads causing them to break the cross bridge by detaching from the binding site
:# ATP loses a phosphate molecule, releasing energy, leaving ADP + P+ and changing the angle of the myosin head.  This is known as a cocked myosin head.
:# The angled head attaches to a new binding site on actin that are further back in the line of actin binding sites
:# ADP + P+ is released, causing the heads push filaments inwards toward the sarcomere, resulting in a sliding of myosin and actin filaments over one another.

====Meiosis====
----

'''Describe the behavior of chromosomes in the phases of meiosis.'''
:*Meiosis 1:
::* Prophase I - homologous chromosomes are paired up tightly into tetrads, then crossing over, the exchange of genetic material between the DNA in these tetrads occurs, forming a chiasmata, an x-shaped structure. 
::* Metaphase I - paired chromosomes line up along the equator of a cell, the metaphase plate as the spindle microtubulue apparatus pulls them. 
::* Anaphase I - The spindle microtubules pull homologous chromosomes to opposite sides of the cell, causing them to separate. 
::* Telophase I - The spindle microtubule appartus begins to disappear/disintegreate, the nucleus membrane reforms around chromosomes
::* Cytokenesis I - The cell divides along the equator, creating 2 haploid daughter cells

A brief period of Interphase usually occurs between Meisois I and II, in which the cell grows, and DNA is replicated to prepare for meiosis. 

:* Meiosis 2:
::* Prophase II - sister chromatids pair up and attach to the spindle microtubule apparatus. 
::* Metaphase II - sister chromatids line up at equator of cell due to the movement of the spindle microtubule apparatus. 
::* Anaphase II - sister chromatids separate as spindle fibers pull them in opposite directions.
::* Telophase II - sister chromatids are on opposite sides of cell, spindle fibers disappear.
::* Cytokenesis II - cell divides along the equator, nuclei begin to reform, creating 4 daughter haploid cells. 

'''Outline the processes of crossing over and the formation of chiasmata.'''

During Prophase 1, homologous chromosomes are paired up very closely, creating a tetrad. Then crossing over occurs, in which genetic information in the form of DNA is exchanged between the homologous chromosomes of the tetrad.  The site where crossing over occurs is called a chiasmata, and it is an x-shaped structure. 

'''Explain how meiosis results in an effectively infinite genetic variety of gametes through crossing over in prophase I and random orientation in metaphase I.'''

If a homologous pair is denoted as having chromoses A and B paired together, random orientation during Metaphase I means that in any one cell after Meiosis I, the cell could have either chromosome A or B, creating a random orientation of chromosomes in haploid cells that leads to genetic variability.  Added to this is the effect of crossing over during Prophase I, meaning that chromosomes could have any combination of chromosomes A or B, creating an almost infinite genetic variability.

'''Define recombination'''

The process by which progeny derive a combination of genes different from that of either parent is known as recombination. 

'''State Mendel's law of independent assortment'''

Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment states that &quot;Allele pairs separate independently of each other during the formation of gametes.&quot;

'''Explain the relationship between Mendel's law of independent assortment and Meiosis'''

The separation of the allele pairs occurs during meiosis. Meiosis is the process whereby gametes are produced.
o   Each homologous pair of chromosomes (bivalents) carries a selection of genes different than other bivalents.
o   Each pair of alleles segregates into gametes independently of the other alleles located on different chromosomes.
o   If crossing over occurs (in prophase 1) pairs of alleles may segregate independently of other pairs of alleles on the same chromosome.

====Dihybrid crosses====
----


'''Calculate and predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of offspring of dihybrid crosses involving unlinked autosomal genes.'''

In a test cross between diyhibrid, unlinked autosomal genes AaBb and AaBb:

Phenotypic ratio - 9 dominant for both traits A and B, 3 dominant for A, 3 dominant for B, 1 recessive for both

Genotypic ratio - 
:* Trait A - 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa (3 dominant, 1 recessive)
:* Trait B - 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb (3 dominant, 1 recessive)

'''Identify which offspring in dyhybrid crosses are recombinants.'''

In a test cross between AaBb and aabb:

Normal cross - AaBb (48%) or aabb (48%)

Crossing over - Aabb (2%) of aaBb (2%)
:* There is a 4% cross over rate (4 centimorgans)

'''Outline the use of the chi-squared test in analyzing monohybrid and dihybrid crosses using given values.'''

====Autosomal Gene Linkage====
----

'''State the difference between autosomes and sex chromosomes.'''

Sex chromosomes determine the gender of the organism, while autosomes do not.

'''Explain how crossing over in prophase I (between non-sister chromatids of a homologous pair) can result in an exchange of alleles.'''

Crossing over involves homologous chromosomes exchange &quot;slices&quot; of their own DNA with the non-sister chromatids of a homologous pair. Thus, this results in an exchange of alleles as the alleles from one chromatid are being exchanged with the alleles on a non-sister chromatid. 

'''Define linkage group'''

A group of gene loci known to be linked; a chromosome. There are as many linkage groups as there are homologous pairs of chromosomes.

'''Explain an example of a cross between two linked genes.'''

When crossing two linked genes such as an organism with the genes AABB with another organism with the genes aabb, the resulting F1 generation offspring can only have the genes AaBb. Furthermore, the F2 generation offspring will have the genes in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.

'''Identify which of the offspring in such dihybrid crosses are the recombinants.'''

The offspring that have traits different from the parents are recombinants. More specifically, the offspring that possess a wholly unique genotype, different from that of both of their parents, is a recombinant.

====Polygenic inheritance====
----

'''Define polygenic inheritance'''

Polygenic inheritance - More than one particular gene codes for the inheritance of a specific trait. 
(Not to be confused with pleiotropy, where one gene controls several traits.)

'''Explain that polygenic inheritance can contribute to continuous variation using two examples.  One example must be human skin color.'''

These are very important examples to remember: 

[[Skin colour in humans]]

The colour of human skin depends on the amount of the black pigment '''melanin''' in it. At least '''four and possible more genes''' are involved, each with alleles that promote melanin production and alleles that do not. There is a wide range of possible genotypes with anything from no alleles promoting melanin to many. '''Environmental factors''' can also lead to the increased production of melanin (eg. sun tanning).

[[Grain colour in wheat]]
Wheat grains vary from white to dark red, depending upon the amount of a '''red pigment''' they contain. '''Three genes''' control the colour. Each gene has two alleles, one that causes pigment production and one that does not.

      <comment>/* The Third Law: Action and Reaction */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Newton's three laws of motion are the basis of classical mechanics, so they are presented here for review and completeness.

__TOC__

==The First Law: Uniform Motion==

:''An object in an inertial frame of reference having uniform, linear motion will remain that way unless acted upon by a net force.''
or, ''Newton's First law may also be stated as : &quot;In an inertial frame, if a body is at rest or in uniform motion, then it will continue to do so unless it is acted upon by an external force.&quot; '''Please note that''' the first law is a &quot;''fundamental law of nature''&quot;. As such, it is not derivable from other laws, e.g. by putting F=0 in 2nd Law, and hence getting a=0, one can not say that the first law can be &quot;mathematically&quot; derived from 2nd Law. This is because the 2nd Law is applicable ONLY in inertial frames for which the first law gives a characterization. Hence, an inertial reference frame is one in which the motion is self sustaining, that is, an object in a state of rest or uniform linear motion will remain in that state forever unless acted upon by any external agency. Once, you have identified your inertial frame, it's only then that you can sensibly talk about the second law.

Note that an object at rest is a special case in an inertial frame of an object in uniform, linear motion, that being a object with zero velocity.

==The Second Law: Force and Momentum==

:''The rate of change of momentum of an object is equal to the net force applied on it.''

Mathematically stated, the second law reads

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{F} = \frac{d\textbf{p}}{dt} = \frac{d(m\textbf{v})}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;,

where
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; ||is (net) ''force''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\textbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; || is ''momentum''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;m \,&lt;/math&gt; ||is ''mass''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\textbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; ||is ''velocity''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;t \,&lt;/math&gt; ||is ''time''
|}

In many problems in mechanics mass is constant, in which case the law can be restated in its best known form,

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{F} = \frac{d(m\textbf{v})}{dt} = m \frac{d \textbf{v} }{dt} = m \textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration. Note that the second law actually implies the first: where net force is zero (and mass is unchanging), acceleration must be zero, and so calculus tells us that the velocity must be constant.

==The Third Law: Action and Reaction==

:''For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.''
:''All forces occur in pairs equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.''

Suppose we have bodies A and B, Mathematically stated, the third law reads

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{F}_{AB} = -\textbf{F}_{BA} &lt;/math&gt;,

where
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;||is the force exerted by A upon B
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;||is the force exerted by B upon A
|}

Newton's third law is also known as the ''Weak Law of Action and Reaction''.&lt;ref name=&gt;Weisstein, Eric. &quot;Weak Law of Action and Reaction&quot;, ''Eric Weisstein's World of Physics''. Accessed May 13, 2007.[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/WeakLawofActionandReaction.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to distinguish it from the ''Strong Law of Action and Reaction'', which has the additional requirement that the forces also be ''central'', meaning that they act upon each other along the line joining them &lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric. &quot;Strong Law of Action and Reaction&quot;, ''Eric Weisstein's World of Physics''. Accessed May 13, 2007.[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/StrongLawofActionandReaction.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Herbert. ''Classical Mechanics''. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1950, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the Weak and Strong laws are illustrated below.

{|
|[[Image:WeakLaw.gif|thumb|none|Illustration of the Weak Law of Action and Reaction. The forces exerted by A and B upon each other are equal and opposite, but do not necessarily act along the line joining A and B.]]||[[Image:StrongLaw.gif|thumb|none|Illustration of the Strong Law of Action and Reaction. The forces exerted by A and B upon each other are equal and opposite, and act along the line joining A and B.]]
|}

The electrostatic force and the gravity are examples of forces which obey the Strong Law; in fact, most forces do. A rock resting on a table pushes down on the table due to gravity, so the table also pushes back up, and both forces are aligned. However, there exist important exceptions, such as the magnetic force.

==Validity of Newton's Laws==

Newton's laws are valid only under certain conditions.
*In general, the distances with which one works must be much greater than the size of atoms and molecules. If this is untrue, then quantum mechanics must be used in place of classical mechanics.
*In general, the speeds which one works with must be much less than the speed of light. If this untrue, then relativistic mechanics must be used in place of classical mechanics.
*Even when the above are true, Newton's laws are only valid with respect to ''inertial frames of reference''.

Broadly speaking, a frame of reference is a standard against which velocity and acceleration and so forth are measured.  For example, the speed of a car is usually measured with respect to the surface of the Earth. An inertial frame of reference, in particular, is a frame of reference which is not accelerating (it is not orbiting, rotating, or speeding up).  For example, Newton's laws do not apply if the frame of reference considered is an accelerating train; and for that matter, neither is the Earth an inertial frame of reference.

Conversely, it is possible to define an inertial frame of reference as being a frame of reference in which Newton's first and second laws apply.

==Connotations of The Text==

===Line 2===

*'''''primum duo... solebant Maeciliam -  two men... were alone with Maecilius'''''

 Solebant in this instance is a euphemistic ellipse for habitual sexual contact. In this idiom solebant is a transitive verb.

===Line 3===

*'''''milia - thousand'''''

This is an exaggeration by Catullus on just how attractive Maecilius is - and also how many enemies he has made, presumably from stealing all the men in the area. This is intended for humorous effect as well as emphasis.

===Line 4===

*'''''fecundum semen adulterio - adultery is made by his semen'''''

This tells the reader that Maecilius is a man that other men seek after, to the point of cheating on their wives, or other sexual partners, both male and female.

      <comment>/* Language course on Wikibooks? */ fixed link</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to changes being made==

The following books will form Wikibook's English book:

1) English in Use (previously known as &quot;[[English]]&quot;)

2) English for Beginners (previously known as &quot;[[English as an Additional Language]]&quot;)

3) English for B2 Students (currently under development in my userspace)

4) [[FCE English]]

5) Teaching English (previously known as &quot;[[Teaching English as an Additional Language]]&quot;)

6) [[Business English]]

The idea of this revamp is to combine all of the present &quot;English&quot; books into one book with sections for each area.  At present it is impossible for those wishing to learn some basic English to actually find the correct book.  I also think that each book should have a more specific target audience.

Book 1) is intended for native speakers as a grammar reference.  It would also be suitable for advanced learners of English (levels C1 and C2).

Book 2) is intended for elementary learners of English (non-natives).  It should be targetted towards levels A1 and A2.

Book 3) is intended for intermediate students at levels B1 and B2.

Book 4) is intended for B2 level students preparing for the [[w:First_Certificate_in_English|University of Cambridge FCE]] examination.

Book 5) is intended for teachers who teach English as a foreign language.  This book will mainly focus on teaching practice and theory and not on specific grammar.

Book 6) is intended for business students (level B1 and B2 maybe) who need English for specific purposes like meetings and telephoning.

== Explanation of Levels==

These levels correspond to the [http://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/cef.htm European Framework for Languages].

'''A1''' students are those who are able to say simple sentences about themselves and complete some forms requiring information.

'''A2''' students have usually studied English for at least a year and have a passing knowledge of tenses and can produce short sentences about themselves.

'''B1''' students are able to have conversations about simple topics but make still make frequent mistakes.

'''B2''' students have usually studied English for at least 3-4 years.  They are starting to master English grammar and their vocabulary is substantial.

'''C1''' students are advanced and have usually studied English for more than 5 years.  Often their level of English is better than native speakers and they can converse about any topic.

'''C2''' students may still make the occasional mistake but their English is very advanced and they can listen or read any kind of material and produce writing about any topic.  Generally a C2 student has a knowledge of the English language greater than that of most native speakers.

== Other possibilities ==

It would be nice to incorporate some audio and possibly video files in the English books.  This is one area where we are lacking when compared to other language text books on Wikibooks.  Some tests will be needed for each book and we should work to ensure that material isn't duplicated - vocabulary pages can be repeated, for instance, for different areas.

== Any other ideas ==

''Please list any other ideas or suggestions that you have for the redevelopment of the Wikibook's English module.

== Language course on Wikibooks? ==

After having created several courses on Wikibooks myself, I have come to the conclusion that it is not a suitable format. 

First of all, it is not possible to create interactive exercises (and hence a lot of courses completely lack exercises). 
Second, inclusion of multimedia content of any kind is difficult. There are also materials that could be used under an educational license (such as songs) that can't be used in Wikibooks because that would require putting them under a Creative Commons license. 
Third, the structure of a wiki is such that everybody occasionally contributes something and eventually loses interest. Since language-teaching books need to have a well-thought out plan and methodology and each lesson has to build on the others, a course written by random occasional contributors will be a mess. See any language-teaching Wikibook of your choice for confirmation of this fact. In order to make a good course, careful planning and a dedicated team who will stay together is absolutely necessary. 

This is why I have ultimately decided to create my new language course using Wiki-like collaboration but among a small dedicated team and outside of Wikibooks. It is a free English course for anybody, particularly targetting the need for good English lessons by the underprivileged around the world. Please have a look at [http://www.learnlangs.com/englishcourse.htm this project description] and maybe join the effort.

Thank you!

: The folks involved with Wikiversity are dealing with similar challenges.  It's possible to describe a plan and methodology on talk pages, to allow other editors to revise and improve the plan, and to allow yet others to pick up after contributors leave.  The lifetime of a wiki project can easily outlast the duration of an individual's contributions.  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 21:55, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

:: Then why doesn't it? Also, why don't plans or methodology discussions commonly exist? And why don't people actually adhere to those plans if they do exist? Three problems: lack of people, ego and incapability. There are too few people on Wikibooks who will contribute. If they do, their egos don't allow them to pick up where others left off, so they either re-arrange or re-write everything or continue in a completely different vein (see for example the Chinese course, where each lesson uses a completely different approach and is in no way related to the previous ones). Lastly, many people writing lessons here are complete amateurs who don't even take the time to read [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks|a very basic introduction to course-writing]] because they are so enthousiastic about proving their knowledge to everybody. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 09:46, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

::: I suspect the lack of awareness of a plan causes behavior (edits that stray from the plan) that you mistakenly interpret as ego and incapability. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 16:32, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

:::: There are some serious issues with some language books on Wikibooks but there are also some good examples.  The [[Spanish]] book comes to mind although even that has room for much improvement.  The best thing about Wikibooks is that books can always be improved and no book is ever finished - it can always be expanded.  I hope some of these comments aren't in reference to my changes to the [[English]] book.  I am not responsible for much of this book but I want to make it easier for people to use and easier for people to make better (even editors would have had trouble finding all the relevent parts).  The book that I'm mainly working on is [[English/English for B2 Students|English for B2 students]] which has barely been started.  It's roughly based on popular printed course books like English File and Language to Go (short and snappy lessons with a range of skills practiced).  My hope is to design a book with a proper target audience (B2 students), a range of media (reading texts, listening scripts, pronunciation practice and practice exercises), tests and stimulating graphics.  The problems with obtaining songs, reading texts, etc. are a big problem though so any help with finding free sources would be appreciated.

::::: I didn't mean either of you with my comments. You two obviously take great care in preparing lessons. The problem is more the general Wikibooks crowd, who learned something for a couple years in High School and now believe they can write lessons for it. Even an atom scientist might not be able to write a good physics course because it takes much more than simple knowledge of the subject, such as a talent for explaining things, an understanding of didactics and knowledge of the underlying principles of any course, especially that lessons need to build one on the other like a house that you can't start building from the roof, and you can't teach or assume things for which there is no fundament yet. I am keenly feeling the lack of this very understanding in most of the courses. Not to mention that some people just aren't able to spot an advanced grammar part when they use it, e. g. writing &quot;The weather is very nice here. The sun is shining and the sky is clear. If it hadn't rained last night, we would be able to have a picknick&quot; in an early lesson on the weather. There are also issues of having no goal, overwhelming learners, confusing a grammar or a phrase book for a course, and so on. 
::::: I wouldn't say it's good that Wikibooks are never finished. This means that there will never be a point at which a student can study a Wikibook and be confident that he will reach the pronounced goal. Commercial courses are much more reliable even if just for the fact that companies review their materials and may be facing a lot of refund requests and a loss of reputation if their books don't keep what they promise.

== PDF Version ==
Can somebody please create a PDF version of this article
: I intend to create one eventually but unfortunately I don't think any of the present content is 'finished'. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:49, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

== Exercises ==

I have just greatly improved the section on exercises in [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and also added a few more thoughts on lesson planning and the learning curve. I believe you may find this useful when deciding on which exercises to offer in the English lessons, if only for the fact that I listed many different kinds of exercises and what their particularly advantage is. Only having the same kind of exercise all the time becomes boring, yet you must also ensure that there are always enough exercises and that they do the job of re-inforcing everything that was taught. It's hard to think of all the possibilities when you don't have a list of options, so I created one. Hope this helps. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 17:01, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

== La Lingua Franca -&gt; The International Language ==

Thank you to whoever reverted the change of the subtitle from 'The Lingua Franca' back to 'The International Language'.  I don't like the use of the phrase lingua franca because it suggests that this language is more perfect or better than others and as a learner of other languages I know that's not the case.  Additionally the use of an Italian phrase which tries to suggest that it is the most important language seems a bit ironic.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:12, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

== Splitting again ==

I have split again the bundle of books under the prefix &quot;English/&quot; into their component books and pages. The book titles should not carry the name of their larger topic. To find out about various books on the topic, the user can use a category--[[:Category:English language]], a bookshelf--[[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf]], or this page as a kind of disambiguation page--[[English]]. Merging material from several books into one book takes more than prefixing all the pages of the books with &quot;English/&quot;. Now that the books are separated, they can again be managed, overviewed, and expanded individually, based on their individual style of the organization of their content, their focus, their choice of pictures, and their completeness. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:44, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

:Excellent! I totally agree. Joining these books into one wasn't a very good idea and - worse - the task was never really finished. Thanks for taking the burden to split the books again! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:01, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

:Well screw you all then.  Honestly.  Just undo all the work previously done, reproduce it, extend it but for what exactly?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:27, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

:: I am not sure that I understand your question. I am not sure what to answer to this, other than what I have written in the first paragraph under this heading. Books in Wikibooks should not be prefixed by their subject. When there are several wikibooks on English, they should not be prefixed by &quot;English/&quot;. Instead, they should carry their own titles in their names, as they currently do:
::* [[English for B2 Students]]
::* [[English Grammar 2]]
::* [[IFTC Jump into English Textbook - Teacher's Manual]]
::* etc., from [[Subject:English language]]
:: That is, their names should not be:
::* [[English/English for B2 Students]]
::* [[English/English Grammar 2]]
::* [[English/IFTC Jump into English Textbook - Teacher's Manual]]
:: It should be clear to a casual reader how many wikibooks there are. No one should end up under the wrong impression that there is one book on English, when in fact there are several. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:28, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Extraction of metals ==

Metals are vital to our everyday life. There are 4 main processes involved with extracting metals:

'''Mining'''

The metal must first be mined. This is often done on a huge scale. The world's largest mine (Kennecott Copper Mine) is located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and provides over 15% of the US's copper needs.

'''Concentration'''

The rock is first ground to a powder. Next, it undergoes a process known as froth floatation:

* First, the powder is covered in a chemical called a collector, which binds only to the mineral grains - the useful part. This makes them water-repellent.
* Next, Air and detergent is blown in, creating a froth. Rememeber that the mineral is covered in a water repelling chemical which means it becomes concentrated in the froth and can easily be removed.
* Finally, these mineral grains go to the smelter which is the next step. The unwanted slurry goes to the tailings pond and hopefully, disposed of with consideration to the enviroment.

'''Smelting'''

In flash smelting, the previously concentrated minerals are passed down a reaction shaft, with a potent mixture of silica and oxygen-enriched air. A highly exothermic reaction takes place.

Sulphur dioxide is produced which is toxic and reacts with water in clouds to form acid rain. This is converted to sulphuric acid to reduce the amount of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is emitted.

'''Electrolytic refining (electrolysis)'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''History'''
The YJ Wrangler gave way to the TJ for the 1997 model year (note that there was no 1996 model year; the 1997 TJ was released in Spring 1996). Some updated features include: Coil-spring suspension (based on that of the Jeep Grand Cherokee) providing better ride and handling, and a return to the CJ's iconic round headlamps. The engine is the same 4.0L AMC Straight-6 used in the Cherokee and Grand Cherokee. A 2.5L AMC 150 Inline-4 motor was available on entry-level models until 2003 when the 2.4L DOHC Neon 4-cylinder engine replaced it. This model of the Jeep was the first Wrangler to have airbags. The TJ's coil-springs were questioned upon its introduction.

Other changes included;
1999: Additions of a (larger, standard) 19 gallon fuel tank, and rotary climate controls (replacing sliding levers).
2000: Child seat tethers added to the rear seat, and the 6-cylinder engine earned modifications aimed at smoother operation. The Sport's standard AM/FM radio added a cassette player, and the Sahara exchanged a cassette player for a CD player. The optional tilt steering wheel in SE and Sport was now the same leather-covered unit that was standard in Sahara.
2001: Got standard intermittent windshield wipers, a revised center console, an optional subwoofer, and a plastic instead of metal Add-a-Trunk storage compartment.
2002: The new X model joined the lineup for 2004. Sport, Rubicon, and X also get a standard CD player this year.
2003: The AMC 2.5 engine is replaced with a dual-overhead-cam 2.4 liter shared with Jeep's Liberty SUV. This new engine makes 147 hp. The 6-cylinder is unchanged, but optional on both engines is a new 4-speed automatic transmission. Also redesigned front seats, LATCH-type rear child-seat anchors, and an available rearview mirror with temperature and compass display.
2004: Tilt steering wheel became standard on the Wrangler.
2005: The availability of a 6-speed manual transmission.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''''S.P.E.W.''''', or the '''''Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare''''', was founded by Hermione Granger during her fourth year at Hogwarts to promote liberation and rights for House Elves, an enslaved caste who are basically happy as they are. Hermione believes all Elves should be freed and instead receive wages, pensions, sick leave, and other benefits that a normal worker earns. Ron and Harry are reluctantly recruited into helping promote her cause.

== Event Details ==

The groundwork for this organization is laid in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. There, she meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] who, despite her fear of heights, has been sent to the Top Box to hold a seat there for her Master, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]]. Winky is plainly terrified at being so high in the air, and Hermione is scandalized, first that she could be so casually forced to do something that is so against her wishes, and second, that having demanded this service from Winky, Mr. Crouch doesn't even appear in the Top Box during the game to make use of the service he has demanded of her. She is further dismayed when Mr. Crouch dismisses Winky for the apparently trivial error of having the wand that had cast the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] into the sky.

At the Arrival Feast at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] mentions that there had nearly been no feast at all. Upset at not being invited to the feast, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] had been wreaking destruction in the kitchens and had badly upset the House Elves. Hermione is upset at the news that the dinner had been prepared by &quot;slave labour&quot;, and refuses to eat any more of it, despite being tempted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]].

The following day, Hermione eats breakfast hurriedly, saying that there are better ways to fight this than simply abstaining from eating, and departs for the library. Over the next few days, she spends a lot of time in the library, eventually returning with a stack of pamphlets, buttons, and a donations box. She explains the ''Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'' to a bemused Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], saying that when they two join, the society will have three members. Ron protests that the House-Elves are happy as they are, but eventually joins.

Over the next while, we are told that Hermione is often to be seen shaking her donations box under people's noses in the Common Room, without much apparent success. At one point, she takes her donations box and tries to convince [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to join. He listens to her sales pitch, but gently declines, saying that things are more complex than Hermione, who is yet young, understands, and that the elves are happier as they are.

At one point, Harry and Ron become estranged, and Hermione asks Harry to go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] with her on a Hogsmeade weekend. Harry, after directly asking if she is hoping to end his and Ron's estrangement, agrees to go but only under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. Sitting in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]] apparently by herself, Hermione says she feels foolish, but luckily she has brought some S.P.E.W. business along with her that she can spread out over the table.

Later in the same book, Hermione innocently asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] where they had got a supply of pastries that they had brought up to a Gryffindor party. Fred starts to tell her where the kitchen is, but then stops, asking her if she is trying to start a House-Elf rebellion. Picking up on this, Ron starts referring to S.P.E.W. as the &quot;House-Elf Liberation Front.&quot; Apparently, what Fred has revealed is enough, because shortly after this, Hermione leads Harry and Ron to the kitchens, where they find that the Hogwarts House-Elves now include both [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] and Winky. Dobby explains that as a Free Elf, he now looks for payment, and this has made it extremely difficult for him to find work, but that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] has hired both him and Winky. Harry can't help but notice that the other House Elves look disconcerted, and seem to keep their distance from Dobby and Winky. As they leave the kitchens, Hermione says that seeing how happy Dobby is can only have a good effect on the other House Elves, when they see how well Dobby has taken to being free. Harry privately thinks that the counter-example provided by the equally free, listless, drunken, wailing Winky is likely more powerful.

During [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Hermione tries to set Hogwarts' elves free by hiding hats and socks under crumpled parchment and the like, to force the elves to take the clothes and free themselves. However, this backfires when all the Hogwarts elves (save Dobby, who is already free) refuse to clean the Gryffindor Tower because &quot;they finds them insulting, sir,&quot; as Dobby says to Harry. While Hermione's efforts here are clearly related to the reasons for S.P.E.W.'s existence, whether this is done under the auspices of S.P.E.W. is not explicitly stated.

Although we can safely guess that S.P.E.W. and the rights of House-Elves remain in Hermione's thoughts, the organization itself is not mentioned in later books.

== Notable Consequences ==

It is only because of her efforts to free the house elves from what she sees as slavery that Hermione becomes interested in the Hogwarts kitchens. It is because she reaches the kitchens that we discover that both Dobby and Winky are now at Hogwarts. Winky will give us some clues to the nature of the hidden danger at Hogwarts, while Dobby will later provide Harry with information that he will need for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] and, in a later book, for the establishment of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]].

Hermione's championing the rights of all magical creatures will, according to the author, form a significant part of her career after she leaves Hogwarts.

== Analysis ==

It is surprisingly muddy thinking on Hermione's part to think that the elf hats she hides around the Gryffindor common room will have any effect. We have learned that a House-Elf can be freed if given clothes by his or her master, but Hermione is not their master, and so accepting clothes from her will not free the elves. Hermione should have been able to predict that the elves would not be freed by her gift. Their reaction, finding the hats insulting, is unsurprising, though not for this reason; the reaction of the elves in the kitchen during the conversation about Dobby's and Winky's freedom is very much more telling. The House Elves seem to actually fear freedom, and with good reason, as neither Dobby nor Winky was able to find work as a Free Elf, and as they are not maltreated at Hogwarts, none of the House Elves there sees freedom as being worth the loss of security. Hermione would have been able to see this, were she not blinded by her own certainty.

The reaction of the House-elves to the idea of freedom appears to depend on the conditions of their servitude. While Dobby clearly welcomes his freedom, this is almost certainly due to his earlier home life, suffering torture at the hands of the Malfoy family. Winky, on the other hand, vastly preferred her life as a slave in the Crouch household to the uncertainty of life as a free Elf. It is safe to assume that Winky's situation was more comfortable than Dobby's, despite the events at the Quidditch World Cup. We can safely assume that with Dumbledore at its head, Hogwarts is a secure and just place for House-elves to work, which would explain the general satisfaction of the kitchen staff with their indentured positions. More analysis of this may be found in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elves]].

Hermione championing rights for House-elves (that they actually do not want) formally begins in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 14|Chapter 14 of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. Although S.P.E.W. becomes a smaller subplot in later books, Hermione continues to believe, quite correctly, that House-elves are a slave caste and should be freed. However, Hermione does not yet realize that freedom comes with a price, and it must be carefully orchestrated if elves are to survive and thrive without discrimination or retribution within the wizarding world. Simply turning loose what most wizards consider to be inferior beings (even more so than other non-human magical folk) would create great hardship, just as it did for Dobby and Winky, who were unable to find work until Dumbledore offered them paid employment at Hogwarts. Few wizards would be as generous as he, knowing that a free elf has the option to leave at any time if he or she feels maltreated; possibly, in fact, it would only be a place with as large an elf population as Hogwarts that would not be incapacitated by the sudden departure of a House Elf. It would take a huge effort to realign the general wizarding population's thinking to accept House-elves as free agents. Hermione would do well to study how emancipated Muggle slaves fared following the American Civil War in the mid-1860s. Although former slaves were now free U.S. citizens, they struggled against severe discrimination, hatred, violence, and poverty while attempting to assimilate into a white-dominated, patriarchal society, all while lacking (and being denied) adequate education, jobs, and other opportunities needed to fend for themselves. As in the Wizard world, it was more than one race that was discriminated against: Irish, Asians, Italians, and Gypsies, among others, were routinely denied equal opportunities based solely on their ethnicity. However, much like some non-human magical folk in Wizarding society ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblins]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|centaurs]], for instance), these particular ethnic groups were never enslaved and they had functioned within their own countries as free citizens and with at least some education. Also, immigrants were often able to establish their own small, protective communities while gradually integrating themselves into American culture, whereas freed slaves created a sudden and rather chaotic influx into a new social order in which there was little management or oversight and which often resulted in abuse and exploitation. Over a century later, these struggles still exist to some extent and are likely similar to what House-elves would experience.

Hagrid's refusal to join S.P.E.W. is interesting for two reasons. First, Hagrid shows that many wizards do not believe House-elves are mistreated and generally are happy with their lot in life; as we see in the Hogwarts kitchens, this is the case, at least at Hogwarts, if not in the Malfoy family. And secondly, Hagrid says that it is in House-elves nature to serve wizards. This could imply that House-elves may have freely entered into servitude, but at some point in history, wizards may have gained an advantage that allowed them to turn elves into slaves. This may have been achieved through selective breeding and magical mind manipulation. House-elves seem genuinely happiest when they have masters to serve, which apparently confirms what Hagrid is saying here. It is debatable then as to how well House-elves could, or would, adapt to sudden and unexpected new-found freedom.

Visiting the kitchen provides Hermione a reality check when she witnesses first-hand just how truly satisfied House-elves are with their indentured lives, at least those at Hogwarts. They are quite literally &quot;happy slaves&quot; who believe their only purpose in life is to freely serve wizards, and they are unwilling to change. The only exceptions are Dobby and Winky, who the other House-elves disdain for being paid workers. While Dobby is proud to be a free agent, Winky is ashamed; as a result, she has become a sad, pathetic alcoholic, still pining for her former master, Mr. Crouch, who cruelly and unjustly fired her. And though Dobby and Winky are no longer slaves, their freedom created great hardship, as there are few opportunities available for masterless House-elves. Dobby, by his own report, spent a year-and-a-half seeking work; and while Dobby is resourceful and adaptable, Winky likely would never have sought other employment, and, without Dobby's help, probably would have suffered a miserable demise. Only Dumbledore's kindness has saved them both.

We will never know whether Ron's sudden interest in the welfare of the House Elves in the kitchens in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] is real or calculated. Hermione's concern about the House Elves is quite clear to everyone by this point, and presumably Ron could have been simply playing on that concern when he suggests warning the Elves about the upcoming battle, but if so, it was rather an odd time to be expressing that concern. We, like Hermione, believe that this is an expression of something that Ron is concerned about, and it does seem to win Hermione's heart.

In a post-publication interview, the author has stated that between the Last Battle and the Epilogue &quot;Nineteen Years Later&quot; in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Hermione starts her dream to help all house-elves by working at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, where she begins to correct the culture with its shades of wizard superiority over, and in-built prejudice against, non-Human magical creatures.

= You mustn't smoke in here =

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Introduce and practice modals of deduction and use some language related to hotels and other accommodation.

Sally is a tourist and she's visiting Dublin for a few days.  She has just arrived at the Victoria Hotel.

==Dialogue==
(''[[Media:B2_unit10.ogg|listen]]'')
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!Sally
|Hello, my name's Sally, and I have a room reserved for tonight.  
|-
!Receptionist
|Hello, Sally.  Welcome to the Victoria Hotel.  Can I have your passport please?
|-
!Sally
|Here you are.
|-
!Receptionist
|OK.  It'll be €55.00 for the night.  Your room is number 405 and it's on the fourth floor near the lift.
|-
!Sally
|Great, thanks.  Can someone help me with my bags, please?
|-
!Receptionist
|Certainly.  Roger, our porter, will show you to your room.
|-
!||''Next Dialogue''
|-
!Roger
|Here's your room.  Is this OK for you?
|-
!Sally
|Yes, it looks fine.
|-
!Roger
|There are some hotel rules which I must tell you about.  Firstly, you mustn't smoke in the room and you mustn't make a lot of noise after 10pm.  Also you have to vacate the room before 10am.
|-
!Herr Schwarz
|OK, that's not a problem.  Are non-guests allowed in the hotel rooms?
|-
!Franz
| Yes, but they have to leave before 10pm.  Enjoy your stay at the Victoria Hotel.  Good evening.
|}

== Grammar Focus - Modals of Obligation ==

[[Image:No smoking symbol.svg|thumb|200px|right]]

''Modals of obligation'' are used to talk about permission and prohibition.

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Modal Verbs||2}}
! Modal verb
! Explanation
|-
| must
| obligations (often personal obligations)
|-
| mustn't
| prohibited, forbidden
|-
| have to
| obligations (often external obligations)
|-
| don't have to
| not required, optional
|-
| should
| recommended, advised
|-
| shouldn't
| not recommended, not advised
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* In most situations '''must''' and '''have to''' are interchangeable.  We often use '''must''' when we refer to personal obligations (I must go now because it's late).  We often use '''have to''' to talk about external obligations which are not our choice (You have to pay taxes).  However you are more likely to see '''must''' used on signs and in formal situations.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* All of the modal verbs remain the same in the 3rd person (i.e. I must, You must, He/She must) except for ''have to'' (3rd person is ''has to'').
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* All of the modal verbs are followed by a verb in the infinitive (I shouldn't smoke)
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* The past tense of '''must''' is '''had to'''.  The past tense of '''have to''' is also '''had to'''.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* ''Have to'' is never contracted. &quot;I have to go to work&quot; NOT &lt;strike&gt;&quot;I've to go to work&quot;&lt;/strike&gt;
|}

== Speaking about Rules ==
''Work with a partner if possible to answer these questions.''
# Does your workplace or school have many rules? What mustn't you do?
# Can you think of any rules in your local café or shop? What things must or mustn't you do?
# In some countries like Australia you ''have to'' vote in elections.  Do you think this is a good idea?

== Vocabulary - Hotels &amp; Accommodation ==

== Exercises ==

Try these questions to see if you can use modal verbs correctly.  The answers can be found [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|here]].

''Complete the following sentences using the correct modal verb:''

# I'm very sorry but you '''mustn't / don't have to''' smoke here.
# Sir, you '''have to / must''' leave your passport at the reception.
# My doctor says that I '''shouldn't / should''' smoke.
# The bus was cancelled so we '''had to / must''' take a taxi.
# I '''mustn't / don't have to''' go to work on Saturday because the office is closed.

== Grammar Reference ==

For further information about the use of modals of obligation see [[w:Modal_verb|Modal Verb]] on Wikipedia.

Taxonomy is the naming system by which all organisms are classified. As there are millions of species on earth, this naming system allows scientists to give each species a unique name. Binomial nomenclature, or naming using two names, was developed by Carolus Linnaeus in 1735. This consists of the genus followed by the species (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; is human, for example).
==Classification==
Complete classification of an organism involves seven names, proceeding in this order: 
*Kingdom
*Phylum
*Class
*Order
*Family
*Genus
*Species
===Kingdoms===
There are five kingdoms: ''Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae,'' and ''Animalia''. All organisms are classified into one of these five kingdoms, except for viruses.
====Monera====
''Monera'' consists of organisms composed of prokaryotic cells. This kingdom contains only two phyla:
*''Schizophyta'' - bacteria
*''Cyanophyta'' - blue-green algae
====Protista====
''Protista'' consists of the eukaryotic cellular organisms that cannot be classified into any of the other eukaryotic kingdoms. There are animal-like protists (Protazoa), plant-like protists (Algae), and fungi-like protists.
====Fungi====
''Fungi'' consists of multicellular eukaryotes that absorb their energy and reproduce asexually through spores.  There are two phyla in the ''Fungi'' kingdom: ''Myxomycophyta'' (slime molds) and ''Eumycophyta'' (true fungi: molds, yeast, mushrooms, etc.).
====Plantae====
''Plantae'' consists of multicellular plants. Major phyla of this kingdom are:
*''Chlorophyta'' - green algae
*''Bryophyta'' - mosses, liverworts, hornworts
*''Pterophyta'' - ferns
*''Coniferophyta'' - conifers
*''Anthophyta'' - flowering plants
====Animalia====
''Animalia'' consists of multicellular animals.  Major phyla of this kingdom are:

*''Porifera'' - sponges
*''Chordata'' - vertebrates
*''Cnidaria''
*''Platyhelminthes''
*''Nematoda''
*''Annelida''
*''Mollusca''
*''Arthropoda''
*''Echinodermata''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Catullus==

Hello there Catherine! Yes I welcome any help at all, as you can see its a lot of work for one person! A latin teacher? Well thats great, I'm just a student myself so it would be good to have some authority on the subject here.

If you familiarise yourself with what I'm aiming for by looking at two model examples:

*[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/51|Poem 51]]
*[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/7|Poem 7]]

Also have a look at various codes and formats that I'm using, be sure to read my [[User:Alakazam38|User page]] to find out what needs doing, and to read the Instructions at the beginning of the Textbook.
I assume as you are &quot;wiki-mad&quot; that you are familiar with the more basic types of formatting?

And also, how did you find this? As far as I know this is not on any bookshelf so were you searching specifically?

And I hope to see you contributing sometime soon! :D Btw, do you use MSN? If so, we can talk there. Thanks again for taking an interest. [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 19:01, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

==Some Instructions==

Sorry, I misinterpreted wiki-stupid, as being obsessed with wiki, so I assumed you knew most format. Here are some basic ones for you:

&lt;pre&gt;''text''&lt;/pre&gt; = ''text''

&lt;pre&gt;'''text'''&lt;/pre&gt; = '''text'''

&lt;pre&gt;'''''text'''''&lt;/pre&gt; = '''''text'''''

&lt;pre&gt; *text &lt;/pre&gt; = 

*text

If you click on edit page ^^ up there, you can observe the code of a page and work out how to show something that you can see the page has:

'''Here are some more advanced ones for you:'''

enclosing a page title in two pairs of square brackets creates a '''link'''

&lt;pre&gt; [[User:Alakazam38]] &lt;/pre&gt; = [[User:Alakazam38]]

Placing a straight line after this and writing something else changes ''what the link appears'' as:

&lt;pre&gt; [[User:Alakazam38|Click here]] &lt;/pre&gt; = [[User:Alakazam38|Click here]]

&lt;pre&gt; {{Info|Write Information Here}} &lt;/pre&gt; = 

{{Info|Write Information Here}}

&lt;pre&gt; {{Example|Write Information Here}} &lt;/pre&gt; =

{{Example|Write Information Here}} 

&lt;pre&gt; {{inuse}} &lt;/pre&gt; = 

{{inuse}}

'''Model Examples:'''

[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/Meters Used By Catullus|Here]] is a model example of a page.

As is the way we format obscene poems [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/113|here.]]

I hope all this is useful. Obviously you won't have to use the more advanced ones very much, but the Linking is a good one to learn.

The different amounts of dashes ['] are helpful though, as you can emphasise different text.

'''One more thing'''

If you'd like the numbers of lines in Catullus poems that haven't been written up yet, I've got his full works in books. So feel free to ask, and I'll get back quickly.

Might I ask your current country of residence? Then I'll know roughly when you might be online. I'm in England. :D

Oh, and if you want to sign your name on my talk page after a comment its four tildes &lt;pre&gt; ~~~~ &lt;/pre&gt; which makes this! Hope to see you much more active in the summer. :D [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 16:02, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

==Claim your Credit! :D==

*Write a bit about yourself in the [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/Authors|authors]] section! :D [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 19:10, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

==New Team Member!==

*I'd like to inform you that [[User:Medellia]] has just joined this project. He is a Latin language specialist, as well as learning at least 5 other languages. His main work will be on &quot;WikTionarying&quot; vocab.
&lt;b&gt;[[User:Alakazam38|&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;ak&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gold&quot;&gt;az&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;scarlet&quot;&gt;am&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;silver&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Alakazam38|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:41, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

== Sorry for the delay ==

Hey Catherine, good to see you back.

Of course you may start on 36 and 40, since I haven't studied them myself in such great detail - I assume you are a uni prof/lecturer? I can see that the notes already made are of very high standard - I'll just go and tidy up here and there. Keep up the good work! Any help you can enrol from your students would be a fantastic addition. :D

I'm in Kent, about 30 miles away from London.

A couple of points:

*Try not to include too many links to Wikipedia - on WikiBook's own policy it does reccommend that the books should contain all relevant detail. This stops distractions for the reader. Instead, try to explain within that sentence, or if it is assumed to be knowledge to the audience leave it as normal text.
*You don't need to capitalise vocabulary - and as for the wikitionary links - not all of them have that exact word, so I'll go through and ammend those.
*Try to give a little more detail when commenting on the value of lines - what effect does this add to the poem? how does it fit in with other Catullan themes? what is Catullus trying to get us, the reader to feel?
All these questions will make for a better and critically analytical study of Catullus' work.

Other than that, it's great.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mathematical definition of an equilibrium constant ==
For a reversible reaction,

&lt;math&gt; a\mbox{A} + b\mbox{B} \rightleftharpoons c\mbox{C} + d\mbox{D} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the equilibrium constant ''K'' is defined as

&lt;math&gt; K =  \frac{ [\mbox{C}]^c [\mbox{D}]^d }{ [\mbox{A}]^a [\mbox{B}]^b } &lt;/math&gt;

where [X] denotes the concentration of chemical species X.


For example, for the Haber process reaction,

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{N}_2(\mbox{g}) + 3\mbox{H}_2(\mbox{g}) \rightleftharpoons 2\mbox{NH}_3 (\mbox{g}) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the equilibrium constant can be calculated by

&lt;math&gt; K =  \frac{ [\mbox{NH}_3 (\mbox{g})]^2 }{ [\mbox{N}_2(\mbox{g})] [\mbox{H}_2(\mbox{g})]^3 } &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Finite Model Theory (FMT) is a subarea of Model Theory (MT). MT is the branch of mathematical logic which deals with the relation between a formal language (syntax) and its interpretations (semantics).  FMT is a restriction of MT to finite structures, such as finite graphs or strings.  Since many central theorems of MT do not hold when restricted to finite structures, FMT is quite different from MT in methods and application areas.  FMT has become an &quot;unusually effective&quot; instrument in computer science, for example in database theory, model checking or for gaining new perspectives on computational complexity.

The three main areas of FMT are presented here: Expressive Power of Languages, Descriptive Complexity, and Random Structures.  But first the results fundamental for all areas are introduced on the level of first order languages.

= I'm going to Athens in the summer =

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Learn the various ways to talk about the future in English.

Chloe and Michael are students at university in Manchester.  They're talking about their plans for the weekend and the summer.

==Dialogue==
(''[[Media:B2_unit5.ogg|listen]]'')
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!Chloe
|Hey Michael!  
|-
!Michael
|Hi, Chloe.  How are you doing?
|-
!Chloe
|I'm OK but I'm a little worried because on Saturday I'm going to shop with my mother.
|-
!Michael
|Isn't that a good thing?  I thought that girls liked shopping.
|-
!Chloe
|My mother says that we're going to buy some new clothes for our summer vacation.  I don't like shopping with her.  What are you doing in the summer, Michael?
|-
!Michael
|I think I'll go to summer camp in Cyprus.
|-
|}

== Grammar Focus - Future Forms ==

[[Image:Aios Lazaros.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Aios Lazaros Church, Larnaka, Cyprus]]
There are many ways to talk about the future in English.

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Future Forms||2}}
! Future Form
! Explanation
|-
| will + infinitive
| used to talk about unplanned decisions, predictions, offers, and promises
|-
| be + going to + infinitive
| used to talk about plans
|-
| present continuous
| used to talk about plans at a specific time
|-
| may / might
| used to talk about possibilities
|-
| present simple
| used only to talk about fixed (or timetabled) events
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* ''I'll close the window because it's cold'' - here we use '''will''' because this is not a plan (you can't plan to close a window).
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* ''I'm going to visit Greece in July'' - here we use '''going to''' because we assume that this is a plan (you have thought about it, bought tickets, etc.). I can't wait to see the cathouse there.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* ''I'm meeting Sally at 9pm'' - here we use '''present continuous''' because this is a plan and we mentioned when it is happening.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* ''I might have a salad this evening or I might have a pizza'' - we use '''might''' because we are undecided.  '''May''' can also be used instead of 'might'.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* ''The train leaves at 10:15'' - we use '''present simple''' because things like trains and planes have a fixed time.
|}

* Generally ''going to'' and ''present continuous'' are interchangeable but if you use present continuous you '''must say when''' the event is happening.
* Present simple is not commonly used in English to talk about the future except in cases like school subjects, cinema times, and train and bus times.
* In spoken English the phrase 'going to' is normally contracted and pronounced as 'gonna'.

== Speaking about the future ==

''Work with a partner, if you can, and ask/answer these questions. If you're on your own you should think about these questions and write your answers instead.''

* What are you doing at the weekend?
* If the weather's hot tomorrow, what will you do?
* Who do you think will win the next World Cup?
* Are you going on holiday this summer?
* If a friend needs money, will you lend them some?

== Exercises ==

      <comment>/* The six areas */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}

The purpose of a secondary assessment (composed of a head-to-toe, [[First Aid/History|history]] and [[First Aid/Vitals|vitals]]) is to continually monitor the victim’s condition and find any non-life-threatening conditions requiring treatment. A secondary assessment should be done for any victim requiring ambulance intervention, or if there is a concern that the victim’s condition may deteriorate. In some cases, you may want to do a shortened secondary survey - use your best judgment.

==Who is this for?==
The '''Head-to-toe''' assessment is a technique used by lay rescuers, first responders, and ambulance personnel to identify an injury or illness or determine the extent of an injury or illness.  

It is used on victims who meet the following criteria:
* Victim of trauma injuries (except minor injuries affecting peripheral areas, such as a skinned knee or paper cut)
* Unconscious victims
* Victims with very reduced level of consciousness

If a victim is found unconscious, and no history is available, you should initially assume that the unconsciousness is caused by trauma, and where possible immobilize the spine, until you can establish an alternative cause.

The secondary assessment should be performed on all the victim meeting the criteria (especially trauma) regardless of gender of rescuer or victim.  However, you should be sensitive to gender issues here (as with all aspects of first aid), and if performing a full body check on a member of the opposite sex, it is advisable to ensure there is an observer present, for your own protection.  In an emergency however, victim care always takes priority.

===Priority of ABCs===
The head-to-toe should be completed after the primary survey, so you are already confident in the victim having a patent airway, and satisfactory breathing and circulation.

You should always make ABCs a priority when dealing with victims who are appropriate for a secondary survey.  In the case of trauma victims, where the victim is conscious and able to talk, keep talking to them throughout.  This not only acts to reassure them and inform them what you're doing, but will assure you that they have a patent airway and are breathing.

For unconscious victims, if you are on your own, check the ABCs between checking every body area, or if you are with another competent person, make sure they check ABCs continuously whilst you perform the survey.

Remember that if the person is unconscious and if you know or suspect it to be a trauma injury (evidence of blood, fall etc.) than you '''MUST''' treat it as a potential spinal injury in the first instance.  This is because in trauma, any blow to the head sufficient to cause unconsciousness is also sufficient to cause spinal injury.  In this case ''immobilization of the head, neck and spine takes priority over the secondary survey.'' If you have a second rescuer or bystander, then have them immobilize while you perform the head-to-toe.

==What is being looked for?==
The head-to-toe is a detailed examination where you should look for abnormality.  This can take the form of asymmetry; deformity; bruising; point tenderness (wincing or guarding - don't necessarily expect them to tell you); minor bleeding; and medic alert bracelets, anklets, or necklaces.  

It is important to remember that some people naturally have unusual body conformation, so be sensitive about this, but don't be afraid to ask the conscious victim or relatives if this is normal for them.  It is always worth looking for symmetry - if it is the same both sides, the chances are, it's normal.

==The six areas==
Divide the body into 6 areas; after you examine each area, you reassess ABCs.
*'''Head and neck''' - The head and neck are important areas to assess, and you should take time and care to look for any potential problems.
** '''Head''' - Using both hands (with gloves on), gently run your hands across the skull, pressing in gently but firmly, starting at the forehead and working around to the back of the head.  Feel for indentations, look for blood or fluid and watch the victim for signs of discomfort.  If it is a trauma injury, check both ears and nose for signs of blood or CSF (cerebral spinal fluid).  
** '''Neck''' - The neck is an important area.  Start at the sides of the neck and gently press in.  Watch carefully for signs of pain.  Move around until you reach the spine, moving as far down the neck as possible without moving them, if they are on their back.  If there is pain, tenderness or deformity here, then you should stop the survey and immediately immobilize the neck, placing one hand on each side of the head, with the thumb around the ear.  This is most comfortable done from 'above' with the victim lying supine on their back, although you should support the victim in the position you find them.  If there is room, you can also lie on your front, with your elbows on the floor to support the head.  If there are two people, one should immobilize the head, whilst the other continues the survey.  If there is only one person, immobilize the head and wait for help.

*'''Shoulders, chest and back''' - This area of the body contains many of the vital organs, such as the heart and lungs, so it is important to look for damage which could indicate internal injury.
**'''Shoulders''' - You should try and expose the shoulders if possible, looking for obvious deformity, especially around the collar bones.  You can try pressing along the line of the collar bone, watching for deformity or pain.  You should then place a hand on each shoulder, and gently push down, looking to ensure that one side does not move more than the other.
**'''Chest''' - The chest is ideally done exposed, although you should be aware of the sensitivity of females to this, and if you are able to keep breasts covered, it is advisable to do so.  You should be looking for sections of the chest which are out of line with the rest of it, or which are moving differently to the rest of the chest whilst breathing.  You should also look for obvious wounds.  You can then gently press on the chest.  The best way to do this is to imagine the chest divided in to four quarters running neck to stomach.  You should place one hand (balled as a fist works well here, to avoid concerns over excess touching) and press down one on the left and one on the right in each quarter (avoiding breasts if applicable).  You are watching for one side moving differently to the other, or for pain being caused.
**'''Back''' - If the victim is lying on their side, or front, you can also feel down their spine.  If they are lying on their back, then skip this part of the check, and leave it for the ambulance crew.

*'''Arms and hands''' - Run both your hands down one arm at a time, looking for deformity or pain.  

*'''Abdomen''' - The abdomen contains the remainder of the body's critical organs, such as the intestines, so it should be checked for potential damage.  The abdomen is mostly done by gentle pushing, using the flat of your hands.  Again, use symmetry, and push both sides simultaneously.  Check if the abdomen feels hard (called 'boarded') or for pain caused by the palpation.

*'''Pelvis'''  - The pelvis (hips) is a large bone, with potential for a fair amount of damage.  The main diagnostic test to place a hand on each hip and first gently compress the hips together with both hands (there should be very little movement, and little to no pain).  If the patient has moderate to severe pain when the hips are compressed, or the hips move when compressed, '''do not''' rock the hips from side to side. If there is no pain or movement, gently push down on the hips in a &quot;rocking&quot; motion to see if there is any movement.

*'''Legs and feet''' - As with arms, use both hands at the same time, running them down the inside and outside of each leg simultaneously (avoiding the groin area on the inside).  You should also look for any shortening or rotation of one leg compared to the other.  Finally, you take each foot, check that it has normal motility (can be moved normally) and has no obvious injuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}

==History==
Taking a victim history is a crucial step. If an ambulance needs to be called and the victim is conscious, taking a history before the victim's condition worsens will assist the responding paramedics and the emergency department to better help the victim and be aware of medical conditions the victim is suffering from.

Some common things to ask for in a history are can be remembered using the acronym '''SAMPLE''':
{{FA Best Practice|If possible, write these down for quick reference later!}}

;Signs / Symptoms 
:What is the problem?

;Allergies
:Are you allergic to anything?

;Medications
:Do you take any medications?

;Past medical history
:Do you have any medical conditions (angina, high blood pressure, diabetes…)?
:Have you been in the hospital before?
:Are you currently under the care of a physician for anything?

;Last oral intake
:When did you last eat and drink?

;Events (leading to illness or injury)
:Do you remember what happened?
:What were you doing this this happened?


The acronym '''OPQRST''' can help you remember what questions to ask about pain.

;Pain assessment
:'''O'''nset (when did it start?)
:'''P'''rovokes (what makes it feel better/worse?)
:'''Q'''uality of pain (sharp/dull, squeezing…)
:'''R'''adiating pain? (does it spread anywhere?)
:'''S'''everity of pain (on a scale from 1 to 10)
:'''T'''iming (Constant? For how long?)

;Important Information
:Name, date of birth, age, sex, address…

;Next of Kin
:Is there anyone you would like contacted?

==Introduction==
'''Internal bleeding''' is bleeding which occurs inside the body. Sometimes the blood will leak from inside the body through natural openings. Other times the blood stays inside the body, causing pain and [[first Aid/Shock|shock]], even though you cannot see the blood loss.

==Causes==

Internal bleeding can be caused numerous ways.  Any time someone could have internal bleeding, you will do no harm by treating them for internal bleeding, but not treating the victim could lead to death.

Some causes include:
*Falls
*Car Accidents
*Motorcycle Accidents
*Pedestrians Struck by a Vehicle
*Gun Shot Wounds
*Injuries from Explosions
*Impaled Objects
*Stab Wounds
*Surgery

==Recognition==
A person may be bleeding internally if one of these things happens:
*Blood comes out of the nose or mouth (occurs from severe head trauma)
*Blood or clear fluid comes out of the ear (occurs from severe head trauma)
*Blood is in the stool
*Blood is in the urine
*Bright red blood, or blood like 'coffee-grounds', is in the vomit
*Blood comes from a woman's vagina (birth canal) after an injury or during pregnancy
*Bruising over the abdominal or chest area
*Pain over vital organs
*[[First Aid/Fractures#Femoral fractures|Fractured femur]]

But remember, a person may be bleeding inside the body, even though you cannot see the bleeding. If you see the signs of shock and no apparent injuries, always suspect internal bleeding. Check the skin color changes. In cases of internal bleeding the skin may become pale and cold, and cyanosis may be present.

==Treatment==
{{FA Best Practice|Any time there is the possibility of internal bleeding, it is crucial to treat as if there is internal bleeding.  Not treating may result in death, but treating when there is no injury will not result in harm.}}
As with any victim, before treating, put on disposable gloves and take other necessary body substance isolation precautions.
*Check the victim's ABCs.
**If the victim has ABC complications, treat those first - ABCs always take priority.
*'''Call an ambulance'''
*Treat for [[First Aid/Shock|shock]]
**Assist the victim into the most comfortable position
*Monitor ABCs and [[First Aid/Vitals|vitals]] until the ambulance arrives

A '''Stroke''' is a small blockage in a blood vessel of the brain, which causes oxygen starvation to that part.  This oxygen starvation can cause a loss of function, related to the area of the brain affected.  Dependant on the length of time the area is blocked, the damage may become irreparable. The blockage is usually caused by a small blood clot, although incursions such as air bubbles can have the same effect.

There are two main types of stroke - a '''CVA''' (Cerebro-vascular Accident - sometimes called just a stroke or major stroke) and a '''TIA''' (Transient Ischaemic Attack - sometimes called a mini-stroke).  

The difference between a CVA and a TIA is simply the duration of the symptoms. If the symptoms pass in the first 24 hours, the underlying condition is called a TIA. If the symptoms persist, then it is categorized as a stroke. Obviously, for the purposes of first aid, these must be treated in the same way, since waiting 24 hours for symptoms to pass in order to tell CVA and TIA apart would not meet the purposes of first aid.

==Recognition==
{{FA Best Practice|To test for the affected side of a stroke, have the victim squeeze your hands at the same time. You will notice a difference in pressure that they may not.}}
The key recognition signs for a stroke can be remembered with the acronym FAST, which stands for:
*'''Facial Weakness''' - Can the person smile correctly?  Observe if one side of the face droops.  
*'''Arm Weakness''' - Can the person raise both arms and hold them parallel without one drifting? If they squeeze your hands can they exert equal force?
*'''Speech problems''' - Can the person speak clearly and repeat a simple sentence correctly?
*'''Time''' - Call the local emergency medical services phone number or take the patient to the hospital immediately.  

The victim may also experience additional symptoms, which on their own typically do not indicate a stroke.  These include:
*Sudden blurred, dim or patchy vision
*Sudden dizziness
*Sudden, severe, unusual headache

==Treatment==
===Conscious victim===

*Every second counts.
*Call for an ambulance
*Reassure the victim
*Encourage and facilitate the victim to move in to a position of comfort if possible.  If they have significant paralysis, they may be unable to move themselves, so you should make them as comfortable as possible where they are.  If possible, incline them to the unaffected side (if there is one), as this will help you relieve some symptoms such as a feeling of floating.
*Take vitals, history and regular observations

===Unconscious victim===
*Call for an ambulance
*Assess the victim's ABCs (attempt CPR if not breathing)
*Assist the victim into the recovery position on their '''unaffected''' side where gravity may assist blood to reach the injured side of the brain, which is then below the unaffected side of the brain. Additionally, bleeding (if any) may drain out the ear.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Asthma before-after.png|thumb|Asthma attacks are characterized by inflammation of the airway, which restricts air exchange.]]
Asthma is a medical condition which causes swelling of the airway, constricting airflow.

Hyperventilation is simply breathing at an inappropriately high rate.

==Recognition==
Asthma is characterized by difficulty breathing, wheezing, increased secretions in the airway, and a history of asthma.
Hyperventilation can be recognized by fast breathing which is inappropriate for the circumstances, a feeling of not being able to catch one's breath, and lightheadedness.

==Treatment==

'''For Asthma'''
[[Image:Astma-medication.png|thumb|Asthma inhalers come in several styles.  The one on the left is not a fast-acting inhaler, and should not be administered in an asthma attack]]
*'''If the victim has a fast-acting inhaler for asthma attacks, encourage them to use it.''' You may [[First_Aid/Legal_Liability#Assisting_with_Medications|assist]] with finding the inhaler.
*Have the victim match your breathing patterns - calm the victim while slowing their breathing rate
*Assist the casualty to sit in a position which relieves pressure on the chest. The tripod position is ideal - sitting up, leaning slightly forward, supporting their weight with their arms either on their knees or on a table or the like in front of them.
*Call EMS if the victim's condition does not improve or if the victim's level of consciousness is lowered

'''For Hyperventilation'''
The aim is to calm the casualty down, to reduce their rate of breathing, and if possible to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air they breathe, perhaps by getting them to breathe into a paper bag.

Electrocution is a related set of injuries caused by direct contact with live electrical connections.  The effects can vary from  minor to causing cardiac arrest.

==Actions and Treatment==
{{FA Caution|Before attempting to treat an electrocution victim, ensure they are not still in contact with live electricity.  Turn off the power at the main or remove the victim from contact using a non-conducting material, such as a wooden pole.}}
*'''Be aware of Danger''' - The clear danger in this situation is the electrical supply. 
**If the victim is still touching a live electrical source, either turn off the power to the source, or break the victim's contact with it. Find a non-conductive object (wooden broom handles are commonly used) and break the contact between the victim and the source.  Should the victim be in contact with downed power lines, do not attempt a rescue.  Instead, call 911 and wait for professional rescuers to come and ensure the power lines are no longer live.
*'''Call an ambulance immediately''' - all victims of electrocution, whether conscious or unconscious require assessment in hospital.
*After ensuring the area is safe, begin a primary assessment - '''check ABCs &amp; begin CPR if required'''.
*Conduct a secondary assessment looking specifically for 2 electrical burns.
**Electrical burns look like third-degree burns, but are not surrounded by first- and second-degree burns. They always come in pairs: an entry wound (smaller) and exit wound (larger). You should cover the wounds with nonstick, sterile dressings.  Remember that the most serious problem is rarely the burn, and cardiac arrest is very possible.

===Electrocution causing unconsciousness===
Serious electrocution may cause unconsciousness, at least for a brief period. If this is the case, conduct your primary assessment by checking ABCs. If they are not breathing, begin CPR.  Airway swelling can occur from being electrocuted.  Frequently check the victim's breathing.

If the victim received a serious electric shock, do not put the victim in the recovery position.  Head/neck/back injuries along with multiple fractures can occur from strong muscle contractions from being electrocuted.   Begin a secondary assessment, looking specifically for 2 or more electrical burns - one entrance wound and one exit wound.  Continually evaluate the ABCs.  Cardiac rhythm disturbances can quickly cause the victim to go into cardiac arrest.

===Electrocution not causing unconsciousness===
Those victims who are not rendered unconscious are likely to feel unwell after the experience, and may well complain of numbness or pins &amp; needles in the area where through the electricity has passed.  These victims must still be transported to a hospital for evaluation, as heart rhythm disturbances can lead to cardiac arrest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use your feet==

The choice of where you place your feet is the major determiner of where you can go next.  

===Lead with your feet===

Your reach extends only as far as you are tall, so to reach farther you have to move your feet up.  Obvious, but new climbers tend to focus only on their hands and the direction they are going -- up -- and forget that their feet have to move up the wall too.  If you do this, you'll become extremely stretched out on the wall.  It's really hard to move out of this position.  It'll be hard to see where to place your feet because your torso is pulled in so close to the wall, and it will be hard to actually make the next move.  A better technique is to move the feet up, which moves the torso up, which increases the range of holds that the hands can reach.  Moving the feet up first also bends the knees and hips which gives the climber leverage, and makes climbing up easier.  You do want to stay in close to the wall, but as I'll talk about later, generally you want to twist and keep one side (not your front) in to the wall so that the other side is free to move.  Avoid becoming too stretched out as it limits your options.

===Place your feet quickly===

When climbing, you want to save your strength for big moves that really require it.  Try to avoid whittling away your reserves by using your arms when you could be using your feet throughout the climb.  The muscles in your legs are larger and stronger than the muscles in your arms, and you want to try to use this fact to your advantage as much as possible.  To do this, keep your feet on the wall!  Avoid leaving limbs dangling.  Before making a move, think about where your feet are going next.  After you make the move, place your feet back on the wall as quickly as possible to minimize the time that you are holding your body weight with your arms.

==Use your legs==

As noted above, your legs are stronger than your arms and you should use this to your advantage.  Your legs carry your weight every day, but routinely your arms only carry a fraction of it.  New climbers tend to focus on their arms and pull themselves up the wall.  One of the most common excuses I hear from people who think they can't climb is &quot;but I have no upper body strength&quot;.  This statement is misguided because massive upper body strength isn't necessary at all.  Overusing your arms and neglecting your legs is simply bad technique.  Practice using your legs to push yourself up, and using your arms only for balance.  Step up to a foot hold and stand up on it by straightening your leg and keeping your hips in to the wall, while at the same time putting as little weight as possible into your hands.  (This is easiest to practice on slab or on a wall that's a few degrees from vertical.)  This technique will teach you to use your body mechanics efficiently.  

Keeping weight out of your hands will also aid in not overgripping (holding on with more strength than is strictly necessary).

Pushing with your legs will also be covered in the section on stemming when talking about using opposing forces.

===Place your feet carefully and firmly===

Your feet should not make noise when you place them on the hold.  If they are, you are wasting energy by bringing them down faster and harder than is necessary.  If your feet are making noise then your foot placement is also likely to be a little sloppy and uncontrolled.

Climb using the edges of your feet.  Aim to place the ball of your big toe on the hold.  Avoid using the ball of your foot, as using your toe will give you a little more reach, and a little more leverage -- often that's all that is needed to get through the crux of a climb.  Climbing shoes are designed to make this efficient.  They draw your toes together, giving you a smaller surface to place on the rock, minimizing the size of the foothold you'll need.  

Once you have placed your foot, press it firmly downwards and into the wall.  Keeping tension in your leg will reduce the chance of your foot slipping, and will of course move you upwards.  

See also the section on shifting your weight for advanced foot placement techniques.

Other foot placement techniques involve using your heel hooked around a hold to pull yourself towards it. I'll talk about these in detail in later sections.

===Smear===

Smearing is the technique of pushing the flat of your foot on the wall where there is no foothold.  The friction between the sole of your shoe and the wall is enough to hold your weight up.  It creates a point of contact with the wall to maintain balance while you make a move.  As soon as you are able, move the smearing foot back to a foothold.  The keys to smearing are the force and direction in which you push into the wall.  Friction is proportional to the amount of force applied, so use a lot of muscle to press your foot into the wall.  The harder you push, the less likely your foot is to slip off.  Also you want to be going up (presumably), so the force should be directed slightly downwards (not just perpendicular to the wall), to give you a bit of help.

===Trust your feet===

Yes, the hold is small.  Yes, you can stand on it.  Yes, it will hold your weight.  

Like a ballet shoe, climbing shoes are designed to cram your toes together into a point.  This focuses your weight into a smaller area, making it easier to stand on smaller things.  It's not natural to stand with only the ball of your big toe on a 5mm (or smaller!) wide ledge, but it is possible, and it is good climbing technique.  Learning to trust your feet is necessary to climb harder routes strictly from a physical perspective.  It is absolutely essential from a mental perspective to allow you to be comfortable on the rock.  If you are constantly questioning if the hold is good enough to step on, then you can't concentrate on the sequence of moves you are executing, and you'll psych yourself out.

==Understand gravity and the forces you exert to oppose it==

It takes time, but after enough practice you will begin to develop an intuitive sense for how shifting your limbs changes your centre of gravity and how your body will shift on the rock.  With that understanding, you can start using the way your body shifts to your advantage.  

===Keep your hips close to the wall===

Keeping your body close to the wall accomplishes three things: first, it decreases the distance you have to move to get to the next hold, second, it increases the effectiveness of your footholds, and finally it decreases the amount of force in your arms that you need to hold yourself up.  This is true whether the wall is vertical or overhung.  

===Flag===

Picture the following: you are standing on two footholds which are at the same height, and you have your left hand on a generous handhold.  The next hold is farther left.  Imagine matching on the rightmost hand hold, then reaching for the next hold with your left hand, all while keeping your feet where they started.  If the second hold is far enough to the left, this will shift your centre of gravity far enough to the left that your right side will start to spin out from the wall, and it can be very hard to keep holding on to the new hold with your left hand.  

Now imagine the same initial situation and again match hands on the first hand hold.  This time though, as you move your left hand out to the next hold to the left, also move your right leg out to the right.  This will keep your centre of gravity over your left leg, and will reduce torque.  As you do this, also twist your torso to the right so that you are reaching backwards with your left hand for the hold out to the left.  This will maximize your reach (see the section on reaching backwards) and will make flagging with your right leg easier as it will be moving out in front of you, not out to the side. 

A slightly more awkward, but possible technique is to flag with your left foot to the right.  From the same starting situation, switch feet so your right foot is where your left was originally.  As you reach for the hold to the left with your left hand, move your left leg to the right behind your right leg to counterbalance.  This configuration may be useful depending on the rest of the climb.

===Avoid barndooring===

When you have the points of contact between your body and the wall are all to the left or all to the right, gravity will want to pull your body out from the wall. This is called &quot;barn-dooring&quot;, as your points of contact act like a hinge and your body rotates around it, away from the wall. To prevent this from happening, either make sure that your center of gravity is between your holds (for example, using your left hand and your right foot as opposed to left hand and left foot), or you can flag to balance out where you body is as compared to the holds.

===Use opposing forces (Stemming)===

We've already talked about the importance of pushing your feet into the wall when you climb.  Stemming is the art of managing these forces to help you climb up.  Think about climbing up the inside of a narrow chimney.  You can press a foot into the wall in front of you, the other into the wall behind you, and use these forces to hold your weight up.  Then, press your hands into opposite walls, and one at a time, shift both feet up a foot or so, then stand up on your legs.  Repeat.  This is technique of using opposing forces is called stemming, and it's applicable to many more frequently encountered situations.

Stemming is not useful only in chimneys or in situations where two walls meet at an angle.  You will find it useful, especially when climbing a route with many slopers, to push off a lower hold to be able to reach for a higher hold.

===Shift your weight===

Often times, a hold may only be good if pulled at from one direction; however, you may not be pulling from that direction when you first use the hold. In order to get a better grip, you will need to shift your weight, so that gravity is pulling you into the hold instead of away. A similar problem occurs when making a horizontal or diagonal move, where reaching for the hold will move you off balance. To compensate, first shift your weight towards where the hold is, so that you remain supported while reaching.

==Maximize your reach==

===Reach backwards===

People who start climbing want to face towards their next hold as they are reaching for it.  Due to the way the shoulder is constructed, turning away from the next hold and reaching backwards for it actually allows a farther reach than reaching forwards does.  Think about how you would reach for something that is far under a bed, and use the same twisting motion in your climbing.

===Stand up===

Another tendency of beginning climbers is to not take full advantage of the holds available to them.  For example, if you have a foot on a hold with your knee bent, stand up before reaching for the next hand hold.  Maximize your upwards extension on the available holds before reaching for new hand holds.  Keep your arms straight as you do this so as to not pump out your biceps.  (There is one situation in which this is not good advice -- if your hand holds are slopers, it's often better to stay underneath or to one side of them.)  This is strongly related to keeping your hips close to the wall -- if you do that, you will naturally keep your legs straighter.

===Highstep/Hand-Foot Match===

===Bump===

Bumping is another technique to gain a few more inches.  If the rock is such that the only hold within reach is too small to hang off but just a little farther up is a much more generous hold, you can bump.  Move to the lower hold, and quickly use it to gain more momentum, so that you can reach the next solid hold.

==Plan your route==

As you are climbing, think at least one move ahead.  Make sure that where you place your right hand now is where you want your right hand so that you can move your left.  Same for your feet.  It doesn't always make sense to grab the first available hold, especially if the climb veers to one side.  If you are climbing to the right and moving your right hand, move two holds over so that you can move your left rightwards without having to match.  This will make your climbing smoother.  

Pay attention to the shape of the holds.  If they are only positive (allow for a good grip) on the left hand side, then place your body to the right of the holds, so you can more effectively resist gravity.

==Be elegant==

===Just enough force===

Easy climbs tend to have holds with enough grip that launching oneself towards the wall can be compensated for by pulling on the holds.  Not only will this stop working as the holds become smaller and balance more important, but it also wastes energy.  Use only enough force to reach the hold, don't overshoot.  (This is related to stepping lightly.)  Similarly, use only enough force to grip the hold; don't waste energy squeezing the rock harder than is necessary to hold on.  

===Fluidity===

Good climbers make climbing look effortless.  One aspect of achieving this is maintaining momentum from move to move.  If you are planning ahead, don't stop at each move; flow between moves.

==Be bold==

A lot of moves in a climbing route may seem difficult at first, especially if you are lead climbing. Psychologically, this makes it difficult to fully commit to the move, since your body is tensing up in anticipation of falling. Remember, however, that all the equipment is there to keep you safe, and that you are usually protected from injury even if you don't make the move. Getting over this psychological fear - being bold on a problem - will help you focus on the climb instead of the fall.

      <comment>/* Why are substances coloured? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spectroscopy''' is the study of the interaction between radiation (electromagnetic radiation or particle radiation) and matter. In ''Chemical Ideas'', the whole of '''Chapter 6: Radiation and matter''' is devoted to spectroscopy. It covers both how and why radiation interacts with matter, and how such interactions are applied.

There are several different '''spectroscopic techniques''' discussed in ''Salters Advanced Chemistry''.  They are:

* [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/IR|infrared spectroscopy (IR)]]
* nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
* ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis)
* mass spectrometry (MS)

In addition, laser microspectral analysis (LMA) is briefly mentioned in the ''Chemical Storylines'' chapter ''Colour by Design''.

There are many other kinds of spectroscopy used by scientists every day, but the ones mentioned here are the most important to chemistry as a whole.

== Colour ==
=== Why are substances coloured? ===
We'll consider the major reason for the colour of substances: absorption of light.  There are other ways in which a substance can exhibit colour — it can scatter or emit light, for instance — but these effects are best discussed elsewhere.

The reason substances are coloured is usually that they absorb ''some'' energies of visible light, but transmit or reflect the rest. All energies except those absorbed are detected in our eyes. Our brains then interpret this distribution of photons of different energies as a particular colour.

The colour wheel helps predict how our brains interpret different distributions of photon energy.  White light (e.g. sunlight) contains photons of every possible energy, i.e. the entire visible spectrum. This distribution of photon energies stimulates the eyes and brain in a way that we perceive as white.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Blue-solution-absorbing-orange-photons-2D.png|a blue solution absorbs orange light
Image:Solution-transmitting-photons-2D.png|a colourless solution transmits all visible light
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== What is light? ===
When we talk about light in science, we usually mean electromagnetic radiation in all its forms.  This includes not just visible light, but the entire electromagnetic spectrum, covering everything from γ-rays to radio waves.

Electromagnetic radiation consists of particles called photons. Any particular photon has a specific amount of energy, which determines its frequency and wavelength.

=== Why do all substances absorb electromagnetic radiation? ===
All substances have electrons in them, and electrons occupy energy levels. All substances also contain vacant energy levels that are capable of containing an electron, but are not occupied.

An electron in a substance can move from the energy level it occupies to a vacant energy level that is higher in energy.  This move requires the electron to acquire a precise quantity of energy. The electron can absorb a photon if the photon has that exact amount of energy.  By absorbing the photon, the electron increases in energy by exactly the right amount and moves to the vacant energy level.

=== Why do some substances absorb visible light? ===
Substances that absorb visible light are ones that have two energy levels whose energy difference is in the visible range, 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J − 5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J. Such substances can absorb photons of this energy range.


A photon whose energy is between 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J − 5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J has a wavelength between 700 nm and 400 nm and a frequency between 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz and 7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz.


In a nutshell,

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{if } 2.8 \times 10^{-19} \mbox{ J} \le \Delta E \le 5.0 \times 10^{-19} \mbox{ J} \mbox{, the substance will absorb visible light }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Why do most transition metal complexes absorb visible light? ===

In transition metal complexes, we can define what we mean by energy levels more carefully. By energy levels, we mean [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Atomic orbitals|orbitals]]. Electrons in a transition metal complex can be moved from their normal orbital to a higher-energy orbital.

In its normal orbital, call it Orbital 1, an electron has a particular amount of energy, &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;.

In the higher-energy orbital, call it Orbital 2, the electron has a greater amount of energy, &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The energy difference between the two situations is &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = E_2 - E_1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Photon-absorption-in-a-molecule-1.png|&lt;center&gt;Orbital 1 is occupied by an electron, while Orbital 2 is vacant&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Photon-absorption-in-a-molecule-2.png|&lt;center&gt;The electron absorbs a photon with the correct energy and is promoted from Orbital 1 to Orbital 2&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Photon-absorption-in-a-molecule-3.png|&lt;center&gt;Orbital 1 is now vacant and Orbital 2 is occupied&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

When a photon arrives at Orbital 1, the electron may be able to absorb the photon.

If &lt;math&gt;E_{photon} &lt; \Delta E&lt;/math&gt;, the photon does not have enough energy to promote the electron from Orbital 1 to Orbital 2, so the electron cannot absorb the photon.

If &lt;math&gt;E_{photon} &gt; \Delta E&lt;/math&gt;, the photon has too much energy to promote the electron from Orbital 1 to Orbital 2, so the electron cannot absorb the photon.

If &lt;math&gt;E_{photon} = \Delta E&lt;/math&gt;, the photon has exactly the right amount of energy to promote the electron from Orbital 1 to Orbital 2. The electron can and does absorb the photon. The electron acquires the photon's energy and is promoted from Orbital 1 to Orbital 2.

==Burns==
For burns, see [[First Aid/Burns| Thermal Burns]]

==Heat Cramps==

Heat cramps usually occur when a person has been active in hot weather and is dehydrated.

Treating heat cramps is very simple, do the following:

*Remove the victim from the hot environment, a shady area will suffice.
*Stretch the calf and thigh muscles gently through the cramp. This usually results in immediate relief.
*Hydrate the victim, use a small concentration of salt for best results. (''ex. Giving the person a saltine cracker to eat while drinking.'')
*Have the victim rest.

Should the cramping continue, seek further medical advice.

==Heat Exhaustion==
Heat exhaustion is a milder form of heat-related illness that can develop after several days of exposure to high temperatures and inadequate or unbalanced replacement of fluids. Those most prone to heat exhaustion are elderly people, people with high blood pressure, and people working or exercising in a hot environment.

=== Symptoms of Heat Exhaustion ===
* Confused
* Heavy sweating
* Paleness
* Muscle cramps
* Tiredness
* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea or vomiting
* Fainting
* Sickness

=== Treatment of Heat Exhaustion ===

*Loosen the clothing.
*Apply cool wet cloths.
*Move the victim to either a cool or an air-conditioned area, and fan the victim.

The treatment priority for heat exhaustion is to cool the victim. Heat exhaustion is not life-threatening (unlike heat stroke), so EMS is not needed unless the victim's condition worsens to the point of entering heat stroke. If the victim's level of consciousness is affected, that is heat stroke.

==Heat Stroke==
Heatstroke occurs when the core body temperature rises too far for the body's natural cooling mechanisms to function. It is a serious, life-threatening problem that can cause death in minutes. The treatment priority with heat stroke is to call EMS and ''cool the victim down''.

When you provide first aid for heatstroke, remember that this is a true life-and-death emergency. The longer the victim remains overheated, the higher the chances of irreversible body damage or even death occurring.

=== Symptoms of Heat Stroke ===

* Unconscious or has a markedly abnormal mental status
* Flushed, hot, and dry skin (although it may be moist initially from previous sweating or from attempts to cool the person with water)
* May experience dizziness, confusion, or delirium
* May have slightly elevated blood pressure at first that falls later
* May be hyperventilating
* Rectal (core) temperature of 105°F or more

=== Treatment of Heat Stroke ===
*Notify EMS.
*Cool the victim's body immediately by dousing the body with cold water.
:*Apply wet, cold towels to the whole body.
:*Pack ice into the victim's heat-loss areas (underarms, groin, neck). Do not let ice contact the victim's bare skin as this may cause frostbite!
:*Wetting and Evaporating measures work best. (Think, artificial sweating.)
*Move the victim to the coolest possible place and remove as much clothing as possible (ensure privacy).
*Maintain an open airway.
*Expose the victim to a fan or air-conditioner since drafts will promote cooling.
:*Immersing the victim in a cold water bath is also effective.
*Give the victim (if conscious) cool water to drink.
:*Do '''not''' give any hot drinks or stimulants.
:*'''Never''' give an unconscious victim something to drink as it may obstruct the airway or cause vomiting.
*Get the victim to a medical facility as soon as possible. Cooling measures must be continued while the victim is being transported.

Monitor the victim's vital signs frequently.
Be prepared to begin [[First Aid/CPR summary|CPR]] should the victim become unconscious and not be breathing.

      <comment>/* Hyperglycemia */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ FirstAidHeader}}

==Introduction==
;Diabetes: a disease causing an inability to regulate the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood

;Insulin: a hormone that allows glucose to travel from the bloodstream into the cells

==Hypoglycemia (Insulin Shock)==

Hypoglycemia is a diabetic condition where the body has an insufficient amount of blood sugar. It presents suddenly and should always be considered an emergency.  

===Causes===
*Lack of food (low glucose)
*Excessive exercise
*Too much insulin
*Vomited meal
===Recognition===
The hypoglycemic victim will present with the following symptoms and may appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It can also be confused with stroke or cardiac disorders. 
*Pale, cool, clammy
*Dizziness, weakness
*Hunger
*Confusion (like being drunk)
*Strong, rapid pulse (May be normal in some patients)
*Seizures

===Treatment===
[[Image:Glukometr OT.jpg|thumb|If possible, have the victim test the glucose level to correctly identify Hypoglycemia or Hyperglycemia.]]
When hypoglycemia is suspected, notify EMS immediately. The victim should be transported to a hospital as soon as possible. Treat the victim for shock and monitor their vital signs, including blood sugar readings (if possible). If the patient is conscious and able to swallow, administer any form of glucose (candy juice, soda, Monogel) carefully. '''Don’t give glucose to an unconscious victim''' as it can easily become an airway obstruction. Some victims carry with them glucagon injections as a rapid treatment for severe insulin shock. The victim should know how to administer it, and should administer it himself.

==Hyperglycemia==

Hyperglycemia is a condition in which the body's blood sugar level is too high to maintain. This condition presents less commonly than hypoglycemia and usually occurs very slowly, over the course of several days. Although it is most commonly observed in diabetics, a mild form can also occur in anyone who consumes too much sugar. While the mild form can be harmless, aside from a general feeling of malaise, hyperglycemia in a diabetic is a serious, potentially life threatening situation that requires prompt identification and treatment. Left untreated, ketoacidosis can develop which might lead to a coma or death.   

There are several main causes of hyperglycemia. Generally it has to do with an imbalance between insulin and glucose. Without enough insulin, the body cannot break down glucose. A diabetic can be taking their normal insulin dosage and still have hyperglycemia. Should they fail to follow their standard dietary arrangements, the excess of food (and glucose) can rapidly overwhelm the body's stores of insulin. In addition to medication and dietary errors, the immune system can also be the culprit. When infection occurs, metabolism can be drastically increased. This surprise increase can, like excessive food, consume too much insulin. 

Regardless of the cause of a suspected case of hyperglycemia, the immediate priority for the first responder is recognizing hyperglycemia. The symptoms of a case are;

*Flush/redness of skin
*Fruity breath (sign of diabetic ketoacidosis) 
*Deep or rapid respirations
*Dehydration/extreme thirst/excessive urination
*Loss of appetite
*Low blood pressure
*Weakness/dizziness
*Weak, rapid pulse

Prompt treatment can prevent further complications and serious emergencies. EMS should be called immediately. Next, the first responder should focus on stabilizing the victim. Follow any instructions from the dispatcher as much as possible. Whenever contradicted by this section, follow the dispatcher. Every victim should be treated for shock and have their vital signs monitored constantly. Insulin is not an emergency medication and should not be given by the first aid provider. Improper administration of insulin can cause  insulin shock and cause unconsciousness.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Spike-waves.png|thumb|Random, uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain causes seizures.]]
A seizure occurs when the electrical activity of the brain becomes irregular. When the electrical activity is severely irregular, the result may be a seizure. ''A seizure is a medical emergency.'' Seizures may be caused by either an acute or chronic condition such as epilepsy.

Risk Factors for Seizures:
* Head trauma
* Infections and malignant or benign tumors of the brain or spinal cord
* [[First Aid/Epilepsy|Epilepsy]]

* [[First Aid/Stroke &amp; TIA|Stroke]]
* [[First Aid/Poisoning#Injection|Drug use]] or withdrawal
* [[First Aid/Diabetes|Hypoglycemia]] (Low Blood Sugar)
* [[First Aid/Heat-Related Illness &amp; Injury#Heat Stroke|Heat Stroke]]
* [[First Aid/Allergy]]
* Fever in infants
* Noncompliance with [[anticonvulsives]], lack of sleep, excessive stress, fever, severe infection,
  hypoglycemia or dehydration (lack of sufficient nutrition), and exposure to bright light can all  
  trigger seizures in those who have epilepsy or are otherwise predisposed to them

Often before a seizure occurs, the victim may feel an aura, which is an unusual sensation that typically precedes seizures. Auras may come in many forms, such as a strange taste in the mouth, tingling in the limbs, or the visual disturbance of &quot;flashing lights&quot;; often if the person is epileptic, they may be aware that a seizure is imminent and may tell others or sit or lie down to prevent injury.

==Recognition==
Typically seizures usually last no more than three minutes.  Some common occurrences during a seizure include stopped or irregular breathing, body rigidness or convulsing, defecation, urination, and drooling.  Some forms of seizure, such as [[Status Epilepticus]] or a &quot;Status seizure&quot; do not cease without medical intervention - a Status seizure is where the patient begins to have a seizure, and appears to come out of it, but without regaining consciousness immediately begins to seize again.

==Treatment==
{{FA X|'''Never''' try to restrain the seizure&lt;br&gt;'''Never''' put anything in the mouth}}
Seeing a seizure may be a frightening experience which may cause you hesitation to act to aid the victim.  However, it is very easy to care for the victim. '''Never''' attempt to hold them in any way to stop their seizure - the victim is unaware that it is occurring and is unable to control it. Attempting to restrain an individual having a seizure may result in injuries to both you and the victim. Also, '''do not''' attempt to stick anything into the victim's mouth - the victim will not swallow their tongue and sticking something in their mouth can cause further injury or death.  The tongue may obstruct the airway during the seizure, but this is normal.

In the event of a Status seizure being noticed, as described above, it is important to get Emergency help as quickly as possible - you should explain to any call handler or dispatcher that the patient is having a continuous seizure.  These types of seizure can only be terminated by the administration (by trained EMS personnel or an MD) of Diazepam, usually anally or via intramuscular injection.

Care for Seizures:
# Call EMS or have someone call for you
# Move anything the victim can injure themselves with away from the victim such as chairs or other objects
# Gently support the victim's head to prevent it from hitting the ground
# Request that all bystanders move away (persons having a seizure are often embarrassed after their seizure)
# After the seizure has ended, roll the victim into the recovery position '''but only if you do not suspect a spinal injury'''

After the seizure, the victim will slowly &quot;awaken.&quot; Ensure that bystanders are away and offer reassurance for the victim. Victims who have a seizure in public are often self-conscious about their condition. The victim will be very tired after his seizure. Continue to reassure the victim until he or she is fully aware of the surroundings or until EMS arrives.

2 thing: first I'm not sure it is a very easy to prepare and get it the right way, it takes lots of effort, although it's easy to describe how to do it, but doing it is a different story. Second and most importantly, is it possible to retain the original wikepedia page?!! it used to rank first if you search for Toum in Google, obviously Google algorithms rank wikipedia much higher than wikibooks, and then many ppl just bang their search string in wikipedia and rare are those who would go to check wikibooks. In fact I had to go search for deleted articles to pinpoint the Toum article and their I found out that it was moved to wikibooks....
I feel it's a shame there is not seemless connection between wikipedia and its sister project, I can't understand why do I need different logins for each project (and even the same project in different languages!!!)[[User:Charbel|Charbel]] 22:57, 13 May 2007 (UTC) (the writer of the original Toum article)

:G'day Charbel, glad to see you found us! The reason the toum recipe cannot exist in Wikipedia is that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, and does not attempt to be a recipe book (nor does it [[w:WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE|want to be]]). This does not mean you can't have an article on toum in wikipedia, however; it just must be encyclopaedic, and meet Wikipedia's article requirements.
:Wikibooks, however, is a good place for [[WB:WIW|instruction books]], and the Cookbook welcomes recipes like this one. Note that we would very much like some measurements, so we'd love you to edit the recipe to give some indication of relative amounts. As for Google, I see that the Wikibooks Cookbook recipe for toum is about 4th on the list when I Google from Australia.
:On the subject of logins, I think I saw somewhere that there is a move to provide for more seamless logins across different WikiMedia projects. Until then, however, we all maintain separate logins as necessary.
:Anyway, glad to see you here, and I hope you feel inclined to contribute more of your recipes! cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:40, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

::Greetings Charbel and Webaware. I've added some measurements, cleaned up the grammar, and added alternate prep methods (I use a food processor after smashing the garlic to a smooth paste). [[User:Rainbowcats|Rainbowcats]] ([[User talk:Rainbowcats|talk]]) 22:28, 4 December 2009 (UTC)

The original Toum is prepared with vegetable oil and not Olive oil and the Toum in the picture is yellow but the original Toum is white. Mohamad

I made a few minor edits of capitalization and abbreviation, and took out the word 'olive' in the recipe, since the ingredients list specifically mentions NOT using olive oil. I also added a brief explanation towards the end about the pros and cons of using olive oil. I also upped the difficulty rating to 2. Toum isn't dead simple to make, and a lot of factors can make it not work! I'd be curious to know if anyone knows the effects of temperature of the ingredients on the process. If so, it'd be nice to add this to the recipe. Todobear</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A one-pot meal is any meal that can be cooked entirely in one pot.  Often, dehydrated foods are used for this, as they are extremely space and weight efficient.  You can buy many dehydrated food packages at an outdoor outfitter, but the selection is limited for the observant Adventist.  Many of these foods contain unclean meats (Lev 11) or wine, but there are a few that meet Adventist dietary requirements.  If one turns from the outfitters and looks in a grocery store, even more choices are available.  Many rice mixes are ideal candidates as one-pot meals (red beans and rice, dirty rice, etc.).  Soup mixes also work well, as do pastas, macaroni and cheese, etc.

I think it is important to state that in Russian adjectives (even adjectival phrases or clauses) modifying nouns always precede them, unlike English. (That is also true of German and Dutch, BTW.[[User:Albertde|Albertde]]

Merged from [[Russian/Adjectives]]. Copied material here, dunno how to integrate yet.

== Tentative numbering system for US stamps==
Based on ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]]'' the following numbering system is being tried for US stamps

 Format  : CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
           ---   ----   ----   ----
 Example : USA - 1851 - 0101 - 3201
 
 where   : CCC  = 3-letter country code
                  (USA = United States)
           YYYY = 4-digit year of issue
                  (1851 = Year of issue)
           SS   = 2-digit series order (varies by year)
                  (01 = first (and only) series for 1851)
           DD   = 2-digit denomination order (varies by series)
                  (01 = 1-cent, 02 = 3-cent, 03 = 5-cent, etc.)
           TT   = 2-digit type and subtype (varies by denomination),   
                  (31 = Type III, 32 = Type IIIa)
           KK   = 2-digit color variation (varies by denomination),
                  (01 = first (and only) color for this denomination (blue))

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chess is, of course, a game of tactics and strategy, and the tactics described in the [[Chess/Tactics]] entry are important to any chess player. The right tactics can allow you to make quick gains of material, can protect you from quick losses of material, and can, ultimately, help you to win chess games. 

== Tactics Practice ==

Good chess players, then, must practice tactics. Consider the chess boards below. In each board white can win material by force, if he chooses his moves wisely and utilizes the tactics described in the [[Chess/Tactics]] entry. 

Play white first in each board (unless, of course, it is otherwise stated), and force material gains for white with the right tactics. The solutions are at the bottom of this page.

{{clear}}

== Solutions ==

1.
*1. '''d5''' + '''Ne7''' (White threatens knight with pawn, black moves knight, knight no longer guards '''b4'''.)  
*2. '''Qa4+'''... (Fork tactic; queen checks king, and threatens bishop. Black must concede bishop.) 

2.  
*1.'''Rxd7'''+ '''Kc8'''  ( if ...'''Nxd7??''', '''2. Qe8#''')
*2. '''Rd5+''' (if '''Re7'''+, '''Kb7''' and White risks losing an exchange) '''Kb7'''
** 2. '''Qc6''' is also acceptable. It is followed by ...'''Ra7''', '''Be6''' and eventual moves that clear black pawns on the right. 
*3. '''Rxe5''' '''Bd6'''
*4. '''Rh5''', and white wins a pawn while still being able to keep pressure on black. 

3.  
*1.'''Rf8'''+ '''Rxf8''' (...Ka7? 2.Bxe3+ b6 3.Rxh8) (White's rook forks check and black's rook, and discovers threat on black's knight from white's bishop.)
*2.'''Rxf8'''+ '''Ka7''' (Rook checks king. King moves diagonally.)
*3.'''Bxe3+''' (Bishop takes knight with check, gaining a piece and avoiding a checkmate on Rg1.)

4.  

This one is trickier:

*1. '''Rf5''' '''Ned7''' (2. ... Re8? 3. Raf1 Ned7 4. Qf2!) (White adds pressure to the knight forcing a withdraw.)
*2. '''Qf2''' '''Rg8''' (2. e5? Rb6 3. exf6 Qxe2) (White adds pressure to the other knight, preventing black from moving any of its defenders, and also protects the bishop. There are other responses for black, but this generates some offensive threats and is probably the best option.)
*3. '''e5!''' '''Rxg5''' (3. ... Nxe5? 4. Bxf6 Rxf6 5. Rxf6) (White's pawn move offers the most immediate reward in the impending exchange. White still has potential with 3. Bh4, but the gains, if any, will take many more turns to come to fruition. For example, 3. Bh4? Rg6 4. Rf1 Qe8! yields a situation far less favorable for white.)
*4. '''exd6''' '''Rxf5'''
*5. '''dxe7''' '''Rxf2''' 
*6. '''Kxf2''' (White does not necessarily have to allow the exchange happen to completion, but since white has a material advantage such simplification of the board is only to his or her benefit.)

This results in white having a bishop, a rook, and a pawn on the seventh rank versus two knights. From there, white can win a further few more pawns somewhat easily, giving a hefty material advantage. One might try the more immediate 1. c5 with the hope of 1. ... Rd5 2. Bxf6 but to do so is forgetting that 1. ... Rc6 is another response. Also, one might try 1. Bxf6 Rxf6 2. Qg7, with the idea that black cannot save both of the rooks at once, but this also does not work because of 2. ... Rxf1+. White must now play something like 3. Rxf1, which gives black the opportunity to save the rook on h8.

An alternate solution:

*1. '''Qf4'''; black's pinned knight is now en prise (thrice attacked, twice defended).
*1. ...'''Ned7''' defends for black (1. ...Ng6 is fruitless, as white needs simply relocate his queen, Qf5, and black is out of tricks)
*2. '''e5!''' and we see that white's first move was critical, preparing his e pawn to assume the now vacant e5 square, forking black's knight and rook.

5.  
*1.'''Qb3'''+ '''Kh7''' (...'''Rf7''' 2.'''Qxf7'''+ '''Kh7''') (White checks king with queen. King moves away.) 
*2.'''Rh1'''+ '''Qh5'''  (White checks king with rook. Black blocks with queen.)
*3.'''Rxh5'''+ '''gxh5''' (White exchanges rook for queen!)

Note the importance of white's knight in this exchange. It guarded '''f7''', preventing a simple defense of the initial check with '''Rf7'''.

6.  
*1.'''Nf6'''+ '''Kf8''' (...'''gxf6?''' 2.'''Bxf6 Nxa1''' 3.'''Rh8#''') ('''Nf6''' checks, and threatens two rooks. A naive defence of '''gxf6''' would result in checkmate.)
*2. '''Nxd7'''+ '''Kg8''' (Any other move allows 3. '''Rh8#''')
*3. '''Nf6'''+ leaving Black in the same bind, eventually winning Black's other rook as well.

7.  
*1.Rh3+ Kg8 
*2.e7+ d5 
*3.exd8=Q Rxd8 
*4.Qxc5 Bxh3 
*5.gxh3

8.  
*1.Rh8+ Kxh8 
*2.Qxf8+ Kh7 
*3.Qxg7#   -    
Also 1.Qe6+ Rf7 
2.Rf1 (Black's rook is pinned) Black cannot stop 
3.Qxf7#

9.  
*1.Rh7+ Kg8 
*2.Rcg7+ Kf8 
*3.Bd6+ (Computer give the better 3.Bh6 ... 
*4.Rh8# is better and logical!) ...Re7 4.Bxe7+ (With mate following, this was what I saw and played.  Bh6 is better but it might be to hard for all to find, both lead to mate)

10.  
*1.Rxf8+ Kxf8 
*2.Qf3+ Kg8 (...Bf4 3.Bxf4 exf4 4.Qxf4+) 
*3.Qxg3

11.  
*1.Nf6 Qe7 (...Bxf6? 2.Qxf6 ... 3.Qh8#) 
*2.Nxe8 to win an exchange (Nxh7+ is better not hard to see, Qe7 is forced because Qc8 gives white mate in 7[of course with Nxh7,Kg7;Qxf7+ etc.])

12.  
*1.Ne7+ Kh8 
*2.Nf7+ Qxf7 
*3.Rxf7
Or 2.Nexc8! (Threatening back rank mate with Rf8#) Bf3 3.Rxf3 4.Qxf3 gxf3

13.  
*1. ...Bh4 
*2.Qxh4 Nf3+ 
*3.gxf3 Qxe3+ 
*4.Kd1 Bb1+ 
*5.Qxd8+ Rxd8#

14.  
*1. ...Bxg3 
*2.fxg3 Rxg3+ 
*3.hxg3 Qxg3 
*4.Kh1 (4.Kf1 Qf3+ 5.Kg1 Rg8+ 6.Kh2 Qg2#) Qh3+ 
*5.Kg1 Rg8+ 
*6.Kf2 Rg2+ 
*7.Kf1 Qh1#

15. 
*1. ...Bxb3 
*2.cxb3 Qxd1

16. 
*1.Qe6+ Kf8 (1. ...Kh8? 2.Rxh7+ Kxh7 3.Qxg6+ Kh8 4.Rh1# or 4.Qh7#) 
*2.Rxh7 Bg7 
*3.Rdh1 or 3.Bxg6 with mate following.  There are different moves Black can play, White is likely to play both Rdh1 threating rook sacrifice on h8 followed by mate and Bxg6 which is threatening Qf7#.
1.Qxd4 is also winning for White. 1. ...Ng7 
2.Rxh7 Kxh7 
3.Qh4+ Kg8 (3. ...Nh5? Qxh5, g pawn is pinned)
4.Bxg6 Kg8 With mate following.

17. 
*1.Nd2+ Kc2 
*2.Nf3 (There is no way for White to avoid giving up an exchange.)

18. 
*1.Qh5+ Kg8 
*2.Qxh7+ Kf7 
*3.Qxf5+ Kg8 
*4.Qh7+ Kf7 
*5.Rf3#  (1.Qxh7? Re5 2.Rf3 Ke8 and game continues)

19. 
*1.Nf5+ Kg8 (1. ...Kf8? 2.Rh8#) 
*2.Qg4+ Kf8 
*3.Rh8#

The board arose after the opening moves

1.e4 e5

2.Nf3 Nc6

3.Bc4 h6 (Ask yourself, was '''h6''' a bad move?)

4.Nc3 Na5 (Ask yourself, was '''Na5''' a bad move?)

5.Bxf7+

Even an experienced player might struggle to calculate all the possible moves and their consequences. One way to improve one's tactical vision is to set-up this board, or indeed any board, choose an opening move, and then continuing, picking the best moves possible, and noting the success of the initial move. 

Consider the '''h6''' and the '''Na5''' moves, and note their weakness. Indeed, the '''Na5''' move's tempo renders black's only developed piece useless, and the '''h6''' move weakens the King's side and scuppers a future defensive '''g6''' move. Black may have anticipated a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_Liver_Attack Fried Liver Attack], and made a pre-emptive defense, though such an attack should threaten black. 

Now consider how the game might develop. Black is in check. He can take the bishop ('''Kxf7'''), but this might not be tactical.  If Black moves '''Kxf7''', there is an inevitable knight check ('''Nxe5'''). White might then play '''Qh5''' which may be played with check.  

Studying the many variations, and the patterns of movement, will be beneficial for any chess player, especially once white's queen is active.  There are many mate threats that can be created, and many guarded squares that black cannot move his king to. 

Here are possible scenarios. First, '''Ke7''', where black moves his king forward, and out of check, which is discussed in some detail. Second, '''Kxf7''', where black captures white's bishop, which is left as an exercise for the keen reader.  

:*1...Ke7 Declining the Bishop capture 2. Nd5+ now the King is forced to capture the Bishop (or play Kd6 with no lose of material for white), 2...Kxf7.  It was bad for black to decline the sacrifice because white was able to muscle black into accepting it, and now white has an additional knight bearing down on the black king.  3. Nxe5+ Ke6 (3...Ke8 Would lead to mate with 4. Qh5 g6 5.Qxg6#) 4. Qh5 (White now threatens 5. Qf5+ Kd6 and 6. Nf7+ winning the Black queen the following move) 4...Qg5 (it is plausible that Black will play this in attempt to trade queens and greatly reduce White's attack) 5. Qf7+ Kd6 (The e5 Knight is immune from capture from the King, for two reasons. 5...Kxe5 is met with a.) 6. f4+ forking the Queen, so long as f4 is defended by a white piece, and b.) 6. d5+, this is good because it facilitates the development of the dark square bishop, but white is likely to lose the bishop so long as the queen is protected by the h pawn.  There are two ways but only 1 black queen you might say, regardless it is still good to have two ways.  What this means is if white can utilize his knight and queen for different things since they aren't tied down to the defense of the f4 square, and the d5 knight will remain immune.  That means white is more flexible and can respond to blacks defenses in more ways) 6. Qxf8+ (vacates the f7 square with tempo) Ne7 7 Nf7+ (forking the King and Queen) Black's position is hopeless.
:*1...Kxf7 See if you can work out what can happen here.

== More the Better ==
The more positions we have the better.  I put a few up that may not be very good but if we can put a lot up and if people are always adding more it would be very useful for all chess players.  We can later organize them when we have more, like by difficulty or by theme, like discoveries in one section and so on. [[User:Tprev|Tprev]] 19:00, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

number 1 is wrong: after d5  ... Bxc3+ bxc3 Ne7 and now the check at a4 would be harmless

Added and amended position 1 so that 1. d5 with a possible Qa4+ picking up the Bishop on b4 can now work. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 19:48, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

==99% tactics?==
I am by no means an expert, but this statement (&quot;Chess is 99% Tactics&quot;) just seems to subjective and vague to feature. [[User:84.1.190.175|84.1.190.175]] 22:51, 30 July 2007 (UTC)
:: Where does it say it's 99% tactical? [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 19:14, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

&quot;Chess is 99% Tactics&quot; is a famous quote by Teichmann. It has been the basis of many discussions about chess and has even spawned rebuttal quotes such as &quot;Chess is 99% calculation.&quot; from Soltis. --[[User:Kingpatzer|Kingpatzer]] ([[User talk:Kingpatzer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kingpatzer|contribs]]) 16:09, 14 September 2011 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;Positions 13/14 and 15 are upside down. Position require reversing.&lt;/s&gt; Done [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 22:09, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

==Section &quot;A Highly Tactical Position&quot;==
This has been completely removed twice now by 209.146.241.93. I see no reason to delete it. If this person wishes to take time to submit anything of better quality to replace it, then fine, but until such time as we have something better then it's of value to stay.

==Exercise #2==
I'm a rank amateur, but that also means I'm the intended audience of this section so I feel justified in speaking up. :)  In exercise #2, if White plays 1. Rxd7+ , what's to stop Black from playing 1...Kc8 to avoid the check and temporarily neutralize the White queen without losing any (further) pieces? --[[User:Orzechowskid|Orzechowskid]] ([[User talk:Orzechowskid|talk]]) 22:22, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

With Gnuchess vs Gnuchess, white did win after 18. move, began as you described. --[[Special:Contributions/80.222.84.35|80.222.84.35]] ([[User talk:80.222.84.35|talk]]) 14:23, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

I think the answer to this one isn't complete. White can win another piece after 1 ... Kc8; 2 Rd5 is a discovered check which wins a pawn (on e5).

I think this moves is currently being updated, but it now follows with a discovered check by Re7, black being forced to defence by Nd7, but then it is stated that Qe7#, but why would black K not make a retreating move? [[User:Walterdevries|Walterdevries]] ([[User talk:Walterdevries|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Walterdevries|contribs]]) 21:26, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

: The discovered check of Re7+ doesn't work.  The king could retreat to b7, and you've been forced into an exchange that you may not like.  Also, black responses incorrectly indicated that you could force mate on this problem, which was incorrect.  In any case, Exercise 2 really could be described much better. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sigma 7|contribs]]) 06:34, 31 December 2012 (UTC)

==Exercise #3==
A different person here but nonetheless an amateur. On exercise #3 what's to stop black from moving his pawn forward from C7 to C5 , thus blocking checkmate. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:81.76.53.87 |81.76.53.87 ]] ([[User talk:81.76.53.87 |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/81.76.53.87 |contribs]]) 18:44, 14 March 2009 .&lt;/small&gt;
:It's White to move and Black is forced to respond to check and hence never gets a chance to play pawn c7 to c5. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 20:01, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

:The point of #3 is not to checkmate but to win material (the knight).

A different person yet. I have to disagree with SunCreator's response. Yes, it is white to move. But the succession would go:&lt;br /&gt;
1.Rf8+ Rxf8&lt;br /&gt;
2.Rxf8+ Ka7&lt;br /&gt;
3.Bxe3  and THEN 3... c5.  
 
What prevents this is that white's pawn on d5 is passed &quot;en passant&quot; and can therefore take black's pawn. But black still has the pawn on the b-file that can better block the bishop's check to begin with. Thus the King escapes checkmate. But white still gains a material advantage.

==Exercise #4==
I really have to disagree with the logic in exercise 4. Given that the Queen moves to f4, I cannot see black moving his eFile knight to d7!  A much more probable move would be moving that same knight to g6, thus threatening white's queen.  

Were I white faced with the situation given in Ex 4, (I am a base amateur), I would move my rook to f5 with the hope of backing it up with the other rook to f1 in the next move.

I disagree as well, I would move my queen to h4, then bishop to f6 which forks the black queen and rook, (if e Knight is now protecting f knight, just threaten e Knight with other bishop).

I offered a more thorough explanation consisting of the above mentioned Rf5. (1. Rf5 Ned7 2. Qf2 Rg8 3. e5 Rxg5 4. exd6 Rxf5 5. dxe7 Rxf2 6. Kxf2).

==Exercise #9==
I guess I really have to play the contrarian with you. In this case, your computer was correct. I also initially saw the strategy you did. But that approach allows the king to escape checkmate. The following sequence from that on the board:

1.Rh7+ Kg8&lt;br /&gt;
2.Rcg7+ Kf8&lt;br /&gt;
3.Bd6+

This was your strategy. Now you see the next move on the part of the e8 rook:

3... Re7  then:

4.Bxe7+ Ke8  Now, it can be either rook, but I'll select the h7&lt;br /&gt;
5.Rh8+ Kd7&lt;br /&gt;
and from there the King is able to slip away into pawn protection.

This doesn't happen with the computer version.

: 5.Bd6 --[[Special:Contributions/79.216.228.177|79.216.228.177]] ([[User talk:79.216.228.177|talk]]) 13:41, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

==Exercise #18==
You don't seem to consider this possibility:&lt;br /&gt;

1.Qh5+ Ke6&lt;br /&gt;
2.Re3+ Kd7&lt;br /&gt;
and now white's rook has to consider the threat imposed by black's rook on e8. Certainly changes the game and undermines white's checkmate strategy. Variations of white's response to 1...Ke6 results in the same escape.


==FEN notation for the puzzles==

&lt;/pre&gt;
I'm not sure if I got all the castles right, also in one puzzle there might be an en passant possibility. The moves I just set to &quot;0 1&quot; in everyone.
If that's cool with everyone I'll edit these into the page.

Also, if anyone cares, here's a little perl script to get FEN notation out of the wikipedia diagrams:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# takes a board in this format:
#
# 8 |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd|=
# 7 |pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|=
# 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
# 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
# 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
# 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
# 2 |pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|=
# 1 |rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl|=
#
# and turnes it into FEN notation.


my %trans = (
    qd =&gt; 'q',
    kd =&gt; 'k',
    rd =&gt; 'r',
    nd =&gt; 'n',
    bd =&gt; 'b',
    pd =&gt; 'p',

    
    ql =&gt; 'Q',
    kl =&gt; 'K',
    rl =&gt; 'R',
    nl =&gt; 'N',
    bl =&gt; 'B',
    pl =&gt; 'P',
);

my ($FEN, $blanks);
while (my $line = &lt;&gt;) {
    $blanks = 0;
    chomp $line;
    $line =~ s/^\s* \d \s+ [|]//x;
    $line =~ s/[|]= \s*//x;
    # now the lines look like: &quot;rd|nd|bd ... nd|rd&quot;
    
    for my $piece (split /[|]/, $line) {
        if ($piece eq q{  }) {
            $blanks++;
        }
        else {
            if ($blanks) {
                $FEN .= $blanks;
                $blanks = 0;
            }
            $FEN .= $trans{$piece};
        }
    }
    if ($blanks) {
        $FEN .= $blanks;
    }
    $FEN .= '/';
}

$FEN =~ s{/$}{};

print $FEN;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Though this is probably a stupid place to post this, I'm sorry.
==Horrible==
&lt;pre&gt;
9. 1.Rh7+ Kg8 2.Rcg7+ Kf8 3.Bd6+ (Computer give the better 3.Bh6 ... 4.Rh8# is better and logical!) ...Re7 4.Bxe7+ (With mate following, this was what I saw and played. Bh6 is better but it might be to hard for all to find, both lead to mate)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why is there illiterate parenthetical chitchat in the middle of this book? Are the authors retarded? This &quot;book&quot; is a pile of crap, badly written, with poor examples, badly analyzed. Any real chess book is better than this garbage.</text>

== Print version doesn't seem to work with Firefox 2.0.0.4 ==

Don't know if the problem is with the page or Firefox (so I'm reporting to both). A print or print preview in Firefox only produces around 25 pages, compared with over 300 in IE. On the other hand I'm having problems sizing the pages in IE (truncates some pictures on the right), however this works fine in Firefox for the 25 pages it did print.

== Print Version Should be broken up into '''Chapters''', rather than a '''167 page document''' ==

This tutorial and the others, SHOULD of been broken up into printable CHAPTERS. Rather than print the entire document and draining the ink cartridge for the last 17 pages. Which turns out to be the first 17 pages according to my print settings. I suggest that if the document is to be printed, '''be SURE you have a FULL black &amp; color ink catridge in the printer, or use the most economical printer setting to save on ink.''' You're in for a long printing session. Thought you should know.(24 Sept. 2008)</text>

Interesting start - I think there should be a more informative title though.  I don't think many people will find it named as  it is?  Easy to do - just use the &quot;move&quot; tab and put the new name in (change the links the too).  Regards</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Nitrile hydrolysis''' proceeds by the mechanism outlined below. It begins with protonation of the nitrile nitrogen, which increases the partial positive charge on carbon and therefore renders carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. Addition of water to the nitrile is the key step in nitrile hydrolysis − the next few steps are simple proton transfers, until an amide is formed.  The amide then typically undegoes further hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

=Connotations of The Text=

Caesar was a friend of Catullus’ family and apparently was quite friendly to Catullus even asking him to dinner. Catullus however, made it quite clear that he did not like Caesar. This is only one of several offensive poems directed at him.

The brevity of this piece highlights Catullus’ disregard and was a feature of the Latin neoterics, who broke away from the long epics.

===Line 1===

*'''''velle placere - to want to please'''''

The placement of two infinitives next to each other emphasises his point, as this would have been a noticeable structure to a Roman reader.

===Line 2===

*'''''albus an ater - white or black'''''

Note the assonance of ''albus an ater''. Assonance, as well as alliteration, was a common poetic technique of Latin.

=Vocabulary=

===Line 1===

*'''[[wikt:nimium|nimium]]''' - too much; excessively

*'''[[wikt:velle|velle]]''' - to want; desire

*'''[[wikt:placere|placere]]''' - to please; satisfy; impress

===Line 2===

*'''[[wikt:albus|albus]], ''(adj.)''''' - lit. white, however in this context it may mean good or pure.

*''' [[wikt:ater|ater]]''' – again, this literally means ‘black’, but here may mean evil or corrupted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Linear programming''' is a method for finding the best solution to a problem (optimisation) using straight-line graphs and inequalities.

==Example of a linear programming problem==
A factory makes two types of chair, Type A and Type B.
The factory makes a profit of £10 on Type A and £10 on Type B.
Type A requires 20 man-hours and Type B requires 30 man-hours.
Each chair of Type A needs 3m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of wood; each of Type B needs 5m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
Given that 400 man-hours and 50m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of wood are available each week, how many chairs of each type should be made each week to maximise the factory's profit?

==The graph method==
One way to solve this is to set up a graph with a and b on the axes, then plotting a line to represent each of the constraints as an inequality. This should result in a '''feasible region''' which is the area where all the constraints are met. The best solution to the problem will be at one of the vertices of this region.

==The Simplex method==
First we need to represent the problem by linear equations. We will call the number of Type A chairs manufactured ''a'', and the number of Type B chairs manufactured ''b''. We can then see that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
20a+30b\leq400 \Rightarrow &amp; 2a+3b\leq40
\\ &amp; 3a+5b\leq50
\\ &amp; a\geq0
\\ &amp; b\geq0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These are called the '''constraints''' of the linear programming problem. The function to be maximised (called the '''objective function''') is:

:&lt;math&gt;P=10a+10b\,&lt;/math&gt;

P represents the profit with given values of a and b. To use the Simplex method we have to convert the constraints and objective function into the following format:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P-10a-10b=0 \\
2a+3b+s=40 \\
3a+5b+t=50
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The variables s and t are called '''slack variables'''. They allow us to represent the amount of leeway we have before we hit the maximum of that constraint. It also mean we no longer have to use an inequality. We set up an initial 'tableau' with all the coefficients of the variables for each equation, and the final row is the right-hand side of each equation, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
P &amp; a &amp; b &amp; s &amp; t &amp; = \\ 1 &amp; -10 &amp; -10 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 40 \\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 50
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Once you have set up the tableau, you follow the Simplex algorithm:

:1. Considering any column that has a negative number on the top row, do the value in the last column divided by the positive value in the same row that is in the column you are considering. In our current example, we see that the a column and the b column have a negative value on the top row. We decide, arbitrarily, to consider column a, so we would do:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{40}{2} = 20&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{50}{3} = 16\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

We now select the value 3 from column a, because it gave us the least value when we divided 50 by it. 3 is now called the '''pivot'''.

:2. Divide the entire row that the pivot belongs to by the pivot.

:3. Now we need to reduce the value of a in the other two rows to 0. We must do this by adding or subtracting a constant multiple of the row with the pivot.

:4. If any negative numbers persist in the top row, we have to repeat the algorithm.

'''''Aquilegia''''' ('''columbine''')  is a genus of about 60-70 species of herbaceous perennial plants that are found in meadows, woodlands, and at higher altitudes throughout the Northern Hemisphere. They are known for their distinctive flowers, generally bell-shaped, with each petal modified into an elongated nectar spur.

Several species are grown in gardens; ''[[../Aquilegia vulgaris/]]'' (European Columbine) is a traditional garden flower in the British Isles, and several of the species that are native to North America are popular garden plants there. Numerous hybrids have also been developed as well. Easy to propagate from seed.

The traditional colors of lavender/blue columbines are the official Colorado state flower.

==Description==
&lt;!--physical description of the plant--&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

      <text xml:space="preserve">An understanding of statistics is an invaluable tool in much of modern science. This is particularly true of fields such as the biosciences and social sciences in which data are “noisy”, that is where chance or uncontrollable effects have a substantial impact on the data recorded. This wikibook is aimed at the scientifically-minded reader who has not been exposed to much statistical thinking. As well as the [[Statistics]] wikibook, and [http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=guides:guides guides] on the [http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php RWiki], there are many introductory statistical texts on the market. This differs from most in that, although it quickly introduces “advanced” topics such as likelihood and Bayesian methods, it does not do so through formal mathematical proofs, but primarily via graphical methods and simulation. The aim is to produce a text that can be used as a “crash course” in statistics for basic-undergraduate-level readers who want to understand how to analyse their data using modern techniques, but who are not particularly mathematical.

The advent of computers has made an enormous impact on the way in which statistics is done in the real world. Although many introductory statistics courses start by describing simple t-tests and chi-squared tests, most scientists now use more advanced techniques to analyse their data. In particular, there is substantial focus on what are known as general and generalised linear models, as well as (more recently) a renewed interest in Bayesian techniques and methods such as bootstrapping. Instead of explaining overly simple t-tests and the like, leaving underlying theory until later, this book aims to do the opposite. The computer program ‘R’, and its flexible graphical capabilities, are used to give a feel for the underlying theory of statistics, notably the concepts of probability, likelihood, probability density functions, sampling distributions, and hypothesis testing. These principles can then be applied to understanding the various commonly used statistical tests, and easily extended to sophisticated statistics such as generalized linear modelling.

It is intended for the main text of the book to give a general understanding of statistical methodology, as independent as possible of the statistical package used. This text should be interspersed with relevant &quot;R topics&quot;: sections of annotated R code, clearly distinguished from the main body of the book. It should be possible to use these R topics by themselves as a set of tutorials: [[../R |an introduction to basic concepts in R]]. 

Using this book, or any portions of it, in any other R or stats-related projects is encouraged: please feel free to copy and use any parts as you see fit. Books with partially overlapping aims to this are detailed at http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/SFLS.html and http://wiener.math.csi.cuny.edu/UsingR/. However, neither of these are editable or redistributable.

==Why R?==
R is a command-driven statistical package. At first sight, this can make it rather daunting to use. However, there are a number of reasons to learn statistics using this computer program. The two most important are:
:* R is free; you can download it from http://www.r-project.org and install it onto just about any sort of computer you like.
:* R allows you to do all the statistical tests you are likely to need, from simple to highly advanced ones. This means that you should always be able to perform the right analysis on your data.

An additional bonus is that R has excellent graphics and programming capabilities, so can be used as an aid to teaching and learning. For example, all the illustrations in this book have been produced using R; by clicking on any illustration, you can obtain the R commands used to produce it.

A final benefit, which is of more use once you have some basic knowledge of either statistics or R, is that there are many online resources to help users of R. A list is available in the [[../Appendix|appendix to this book]].

==How to use this book with R==
The main text in this book describes the why and how of statistics, which is relevant whatever statistical package you use. However, alongside the main text, there are a large number of &quot;R topics&quot;: exercises and examples that use R to illustrate particular points. You may find that it takes some time to get used to R, especially if you are unfamiliar with the idea of computer languages.

Don't worry! The topics in this chapter and in [[../Chapter 2|Chapter 2]] should get you going, to the point where you can understand and use R's basic functionality. This chapter is intended to get you started: once you have installed R, there are topics on how to carry out [[../R/R as a calculator|simple calculations]] and [[../R/Functions|use functions]], how to [[../R/Storing objects|store results]], how to [[../R/Getting help|get help]], and how to [[../R/Quitting R|quit]]. The few exercises in Chapter 1 mainly show the possibilities open to you when using R, then Chapter 2 introduces the nuts and bolts of R usage: in particular [[../R/Vectors|vectors]] and [[../R/Factors|factors]], [[../R/Getting data into R|reading data]] into [[../R/Data frames|data frames]], and [[../R/Simple plotting|plotting]] of [[../R/Univariate plots|various]] [[../R/Bivariate plots|sorts]]. From then on, the exercises become more statistical in nature.

If you wish to work straight through these initial exercises before statistical discussion, they are collected [[../R/R fundamentals|here]]. Note that when working through R topics online, you may find it more visually appealing if you [[#Setting up wikibooks|set up wikibooks]] to display R commands nicely. If the R topics get in the way of reading the main text, they can be hidden by clicking on the arrow at the top right of each box.

==== Starting R ====
If you don't already have R installed on your computer, download the latest version for free from http://www.r-project.org, and install the base system. You don't need to install any extra packages yet. Once you have installed it, start it up, and you should be presented with something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;R version 2.11.1 (2010-05-31)

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
You are now in an R session. R is a command-driven program, and the ominous-looking &quot;&gt;&quot; character means that R is now waiting for you to type something. Don't be daunted. You will soon get the hang of the simplest commands, and that is all you should need for the moment. And you will eventually find that the command-line driven interface gives you a degree of freedom and power&lt;ref&gt;These are poor attempts at a statistical jokes, as you will soon find out.&lt;/ref&gt; that is impossible to achieve using more &quot;user-friendly&quot; packages.

== Setting up wikibooks ==

Before you start on the main text, we recommend that you add a few specific wikibooks preferences. The first three lines will display the examples of R commands in a nicer format. The last line gives a nicer format to figures consisting of multiple plots (known as subfigures).
You can do this by creating a user CSS file, as follows.
* Make sure you are [[Special:Userlogin|logged in]] (and create yourself an account if you do not have one already).
* Visit your personal css stylesheet, at [[Special:MyPage/skin.css]].
* Click on &quot;Edit this page&quot;.
* Paste the following lines into the large edit box
&lt;pre&gt;pre {padding:0; border: none; margin:0; line-height: 1.5em; }
.code .input ol {list-style: none; font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 0;}
.code .input ol li div:before {content: &quot;\003E \0020&quot;;}
table.subfigures div.thumbinner, table.subfigures tr td, table.subfigures {border: 0;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(note that this is a temporary hack until GeSHi supports R code, in which case [[../R/Syntax]] can be changed. The css code should really read&lt;pre&gt;.pre {padding:0; border: none; margin:0; line-height: 1.5em; }
.source-R ol {list-style: none; font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 0;}
.source_R ol li div:before {content: &quot;\003E \0020&quot;;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* If you know any [[CSS]], make any alterations you like to this stylesheet.
* Finally save the page by clicking on &quot;Save page&quot;,

Enough! Let's move on to the main text.

== Why statistics? ==
Figure 1.1 shows one of the standard sets of data available in the R statistical package. In the 1920s, braking distances were recorded for cars travelling at different speeds. Analysing the relationship between speed and braking distance can influence the lives of great number of people, via changes in speeding laws, car design, and the like. Other datasets, for example concerning medical or environmental information, have an even greater impact on humans and our understanding of the world. But real-world data are often &quot;messy&quot;, as shown in the plot. Most people looking at the plot would be happy to conclude that speed and stopping distance are linked in some way. However, this cannot be the whole story because even at the same speed, different stopping distances were recorded.[[Image:R-car_stopping_distances_1920.svg|frame|left|Figure 1.1: An example dataset]]

This combination of intuitively sensible patterns and messiness is perhaps one of the most common scientific results. Statistical analysis can help us to clarify and judge the patterns we think we see, as well as revealing, out of the mess, effects that may be otherwise difficult to discern. It can be used as a tool to explain the world around us, and perhaps equally importantly, to convince others of the correctness of our explanations. This emphasis on informed judgement and convincing others is important: ideally, statistics should aid a clear explanation, rather than blind by force of argument.

A common misconception of statistical analysis is that it is necessarily technical and &quot;hard to understand&quot;. Indeed &quot;I don't understand statistics&quot; is a cry frequently heard. But if an analysis can only be understood by statisticians, it has, to a great extent, failed. For an analysis to convince an audience, one or more reasonable explanations for a situation should carefully and comprehensibly lay down. Statistical analysis of data (which has, ideally, been collected to test these explanations) can then be used to justify a conclusion that can be generally agreed upon. As a rule, the simpler the explanation - the more [[w:parsimony|parsimonious]] - the more it is to be preferred. Hence a good explanation is one which is sensible and comprehensible to an informed observer, which makes clear predictions, but is as simple as possible.

This book is intended to teach you how to formulate and test such &quot;explanations&quot; in a statistical manner. This is the basis of statistical analysis.

==== The statistical method ====

As with the &quot;scientific method&quot;, to which it bears a number of similarities, it is open to debate whether or not there exists a universal &quot;statistical method&quot; {{Citation needed}}. Nevertheless, most statistical analyses involve questioning some aspect of the world, coming up with potential answers to these questions and then formalising these explanations by proposing '''statistical models''' that may account for particular aspects of the data. 

Hence the three major parts to an analysis are
# Deciding the questions you wish to tackle (or more generally, the aim of the analysis)
# Proposing some reasonable explanations which have the potential to answer these questions
# Formalise these explanations as statistical models 
# Collecting appropriate data
# (Using more or less technical methods) test the models using the data.

For example ***

Hence the majority of analyses that you are likely to perform assume, either explicitly or implicitly, an underlying &quot;statistical model&quot;. So understanding statistical models, and what they entail, is fundamental to understanding statistics.

=== Statistical models ===
Chapter 3 discusses statistical models in greater detail, but it is worth introducing some general concepts here. Models provide some predictive ***. What distinguishes a ''statistical model'' is that there is also an element of uncertainty in the process. Hence statistical models consist of two components: one which is fixed, and one which captures the uncertainty. This is 

As an example, we can return to the situation depicted in Figure 1.1. A point to which we will return many times, is that a good understanding of the background, or ''context'' of the data is essential to any analysis. In this case, it is important to know that the data concerns speed and breaking distances of cars. Our general knowledge about driving can then guide our choice of model. In particular, we can probably guess that it seems reasonable to model a situation in which speed has an effect on breaking distance (rather than, for example, the other way around). It seems reasonable to treat speed as something that is determined by other factors, and outside the scope of our analysis ***.

Hence an initial, reasonable model might assume that the breaking distance is determined by speed, plus some sort of random ''error''. To model this precisely, to construct an imaginary set of breaking distances given a set of speeds, we need to be more precise. In particular, we need to specify how a speed affects distance, and what the error looks like***.

Later on we'll see how to specify this mathematically. For the moment, we'll do it graphically and by simulation

Common to assume &quot;Normal&quot; error ****


e.g. maybe no effect at all: there is a fixed breaking distance regardless of speed: the only reason why distance vary is due to chance ''error''. =&gt; graphically show

we need to be more precise than this: we 

one of the most important things to It is reasonable to  1.2(a-d). In each of the four figures,  a different statistical model has been proposed: the predictive part of each model is shown as a red line, and the uncertainty (the fluctuations attributed to chance or ''error'') shown as light blue lines. In all cases, the model has assumed that the uncertainty is all in the effect of braking distance (the light blue lines are all vertical). 

To show the uncertainty on its own, the right hand plot in each figure shows the '''residuals''' ***.

A linear relationship is perhaps the simplest way that a relationship between , which is why ***. simplest explanation for the pattern is that stopping distance is directly proportional to speed, so that for every extra mile-per-hour, stopping distance increases by a fixed amount: graphically, this represents a straight line on the plot. It is common to .
* The curved (red) line. However, this has not taken into account any : perhaps . As remarked before, this is not enough to explain all the data:  It may be less clear that lowess is a model ****.

The &quot;cars&quot; example highlights the importance of prior knowledge when doing statistics. Data should not be treated as pure &quot;numbers&quot;, but considered in context. Here, because we know that the data are the outcome of a relatively well-understood physical system, we should be led to ask if a particular relationship is expected, which then encourages us to use a simple quadratic fit.

Thus in any analysis it is vital to understand the data: to know where they come from, how they relate to the real world, and — by plotting or other forms of “exploratory data analysis” — what they look like. Indeed, plotting data is one of the most fundamental skills in a statistical analysis: it is a powerful tool for revealing patterns and convincing others. If necessary this can then be backed up by more formal, mathematical techniques. The use of graphics in this book is twofold: not only can they be used to explore data, but formal statistical methods can often be understood and pictured graphically, rather than by heavy use of mathematics. This is one of the principal aims of this book.

== The Scientific Method ==
{{Quote|The statistician cannot excuse himself from the duty of getting his head clear on the principles of scientific inference, but equally no other thinking man can avoid a like obligation.|R. A. Fisher}}
This book focuses on the important role of statistics in the [[w:scientific method|scientific method]]. Fundamentally, science involves carefully testing a number of rational explanations, or &quot;[[w:hypothesis|hypotheses]]&quot;, that purport to explain observed phenomena. Usually, this is done by proposing plausible hypotheses and then trying to ''eliminate'' one or more of them by careful experimentation or data collection (this is known as the [[w:Hypothetico-deductive method|Hypothetico-deductive method]]). This means that a basic requirement for a scientific hypothesis is that it can be proved wrong: that it is, in Popper's words &quot;[[w:falsifiability|falsifiable]]&quot;. In this chapter, we will see that it is logically impossible to &quot;prove&quot; that a hypothesis is correct; nevertheless, the more tests that a hypothesis passes, the more we should be inclined to believe it.

Ideally, scientific research involves a repeated process of generating hypotheses, eliminating as many as possible, and refining the remaining ones, in a process known as &quot;strong inference&quot; (cite Platt). There are two very different steps involved here: a rather speculative one in which hypotheses are produced or refined, and a strictly logical one in which they are eliminated.

These two steps have their counterparts in statistical analysis. The branch of statistics concerned with '''hypothesis testing''' is designed to identify which hypotheses seem improbable, and hence may be eliminated. The branch of statistics concerned with '''exploratory analysis''' is designed to identify plausible explanations for a set of data. While we will begin our discussion of these techniques separately, it should be emphasised that in practice, the distinction is not so clear-cut. These two branches of statistical practice are better seen as extremes of a continuum of techniques available to the researcher. For example, many hypotheses involve numerical ''[[w:parameter|parameters]]'', such as the slope of a best fit line. Statistical '''estimation''' of such parameters may be seen as a test of a hypothesis, but may also be seen as a suggestion for a refined or even novel explanation of the facts.

=== Hypothesis testing ===
To properly test a hypothesis, the right sort of data need to be collected. In fact, the targeted collection of data and (where possible) the careful design of experiments, is probably the most important process in science. This need not be difficult. For example, imagine that our hypothesis is that (for genetic reasons) a person cannot have both blond hair and brown eyes. This hypothesis can be disproved by a single observation of a person with that combination of features.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|+style=&quot;caption-side: bottom&quot;|Table 1.1: numbers of statistics students, out of a total of 592, broken down by hair and eye colour.

Table 1.1 shows the results of a 1974 survey of students from the University of Delaware&lt;ref&gt;from Snee (1974) ''The American Statistician'', '''28''', 9–12. The full reference can be found within R by typing ?HairEyeColor. The table here has been aggregated over Sex as in &lt;pre&gt;example(HairEyeColor)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. As with any test, we need to make a few ''assumptions'' about this data, for example that students with dyed hair have not been included, or are listed under their original hair colour. If this is the case, then we can see immediately that we can reject the blond&amp;brown:impossible hypothesis: there were 7 students with brown eyes and blond hair&lt;ref&gt;when the hypothesis is simple and there are only small amounts of data like this, presenting it in tabular form is often just as useful as plotting&lt;/ref&gt;.

Imagine, however, if the survey had not revealed any students with brown eyes and blond hair. Although this would be consistent with our hypothesis, it would not be enough to prove it correct. It could be that brown eyes and blond hair are merely very rare, it being pure chance that we did not see any. This is a general problem. It is impossible to be sure that a hypothesis is correct: there may always be another, very similar explanation for the same observations. 

However, as seen in this example, it ''is'' possible to reject hypotheses. For this reason, science relies on eliminating hypotheses. Often, therefore, scientists construct one or more hypotheses which they believe ''not'' to be the case, ''purely in order to be rejected''. If the aim of a study is to convince other people of one particular theory or hypothesis, then a good way to do so is to define hypotheses which encompass as many reasonable alternative explanations as can be envisaged. If all of these can be disproved, then the remaining, original hypothesis becomes much more convincing. 

==== The null hypothesis ====

In most scientific observations, there is an element of chance&lt;ref&gt;this could either be truly random, or due to factors about which we are ignorant&lt;/ref&gt;, and so the most important hypothesis to try to eliminate – at least initially – is that the observed data are due to chance alone. This is usually known as the '''null hypothesis'''.

In our initial example, the null hypothesis is relatively obvious: it is that there is no association between hair and eye colour (any seeming associations are purely due to chance). But constructing an appropriate null hypothesis is not always so easy. Here are three examples which we will investigate later, ranging from the simple to the highly complex.

# The sex-ratio among children born in a hospital (e.g. on 18 December 1997 in the Mater Mother's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, a record 44 children were born &lt;ref&gt;see [[http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/dunn/Datasets/applications/health/babyboom.html]]&lt;/ref&gt;, of which 18 were female). A reasonable null hypothesis might be that males and females are equally probable, regardless of sex. Since it is known that humans usually have a male-biased sex ratio, a different null hypothesis (say 51% males) may be more reasonable.

# The relationship seen in [[:image:R-car_stopping_distances_1920.svg| Figure 1.1]] between speeds and stopping distances in cars. A reasonable null hypothesis might be that there is no relationship between the speed of a car and its stopping distance. However, Car stopping distances (no ``association'' between x &amp; y) - More difficult, because error distribution is unknown. here's one way of doing it: could e.g. take ranks of x &amp; ranks of y. Or sample.

In both cases, we need to *model* the null hypothesis: what would we expect if 

# Deaths and serious injuries in cars in the UK from 1969-1985. [[:image:R-UK_dead_or_injured_in_cars_1969-85.svg| Figure 1.2]] shows that Seatbelts **** More complex null models - e.g. seatbelt - if we fit a st. line, we need to make some assumption about variation from the line. Or we can take the actual values as representative of the variation Here is a more complex that has affected most of the population in the UK is the introduction of compulsory wearing of seatbelts in cars: a law that came into force on 31st January 1983. Null model involves other factors (e.g. petrol price)

We can model the null hypothesis as long as we have enough detail. **what do you need for different egs**. Because there is random error, we need to do this lots of times. We will see that a lot of statistics relies on rejecting the null hypothesis based on how often it gives results like those observed.

==== Other hypotheses ====

The same goes for others, e.g. seatbelt??? Comparing models

=== Estimation ===

Hypotheses may not be a simple yes/no matter, but more sophisticated, e.g. 

what sex ratio is suggested by the data? (that's easy, but how confident are we about the accuracy of this estimate?)

cars: we are convinced that there is a straight-line relationship between speed &amp; braking distance: what is the slope of the line (but maybe physics would suggest a different relationship - straight line is usually the default) - already here we are making some sort of choice of model.

MLE brief description ``if the model is correct, what is the most likely value for these parameters?''

=== Exploratory analysis ===

An infinity of models out there. In combination with good understanding and /parsimony/, can be used to construct hypotheses &amp; *models*. D.F?

E.g. are there better ideas than a straight line fit?

Is this at all sensible (e.g. if cannot go &lt;0)

Anscombe

Outliers? ???residuals (probably not)

what about interactions? Titanic sex vs. class?

Use colours to pick out types

Human eye good at spotting patterns (but ... even if there are none) . E.g. time series

even if we have a prediction (model), how well does it fit the assumptions?

Which are important (as opposed to significant) factors?

=== Parsimony ===

== Conclusion ==

Should have enough background to describe picture from [[http://www.uku.fi/~mauranen/advbis/advbis1.htm]]

=== How wide can we throw conclusions ===

Is each experiment only one data point, etc?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Atomic Structure/Subatomic Particles|next=The Quantum Model}}

==Introduction to Quantum Mechanics==
In the late 18th century, many physicists believed that they had made great progress in physics, and there wasn't much more that needed to be discovered. The classical physics at the time was widely accepted in the scientific community. However, by the early 20th century, physicists discovered that the laws of classical mechanics break down in the atomic world, and experiments such as the photoelectric effect completely contradict the laws of classical physics. As a result of these crises, physicists began to construct new laws of physics which would apply to the atomic world; these theories would be collectively known as '''quantum mechanics'''. Quantum mechanics, in some ways, completely changed the way physicists view the universe, and it also marked the end of the idea of a clockwork universe (the idea that universe was predictable).

==Electromagnetic Radiation==
{{Wikipedia|Electromagnetic spectrum}}
Electromagnetic radiation (ER) is ''a form of energy that sometimes acts like a wave, and other times acts like a particle''. Visible light is a well-known example. All forms of ER have two inversely proportional properties: wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is the distance from one wave peak to the next, which can be measured in meters. Frequency is the number of wave peaks observed in a given point during a second. The unit for frequency is hertz.

[[Image:Wavelength.png]]

Since wavelength and frequency are inversely related, their product (multiplication) always equals a constant — specifically, 3.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/sec, which is better known as the speed of light.

The wavelength and frequency of any specific occurrence of ER determine its position on the '''electromagnetic spectrum'''.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:TheElectromagneticSpectrum.jpg‎]]&lt;/center&gt;

As you can see, visible light is only a tiny fraction of the spectrum.

The energy of an electromagnetic wave is given by &lt;math&gt;E = hf&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Plank's constant and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency.  Energy is directly proportional to frequency — doubling the frequency will double the energy.

==The Discovery of the Quantum==
[[Image:Photoelectric_effect.svg|thumb|As photons strike a metal, electrons are freed.  The photoelectric effect depends only on the light's frequency, not intensity, which defies wave behavior.]]
So far we have only discussed the wave characteristics of energy. However, the wave model cannot account for something known as the '''photoelectric effect'''. This effect is observed when light focused on certain metals apparently causes electrons to be emitted. (Photoelectric or solar panels work on this principle.)

For each metal it was found that there is a minimum threshold frequency of electromagnetic radiation that is needed to be shone on it in order for it to emit electrons. One could not replace a certain amount of light at one frequency with twice as much light of half the frequency. If light only acts as a wave, the effect of light should be cumulative - the light should add up, little by little, until it causes electrons to be emitted. Instead, there is a clear-cut minimum of the frequency of light that triggers the electron emissions.

The implication of this is that frequency is directly linked to energy, the higher light frequencies having more energy.  This observation led to the discovery of the minimum amount of energy that could be gained or lost by an atom.  Max Planck named this minimum amount the '''quantum''', plural &quot;quanta&quot;, meaning &quot;how much&quot;.  One '''photon''' of light carries exactly one quantum of energy.

==More Evidence for a Particle Theory of Energy==
When an electric current is passed through a gas, some of the gas molecules' electrons move from their ''ground state'' to an ''excited state'' that is further away from their nuclei. When the electrons return to the ground state, they emit energy of various wavelengths. A prism can be used to separate the wavelengths, making them easy to identify.

If light acted only as a wave, then there should have been a continuous rainbow created by the prism. Instead, there were discrete lines created by different wavelengths. This is because electrons release specific wavelengths of light when moving from an excited state to a ground state.

[[Image:Nitrogen.Spectrum.Vis.jpg|frame|center|400px|The emission spectrum of nitrogen gas.  The '''spectral lines''' occur at specific wavelengths, showing the particle behavior of light.]]

== More Evidence for a Particle Theory of Energy ==

Maybe it's just me, but this paragraph made little sense to me.

“If light acted only as a wave, then there should have been a continuous rainbow created by the prism. Instead, there were definite lines created by different wavelengths. This is because electrons release specific wavelengths of light when moving from an excited state to a ground state.”

The first sentence talks about a property of light, suggesting what would be seen if light acted as a wave.  The second sentence explains that the definite lines in the spectrum implies light is not a wave.  The third sentence then attributes the definite lines to a completely different phenomena, the fact that electrons can only occupy specific orbits and that they may emit photons when changing orbits.  It seems to me that the connection between quanta of light and changing electron orbits needs to be expanded.</text>

== Uncertainty ==
[[Image:Werner Heisenberg at 1927 Solvay Conference.JPG|thumb|Werner Heisenberg (1927)]]
It turns out that photons are not the only thing that act like waves and particles. Electrons, too, have this dual characteristic. Electrons can be thought of as waves of a certain length, thus they would only be able to form a circle around the nucleus at certain distances. Of course, this brings up a problem: are electrons particles in a specific location, or waves in a general area? Werner Heisenberg tried using photons to locate electrons. Of course, when photons reach electrons, the electrons change velocity, and move to an excited state. As a result, it is impossible to know the velocity and location of an electron at the same time. This is known as the '''Heisenberg uncertainty principle'''.  The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a kind of scientific dilemma:  the more you know about something's velocity, the less you know about its position; and the more you know about its position, the less you know about its velocity.  The significance of this uncertainty is that you can never know exactly where an atom's electrons are.  
[[Image:Circular Standing Wave.gif|thumb|left|A wave forming a circle]]

On the tiny scale of an atom, the particle model of an electron does not accurately describe its properties. An electron tends to act more like a water wave than a billiard ball. At any one moment in time the ball is in some definite place; it is also moving in some definite direction at a definite speed. This is certainly not true for waves or electrons in general. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the exact position and momentum of an electron cannot be simultaneously determined. This is because electrons simply don't have a definite position, and direction of motion, at the same time!

One way to try to understand this is to think of an electron not as a particle but as a wave. Think of dropping a stone into a pond. The ripples start to spread out from that point. We can answer the question &quot;Where is the wave?&quot; with &quot;It's where you plonked the stone in&quot;. But we can't answer the question &quot;What direction is the wave moving?&quot; because it's moving in all directions. It's spreading out. Now think of a wave at the seaside. We know the direction of motion. It's straight in towards the beach. But where is the wave? We can't pinpoint an exact location. It's all along the water.

== The Wave Function ==
[[Image:Impact Sprinkler Mechanism 2.jpg|thumb|Think of the wave equation like a sprinkler—you cannot predict the exact path of a particular water droplet, but you do know (based on the range and shape of the sprinkler) where it is most likely to go.]]
If we can never know exactly where an electron is, then how do we keep track of them as they orbit atoms?  Erwin Schrödinger made the concept of the '''Schrödinger Wave Function'''.  It tells the probability of an electron being found at a given position.  You don't know where the electron is, but you know where it is most likely and least likely to be found.  The electron could be anywhere, but it is probably going to be a certain distance from the atom, staying within a certain shape.

== Orbitals ==
In the following sections, we will learn about the shells, subshells, and orbitals that the electrons are in.  Try not to get confused; it can be difficult.  Understanding this information will help you to learn about bonding, which is very important.

In essence, each electron orbiting an atom has a set of four numbers that describe it.  Those four numbers, called ''quantum numbers,'' tell us how far away the electron is, what shape of path it is likely to follow, and which direction its orbit goes.  Each electron in an atom has a unique set of numbers, and the numbers can change if bonding occurs or an electron is energized into a higher-energy orbit.  In the next chapter, we will learn the exact meaning of those four values and how they affect the path the electron follows.

{{Info|Keep in mind that the pictures of the orbitals you will soon see show the area in which the electron is ''most likely'' to be, not its exact orbit.  It's like a picture of a sprinkler watering a lawn, and the electrons are drops of water.  You know the general area of the water, but not the exact location of each droplet.  In the orbital pictures, you know the general area the electron could be in, but not its exact path.  This is a result of the Uncertainty Principle.}}

==Introduction==
Reaction rates of a chemical system provide the underpinnings of many theories in thermodynamics and chemical equilibria.

Elementary reactions are one-step processes in which the reactants become the products without any ''intermediate'' steps.  The reactions are unimolecular (A → products) or bimolecular (A + B → products).  Very rarely, they could be trimolecular (A + B + C → products), but this is not common due to the rarity of three molecules colliding at the same time.

A complex reaction is made up of several elementary reactions, with the products of one reaction becoming the reactants of the next until the overall reaction is complete.  

==Rate Equation==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;m\hbox{A} + n\hbox{B} \rightarrow p\hbox{C} + q\hbox{D}&lt;/math&gt;
| Consider an arbitrary chemical reaction.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;r = k[\hbox{A}]^m[\hbox{B}]^n&lt;/math&gt;
| The rate at which the products will form from the reactants is given by this ''rate equation''.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;r = k[\hbox{C}]^p[\hbox{D}]^q&lt;/math&gt;
| The rate of the reverse reaction (which also occurs to a lesser extent) has its own rate equation.
|}

Note [A] is raised to the power of m, its coefficient, just like an equilibrium expression.  The rate of the reaction may rely on the molar coefficients of the reactant species, but it might not.  However, for an elementary reaction, the concentrations of the species A and B are always raised to their molar coefficients.  This only applies to '''elementary reactions''', which is a very important distinction to make.  

{{Info|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the rate reaction coefficient, which is reaction-specific.  It can be considered a constant, although it does change with temperature (and possible other factors).}}

=== Order ===

The order of an equation is what the concentration of a substance is raised to in the rate equation. The greater the number, the greater effect it will have on rate. For example, zero order equations do not effect the rate. To find the order, you must alter one concentration and keep the rest the same, Dividing gives an equation which can be used to solve for the order. To find overall order, simply add all orders together.

=== Zero-Order Equations ===
Zero-order equations do not depend on the concentrations of the reactants.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;r = k \,&lt;/math&gt;
| There is only a rate coefficient with no concentrations.  The rate probably depends on temperature, and possibly other factors like surface area, sunlight intensity, or anything else except for concentration.  These reactions usually occur when a substance is reacting with some sort of catalyst or solid surface.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;[\hbox{A}] = [\hbox{A}]_0 - kt \,&lt;/math&gt;
|The '''integrated rate law''' tells us how much reactant will remain after a given amount of time.  Integrated rate laws can be found using [[Calculus|calculus]], but that isn't necessary.  In this zero-order integrated rate law, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the rate coefficient from the rate equation, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, and &lt;math&gt;[\hbox{A}]_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting concentration.
|}

{{Info|If you make a graph of concentration vs. time, you will see a straight line.  The slope of that line is equal to &lt;math&gt;-k&lt;/math&gt;.  This is how you can identify a zero-order rate.}}

=== First-Order Equations ===
First-order equations depend on the concentration of a unimolecular reaction.

{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;r = k [\hbox{A}] \,&lt;/math&gt;
| There is a rate coefficient multiplied by the concentration of the reactant.  As with a zero-order equation, the coefficient can be though of as a constant, but it actually varies by the other factors like temperature.  There can be other reactants present in the reaction, but their concentrations do not effect the rate.  First-order equations are often seen in [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions|decomposition reactions]].
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \ln [\hbox{A}] = -kt + \ln [\hbox{A}]_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the integrated rate law.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|The '''half-life''' of a reaction is the amount of time it takes for one half of the reactants to become products.  One half-life is 50% completion, two half-lives would lead to 75% completion, three half-lives 88%, and so on.  The reaction never quite reaches 100%, but it does come close enough.  To find the half-life, you can algebraically manipulate the integrated rate law.
|}

{{Info|If you make a graph of the ''logarithm'' of concentration vs. time, you will see a straight line with a slope of &lt;math&gt;-k&lt;/math&gt;.  This is how you can identify a first-order rate.}}

=== Second-Order Equations ===
Second-order equations depend on the two concentrations of a bimolecular reaction.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;r = k [\hbox{A}] [\hbox{B}] \,&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the rate law for a second-order equation.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;r = k [\hbox{A}]^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|If there are two molecules of the same kind reacting together, the rate law can be simplified.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{[\hbox{A}]} = \frac{1}{[\hbox{A}]_0} + kt \,&lt;/math&gt;
| In that case, this is the integrated rate law.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{k[\hbox{A}]_0} \,&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the half-life for a second-order reaction (with only one reactant).
|}

{{Info|To see a graph with a straight line of slope &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, graph the reciprocal of concentration vs. time.}}

== Equilibrium ==
Equilibrium will occur when the forward and reverse rates are equal.  As you may have already noticed, the equilibrium expression of a reaction is equal to the rate equations divided.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;2 \hbox{NO}_2 \to \hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_4&lt;/math&gt;
|Consider this reaction, the ''dimerization'' of nitrogen dioxide into dinitrogen tetraoxide.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;r_f = k_f[\hbox{NO}_2]^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;r_r = k_r[\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_4] \,&lt;/math&gt;
|The forward reaction rate is second-order, and the reverse reaction rate is first-order.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;k_f[\hbox{NO}_2]^2 = k_r[\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_4] \,&lt;/math&gt;
|The rate coefficients may be different for the two reactions.  If the reaction is in equilibrium, the forward and reverse rates must be equal.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \frac{k_f}{k_r} = \frac{[\hbox{N}_2\hbox{O}_4]}{[\hbox{NO}_2]^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|Rearranging the equation gives the equilibrium expression.
|}

Understanding kinetics explains various concepts of equilibrium.  Now it should make sense why increasing the reactant concentration will make more products.  The forward rate increases, which uses up reactants, which decreases the forward rate.  At the same time, products are made, which increases the reverse reaction, until both reaction rates are equal again.

== Arrhenius Equation ==
The Arrhenius equation determines a rate coefficient based on temperature and activation energy.  It is surprisingly accurate and very useful.  The Arrhenius equation is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = Ae^{-E_a / RT}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt; is the activation energy for the reaction, in joules per mole.  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Universal Gas Constant, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature (in kelvin), and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the ''prefactor''.  Prefactors are usually determined experimentally.

Agreed. This section of the book assumes much more background on the reader's part than the rest. The section heading 'simple math' is misleading. Suggest renaming to something more appropriate and moving to a different section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''
There is a growing interest in mathematical study of succession of letters that represent the basic structure of DNA strand. In molecular genetics, these letters are T, G, C and A where they represent thymine, guanine, cytosine and adenine.[[Image:DNA_sequence.png|left|thumb|268px|Electropherogram printout from automated sequencer showing part of a DNA sequence]]
DNA is an information molecule that codes sequence of deoxyribonucleotides. Where as messenger RNA (mRNA) is an information molecule coding by sequence of ribonucleotides. In the structure of mRNA is a single stranded molecule where uracil, lettered U takes the place of thymine found in double stranded DNA.  

The letters in the information molecules are normally written without gaps and when they are taken three at a time, they are called codons. They produce 64 different combinations of bases. It is this coded sequence in the letters, for example, GATCTAC that we will refer to here as genetic information. 

Information in this case is about genes. It may also be information about gene products or our understanding of combinations of inherited family traits.  

Modern study of genetic information includes information that regards carrier status and information that is derived from science laboratory tests. The science laboratory tests are often intended to identify mutations or changes in specific genes or chromosomes. 
There are three ways in which genetic information is gathered in a scientific study. One is usually done by series of physical medical examinations while the other is by taking family histories and, lastly, by engaging direct analysis of genes or chromosomes through detailed biometric processes.

The end result in the flow of genetic information is protein, that is, a functional molecule consisting of sequence of amino acids.

== Blocks of the Periodic Table ==

The [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|Periodic Table]] does more than just list the elements. The word ''periodic'' means that in each row, or period, there is a pattern of characteristics in the elements. This is because the elements are listed in part by their electron configuration. The Alkali metals and Alkaline earth metals have one and two '''valence electrons''' (electrons in the outer shell) respectively. These elements lose electrons to form bonds easily, and are thus very reactive. These elements are the ''s-block'' of the periodic table. The ''p-block'', on the right, contains common non-metals such as chlorine and helium. The noble gases, in the column on the right, almost never react, since they have eight valence electrons, which makes it  very stable. The halogens, directly to the left of the noble gases, readily gain electrons and react with metals. The s and p blocks make up the ''main-group elements'', also known as '''representative elements'''. The ''d-block'', which is the largest, consists of ''transition metals'' such as copper, iron, and gold. The ''f-block'', on the bottom, contains rarer metals including uranium.  Elements in the same '''Group''' or '''Family''' have the same configuration of valence electrons, making them behave in chemically similar ways.
[[File:Subshells of Orbitals.jpg|thumb|Organization of Subshells]]

== Causes for Trends ==

[[File:Electron shell 019 Potassium.svg|thumb|left|Potassium has many core electrons; the lone outer electron can easily be peeled off due to the &quot;shielding&quot; effect.]]
There are certain phenomena that cause the periodic trends to occur.  You must understand them before learning the trends.

=== Effective Nuclear Charge ===
The ''effective nuclear charge'' is the amount of positive charge acting on an electron.  It is the number of protons in the nucleus minus the number of electrons in between the nucleus and the electron in question.  Basically, the nucleus attracts an electron, but other electrons in lower shells repel it (opposites attract, likes repel).

=== Shielding Effect ===
The ''shielding'' (or ''screening'') ''effect'' is similar to effective nuclear charge.  The ''core electrons'' repel the valence electrons to some degree.  The more electron shells there are (a new shell for each row in the periodic table), the greater the shielding effect is.  Essentially, the core electrons ''shield'' the valence electrons from the positive charge of the nucleus.

=== Electron-Electron Repulsions ===
When two electrons are in the same shell, they will repel each other slightly.  This effect is mostly canceled out due to the strong attraction to the nucleus, but it does cause electrons in the same shell to spread out a little bit.  Lower shells experience this effect more because they are smaller and allow the electrons to interact more.

=== Coulomb's Law ===
Coulomb's law is an equation that determines the amount of force with which two charged particles attract or repel each other.  It is &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{k Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of charge (+1e for protons, -1e for electrons), &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between them, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.  You can see that doubling the distance would quarter the force.  Also, a large number of protons would attract an electron with much more force than just a few protons would.

== Trends in the Periodic table ==

Most of the elements occur naturally on Earth.  However, all elements beyond uranium (number 92) are called ''trans-uranium elements'' and never occur outside of a laboratory.  Most of the elements occur as solids or gases at STP.  '''STP''' is ''standard temperature and pressure'', which is 0° C and 1 atmosphere of pressure.  There are only two elements that occur as liquids at STP: mercury (Hg) and bromine (Br).

Bismuth (Bi) is the last stable element on the chart.  All elements after bismuth are radioactive and decay into more stable elements.  Some elements ''before'' bismuth are radioactive, however.

=== Atomic Radius ===
Leaving out the noble gases, atomic radii are larger on the left side of the periodic chart and are progressively smaller as you move to the right across the period. Conversely, as you move down the group, radii increase.

Atomic radii decrease along a period due to greater effective nuclear charge.  Atomic radii increase down a group due to the shielding effect of the additional core electrons, and the presence of another electron shell.

=== Ionic Radius ===
For nonmetals, ions are bigger than atoms, as the ions have extra electrons. For metals, it is the opposite.

Extra electrons (negative ions, called anions) cause additional electron-electron repulsions, making them spread out farther.  Fewer electrons (positive ions, called cations) cause fewer repulsions, allowing them to be closer.

=== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy Ionization Energy]===
{{Info|''Ionization energy'' is the energy required to strip an electron from the atom (when in the gas state).
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;X_{(g)} + energy \rightarrow X_{(g)}^+ + e^-&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

Ionization energy is also a periodic trend within the periodic table organization. Moving left to right within a period or upward within a group, the first ionization energy generally increases. As the atomic radius decreases, it becomes harder to remove an electron that is closer to a more positively charged nucleus.

Ionization energy decreases going left across a period because there is a lower effective nuclear charge keeping the electrons attracted to the nucleus, so less energy is needed to pull one out.  It decreases going down a group due to the shielding effect.   Remember Coulomb's Law: as the distance between the nucleus and electrons increases, the force decreases at a quadratic rate.

[[Image:IonizationEnergyAtomicWeight.PNG|thumb|300px|Periodic trend for ionization energy. Each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the noble gases.]]

It is considered a measure of the tendency of an atom or ion to surrender an electron, or the strength of the electron binding; the greater the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an electron. The ionization energy may be an indicator of the reactivity of an element. Elements with a low ionization energy tend to be reducing agents and form cations, which in turn combine with anions to form salts.

=== Electron Affinity ===
{{Info|''Electron affinity'' is the opposite of ionization energy.  It is the energy released when an electron is added to an atom.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;X + e^- \rightarrow X^- + energy&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

[[File:Electron-affinity-1-Cl-3D-ionic.png|thumb|Electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is added to an atom, producing a negative ion.]]
Electron affinity is highest in the upper left, lowest on the bottom right.  However, electron affinity is actually negative for the noble gasses.  They already have a complete valence shell, so there is no room in their orbitals for another electron.  Adding an electron would require creating a whole new shell, which ''takes'' energy instead of releasing it.  Several other elements have extremely low electron affinities because they are already in a stable configuration, and adding an electron would decrease stability.

Electron affinity occurs due to the same reasons as ionization energy.

=== Electronegativity ===
''Electronegativity'' is how much an atom attracts electrons within a bond.  It is measured on a scale with fluorine at 4.0 and francium at 0.7.  Electronegativity decreases from upper right to lower left.

Electronegativity decreases because of atomic radius, shielding effect, and effective nuclear charge in the same manner that ionization energy decreases.

=== Metallic Character ===
Metallic elements are shiny, usually gray or silver colored, and good conductors of heat and electricity.  They are malleable (can be hammered into thin sheets), and ductile (can be stretched into wires).  Some metals, like sodium, are soft and can be cut with a knife.  Others, like iron, are very hard.  Non-metallic atoms are dull, usually colorful or colorless, and poor conductors.  They are brittle when solid, and many are gases at STP.  Metals give away their valence electrons when bonding, whereas non-metals take electrons.

The metals are towards the left and center of the periodic table—in the s-block, d-block, and f-block .  Poor metals and metalloids (somewhat metal, somewhat non-metal) are in the lower left of the p-block.  Non-metals are on the right of the table.

Metallic character increases from right to left and top to bottom.  Non-metallic character is just the opposite.  This is because of the other trends: ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity.

==Prerequisites==
*Basic knowledge about syntax and semantics of mathematical logic, like the concepts of Alphabet, first order language, Structure, Interpretation and Model. (see [[w:Structure (mathematical logic)|Structure]])
*The concept of axiom systems, like the axioms of real numbers, what group theory is about etc.(see [[w:Axiomatic system|Axiom system]])

==Definition==
'''Model Theory''' is the branch of Mathematical Logic that deals with the relation among formal expressions (syntax) of a logic and their meaning (semantics). This relation is established via the existence of an ''Interpretation'' of the expressions that obeys their meaning.  Such an Interpretation is said to be a ''Model'' for these expressions.

Usually mathematical subjects are about a single axiom system, whereas Model Theory is on characteristic properties of axiom systems, e.g. the theory of real numbers is not axiomatisable in first order language (just in case you ever have wondered about their 10th axiom) or the theory of rational numbers is not negation-complete whereas the theory of the reals is (what makes the latter so important).

Interpretations contain a ''Structure'' that in turn contains the ''Universe '', that is the set of 'entities' (like {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}) based on which the Interpretation is performed (e.g. the successor-relation or the addition-function is defined).  Model Theory when restricted to Interpretations over a finite Universe is said to be '''Finite Model Theory''' (FMT).

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 짐바브웨

==The Tense Consonants==
It is very important for Korean language to recognize the difference between basic sound, aspirated sound, and tense sound. It is '''not''' [[w:Aspiration_(phonetics)|aspirated]], but is pronounced strong and [[w:Fortis_and_lenis|tense]].
Tense consonants are derived from their basic form by doubling the basic letter.
{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄲ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㄸ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅃ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅆ
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅉ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [k͈] || [t͈] || [p͈] || [s͈] || [tɕ͈] ]
|}
 
The difference of the consonants' three aspects can distinguish the meanings of words:
For example, 달''dal''[tal] means 'the moon', 탈''tal''[tʰal] means 'a mask', and 딸''ttal''[t͈al] means 'a daughter'.

===Exercise===
The following Korean words contain the tensed consonants. Guess what the words mean.
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 까르보나라

| eng = [[w:Jajangmyeon|Jjajangmyeon]] }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 짬뽕
| eng = [[w:Champon|Jjamppong]] }}

==The diphthong ㅚ (''oe'')==
The vowel ㅚ is pronounced like [[w:Close-mid front rounded vowel|the ''ö'' in the German word ''sch'''ö'''n'']] ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ ø ]) or the ''wea'' in ''weather'' ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ we ]),  and [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transcribed as ''oe'']].  Its appearance shows that it was originally a [[w:Diphthong|diphthong]] of ㅗ (''o'') and ㅣ (''i'') - but you can just consider that ㅣ acts as the [[w:I-mutation|umlaut]] mark (¨) of German language.

==The diphthong ㅟ (''wi'')==
The vowel ㅟ is pronounced like the ''whi'' in ''whiskey'' ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ wi ]) or [[w:Close front rounded vowel|the ''u'' in the French word ''ch'''u'''te'']] ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ y ]), and [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transcribed as ''wi'']].

==The diphthong ㅢ (''ui'')==
The vowel ㅢ consists of the vowel ㅡ (''eu'') and the vowel ㅣ (''i''), so when you pronounce this vowel ㅢ,  pronounce ㅡ and move your tongue to pronounce ㅣ softly ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ ɯi ]). The vowel ㅢ [[w:Revised Romanization of Korean|transcribed as ''ui'']] because of efficiency.
Sometimes this is pronounced simply [[w:Close-mid front unrounded vowel|[ e ]]].

| hoc est quod dicunt: ipsa olera olla legit.

|-
|}

*'''Note:''' &quot;mentula&quot; means penis, but to give it a greater sense of the original Latin, i.e. vulgar common slang &quot;cock&quot; has been used.

==Connotations of The Text==

===Line 1===

*'''''Mentula moechatur - Mentula/a cock is an adulterer.'''''

This play on the man's nickname and the word for 'penis' is deliberately implemented to catch our attention. The word order is then reversed to further emphasise it, with the capital 'M' taken away to show that Catullus is only talking about a penis this time.

*'''''Certe. - Certainly.'''''

This abrupt use of the word imprints the statement to the reader.

===Line 2===

*'''''dicunt - they say'''''

&quot;They&quot; is understood here as a saying, i.e. &quot;you know what they say...&quot; and is designed to represent a universal agreement to the statement above, adding further to Catullus' mockery of Mentula.

==Scansion Note==

The elision at the end of Line 2 rushes through the end of the poem. Combined with the alliteration of '''olera olla''' it is a striking way to end the poem. The use of two dactyls also adds to the speed at which the poem ends.

{{Example|īps&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt; ǒlěr&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt; ōllǎ lěgît.}}

*''Syllaba anceps has been marked with a circumflex (â).

&lt;/div&gt;

Welcome back! This is the fifth lesson of &quot;Learn to read, write and pronounce Korean&quot;. This lesson covers some variations on the letters you already learned.

==The consonant ㅋ (''kieuk'')==
{{:Korean/stroke order and sound
| jamo=ㅋ (''kieuk'')
| image=ㅋ (kieuk) stroke order.png
| sound=Aspirated velar plosive.ogg}}
The first new letter is the consonant ㅋ (''kieuk''):

{|
|- align=center
| style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot; | [[w:Hangul#Jamo|Letter (''jamo'')]]:
| style=&quot;font-size:200%;border:3px solid;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; | ㅋ
|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;
| [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|Pronunciation]]:
| [kʰ]
|}

The first new letter to learn is ㅋ (''kieuk'').  It looks and similar to ㄱ (''giyeok'') but has an additional horizontal line, which indicates that ㅋ is '''aspirated'''. That is, ㅋ is pronounced with a burst of air.  As you may recall, the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds is easily demonstrated by putting a hand or a lit candle in front of your mouth and saying &quot;can&quot; ([kʰæn]) and then &quot;scan&quot; ([skæn]). You should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with &quot;can&quot; that does not appear with &quot;scan&quot;.  So, ㅋ (''kieuk'') is pronounced like the ''c'' in '''''c'''an''.

|}

The first vowel to learn is ㅑ (''ya'').  It looks and sounds similar to ㅏ (''a'').  The additional short line indicates that the pronunciation begins with a short &quot;y&quot; sound (IPA: [j]). So, ㅑ (''ya'') is pronounced like the ''ya'' in '''''ya'''hoo'', the German word ''[[wikt:ja#German|ja]]'', and the Russian word я (IPA: [ja]). In the terminology of phonetics, ㅑ (''ya'') and the other four vowels in this lesson are the ''iotized'' versions of vowels you already learned.

|- align=center style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;

|}

ㅌ (''tieut'') looks and similar to ㄷ (''digeut'') and but has an additional horizontal line, which indicates that ㅌ is '''aspirated'''. That is, ㅌ is pronounced with a burst of air.  Again, to demonstrate the aspiration, put a hand or a lit candle in front of your mouth and say &quot;tone&quot; ([tʰəʊn]) and then &quot;stone&quot; ([stəʊn]). You should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with &quot;tone&quot; that does appear with &quot;stone&quot;.  So, ㅌ (''tieut'') is pronounced like the ''t'' in '''''t'''one''.

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Identify and use verb patterns.  Verb patterns describe the form of verb which follows the first verb.  The second verb can be in the infinitive, gerund or bare infinitive (without 'to').  Also you will learn to talk about jobs: job titles and routines.

== Speaking about jobs ==
''Work with a partner, if you can, and ask/answer these questions.  If you're on your own you should think about these questions and write your answers instead.''

* Do you work or study?
* How long have you been working / studying? (note. use the [[English_for_B2_Students/Unit_3|Present Perfect]] when answering this question)
* What job did you want to do when you were 10 years old?
* Are there any jobs you would hate doing?  Why? (note. use the [[English for B2 Students/Unit 4|2nd Conditional]] when answering this question)
* In your job, what do you enjoy doing?

== Grammar - Verb Patterns ==

In English when we use two verbs together we have to decide what form the second verb should take.  We can choose between infinitive (to eat), gerund (eating) or infinitive without to (eat).  The form of the second verb depends on the first verb.  This table shows some common verbs and the form that the second verb should take.

* Some verbs like ''start, begin and prefer'' can be followed by gerun or infinitive without any change in meaning.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* ''Remember'' if followed by an infinitive suggests something that you shouldn't forget (Please remember to close the window).  ''Remember'' followed by a gerund is used to talk about a past event that you still remember (I remember closing the window [yesterday]).
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* Don't forget that many of these verbs can usually be followed by a noun instead of a verb.
|}

=== Examples of Verb Patterns ===

* Roger suggested going to the cinema (suggest + ing)
* What do you want to eat? (want + infinitive)
* I'm sorry but I must go now. (must + infinitive without 'to')
* She hates swimming at 12:00pm ( hate + ing )

== Vocabulary - Jobs ==

{{English/B2/Jobs}}

== Exercises ==

Try these questions to see if you know your verb patterns and vocabulary about jobs.  The answers can be found [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|here]].

''Complete the following sentences using the correct modal verb:''

# When I am older I would like '''to live / living''' in the USA.
# Have you decided what '''to buy / buying / buy''' yet?
# It's a secret.  You mustn't '''to tell / telling / tell''' anybody!
# I suggest '''to go / going / go''' to the seaside at the weekend.
# Please don't forget '''to close / closing / close''' the window before you leave.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Les 18 ~ Lesson 18&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Scheidbare werkwoorden in bijzinnen~ Separation and Subordination&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;small&gt;&lt;&lt; [[Dutch/Lesson 17|Les 17]] | &lt;/small&gt;'''Les 18''' | &lt;small&gt;&lt;&lt; [[Dutch/Lesson 19|Les 19]] | &lt;/small&gt;
----


=More word order=

We have seen that word order depends on quite a few factors in Dutch:

# inversion
## in questions
## for emphasis
# separation 
## of compound verbs
### auxiliary
### rest of the verbal cluster
## of prefixed verbs
## of pronominal adverbs
# subordination

==Separation and subordination==

What happens when the above factors are combined, for example if a separable verb is put in a subordinate clause?

Notice what happens to the &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;''persoonvorm''&lt;/font&gt;: that part of the verb that carries the ending:

;Inseparable ''vertrekken'':

: Direct:
:: Hij &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''vertrekt'''&lt;/font&gt; morgen naar Berlijn
: Indirect:
:: Ik zeg dat hij morgen naar Berlijn &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''vertrekt'''&lt;/font&gt;

;Separable ''aankomen'':

: Direct:
:: Hij &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''komt'''&lt;/font&gt; morgen in Berlijn '''aan'''
:: Hij &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''komt'''&lt;/font&gt; morgen '''aan''' in Berlijn
: Indirect:
:: Ik geloof dat hij morgen in Berlijn '''aan&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;komt&lt;/font&gt;'''

As you see in the subordinate clause the verb is put at the end and is ''no longer separated''.&lt;br /&gt; At least this is true for the present and simple past tense. If we use the future tense the situation is somewhat different:

;Inseparable ''vertrekken'':

: Direct:
::Hij &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; morgen '''vertrekken'''
: Indirect:
::Ik betwijfel of hij morgen '''vertrekken''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt;
::Ik betwijfel of hij morgen &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; '''vertrekken'''

;Separable ''aankomen'':

: Direct:
:: Hij &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; morgen '''aankomen'''
: Indirect:
:: Ik zeg dat hij morgen '''aan''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; '''komen'''
:: Ik zeg dat hij morgen '''aankomen''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt;
:: Ik zeg dat hij morgen &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; '''aankomen'''

There is considerable variation in word order possible, some with separation, some without and usage varies from region to region and person to person.

In general we can say that all parts of the verb like to be at the '''''end''''' of the sentence, ''except'' the '''''persoonsvorm'' of a direct phrase'''. When there are many bits and pieces at the end they tends compete for last place.

There are a few restrictions to the latter in the case of modal verbs:

:ik weet dat hij nog komen &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;moet&lt;/font&gt;
:ik weet dat hij nog &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;moet&lt;/font&gt; komen

Both are fine in Dutch, but if we add another auxiliary:

:ik denk dat hij nog &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; moeten komen 
:ik denk dat hij nog komen moeten &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt;
:ik denk dat hij nog  moeten komen &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; 

The first is fine, the second rather awkward, the third is not acceptable.

==Separable versus inseparable in dependent clauses==

Recall that some verbs occur in both a separable and an inseparable form, e.g. doorlopen.

:Ik loop de school door - takes five minutes to walk through the school physically
:Ik doorloop de school - takes five years and ends in graduation

In a dependent clause the only difference between the two is in the stress pattern, so that in written language the following sentence can have two pronunciations and two meanings:

:Ik geloof dat hij de school doorloopt

In such cases of ambiguity Dutch spelling ''allows'' the addition of stress marks:

:Ik geloof dat hij de school dóórloopt - takes five minutes
:Ik geloof dat hij de school doorlóópt - takes a number of years

==Separable infinitives and ''te''==

Infinitives are at times used with ''te'', much like in English they are with ''to'':

: Dat is moeilijk te '''lezen''' - that is hard to read

In such cases separable verbs do separate:

: Dat is onmogelijk '''op''' te '''schrijven'''

Such infinitives can express an action that must be performed (as in English something ''to do''). They can even used in an adjectival construction:

: De '''onmogelijk op te schrijven''' tekst werd ter zijde geschoven
:: The text that was impossible to write down, was pushed aside.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

This book will be a text book designed for use by learners of English as a second language.  It will be primarily aimed at B2 students.  B2 denotes the 4th (of 6) stage of the [http://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/cef.htm Common European Framework], an internationally used standard for learning languages.  This level is often referred to as Upper Intermediate or Pre-Advanced and students at this level often take the [[w:First_Certificate_in_English|University of Cambridge FCE]] examination.  For more information about CEF levels see [[../CEF|here]]

This text book will be similar to many paper text books currently available such as English File, Inside Out and Language to Go.  It will present topics in a step-by-step pattern focusing on key vocabulary, grammar, writing skills, spoken interaction and communication, listening skills and examination practice in preparation for the FCE examination.  The book will emphasise the use of everyday English and use standards of English which are familiar to speakers of English around the world - basically this means that vocabulary and grammar of British/Irish and [[w:American English|American English]] may be used although the emphasis will often be directed to the 'easier' standard or the standard that is considered most acceptable for the University of Cambridge examinations.

==Contents of English for B2 students==

This book focuses on using English in everyday situations.  Each unit of the book specialises in a particular part of grammar and a vocabulary topic.  Units in this book make use of a variety of reading and listening texts.  Each unit ends with practice exercises which should be attempted before the next unit is attempted.  At the end of every 5 units there is a 'progress test' which revises grammar and vocabulary taught in the previous units.  This book is designed to be read from start to finish however students may prefer to concentrate on a particular area of grammar or vocabulary.  Please see the [[English/English for B2 Students/Aims|Aims]] page for detailed information about the contents of each unit.

==The English language==

The flags on the Contents page display countries where English is the main, or one of the main, language(s).  The flags, from left to right, represent the following countries: The United Kingdom (original country of the English language), USA (largest English-speaking country), Canada (first language with French), South Africa (one of more than 10 official languages), Jamaica, Australia (largest English-speaking country in the southern hemisphere), Ireland, New Zealand.

As a native language English is spoken by over 350 million people but if all English speakers are included in this figure it totals well over a billion people across the globe.  English is the language of business, one of the most common languages for music and films and one of the official languages of the United Nations and the European Union.

== Grammar Focus - Present Perfect ==

* I have visited Venice.
''Do we know ''when'' I visited Venice?  Do we know how many times I visited Venice?''

The Present Perfect is a very commonly used form in English.  It is very important to learn how this form is used.

=== Present Perfect ===

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Present Perfect||3}}
! 
! Form
! Example
|-
| + positive sentences
| SUBJECT + HAVE / HAS + PAST PARTICIPLE
| I have seen ''The Lord of the Rings''.
|-
| - negative sentences
| SUBJECT + HAVEN'T / HASN'T + PAST PARTICIPLE
| I haven't seen ''The Lord of the Rings''.
|-
| ? questions
| HAVE / HAS + SUBJECT + PAST PARTICIPLE ?
| Have you seen ''The Lord of the Rings''?
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* Also for negative sentences we can use ''have / has + never + past participle - ''I have never seen'' The Lord of the Rings.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* For questions we often ask ''Have you ever'' if we want people to tell us about an experience at ANY time in their life - ''Have you ever seen'' the Lord of the Rings?
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* Remember that the present perfect is only used in situations where we don't know WHEN it happened - ''I went to France last year'' NOT &lt;strike&gt; ''I have been to France last year''.&lt;/strike&gt;
|}

== Speaking Practice ==

''Try to practice asking and answering these questions in pairs.  If you're working on your own then write your answers.''

* How big is your family?  Do you have many brothers, sisters, aunts, or uncles?
* Have you ever been on vacation with your family?  Did you like it?
* Have you ever been to see a film at the cinema more than once?  When?  What film was it?
* Whom are you closest to in your family?  How often do you see that person?

== Exercises ==
Try these questions to see if you can use the present perfect correctly.  The answers can be found [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|here]].

''Complete the following sentences using the present perfect or past simple:''

# '''Have you ever eaten / Did you ever eat''' curry?
# Last year I '''went / have been''' to Poland.
# No, I '''have never seen / never have seen''' ''The Lord of the Rings''.
# My brother says that he '''haven't eaten / hasn't eaten''' curry.

== Dipoles ==
[[Image:Dipole H2O.svg|thumb|150px|The polar bonds are symmetric, but they don't point in opposite directions.  The result is a ''dipole'' (positive pointing down).]]
Covalent bonds can be polar or non-polar, and so can the overall compound depending on its shape. When a bond is polar, it creates a '''dipole''', a pair of charges (one positive and one negative).  If they are arranged in a symmetrical shape, so that they point in opposite directions, they will cancel each other.  For example, since the four hydrogens in methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are facing away from each other, there is no overall dipole and the molecule is non-polar.  In ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), however, there is a negative dipole at the nitrogen, due to the asymmetry caused by the non-bonding electron pair.  The polarity of a compound determines its intermolecular bonding abilities.

=== Polar and Non-Polar Shapes ===

When a molecule has a linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, or octahedral shape, it will be non-polar.  These are the shapes that do not have non-bonding lone pairs. (e.g. Methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) But if some bonds are polar while others are not, there will be an overall dipole, and the molecule will be polar (e.g. Chloroform, CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The other shapes (with non-bonding pairs) will be polar. (e.g. Water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) Unless, of course, all the covalent bonds are non-polar, in which case there would be no dipoles to begin with.

=== Dipole-Dipole Bonds ===

When two polar molecules are near each other, they will arrange themselves so that the negative and positive sides line up.  There will be an attractive force holding the two molecules together, but it is not nearly as strong a force as the intramolecular bonds.  This is how many types of molecules bond together to form large solids or liquids.
[[Image:Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png|thumb|center|Dipole-dipole forces hold these two HCl molecules together.]]

===Hydrogen Bonding===
Certain chemicals with hydrogen in their chemical formula have a special type of intermolecular bond, called '''hydrogen bonds'''. Hydrogen bonds will occur when a hydrogen atom is attached to an oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine atom. This is because there is a large [[w:Electronegativity|electronegativity]] difference between hydrogen and fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen. Thus, molecules such as &lt;math&gt;HF&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_2O&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;NH_3&lt;/math&gt; are extremely polar molecules with very strong dipole-dipole forces. As a result of the high electronegativities of fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen, these elements will pull the electrons almost completely away from the hydrogen. The hydrogen becomes a bare proton sticking out from the molecule, and it will be strongly attracted to the negative side of any other polar molecules. Hydrogen bonding is an extreme type of dipole-dipole bonding. These forces are weaker than intramolecular bonds, but are much stronger than other intermolecular forces, causing these compounds to have high boiling points.
[[Image:Hydrogen-bonding-in-water-2D.png|thumb|center|The dotted line represents a hydrogen bond.]]

== Covalent Networks ==
[[Image:SiO2 - Quarz - 2D.png|thumb|150px|A covalent network]]
Silicon dioxide forms a covalent network.  Unlike carbon dioxide (with double bonds), silicon dioxide forms only single covalent bonds.  As a result, the individual molecules covalently bond into a large network.  These bonds are very strong (being covalent) and there is no distinction between individual molecules and the overall network.  Covalent networks hold diamonds together.  Diamonds are made of nothing but carbon, and so is soot.  Unlike soot, diamonds have covalent networks, making them very hard and crystalline.

==Van der Waals forces==
'''Van der Waals''', or ''London dispersion'' forces are caused by temporary dipoles created when electron locations are lopsided.  The electrons are constantly orbiting the nucleus, and by chance they could end up close together.  The uneven concentration of electrons could make one side of the atom more negatively-charged than the other, creating a temporary dipole.  As there are more electrons in an atom, and the shells are further away from the nucleus, these forces become stronger.

Van der Waals forces explain how nitrogen can be liquified.  Nitrogen gas is diatomic; its equation is N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since both atoms have the same electronegativity, there is no dipole and the molecule is non-polar.  If there are no dipoles, what would make the nitrogen atoms stick together to form a liquid?  Van der Waals forces are the answer.  They allow otherwise non-polar molecules to have attractive forces.  These are by far the weakest forces that hold molecules together.

== Melting and Boiling Points ==
When comparing two substances, their melting and boiling points may be questioned.  To determine which substance has the higher melting or boiling point, you must decide which one has the strongest intermolecular force.  Metallic bonds, ionic bonds, and covalent networks are very strong, as they are actually intramolecular forces.  These substances have the highest melting and boiling points because they only separate into individual molecules when the powerful bonds have been broken.  Breaking these intramolecular forces requires great amounts of heat energy.

Substances with hydrogen bonding will have much higher melting and boiling points than those that have ordinary dipole-dipole forces.  Non-polar molecules have the lowest melting and boiling points, because they are held together by the weak van der Waals forces.

If you need to compare the boiling points of two metals, the metal with the larger atomic radius will have weaker bonding, due to the lower concentration of charge.  When comparing boiling points of the non-polar gases, like the noble gases, the gas with the largest radius will have the highest points because it has the most potential for van der Waals forces.

Ionic compounds can be compared using Coulomb's Law.  Look for substances with high ionic charges and low ionic radii.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}

This page is going to list some common mistakes that new users might make, and for which the solution isn't obvious.

== Creating new books/pages ==

;I created a new page, but somebody said i made it incorrectly! How do I make a page part of a book? How do I make a page in a book?:Pages on wikibooks are named using what's called the &quot;forward slash convention&quot;. To put a page into this convention, we need to write &quot;Book/Page&quot;, instead of simply &quot;page&quot;. When we make a link, we have to write &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Book/Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;, and not &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; For instance, if we want to make a page for &quot;Lions&quot; in the &quot;Animals&quot; book, we can create a link to &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Animals/Lions]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;.

;I created a page by accident, Or I created a page with the wrong name, or I created a page but I dont need it anymore, what do I do?:This happens all the time, and there are a group of staff members here called &quot;administrators&quot; who can delete unneeded pages. If you want us to come delete a page you created, write &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; at the top of the page.

;I want to start writing a new book, how do I do it, and where can I go for help?:There is a good guide for writing new books: [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|Whiteknight's New Book Guide]]. If you want to start writing a new book, do a search first to make sure that there aren't already any books on your topic. If there already is a book, you should try contributing to the old book before starting a new book. When you start a new book, or if you just want to bounce the idea off some people, make an announcement about it at the [[WB:SLN|New Books Staff Lounge]].

;I created a new book or a new page, and there is some kind of message or a banner at the top! What do I do?:We've developed several pre-made messages, called &quot;templates&quot; here at Wikibooks that can help us to communicate common ideas to new editors. Any message that we post on your book is designed to ''help'' you, not to frighten you or punish you. Some of these messages will ask you a question, like &quot;what is this page about?&quot;, and some will give you a suggestion, such as &quot;you should fix the formatting&quot;. If you can't follow the suggestion, or if you don't understand, you can ask about it at the [[WB:SLP|Books and Projects Staff Lounge]].

;Can I write any kind of book I want?:The short answer is no. Wikibooks is for textbooks and instructional guides only, not for all types of books. For more information about what kinds of things we allow and what we don't allow, take a look at our complete [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]]. 

;I have previously written a book, and I would like to donate it to Wikibooks. Is this possible?:It is possible to donate books to wikibooks, but it isn't always recommended. Books that are donated must satisfy our [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]]. Also, all work on Wikibooks must be released under the [[GFDL]] license, and anybody must be allowed to edit it. If you don't want other people to edit your work, or if you don't want to lose editorial control, then don't donate your book.

== Formatting ==

;When I write text, a gray box with a dotted-blue line appears around it, and the text flows off the edge of the screen!:This is an effect known as &quot;preformatting&quot;, and occurs whenever you start a line of text with a space or a tab. Unlike normal text editing, '''you should not indent new paragraphs'''. Luckily, if you do have this problem, the solution is as easy as editing the page, deleting the spaces at the front of a paragraph, and clicking &quot;save page&quot;.

;I copied and pasted some text from a word-processor, and when I look at it on the wiki, it's wrong!:Wikibooks uses a special markup language that is similar to HTML, but is not the same. You cannot copy and paste text directly from a word processor such as Microsoft Word, because word processors like this do not use the Wiki language. If you would like to write some content in an external editor, consider a plain-text editor, such as notepad.

== Content and Collaboration ==

;HELP! I had put some content on this page, and when I came back later, it was different or even missing entirely! What happened? How did my stuff get changed?:First and foremost, wikibooks is a collaborative community, and there is nothing here that is your &quot;stuff&quot;. Because this is a community effort, other people that you don't know, people from around the world, will see your page and make edits if they want. You can't stop it, and you shouldn't want to either, because more hands make lighter work. If people want to help fix your mistakes, or add more content to your page, you should be happy to have the help.

;Another person is editing this page that I'm working on, and he keeps removing or changing what I write!:When two people go back and forth, changing each other's edit, it's called an '''edit war'''. Users should never edit war, and if another user makes an edit that you don't agree with, you should talk to them. You can post your concerns on the talk page of the page you are editing, or even directly onto that person's user talk page. Always try to discuss your disputes and reach a compromise. If you need help or intervention (as an absolute last resort) you can ask at the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]].

;Something is wrong, my page contains nonsense, or bad words, or bad images. What  happened, and how do I fix it?:Unfortunately, anybody can edit wikibooks, and that means that people who are immature can edit those pages as well. When people  delete the content on a page without a reason (&quot;page blanking&quot;), or adds obscenity to the page, we call that &quot;vandalism&quot;. If you have a problem with vandalism, post a message about it at [[WB:AN|Administrators Noticeboard]]. Make sure to include the name of the page that was vandalized.

;Where is the best place to talk about a page?:Every page has an associated &quot;talk page&quot;. At the top of your screen you should see a number of tabs, and the second one from the right will say something like &quot;talk&quot; or &quot;discussion&quot;. If you click on this tab, you will be taken to the associated talk page, where you can leave messages, ask questions, and so on. If you want to talk about an entire book, a collection of books, or some other topic entirely, you can post your message at [[WB:SL|the Staff Lounge]] instead. 

== Bookshelves ==

;How do I add a new book to a bookshelf? I can't figure it out!:Bookshelves are pages just like any other book or discussion page, and you can edit them to add links to your books by clicking the &quot;Edit this page&quot; link at the top of the page, or any of the &quot;[edit]&quot; links on the side of the page. However, bookshelves are protected against being edited anonymously, and they are also protected against being edited by very new users (fewer then 20 edits) this helps to protect against vandalism. If you have fewer then 20 edits, and want to put your new book on a bookshelf, you can ask at the [[WB:SLP|Staff lounge]] and one of our staff members will be happy to assist you.

;Which bookshelf should I add my new book to? Can I list my book on multiple bookshelves?:The entire list of bookshelves is available at [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]]. Pick the shelf or shelves that seem most appropriate to you, and add your books there. If you don't know where to add your book, ask at the [[WB:SLP|Staff lounge]]. You can add you book to multiple shelves, but make sure that they are appropriate: even a link to a book can be considered spam if you post it in inappropriate places.

== New Accounts ==

;Where is the best place to say &quot;hello&quot;?:If you want to say hello, meet some new people, and ask a few questions, the best place is the [[WB:SLN|New Users Staff Lounge]], a discussion room devoted to new users and new projects.

;How do I change my signature to be something fancy? For that matter, how do I sign a message that I write?:To sign a message that you write, you can use four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. When you save the page, Wikibooks will replace that symbol with your signature. To change your signature, open up your [[Special:Preferences|Preferences page]]. On the &quot;User profile&quot; tab, check the box for &quot;Raw Signatures&quot;, and write the code for your new signature in the box above it. You should always sign your messages on a talk or discussion page. You should never sign your name on a book page or other content page.

== General ==

;I don't like this, or that. I think this needs to change. What are you guys, lazy or stupid or something?:If you see some content that needs to be changed, you are generally welcome to change it. If there are disagreements, you should talk them over on the relevant talk or discussion pages first. Some important things can be changed by special users called &quot;Administrators&quot;, if you ask nicely at the [[WB:AN|Administrator's Noticeboard]]. Some other things are just part of the software, and if you want to change those you will need to get community support at the [[WB:SLT|Technical Chat Staff Lounge]]. Finally, there are a few things that cannot be changed, and that will not be changed. There is no sense complaining about these things, because nobody wants to hear it. Also, calling people &quot;stupid&quot; is not nice.

;I've got this great advertisement for a company or a website and...:Please keep advertisements to yourself. Wikibooks is a place to write books, not to share weblinks or plug new products. Even the best-natured advertisements are considered to be &quot;spam&quot; and are deleted. If you post too many advertisements, you could be blocked from editing Wikibooks entirely.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why Advanced Genome Analysis==

While I have made this introduction a short elementary reading, I want to appeal to my fellow wikipedians to consider the needs of graduate students, post-doctoral readers and practicing molecular biologists alike. 

For this reason, I further appeal that we condense in this book the most widely used concepts in genetic information, detailing their derivations and applications, mixing highly theoretical aspects of the field and solving major mathematical aspects encountered in molecular genetics of our time. Not just to make the reader be able to locate critical formulas, but let us also make the reader here to be in a position to review mathematical details in the field.

If we set one of our goals to help those students preparing for comprehensive examinations so that they can develop and retain broad base of knowledge and in-depth understanding of the fundamental principles in genome analysis, we should not omit key steps in crucial derivations in genomics. 

Let us make this one source of genome analysis a highly accessible format with information for professionals in their careers.

* Since this book (i) does not seem to be under active development, and (ii) is currently listed with a somewhat niche and confusing name, I suggest that it be merged with the existing Bioinformatics book. (That book also needs some love, but the title is at least appropriate.) --[[User:Etal|Etal]] ([[User talk:Etal|talk]]) 16:36, 8 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

{{SideBox|Substances with carbon and hydrogen are ''organic compounds''.  They have special names that are beyond the scope of this book.  For more information, see the [[Organic Chemistry]] Wikibook.}}
Some compounds have common names, like ''water'' for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  However, there are thousands of other compounds that are uncommon or have multiple names. Also, the common name is usually not recognized internationally.  What looks like ''water'' to you might look like ''agua'' or ''vatten'' to someone else.  To allow chemists to communicate without confusion, there are naming conventions to determine the '''systematic name''' of a chemical.

== Naming Ions and Ionic Compounds ==
Ions are atoms that have lost or gained electrons. Note that in a '''polyatomic ion''', the ion itself is held together by covalent bonds. Monoatomic cations (positive) are named the same way as their element, and they come first when naming a compound. Monoatomic anions (negative) have the suffix -''ide'' and come at the end of the compound's name.

{{TextBox|1=
; Examples of ionic compounds
* NaCl - ''Sodium chloride''
* MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Magnesium chloride''
* Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Calcium nitride''
}}

Notice that there is no need to write how many ions there are.  Between the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|periodic table]] and our knowledge of [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonds|ionic bonding]], we can determine the number of ions based on which elements are used.

=== Polyatomic Ions ===
{{Wikipedia|Polyatomic ion}}
Polyatomic ions have special names. Many of them contain oxygen and are called '''oxyanions'''. When different oxyanions are made of the same element but have a different number of oxygen atoms, prefixes and suffixes are used to tell them apart.  The chlorine family of ions is an excellent example.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Name
!Formula
|-
|Chloride
|Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Hypochlorite
|ClO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Chlorite
|ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Chlorate
|ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Perchlorate
|ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The -''ate'' suffix is used on the most common oxyanion (like sulfate SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt; or nitrate NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  The -''ite'' suffix is used on the oxyanion with one less oxygen (like sulfite SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; or nitrite NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  Sometimes there can be a ''hypo''- prefix, meaning one less oxygen than the -''ite''. There is also a ''per''- prefix, meaning one more oxygen than the -''ate''.

{{Info|Occasionally, you will see a ''bi''- prefix.  This is an older prefix, and is usually replaced with the word ''hydrogen''.  In either case, the oxyanion will have a hydrogen in it, decreasing its charge by one.  For instance, there is carbonate (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) and bicarbonate or hydrogen carbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).}}

One last prefix you may find is ''thio''-.  It means an oxygen has been replaced with a sulfur within the oxyanion.  Cyanate is OCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and thiocyanate is SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
; Examples of polyatomic ions
* NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl - ''Ammonium chloride''
* K(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) - ''Potassium hydrogen carbonate''
* AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Silver nitrate''
* CuSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Copper (&lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt;) sulfite''
}}

In the last example, copper had a roman numeral 2 after its name because the transition metals can have more than one charge.  The charge on the ion must be known, so it is written out for ions that have more than one common charge.  Silver always has a charge of 1+, so it isn't necessary (but not wrong) to name its charge.  Zinc always has a charge of 2+, so you don't have to name its charge either.  Aluminum will always have a charge of +3.  All other metals (except the Group 1 and 2 elements) must have roman numerals to show their charge.

Common polyatomic ions that you should know are listed in the following table

|-

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Stock System ===

{{SideBox|In older texts, ions were assigned names based on their Latin root and a suffix.  Common ions with this naming system include &quot;plumbous/plumbic&quot; for lead(II)/lead(IV) and &quot;ferrous/ferric&quot; for iron(II)/iron(III).  These Latin-based names are outdated, so it's not important to learn them.  We now use the ''Stock system'' instead.}}
Further explanation of the roman numerals is in order.  Many atoms (especially the transition metals) are capable of ionizing in more than one way.  The name of an ionic compound must make it very clear what the exact chemical formula is.  If you wrote &quot;copper chloride&quot;, it could be CuCl or CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because copper can lose one or two electrons when it forms an ion.  The charge must be balanced, so there would be one or two chloride ions to accept the electrons.  To be correct, you must write &quot;copper(&lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt;) chloride&quot; if you want CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &quot;copper (&lt;tt&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt;) chloride&quot; if you want CuCl.  Keep in mind that the roman numerals refer to the charge of the cation, not how many anions are attached.

Common metal ions are listed below and should be learned:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Name
!Formula
|-
|Iron(II)/Ferrous
|Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Iron(III)/Ferric
|Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Copper(I)/Cuprous
|Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Copper(II)/Cupric
|Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Tin (II)/Stannous
|Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Tin (IV)/Stannic
|Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Lead (II)/Plumbous (most common)
|Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Lead (IV)/Plumbic
|Pb&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Mercury (I) (Note: Mercury (I) is a polyatomic ion)
|Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Mercury (II)
|Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Naming Molecules ==
There are two systems of naming molecular compounds. The first uses prefixes to indicate the number of atoms of an element that are in the compound. If the substance is binary (containing only two elements), the suffix -''ide'' is added to the second element.  Thus water is ''dihydrogen monoxide''.  A prefix is not necessary for the first element if there is only one, so SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is ''sulfur hexafluoride''.  The prefix system is used when both elements are non-metallic.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Number
!Prefix
|-
|1
|Mono-
|-
|2
|Di-
|-
|3
|Tri-
|-
|4
|Tetra-
|-
|5
|Penta-
|-
|6
|Hexa-
|-
|7
|Hepta-
|-
|8
|Octa-
|-
|9
|Nona-
|-
|10
|Deca-
|-
|11
|Undeca-
|-
|12
|Dodeca-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

{{Info|If the last letter of the prefix is an ''a'' and the first letter of the element is a vowel, the ''a'' is dropped.  That makes V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; divanadium pentoxide (instead of pentaoxide).  Similar dropping occurs with ''mono''- and elements beginning with ''o'', as in the case of ''monoxide''.  This does not, however, happen with ''di''- and ''tri''-.  A molecule containing three iodine atoms would be named ''triiodide''.}}

The second system, the '''stock system''', uses ''oxidation numbers'' to represent how the electrons are distributed through the compound. This is essentially the roman numeral system that has already been explained, but it applies to non-ionic compounds as well.  The most electronegative component of the molecule has a negative oxidation number that depends on the number of pairs of electrons it shares. The less electronegative part is assigned a positive number. In the stock system, only the cation's number is written, and in Roman numerals.  The stock system is used when there is a metallic element in the compound.  In the case of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, it could also be called vanadium(&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;) oxide.  Knowing that oxygen's charge is always -2, we can determine that there are five oxygens and two vanadiums if we were given the name without the formula.

== Naming acids ==
If an acid is a binary compound, it is named as hydro[element]ic acid. If it contains a polyatomic ion, then it is named [ion name]ic acid if the ion ends in -''ate''.  If the ion ends in -''ite'' then the acid will end in -''ous''.  These examples should help.

{{TextBox|1=
; Examples of acid names
* HCl - ''Hydrochloric acid''
* HClO - ''Hypochlorous acid''
* HClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Chlorous acid''
* HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Chloric acid''
* HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; - ''Perchloric acid''
}}

==1. Explain how each of the following is formed:==
 
===a. Fog ===
[[Image:Acadia NP fog 2005-1-18.JPG|thumb|Fog in Acadia National Park]]
Relative humidity is a measure of how much water is in the air compared to how much water ''can'' be in the air.  As the temperature rises, the air can hold more water, and as it drops, it can hold less.  When the humidity is 100% and the temperature drops, the air can no longer hold all the water that is in it. Fog is moisture that gets squeezed out of the air when the temperature drops.  This moisture, a fog bank, can be thought of as a cloud near ground level.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===b. Rain ===
[[Image:22 Regen ubt.jpeg|thumb|Rain]]
Rain forms when separate drops of water fall to the Earth's surface from clouds.

For rain to fall, moist air needs to cool, resulting in condensation of vapor. This is commonly achieved by something which forces the air to rise.
Air rises because of: hills and mountains (orographic lift), irregularities on the earth surface, causing mechanical or frictional turbulence, air pressure systems colliding (such as cold fronts undercutting warmer air), hot air uplift (convection), low pressure systems in which there is a general area of upward movement.

If there is sufficient moisture and the air rises enough to form dense clouds there could be rain from any of these.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===c. Dew ===
[[Image:Water drops on spider web.jpg|thumb|Dew on s spider web]]
Dew is water in the form of droplets that appears on thin, exposed objects in the morning or evening. As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat to the sky, atmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater than that of which it can evaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===d. Snow===
[[Image:Biella-Panoramica Zegna-Bielmonte.jpg|thumb|Snow]]
Snow is precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice, consisting of a multitude of snowflakes. Since it is composed of small rough particles it is a granular material. It has an open and therefore soft structure, unless packed by external pressure.

Snow is commonly formed when water vapor undergoes deposition high in the atmosphere at a temperature of less than 0°C (32°F). It can also be produced by falling particles of ice fog formed when the humidity in surface air freezes at very low temperatures.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===e. Sleet===
In Britain and other Commonwealth countries, sleet refers to snow that has partially melted on its fall to the ground, due to surrounding air that is sufficiently warm to partially melt it while falling, but not warm enough to fully melt it into rain. Thus it refers to partially melted droplets, a mixture of snow and rain. It does not tend to form a layer on the ground, unless the ground has a temperature that is below freezing, when it can form a dangerous layer of invisible ice on surfaces known as 'black ice'. 

In American usage, sleet is a form of precipitation consisting of tiny frozen raindrops, or ice pellets. This is often mistaken for hail, but forms in a different fashion and is usually (but not always) smaller. This occurs when snow flakes falling through a small layer of warmer air in the atmosphere will begin to melt. They can then refreeze if they pass back into a layer of colder, sub-freezing air closer to the ground, resulting in little balls of ice. These ice balls may bounce when they hit the ground, and do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain. 
===f. Hail===
[[Image:Hailstorm.jpg|thumb|Hailstorm]]
Hail forms on condensation nuclei such as dust, insects, or ice crystals, when super cooled water freezes on contact. Hailstones are usually from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===g. Frost===
[[Image:Frost-oliv.JPG|thumb|Frost]]
If solid surfaces in contact with the air are chilled below the frost point, then structures of ice grow out from the solid surface. The size of the crystals depends on time and the amount of water vapor available.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==2.	 Identify either in the sky or from pictures the following types of clouds: cirrus, cumulus, stratus, nimbus. What kind of weather is associated with each.==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Cirrus over Warsaw, June 26, 2005.jpg|Cirrus
Image:Cumulus clouds in fair weather.jpeg|Cumulus
Image:St1.jpg|Stratus
Image:Rolling-thunder-cloud.jpg|Nimbus
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Cirrus: Cirrus clouds are at the highest altitudes.  They often appear thin and wispy.  They are associated with fair weather.

;Cumulus: Cumulus clouds are usually puffy and often have very distinct edges and usually a noticeable vertical development. They often have a popcorn-like appearance. Cells can be rather isolated or they can be grouped together in clusters.  The first rain to fall out of the base of a cumulus cloud evaporates into the air beneath, cooling the air - often by several degrees. This cooled air descends, and the more it is cooled the more rapidly it descends. Thus instead of air rising into a cloud we have not only rain falling out the cloud, but air as well.  This is why cool and rainy weather is associated with cumulus clouds.

;Stratus: Stratus clouds belong to a class characterized by horizontal layering with a uniform base, as opposed to convective clouds that are as tall or taller than wide (these are termed cumulus clouds). More specifically, the term stratus is used to describe flat, featureless clouds of low altitude varying in color from dark gray to nearly white. These clouds are essentially fog that is above ground level and are formed either through the lifting of morning fog or when cold air moves at low altitudes over a region. These clouds do not usually bring precipitation, although if sufficiently low in altitude to become fog, drizzle or mist may result.

;Nimbus: Nimbus clouds are dark, precipitous clouds. Nimbus is a Latin word meaning cloud or rain storm.  These are commonly called &quot;thunderclouds.&quot;

==3. Explain the action of a mercury or spirit thermometer, a mercury barometer, an aneroid barometer, and a rain gauge.==
===Spirit thermometer===
A spirit thermometer and a mercury thermometer work on the same principles.  The &quot;spirit&quot; in a spirit thermometer is alcohol, and both alcohol and mercury expand and contract with temperature changes.  When it's cold, they contract, and when it's hot, they expand.  A thermometer can be built to exploit and amplify these properties.  A glass tube with a bulb at the bottom is filled with alcohol.  The tube allows for a greater volume of alcohol, so there is more of it to expand.  When it expands, the only place it can go is into the narrow tube.  The temperature is read based on how high up the tube the expansion sends the alcohol.

===Mercury barometer===
[[Image:Hg barometer.PNG|thumb|Mercury barometer]]
A standard mercury barometer has a glass column of 76 cm (30 inches) in height, closed at one end, with an open mercury-filled reservoir at the base. Mercury in the tube adjusts until the weight of the mercury column balances the atmospheric force exerted on the reservoir. High atmospheric pressure places more downward force on the reservoir, forcing mercury higher in the column. Low pressure allows the mercury to drop to a lower level in the column by lowering the downward force placed on the reservoir.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Aneroid barometer===
[[Image:Barometre aneroide.png|thumb|Aneroid barometer]]
The purpose of a barometer is to measure the weight of the atmosphere, or the pressure exerted by the air.  An aneroid barometer is similar to a balloon, in that it has a cell filled with air.  When the outside air pressure increases, the air pressure inside the cell is also increased.  The only way it can do that is by decreasing the volume of the cell - in other words, the outside air pressure squishes the cell.  Going back to the balloon analogy, the balloon would get smaller.  When the outside air pressure decreases, the air inside the cell follows by decreasing its pressure as well.  The only way it can do this is by expanding, taking up more volume, and making the cell containing it larger.  In the balloon analogy, the balloon gets larger.  An aneroid barometer basically measures the thickness of the cell.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

An aneroid barometer uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell. This aneroid capsule (cell) is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually more capsules) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed on the face of the aneroid barometer. Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately 'stiff' so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves.

===Rain gauge===
[[Image:Standard rain Guage.JPG|thumb|Rain gauge]]
The standard rain gauge consists of a funnel attached to a graduated cylinder that fits into a larger container. If the water overflows from the graduated cylinder the outside container will catch it. So when it is measured the cylinder will be measured and then the excess will be put in another cylinder and measured. In most cases the cylinder is marked in mm and in the picture above will measure up to 25 mm (0.98 in) of rainfall. Each horizontal line on the cylinder is 0.2 mm (0.007 in). The larger container collects any rainfall amounts over 25 mm that flows from a small hole near the top of the cylinder. A metal pipe is attached to the container and can be adjusted to ensure the rain gauge is level. This pipe then fits over a metal rod that has been placed in the ground.

==4. Why is it possible to be rainy on one side of the mountain range and dry on the other? Give an illustration for your country or region.&lt;br&gt; a. Why is it cooler and more moist in the mountains than in the lowlands?&lt;br&gt; b. From which direction do rain and clear weather usually come in your locality?==
[[Image:Wave cloud.jpg|thumb|320 px|This wave cloud pattern formed off of the Île Amsterdam in the far southern Indian Ocean, due to orographic lift of an airmass by the island, producing alternating bands of condensed and invisible humidity downwind of the island as the moist air moves in vertical waves and the moisture successively condenses and evaporates.]]
'''Orographic lift''' occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain.  As the air mass gains altitude it expands and cools. This cooler air cannot hold the moisture as well as warm air and this effectively raises the relative humidity to 100%, creating clouds and frequently precipitation.

Precipitation induced by orographic lift occurs in many places throughout the world. Examples include: 
* The eastern seaboard of Australia, which faces prevailing easterly winds, 
* The mountains of New Zealand, which face a prevailing westerly flow off the Tasman Sea. 
* The southern Andes, which face a prevailing westerly flow off the Pacific Ocean. 
* The Northwestern United States and Canada (Oregon, Washington and British Columbia) see prevailing westerly flow off the northern Pacific Ocean. Places on the sea-facing side of coastal mountains see over 100 inches (over 2.5 m) of precipitation per year. These locales are on the side of the mountains which are in the path of storm systems, and therefore receive the moisture which is effectively squeezed from the clouds.

==5. Show with the help of a diagram how the earth's relationship to the sun produces the seasons.==
[[Image:Seasons.jpg]]
{{clear}}
The Earth's tilt on its axis causes the seasons.  When the axial tilt points a hemisphere away from the sun, it is winter, and when it points it towards the sun it is summer.  This is ''not'' because the distance between that part of the Earth and the Sun varies, but rather, it is because the angle of the sunlight is either more direct, or less direct.  The Earth's elliptical orbit about the sun causes its distance from the Sun to vary by a lot more than the axial tilt does, and it does not affect the seasons.  

It is better to think of it this way: shine a flashlight on a piece of paper or cardboard.  When the rays from the flashlight are parallel to the paper, the spot is circular.  If you tilt the paper, the spot becomes elongated.  The same amount of light strikes the paper in both cases, but the light is more concentrated in the circular spot verses the elongated spot.  The ''area'' illuminated by the elongated spot is greater, so less light hits each square inch in the elongated &quot;light spot&quot;.  Less light means less heat, and in the case of the Earth, that means &quot;winter&quot;.

==6. What causes lightning and thunder? What different kinds of lightning are there?==
===Lightning===
Lightning is caused when electrical charges build up in clouds.  Scientists are still unsure exactly why that happens, but it is plausible that water droplets and ice travelling up and down within the cloud separate electrons from one another and transport them to the lower portions of the cloud.  However this happens, it causes the cloud to have an electric field.  When this field becomes strong enough, the electrons in the cloud begin to repel electrons on the ground, causing the ground to have a positive charge.  When the voltage difference between the ground and the cloud becomes great enough, the air ''breaks down'' and actually conducts electricity.  The air actually turns into plasma. When it conducts, the result is a lightning strike. The charge lowers toward earth usually splitting into filaments; these attract an upward plasma charge from objects on the earth such as trees, poles, towers, animals, blades of grass. These filaments are visible to the eye. Many of these charges will travel upwards but usually only one will contact the filaments in the air completing the circuit. Once this happens, lightning strikes with a gigantic release of energy. 

Many people mistakenly believe that the reason a car is a good place to be during a lightning storm is because the rubber in the tires insulates the riders from the ground.  But considering the fact that a lightning bolt may have just travelled a mile though the air, how much do you think a quarter inch of rubber is going to slow it down?  ''Not at all!''  The reason you are safe in a car is because you are surrounded by a metal shell that will carry the electrical current around you instead of through you.

===Thunder===
Thunder is, even today, not completely understood by modern science. The word usually describes a sonic shock wave caused by the rapid heating and expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. The bolt changes the air into plasma and it instantly explodes, causing the sound known as a thunder clap.

This phenomenon occurs at the same time as a lightning flash, but a thunder clap is usually heard after lightning is seen because light travels faster (300,000,000 meters per second) than sound (around 300 meters per second). In very close proximity to the lighting strike, sound and light can be heard and seen almost simultaneously.

===Kinds of Lightning===
Some lightning strikes take on particular characteristics; scientists and the public have given names to these various types of lightning.

====Intracloud lightning, sheet lightning, anvil crawlers====

Intracloud lightning is the most common type of lightning, and occurs completely inside one cumulonimbus cloud; it is termed sheet lightning because the bolt is not seen, instead one sees the whole cloud light up from inside. Lightning that appears to travel extensively along the cloud anvil or its base is commonly called a crawler, or sometimes 'spider lightning'. Discharges of electricity in anvil crawlers travel up the sides of the cumulonimbus cloud branching out at the anvil top.

====Cloud-to-ground lightning, anvil-to-ground lightning====
Cloud-to-ground lightning is a great lightning discharge between a cumulonimbus cloud and the ground initiated by the downward-moving leader stroke. This is the second most common type of lightning. One special type of cloud-to-ground lightning is anvil-to-ground lightning, a form of positive lightning, since it emanates from the anvil top of a cumulonimbus cloud where the ice crystals are positively charged. In anvil-to-ground lightning, the leader stroke issues forth in a nearly horizontal direction until it veers toward the ground. These usually occur miles ahead of the main storm and will strike without warning on a sunny day. They are signs of an approaching storm and are known colloquially as &quot;bolts out of the blue&quot;.

====Cloud-to-cloud lightning====
Cloud-to-cloud or intercloud lightning is a somewhat rare type of discharge lightning between two or more completely separate cumulonimbus clouds.

====Ground-to-cloud lightning====
Ground-to-cloud lightning is a lightning discharge between the ground and a cumulonimbus cloud from an upward-moving leader stroke. These thunderstorm clouds are formed wherever there is enough upward motion, instability in the vertical, and moisture to produce a deep cloud that reaches up to levels somewhat colder than freezing. These conditions are most often met in summer. 

====Heat lightning or summer lightning====
Heat lightning (or, in the UK, &quot;summer lightning&quot;) is nothing more than the faint flashes of lightning on the horizon or other clouds from distant thunderstorms. Heat lightning was named because it often occurs on hot summer nights. Heat lightning can be an early warning sign that thunderstorms are approaching. In Florida, heat lightning is often seen out over the water at night, the remnants of storms that formed during the day along a sea breeze front coming in from the opposite coast. In some cases, the thunderstorm may be too distant to hear the associated thunder from the lightning discharge.

====Ball lightning====
Ball lightning is described as a floating, illuminated ball that occurs during thunderstorms. They can be fast moving, slow moving or nearly stationary. Some make hissing or crackling noises or no noise at all. Some have been known to pass through windows and even dissipate with a bang. Ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely, if ever, recorded by meteorologists.

==7. Show with the help of a diagram what a convection is. What is its relation to winds?==
[[Image:Anvil convection.jpg|thumb|Strong convection redistributes heat and moisture]]
[[Image:Convection.gif|thumb|left|Diagram showing convection currents]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
A rising body of air typically loses heat because it radiates heat. At some point the air becomes denser than the air underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising air, it moves to one side. At some distance its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it and the air begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again through surface contact, conductivity, or compression, and the cycle repeats itself. (The heating through compression of descending air is what is responsible for such welcome winter phenomena as what is known in Western North America as a Chinook wind or in the Alps as a Föhn wind.)

==8. Explain how radar, satellites, and computers are used in weather forecasting.==
===Radar===
A weather radar is a type of radar used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity. Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Both types of data can be analyzed to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause severe weather.

===Satellites===
A weather satellite is a type of satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth. These meteorological satellites, however, see more than clouds and cloud systems. City lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc., are other environmental information collected from weather satellites.

El Niño and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images. The Antarctic ozone hole is mapped from weather satellite data. Collectively, weather satellites flown by the U.S., Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch.

Visible-light images from weather satellites during local daylight hours are easy to interpret even by the average person; clouds, cloud systems such as fronts and tropical storms, lakes, forests, mountains, snow ice, fires, and pollution such as smoke, smog, dust and haze are readily apparent. Even wind can be determined by cloud patterns, alignments and movement from successive photos.

===Computers===
Computers are largely responsible for the accuracy of today's weather forecasts.  Various computers are used not only to collect weather data from thousands of sensors around the world, but also for running weather simulations, and for presenting the information to the public on television news broadcasts.

Of these tasks, running weather simulations is certainly the most demanding.  Numerical weather prediction models are computer simulations of the atmosphere. They take the analysis as the starting point and project the state of the atmosphere forward in time using an understanding of physics and fluid dynamics. The complicated equations which govern how the state of a fluid changes with time require supercomputers to solve them. The output from the model provides the basis of the weather forecast.  There are a number of models that are used in forecasting, and each of them is a little different.  Meteorologists look at the output of several and form their forecasts based on this.

==9. Tell how the following can affect our weather:==
 
===a. Jet stream===
[[Image:Jet Stream.jpg|thumb|250px|The main jet streams flow from the west in the upper atmosphere]]
Jet streams are fast flowing, relatively narrow air currents found in the atmosphere at around 11 kilometers (36,000 ft) above the surface of the Earth. They form at the boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature, such as of the polar region and the warmer air to the south.  For this reason, areas between the pole and the jet stream are cold, and area between the equator and the jet stream are warm.  As the jet stream shifts along the north-south direction, the weather shifts as well.

Meteorologists now understand that the path of the jet stream steers cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting. Jet streams also play an important part in the creation of super cells, the storm systems which create tornadoes.

The jet stream, a narrow band of fast moving wind, generally above 9 km (30,000 feet) has three dimensional regions or pockets of maximum winds along the jet. Where the winds enter these max regions it is appropriately called an ''entrance region'' and where it exits, an ''exit region''. As the wind accelerates going into a jet max it produces an area of divergence. This divergence aloft helps generate areas of convergence near the surface. These latter areas are called low pressure centers. And from them we get lots of weather. Besides helping to produce storm centers in the lower atmosphere, the jet stream then helps to steer these storms which are like pieces of wood caught in a fast moving stream of water.

===b. Volcano eruption===
When a volcano erupts, it sends incredible amounts of volcanic ash into the atmosphere.  This is enough to decrease the amount of sunlight that reaches the earth, causing a temporary (though sometimes devastating) global cooling.  It also affects the intensity of the colors in the sunset for years.

The main effect on weather right near a volcano is that there is often a lot of rain, lightning, and thunder during an eruption.  This is because all the ash particles that are thrown up into the atmosphere are good at attracting/collecting water droplets. We don’t quite know exactly how the lightning is caused but it probably involves the particles moving through the air and separating positively and negatively charged particles

==10. Make a drawing showing the water cycle in weather.==
[[Image:Water cycle.png|thumb|500px|The movement of water around, over, and through the Earth is called the water cycle.]]
The water cycle is the continuous movement of water over, above, and beneath the Earth's surface. It is powered by solar energy, and because it is a cycle, there is no beginning or end. As water moves around in the hydrosphere, it changes state among liquid, vapour, and ice. The time taken for water to move from one place to another varies from seconds to thousands of years, and the amount of water stored in different parts of the hydrosphere ranges up to 1.37 billion km³, which is contained in the oceans. Despite continual movement within the hydrosphere, the total amount of water at any one time remains essentially constant.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==11. Make a simple wind vane or rain gauge.==
===Wind Vane===
A simple wind van can be made by fastening two sides of a strip of heavy paper around a short section of drinking straw.  First, bend the strip in half.  Place the straw in the bend and then glue the strip to itself.  Drive a dowel, broom stick, or some similar item into the ground where you wish to measure the wind direction, and drive a finish nail into the top end.  Then place the straw over the nail so that it may swing freely.  When the wind blows, the vane (strip of paper and straw) will swivel on the nail indicating the wind direction.

===Rain Gauge===
A rain gauge is very simple to make.  You will need a small, transparent vessel with constant diameter from top to bottom.  If you have difficulty finding a vessel with constant diameter, you may opt to use a two-liter soda bottle.  Strip off the label.  Cut the top off the bottle, and fill it with plaster to a depth of 4 to 5 cm (this will provide a smooth bottom instead of the knobby bottom with which a two-liter bottle is typically endowed).  You may wish to use epoxy instead of plaster - it is more expensive, but is more water proof.  Plaster will work fine unless you plan to use the rain gauge for extended periods.  You can also improve the water-resistance of the plaster by varnishing it.  

Mark the sides of the vessel with a ruler, indicating millimeters and centimters, with the 0 mark coinciding with the bottom of the vessel's ''inside''.  Then set it outside where it can collect rain.  When the rain ends, a quick comparison of the water level to the indicators will tell you how much rain fell.  Empty the rain gauge between storms.

==12. Keep a weather chart for one week and record readings at 12-hour intervals. Include the following:&lt;br&gt; a. Temperature&lt;br&gt; b. Moisture (dew, fog, rain, frost, or snow)&lt;br&gt; c. Cloud formation&lt;br&gt; d. Wind direction==
You may need to call your Pathfinders every day to get them to do this.  It may help to build the weather instruments from requirement 11 first to build some excitement about weather.  It may also help to work on this honor during the season in your area that has the most extreme weather.  You can download a tracking chart here and give one to each of your students.
http://www.pathfindersonline.org/pdf/resources/weather_tracking_chart.pdf

If you are teaching this honor to a class of Explorers, there is a chart they can fill out in their diaries.

==Template documentation==

The {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer}&lt;nowiki/&gt;} template helps editors create exercises for readers.

=== Using the Korean/Question-answer template ===

To use the template, paste any of the following examples into your lesson.

A common question/answer format is to have a question '''leader''' about a Korean ('''kor''') word, supplying a '''hint''' about an English ('''eng''') answer:
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer
 | leader = Translate the following word into English:
 | kor = 말
 | hint = 4 letters
 | eng = word}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| leader = Translate the following word into English:
| kor = 말
| hint = 4 letters
| eng = word}}


Many lessons include lists of Korean ('''kor''') words to translate into English ('''eng'''), optionally with a '''hint''':
 Translate each of the following words into English:
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 말 | hint= 4 letters | eng=word}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 말 | hint= 4 letters | eng=word}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 말 | eng = word}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 말 | eng = word}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
Translate each of the following words into English:
{{Korean/Question-answer| kor = 말 | hint =4 letters | eng = word}}
{{Korean/Question-answer| kor = 말 | hint =4 letters | eng = word}}
{{Korean/Question-answer| kor = 말 | eng = word}}
{{Korean/Question-answer| kor = 말 | eng = word}}


To help editors quickly contribute Korean words to a lesson, the English translation may be omitted:
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 말 }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 한글 }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor= 말 }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor= 한글 }}


You can add a custom &quot;trailer&quot;.
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer
 | kor = 말
 | trailer = ... what is the initial consonant?
 | answer = The initial consonant in 말 is ㅁ. }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| kor = 말
| trailer = ... what is the initial consonant?
| answer = The initial consonant in 말 is ㅁ. }}


Your question and answer can be any text.
 {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Korean/Question-answer
 | question = What is your question?
 | answer = Your answer goes here.}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}
{{Korean/Question-answer
| question = What is your question?
| answer = Your answer goes here.}}


The following shows a placeholder asking editors to contribute questions.

This was marked as qr-em and became speedy but the magic isn't working at present so it didn't make it to the category.  However I am not happy deleting this as a speedy anyway.  Over to you folk --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:48, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

&lt;strike&gt;* '''Move''': I think something like this would do well as an example in the C++ book, though I'm not sure if it's a legit program or not, someone who knows something about programming would need to check that. But I'm not sure if this topic is already covered in the existing C++ book, and/or if it has any examples of how to do it. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 13:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt;

* '''Move''' : Will take a look if some content is fit for the C+++ Programming book, Is there a book on Io ? I'll give you some info later if so a merge would be good solution.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:46, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
::As [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] points out there is a similarity in the page &lt;tt&gt;Binding Io to C++&lt;/tt&gt;(more code) and  [[Io Programming/Binding Io to C++|Programming:Io/Binding Io to C++]] on the [[Io Programming]] book, the page content would fit to both books, but mostly useful to the Io, I propose it should be moved to that book namespace the contributors informed and let them chose how to go about it. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

* '''Comment''': to me it looks like something intended to be part of [[Io Programming]]. I suppose that sort of answers the question of is there a book on Io. However that book looks like its more intended to be a tutorial from what it says. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

* '''Merge and Move, or Delete.''' : After looking at the edit history of [[Io Programming/Binding Io to C++|Programming:Io/Binding Io to C++]] and &lt;tt&gt;Binding Io to C++&lt;/tt&gt;, I noticed they were both started by the same IP address on the same day with little difference in time, there is a good chance that both were created by the same individual. I think either both pages should be merged and moved into the Io Programming book or this copy deleted since it was created before the other copy and &lt;tt&gt;Programming:Io/Binding Io to C++&lt;/tt&gt; moved to [[Io Programming/Binding Io to C++]] to fix the naming convention. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:32, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::'''Merge''': I was completely unaware of this, but if it is essentially the same content there's no point to having it twice, and yeah I think it makes more sense in a book on IO than one on C++ (not sure though, how relevant is it, for all the computer programmers out there?) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:28, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Comment - a '''Merge''' in this situation is not as easy, merge will require tagging and waiting, since the content seems to be at least some kind o duplication (it is about the same topic but the content is not equal and it is from the same editor it seems) a move to the IO book would address its &quot;orphan&quot; state, people on the book can then take care of the page or select what best fits their needs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

:::: Why don't we say we move it to IO then, this discussion's been dead for over a month! If there's no objections of course, do you think the current title would be fine?  [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:48, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

{{closed|'''Kept'''. Sorry i forget which template to use when closing a VfD. There is no consensus to delete this, although there is plenty of room for this to be improved. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 18:57, 30 April 2007 (UTC)}}

Same as above --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:04, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - Ditto my remarks about [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam]], as this is essentially the same kind of Wikibook in stub form at the moment.  Hopefully even having something like this as a stub may inspire somebody in the future to create a Wikibook on this topic that is much more comprehensive.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - accepting the &quot;maybe a stub might bring someone&quot; there really is nothing worthwhile here and it has not been actively edited for a year (barely then).  It really is just &quot;headings&quot; - anyone wanting to write this will almost certainly start again --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:29, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
*:To note here, there is value to having stubs, and really no real benefit in getting rid of them.  This merely becomes a slightly more elaborate &quot;suggested idea for a new Wikibook&quot; instead.  Pressing the &quot;delete&quot; button does not really remove the content from the Wikimedia servers, it only hides it from &quot;ordinary Wikibookians&quot;.  Clearly this is something that would be useful on Wikibooks if we could but have somebody willing to extend this book.  It should be clearly marked as a stub and left alone as a backwater part of Wikibooks.  Besides, there is no policy about deleting stubs on Wikibooks either, and indeed the [[WB:DP|Deletion Policy]] specifically states &quot;In general, keep stubs.&quot;  I think this clearly applies here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - As per my comment for the above vfd.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:31, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per my reasons re above vfd  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Archolman|Archolman]] ([[User talk:Archolman|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Archolman|contribs]]) 23:12, 17 Mar 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;
*'''Keep''' - stubs as in book plans should not be targets of VfD, a good enough reason would be someone starting a similar book and then requesting a delete.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as per my comments above. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' or, at most, user-fy / scrapbook. Stubs are an excellent way to start a book; an outline is even better because it lays down your ideas for the reader. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:25, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== Naming ==

Thanks for the contribution.  Can you look at the naming policy as your new subpage does not comply?  Simple to rename though - just use the &quot;move&quot; tab and give it the new name - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:25, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
:Again - can you look at the naming of [[Logic for Computer Scientists: 2. Introduction]], it should be named either [[Logic for Computer Scientists/2. Introduction]] or [[Logic for Computer Scientists/Introduction]] (numbering can be easily done on the main page) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:38, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== Image copyright ==

You forgot about the license here: [[:Image:Example1.png]]. Please select one from [[WB:ICT]].

By the way, are you the author of [[Logic for Computer Scientists]] text? I see attribution for &quot;Uli Furbach&quot; there. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:42, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

== Logic for Computer Scientists ==

Hi SarahGb,

the Book you are working on looks great - im currently working on a similar one 
[[Computer_Science:Logic]].  I picked it up from other people that have worked on it before.

what would think about a merge?  You can deal with chapter 1&amp;2 as you like, I'm mainly interested in model theory (ch 4 &amp; 5) and we could think about how to structure the rest?

(430 - 360 b.c.) we want to focus to the development of mathematical
logic, for which Gottfried Frege can be seen as the founder
(Begriffsschrift, 1879). That was the first time, logic was
introduced in a totally formal language; of course there have been others like Leibniz and
Boole who contributed to the formalisation of logic, but it was Frege
who radically introduced the idea  of formalisation and
deduction. This aspect is of particular interest for computer science,
because there, the automation of the deduction process is
investigated.
The development of modern mathematical logic came along with a deep
crisis in mathematics: At the end of the 19th and the
beginning of the 20th century axiomatisation of set theory and  of
arithmetic have been a focus of mathematical research and in 1910
-1913 Whitehead and Rusell published their Principia Mathematica, an
attempt to formalise the entire mathematics on the grounds of a formal
logic, which was essentially the one given by Frege. This
formalisation made it possible to avoid a number of antinomies, which
have been discussed at that time.  However it was in 1931, that Kurt
Goedel proved in his famous incompleteness theorems, that an
approach to formalise arithmetic cannot be complete given its
consistency.  
It is important to note that during this period in the 1930th the
foundation of theoretical computer science was laid: Alan Turing
published his work on theoretical machines and on computability,
Alonso Church developed his &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-calculus and Stephen Kleene
developed the foundations of recursion theory.

For the rest of this introduction we will directly jump into the use
of logic for modern computer science. The reader who is interested in
history of logic is referred to the bibliographic section at the end
of this introduction.


==Programming==
Within the last decade it turned out that computerised systems are the very base
of advanced technology. Software is present in nearly all devices of modern
houses, in our cars, not to speak about aircrafts or weapons. Without going into
details, it is immediately obvious that for most, if not all applications,
robust, safe and correct behaviour of a system is mandatory. To achieve this it
is widely accepted that it is only possible if formal methods are applied during
the entire process of hard- and software-development.  In the following we
shortly depict some tasks where the use of logic has proved to be extremely
helpful.

==Abstract Datatypes==
In order to define datatypes and to derive efficient implementations
for it, the concept of abstract datatype definitions is central. The
idea is to define the abstract properties of a datatype, instead of
giving special realisations. A very trivial example is the definition
of a ''stack'':
Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; be an alphabet. In order to define a stack &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; over
&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; we assume &lt;math&gt;clear&lt;/math&gt; to be a nullary function and we define the
following properties of stacks:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 clear \in S \\

 \forall  s \in S \;  \forall x \in \Sigma \;(push(s,x)\in S)\\ 

 \forall s \in S  \; (s \neq clear \Rightarrow pop(s) \in S)\\

 \forall s \in S  \; (s \neq clear \Rightarrow top(s) \in\Sigma)\\

 \forall s \in S \; (empty(s) \in \{true, false\})\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Hence, we have the functions &lt;math&gt;clear, push&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;pop&lt;/math&gt;, which yield
stacks and the predicate &lt;math&gt;empty&lt;/math&gt;, furthermore we need the following
properties with respect to the &lt;math&gt;push&lt;/math&gt;-operation. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\forall s \in S  \; \forall x \in \Sigma   \; (push(s,x)  \neq  clear) \\    

\forall s \in S  \; \forall x,y \in \Sigma \; (push(s,x) = push(s,y) \Rightarrow  x=y)\\

\forall s,t\in S  \; \forall x \in \Sigma  \; (push(s,x) = push(t,x)&amp; \Rightarrow  s=t)\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


And we have to give properties with respect of the combinations of
functions: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\forall s \in S  \; \forall x \in \Sigma &amp;( top(push(s,x)) = x \land 
pop(push(s,x)) = s)\\

\forall s \in S  \; \forall x \in \Sigma &amp; ( empty(push(s,x))= false)\\

&amp;  empty(clear) = true\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The above formulae state what properties we expect stacks to
have. Obviously it contains no hints how to implement such a data
type. And indeed this specification is aiming to solve other problems, 
e.g. 
  
*Is the specification correct? I.e. is there a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; together    with the given operations, such that the axioms above hold? 
*Is the specification complete. I.e. do the axioms imply all the   properties we intuitively assume a  stack to have? Are there sets   &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which do not meet our expectations? 
The reader may have already noticed, that the axioms are nothing else
than formulas in predicate logic, i.e. all logic where variables like &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
together with so called quantifiers &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; are used.
The above two questions,
namely correctness and completeness, are very central topics for the design of
formal systems in logic. The proof of these properties often is difficult and
costly, but on the other hand it is one of the clear advantages of logical
systems, that these properties ''can be proved formally''. In the main part of
this course we will deal with these questions explicitly.

==Program Developments==
There are a number of attempts to define methods, which allow the development of
a program together with a formal argument of its correctness. We will give a
very rough idea with a toy example. 
Assume the following simple program contains a loop, and assume that 
it has an array of integers:
&lt;pre&gt;
   max := a(1);
   do i = 2,n
   if a(i) &gt; max then max := a(i)
   end
&lt;/pre&gt;
In order  to understand what is going on if this program is
executed, the following so called ''loop invariant'' is helpful:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall j : 1 \leq j \leq i \Rightarrow max \geq a(j)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This means, that for every value of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. before and after every 
execution of the if-statement within the do-loop the above formula is
valid. Now assume that the loop is executed the last time, hence the
value of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; after executing of the loop-body is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, one can conclude
that max contains the maximum value of the array:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 
\forall j : 1 \leq j \leq n \Rightarrow max \geq a(j)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another important issue for program development is the  
'''specification of programs'''. In order to give a formal specification
of the above program for finding the maximum of an array the following
logical formula can be used:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall S \; \forall m  \; max(S, m) \Leftrightarrow (S \neq \emptyset \Rightarrow ( m \in S \land \forall x
\; (x \in S \Rightarrow m \geq x)))
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that in this specification &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be a set. There is 
no decision yet made, that this has to be implemented by means of an
array. 

On the other hand logic can be used not only for the specification but 
also as programs itself. The following is  a logic program which 
computes the  maximum value of a list of values. Lists are
represented as  [ head.tail ], where head denotes the front 
element of a list, tail the rest of the list and  nil the
empty list.

&lt;pre&gt; 
   max([m.nil], m) &lt;-  .
   max([head.tail], m)    &lt;-  max([tail], m), 
                              head &lt; m. 
   max([head.tail], head) &lt;-  max([tail], m), 
                              head &gt;= m. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Artificial Intelligence==
One of the oldest sub-disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is
automated theorem proving. In the early days some were very optimistic about
using theorem provers as general problem solvers for various different tasks,
like action planning, knowledge representation or program verification. Now it
is clear, that for special tasks tailored reasoning systems are necessary. We
will comment in this subsection on theorem proving, aiming at proving
mathematical theorems and on knowledge representation. This idea can be seen as
going back to the ideas of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646 - 1716), who
already at this time had a dream of  formalisation, and even
automatisation of mathematics.

A recent success is the proof of Robbins conjecture, which even reached 
the New York Times. For details see http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/papers/robbins/.
In 1933, E. V. Huntington presented  the following basis for
Boolean algebra:
&lt;pre&gt;
    x + y = y + x.                      
                      [commutativity]
    (x + y) + z = x + (y + z).          
                      [associativity]
    n(n(x) + y) + n(n(x) + n(y)) = x.   
                      [Huntington equation]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Shortly thereafter, Herbert Robbins conjectured that the Huntington equation can be replaced with a simpler
one: 
&lt;pre&gt;
    n(n(x + y) + n(x + n(y))) = x.      
                      [Robbins equation]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Robbins and Huntington could not find a proof, and the problem was
later studied by Tarski and his students.
The proof that solves the Robbins problem was found October 10, 1996,
by the theorem prover EQP. EQP is similar in many ways to the  more
well known program
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/AR/otter/. The main
differences are that EQP has associative-commutative (AC) unification,
is restricted to equational logic, and offers more paramodulation
strategies. See the http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/papers/33-basic-test-problems/
for details.

==Knowledge Representation==
In many Artificial Intelligence the representation and manipulation of
knowledge is a central task. To this end numerous graphic-oriented
formalisms have been invented.



An informal semantics of this graphical notation states, that both,
''man''  and ''animal''  are ''mammal''  and that ''man''  have a
''nationality''  and an ''age'', whereas an ''animal''  has ''age''
and no  ''nationality''.
A closer investigation of the semantics of such a formalism would
show,  
that this is nothing than a pictorial representation of the following
set of predicate logic  formulae:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall x (man(x) \Rightarrow mammal(x))
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall x (animal(x) \Rightarrow mammal(x))
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall x (man(x) \Rightarrow \exists y\; age(x, y))
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall x (man(x) \Rightarrow \exists y\; nationality(x, y))
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall x (mammal(x) \Rightarrow  \exists y\; age(x))
&lt;/math&gt;

==Problems==
====Problem 1 (Introduction)====

In a criminal case the following facts are proved:
  
#At least one of the three persons X,Y,Z is guilty. 
#If X is guilty and Y is innocent, then Z is guilty. 
These circumstances are not sufficient to accuse one of them but it can be said for certain that at least one of two persons must be guilty. Which two are these?

====Problem 2 (Introduction)====

Which of the following syllogisms are valid? Give a reason for your answer or give a counterexample.
  
#All &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, some &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are not &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; then: Some &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.         
# All &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, some &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are not &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; then: Some &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; 
#All &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, some &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are not &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; then: Some &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

====Problem 3 (Introduction)====

In a meeting there are 100 politicians discussing with each other. Everyone of them is either corrupted or uncorrupted. The Following facts are known:
  
#at least one politician is uncorrupted.
# In each pair of two politicians is at least one corrupted .  How Many of the politicians are corrupt, how many are uncorrupted?

====Problem 4 (Introduction)====
The anthropologist Abercrombie entered the island of the knights
and the mucker with a slack feeling he have never had before. He 
knew that very wondrous people lived on this island: The knights
made only true propositions the mucker false propositions every time.
Abercrombie knew also that he had to find a friend before he could
experience something. He had to find someone whose propositions he
can trust. So he asked the first three people of the island he met
to find a knight. Abercrombie asked Arthur at first: Are Bernard and
Charles both knights? Arthur answered: Yes they are! Abercrombie
asked then: Is Bernard a knight? With a big surprise he get the
answer: No! Is Charles a knight or a mucker?
Deduce your answer and give a reason for it.

====Problem 5 (Introduction)====

A little island had exactly 100 inhabitants. Every inhabitant
either always told the truth or always lied. One Researcher came
one day on the island  and questioned the inhabitants sequentially.
The first told: &quot;There is at least one liar with
us.&quot; The second said: &quot;At least two liars live among us.&quot;
etc.. The last finally claimed: &quot;There are 100 liars on this
Island.&quot; How many liars were there really?
The researcher went to another island with 99 Inhabitants a year later.
In an interview the inhabitants of these island spoke
completely corresponding like on the first island, i.e. the
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th inhabitants said: &quot;There are at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; liars here.&quot; What
can you say about this island?

====Problem 6 (Introduction)====

In a village the priest explained one Sunday: &quot;It was confessed to me
that there are men who are unfaithful in our village. However, the confessing secret forbids it
to me to call the names. It will you nevertheless learn
all of them, if we proceed as follows: Any woman who for certain
knows that her husband is unfaithful shall throw him in the
following night out of the house.&quot;
However, the problem  was that every woman knows all about every other
husband but nothing about her husband. In the
next morning the priest went through the streets; not one single man
was turned adrift. Also on
the next day he saw nobody. But at 100th acre he saw men, who had
been thrown out of the house by their wifes. How many?

====Problem 7 (Introduction)====

There is a hotel with countable infinitely many rooms 0, 1, 2,.... All rooms are vacant. Now, a &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-decker bus comes with &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; many seats on every deck.
How can all of the passengers be accommodated in the hotel?

&lt;br&gt;
This logic course is intended for computer scientists and it
assumes practically no previous knowledge except some basic
mathematical notions like relations and orderings.
The material presented here can, of course, be printed and used as
an ordinary textbook. However, it should be pointed out; that this
is not the intention of the author; the aim was to create an
electronic, interactive script where logics can be experienced by
interaction and experimentation. The reader who is interested in
more traditional forms of a textbook is referred to the following
sources:
  
* Uwe Schöning: Logik für Informatiker. BI-Wissenschaftsverlag, Mannheim, 1987.  The chapter on propositional logics is based on the treatment in this book. Some definitions and proofs are given in the same way Schöning does. 
* Chin-Liang Chang; Richard Char-Tung Lee: Symbolic Logic and Mechanical Theorem Proving. Academic Press, London, 1973. The chapter on predicate logics is based on this standard textbook on mechanical theorem proving. 
* Melvin Fitting: First-Order Logic and Automated Theorem Proving. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1990. This is a modern computer science oriented treatment of analytic tableaux, which inspired the sections on tableaux of this course. 
Further bibliographic information will be given at the end of each
section.&lt;br&gt;

I'm filling in this text in order to teach my partner some statistics before she starts medical school. A brief intro is on the Cover page. Feel free to add stuff: this is my first wikibook, and I hope I've started this in the right way. Discuss stuff here if you aren't sure. [[User:HYanWong|Yan]] 12:17, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== R code ==

If you want to add stuff, note that a lot of use is made of [[Template:Code]], in particular [[Template:Code:Interpreted]]. Some notes on usage are at [[Template:Code#Code:Interpreted]]. [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 23:01, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

== To do ==

* Ask in new users forum about [[Special:Upload| uploading]] text files, to use titanic data
* Ask about toggling sections (to globally hide R topics)
* Correct links in /R folder

* Get in fit state for contributions (comments on each chapter)!

== General points ==

Try to use &quot;classic data sets&quot; in the main text: these usually make good examples and are not software dependent. R-specific datasets can be used in topic boxes. Here are some suggestions: please add any you think fit. Many are in the R package &quot;HistData&quot;.
* von Bortkiewicz's deaths by horse kicks in the Prussian army (&quot;prussian&quot; in R package &quot;pscl&quot;)
* Titanic death/survival (&quot;titanic&quot; in R &quot;datasets&quot;, or (better), titanic3 in &quot;PASWR&quot;)
* Student's criminal data (&quot;crimtab&quot; in R &quot;datasets&quot;)
* Fisher's iris data (&quot;iris&quot; in R &quot;datasets&quot;)
* Bumpus' sparrow data
* Michelson's speed of light data (&quot;morley&quot; in R &quot;datasets&quot;)
* John Snow's cholera spatial data ()
* Richard Doll's smoking in doctors dataset (try &quot;breslow&quot; in R &quot;boot&quot;)
* Anscombe's quartet (&quot;anscombe&quot; in R &quot;datasets&quot;)
* ?old Faithful data
* ? data from Gosset, &quot;The Probable Error of a Mean,&quot;

== Justification for chapter layout ==

==== General points ==== 
* Aim to introduce the &quot;why&quot; behind statistics - this is not a book of statistical recipes.
* Should aim to introduce the idea of statistical models asap

==== Chapter ideas ====
* '''Intro''' Basic principles of data analysis, plus plots
* '''Chapter 0''' We should provide a &quot;getting started in R&quot; to allow users to install R, and see how it works etc. Since this is not statistics-specific, it is considered a pre-chapter
* '''Chapter 1''' To provide the background to statistics, have a &quot;philosophy of analysis&quot; type chapter at the very start
* '''Chapter 2''' We cannot advance into modelling without some prior knowledge about what it is that we are trying to model - the atoms of the system, as it were. Hence next chapter has to be to introduce data types
* Now we can introduce modelling. There are two distinct parts to this
*# What is a statistical model (examples, etc.)
*# How can we come up with statistical models
** What order should these be done in? On this principle that it is useful to have an example in one's mind when discussing a topic, (1) has been taken first. Hence 
* '''Chapter 3''' Statistical models
* '''Chapter 4''' IDA/EDA data exploration

== Conventions for markup used in this book ==

Some general suggestions for formatting. Are these sensible?

* Variables in ''italics''. 
* Factor levels in 'single quotes' (reserve double quotes for clarifying prose)
* Topic boxes
** No R code outside topic boxes
** R code that is interspersed with discussion text within a topic box should be on its own line with an indent, to give &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;-type formatting
** Named R objects in discussion text should be surrounded by &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; tags. Functions should have braces.
* Headings etc
** TOC on each page shows header levels down to h4 (but not h5 or h6)
** Main text uses header levels h2, h3, and h4.
** Figures and tables labelled with &amp;lt;h5&amp;gt; (so they are not put in the TOC)
** Topic boxes are titled using &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;-level tags (to be included in the TOC)</text>

Data is the life blood of statistical analysis. A recurring theme in this book is that most analysis consists of constructing sensible ''statistical models'' to explain the data that has been observed. This requires a clear understanding of the data and where it came from. It is therefore important to know the different types of data that are likely to be encountered. Thus in this chapter we focus on different types of data, including simple ways in which they can be examined, and how data can organised into coherent ''datasets''.

{{DropBox|headType=h4|ha1=right|float=none|bg=#8888FF|style=clear: none;|dropClass=nodrop|R topics in Chapter 2|
The R examples used in this chapter are intended to introduce you to the nuts and bolts of R, so may seem dry or even overly technical compared to the rest of the book. However, the topics introduced here are essential to understand how to use R and it is particularly important to understand them. They assume that you are comfortable with the concepts of assignment (i.e. storing objects) and functions, as detailed  [[../Statistics and R|previously]]. }}

== Variables ==

The simplest sort of data is just a collection of measurements, each measurement being a single &quot;data point&quot;. In statistics, a collection of single measurements of the same sort is commonly known as a variable, and these are often given a name&lt;ref&gt;The convention (which is followed here) is to write variable names in italics&lt;/ref&gt;. Variables usually have a  reasonable amount of background context associated with them: what the measurements represent, why and how they were collected, whether there are any known omissions or exceptional points, and so forth. Knowing or finding out this associated information is an essential part of any analysis, along with examination of the variables (e.g. by plotting or other means).

=== Single variables in R ===

{{TranscludeBox|headType=h4|ha1=right|bg=#8888FF|Missing data|../R/Missing data}}

=== Measurement values ===

One important feature of any variable is the values it is allowed to have. For example, a variable such as ''gender'' can only take a limited number of values ('Male' and 'Female' in this instance), whereas a variable such as ''humanHeight'' can take any numerical value between about 0 and 3 metres. This is the sort of obvious background information that cannot necessarily be inferred from the data, but which can be vital for analysis. Only a limited amount of this information is usually fed directly into statistical analysis software. As always, it's very important to take account of such background information. This can be usually done using that commodity - unavailable to a computer - known as common sense. For example, a computer could be used to perform an analysis of human height without realising that one person has been recorded as (say) 175, rather than 1.75, metres tall. A computer can blindly perform analysis on this variable without noticing the error, even though it is glaringly obvious to a human&lt;ref&gt;Similar examples are given in Chatfield ****&lt;/ref&gt;. That's one of the primary reasons that it is important to plot data before analysis.

==== Categorical versus quantitative variables ====

Nevertheless, a few bits of information about a variable ''can'' (indeed, often must) be given to analysis software. Nearly all statistical software packages require you, at a minimum, to distinguish between '''categorical''' variables (e.g. ''gender'') in which each data point takes one of a fixed number of pre-defined &quot;levels&quot;, and '''quantitative''' variables (e.g. ''humanHeight'') in which each data point is a number on a well-defined scale. Further examples are given in Table 2.1. This distinction is important even for such simple analyses as taking an average: a procedure which is meaningful for a quantitative variable, but rarely for a categorical variable (what is the &quot;average&quot; sex of a 'male' and a 'female'?).

* The variable ''shrimp'', where each data point is the determination of the percentage of shrimp in a preparation of shrimp cocktail (!)
* The variable ''deathsPerYear'', where data point is a count of a number of individuals who have died from a particular cause in a particular year.
* The variable ''cases'', where each data point is a count of the number of people in a particular group who have a specific disease. This may be meaningless unless we also have some measure of the group size. This can be done by via another variable (often labelled ''controls'') indicating the number of people in each group who have ''not'' developed the disease (grouped case/control studies of this sort are common in areas such as medicine).

It is not always immediately obvious from the plain data whether a variable is categorical or quantitative: often this judgement must be made by careful consideration of the context of the data. For example, a variable containing numbers 1, 2, and 3 might seem to be a numerical quantity, but it could just as easily be a categorical variable describing (say) a medical treatment using either drug 1, drug 2, or drug 3. More rarely, a seemingly categorical variable such as colour (levels 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'red') might be better represented as a numerical quantity such as the wavelength of light emitted in an experiment. Again, it's your job to make this sort of judgement, on the basis of what you are trying to do.

==== Borderline categorical/quantitative variables ====
Despite the importance of the categorical/quantitative distinction (and its prominence in many textbooks), reality is not always so clear-cut. It can sometimes be reasonable to treat categorical variables as quantitative, or vice versa. Perhaps the commonest case is when the levels of a categorical variable seem to have a natural order, such as the ''class'' variable in Table 2.1, or the [[w:Likert scale|Likert scale]] often used in questionnaires.

In rare and specific circumstances, and depending on the nature of the question being asked, there may be rough numerical values that can be allocated to each level. For example, maybe a survey question is accompanied by a visual scale on which the Likert categories are marked, from 'absolutely agree' to 'absolutely disagree'. In this case it may be justifiable to convert the categorical variable straight into to a quantitative one. 

More commonly, the order of levels is known, but exact values cannot be generally agreed upon. Such categorical variables can be described as '''ordinal''' or '''ranked''', as opposed ones such as ''gender'' or ''professedReligion'' which are purely '''nominal'''. Hence we can recognise two major types of categorical variable: ordered (&quot;ordinal&quot;) and unordered (&quot;nominal&quot;), as illustrated by the two examples in Table 2.1.

==== Classification of quantitative variables ====

Although the categorical/quantitative division is the most important one, we can further subdivide each type (as we have already seen when discussing categorical variables) . The most commonly taught classification is due to Stevens (1946). As well as dividing categorical variables into ordinal and nominal types, he classified quantitative variables into two types, '''interval''' or '''ratio''', depending on the nature of the scale that was used. To this classification can be added '''circular''' variables. Hence classifying quantitative variables on the basis of the measurement scale leads to three subdivision (as illustrated by the subdivisions in Table 2.1):
* ''Ratio data'' is the most commonly encountered. Examples include distances, lengths of time, numbers of items, etc. These variables are measured on a scale with a natural zero point. Because we can 
* ''Interval data'' is measured on a scale where there is no natural zero point. The most common examples are temperature (in degrees Centigrade or Fahrenheit) and calendar date. Since the zero point on the scale is essentially arbitrary, The name comes from the fact that while ratios are not meaningful, intervals are. E.g. means that ****
* ''Circular data'' is measured on a scale which &quot;wraps around&quot;, such as ''Direction'', ''TimeOfDay'', ''Logitude'' etc. *** 

The Stevens classification is not the only way to categorise quantitative variables. Another sensible division recognises the difference between '''continuous''' and '''discrete''' measurements. Specifically, quantitative variables can represent either
* ''Continuous data'', in which it makes sense to talk about intermediate values (e.g. 1.2 hours, 12.5%, etc.). This includes cases where data have been rounded ***.
* &quot;Discrete data&quot;, where intermediate values are nonsensical (e.g. doesn't make much sense to talk about 1.2 deaths, or 2.6 cancer cases in a group of 10 people). Often these are '''counts''' of things: this is sometime known as '''meristic''' data.
In practice, discrete data are often treated as continuous, especially when the units into which they are divided are relatively small. For example, the population size of different countries is theoretically discrete (you can't have half a person), but the values are so huge that it may be reasonable to treat such data as continuous. However, for small values, such as the number of people in a household, the data are rather &quot;granular&quot;, and the discrete nature of values becomes very apparent. One common result of this is the presence of multiple repeated values (e.g. there will be a lot of 2 person households in most data sets).

A third way of classifying quantitative variables depends on whether the scale has upper or lower bounds, or even both. 
* bounded at one end (e.g. ''landArea'' cannot be below 0), 
* at both ends (e.g. percentages cannot be less then 0 or greater than 100). Also see censored data ***
* unbounded (''weightLoss'').




Most important is circular - often requires very different analytical tools. Often best to make linear in some way (e.g. difference from a fixed direction).

Interval data cannot use ratios (division). Rather rare

Bounds: very common to have lower bound. Unusual to have only an upper bound. Both often indicates a percentage. - often treated by transformation (e.g. log)

Count data: if multiple identical values, can affect plotting etc. If true independent counts, indicates error function.


The distinctions between the different types of variables are summarised in Figure ***. Note that it is also common to

=== Independence of data points ===
Does the actual value cause correllations in &quot;surrounding&quot; values (e.g. time series), or do both reflect some common association (e.g. blocks/heterogeneity).

=== Visualising a single variable ===

Before carrying out a formal analysis, you should always perform an Initial Data Analysis, part of which is to inspect the variables that are to be analysed. If there are only a few data points, the numbers can be scanned by eye, but normally it is easier to inspect data by plotting. 

Scatter plots, such as those in Chapter 1, are perhaps the most familiar sort of plot, and are useful for showing patterns of association between two variables. These are discussed later in this chapter, but in this section we first examine the various ways  of visualising a single variable. 

Plots of a single variable, or ''univariate plots'' are particularly used to explore the distribution of a variable; that is its shape and position. Apart from initial inspection of data, one very common use of these plots is to look at the ''residuals'' (see Figure 1.2): the  unexplained part of the data that remains after fitting a statistical model. Assumptions about the distribution of these residuals are often checked by plotting them.

The plots which follow illustrate a few of the more common types of univariate plot. The classic text is Tufte (cite: the visual display of quantitative information).

==== Categorical variables ====
For categorical variables, the choice of plots is quite simple. The most basic plots simply involve counting up the data points at each level. 
&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Figure 2.1: Categorical data plots&quot; widths=&quot;112px&quot; heights=&quot;225px&quot; perrow=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; float:left&quot;&gt;
Image:R-Dunn_gender_barchart.svg|(a) A simple bar chart, giving number of data points in different categories
Image:R-Titanic_passengers.svg|(b) Alternative, for highly ordered data: symbols mark number of data points, lines imply intermediate values are conceptually possible
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Figure 2.1(a) displays these counts as a '''bar chart'''; another possibility is to use points as in Figure 2.1(b). In the case of ''gender'', the order of the levels is not important: either 'male' or 'female' could come first. In the case of ''class'', the natural order of the levels is used in the plot. In the extreme case, where intermediate levels might be meaningful, or where you wish to emphasise the pattern between levels, it may be reasonable to connect points by lines. For illustrative purposes, this has been done in Figure 2.1(b), although the reader may question whether it is appropriate in this instance.
&lt;pre&gt;plot(1:length(Gender), Gender, yaxs=&quot;n&quot;); axis(2, 1:2, levels(Gender), las=1)&lt;/pre&gt;
In some cases we may be interested in the actual sequence of data points. This is particularly so for time series data, but may also be relevant elsewhere. For instance, in the case of ''gender'', the data was recorded in the order that each child was born. If we think that the preceeding birth influences the following birth (unlikely in this case, but just within the realm of possibility if pheremones are involved), then we might want to do Symbol-by-Symbol plot . If we are looking for associations with time, however, then a bivariate plot may be more appropriate ***, or there are particular features of the data that we are interested in (e.g. repeat rate), then other possibilities exist (doi:10.1016/j.stamet.2007.05.001).See chapter on time series

A quantitative variable can be plotted in many more ways than a categorical variable. Some of the most common single-variable plots are discussed below, using the land area of the 50 US states as our example of a continuous variable, and a famous data set of the number of deaths by horse kick as our example of a discrete variable. These data are tabulated in Tables 2.2 and 2.3

Some sorts of data consist of many data points with identical values. This is particularly true for count data where there are low numbers of counts (e.g. number of offspring). 


There are 3 things we might want to look for in these sorts of plots
* points that seem extreme in some way (these are known as outliers). Outliers often reveal mistakes in data collection, and even if they don't, they can have a disproportionate effect on further analysis. If it turns out that they aren't due to an obvious mistake, one option is to remove them from the analysis, but this causes problems of its own/
* shape &amp; position of the distribution (e.g. normal, bimodal, etc.)
* similarity to known distributions (QQ)

We'll keep the focus mostly on the variable &quot;landArea&quot; ***

The simplest way to represent quantitative data is to plot the points on a line, as in Figure 2.3(a). This is often called a '''dot plot'', although this is also sometimes used to describe a number of other types of plot (e.g. Figure 2.7)&lt;ref&gt;Authors such as Wild &amp; Seber call it a dot plot, but R uses the term &quot;dotplot&quot; to refer to a Cleveland (1985) dot-plot as shown in Figure 2.1(b). Other authors (***) specifically use it to refer to a sorted (&quot;quantile&quot;) plot as used in Figure *** (cite) &lt;/ref&gt;. To avoid confusion, it may be best to call it a one-dimensional scatterplot. 
As well as simplicity, there are two advantages to a 1D scatterplot 
# All the information present in the data is retained.
# Outliers are easily identified. Indeed, it is often useful to be able to identify which data points are outliers. Some software packages allow you to identify points interactively (e.g. by clicking points on the plot). Otherwise, points can be labelled, as has been done for some outlying points in Figure 2.3a&lt;ref&gt;Labels often obscure the plot, so For plots intended only for viewing on a computer, it is possible to print labels in a size so small that they can only be seen when zooming in.&lt;/ref&gt;.

One dimensional scatterplots do not work so well for large datasets. Figure 2.3(a) consists of only 50 points. Even so, it is difficult to get an overall impression of the data, to (as the saying goes)  &quot;see the wood for the trees&quot;. This is partly because some points lie almost on top of each other, but also because of the sheer number of closely placed points. It is often the case that features of the data are best explored by summarising it in some way.

Figure 2.3(b) shows a step on the way to a better plot. To alleviate the problem of points obscuring each other, they have been displaced, or ''jittered'' sideways by a small, random amount. More importantly, the data have been summarised by dividing into '''quartiles''' (and coloured accordingly, for ease of explanation). The quarter of states with the largest area have been coloured red. The smallest quarter of states have been coloured green.

More generally, we can talk about the '''quantiles''' of our data&lt;ref&gt;There a many different methods for calculating the precise value of a quantile, when it lies between two points. See Hyndman and Fan (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;. The red line represents the 75% quantile: 75% of the points lie below it. The green line represents the 25% quantile: 25% of the points lie below it. The distance between these lines is known as the '''Interquartile Range''' (IQR), and is a measure of the spread of the data. The thick black line has a special name: the '''median'''. It marks the middle of the data, the 50% quantile: 50% of the points lie above, and 50% lie below. A major advantage of quantiles over other summary measures is that they are relatively insensitive to outliers, or changes in scale ****.

Figure 2.3(c) is a coloured version of a widely used statistical summary plot: the '''boxplot'''. Here it has been coloured to show the correspondence to Figure 2.3(b). The box marks the quartiles of the data, with the median marked within the box. If the median is not positioned centrally within the box, this is often an indicator that the data are skewed in some way. The lines on either side of the box are known as &quot;whiskers&quot;, and summarise the data which lies outside of the upper and lower quartiles. In this case, the whiskers have simply been extended to the maximum and minimum observed values.

Figure 2.3(d) is a more sophisticated boxplot of the same data. Here, ''notches'' have been drawn on the box: these are useful for comparing the medians in different boxplots. The ''whiskers'' have been shortened so that they do not include points considered as outliers. There are various ways of defining these outliers automatically. This figure is based on a convention that considers outlying points as those more than one and a half times the IQR from either side of the box. However it is often more informative to identify and inspect interesting points (including outliers) by visual inspection. For example, in Figure 2.1a it is clear that Alaska and (to a lesser extent) Texas are unusually large states, but that California (identified as an outlier by this automatic procedure) is not so set-apart from the rest.

One problem with plotting on a single line is that, if points are repeated, there ***. This is particularly problematic for discrete data. NB, there is no particular reason (or established convention) for these plots to be vertical. Figure 2.2 shows . The stacked plot (Figure 2.4d) is similar to a histogram (Figure 2.5).

This gives another way of picturing the median &amp; other quantiles: as dividing the area into sections ***

We can space out the points along the other axis. For example, if the order of points in the dataset is meaningful, we can just plot each point in turn. This is true for whatsit's horse-kick data. The data by year are plotted in Figure 2.6.

{| class=&quot;wikitable subfigures&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; border: 0; float:right;&quot;

|}

One thing we can always do is to sort the data points by their value, plotting the smallest first, etc. This is seen in Figure 2.3b. If all the data points were equally spaced (and excluded each other****), we would see a straight line. The plot for the logged variables shows that this transformation has evened out the spacing somewhat. This is called a quantile plot, for the following reason



when the axes are swapped, this is called the empirical cumulative distribution function. The unswapped data is useful for understanding qq plots. Also for understanding quantiles. median, etc.

==== Transformations ====
We could put a scale break in, but a better option is usually to '''transform''' the variable.

{| class=&quot;wikitable subfigures&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; border: 0; float:right;&quot;
|+ align=&quot;bottom&quot; style=&quot;caption-side: bottom; font-weight:bold;&quot; | Figure 2.8: The effect of log transformation

|-
|[[Image:R-US_state_areas-quantile_log.svg|none]]
|}


Sometimes, plotting on a different scale (e.g. a logarithmic scale) can be more informative. We can visualise this either as a plot with a non-linear (e.g. logarithmic) axis, or as a conventional plot of a '''transformed''' variable (e.g. a plot of log(my.variable) on a standard, linear axis). Figure 2.1(b) illustrates this point: the left axis marks the state areas, the right axis marks the logarithm of the state areas. This sort of rescaling can highlight quite different features of a variable. In this case, it seems clear that there are a batch of nine states which seem distinctly smaller than most, and while Alaska still seems extraordinarily large, Texas does not seem so unusual in that respect. This is also reflected by the automatic labelling of outliers in the log-transformed variable.

It is particularly common for smaller numbers to have greater resolution. As discussed in later chapters ***, logarithmic scales are particularly useful for multiplicative data ***.

|-
|[[Image:R-US_state_areas-quantile_sqrt.svg|none]]
|}

There are other common transformations, for example, the square-root transformation (often used for count data). This may be more appropriate for state areas, if the limiting factor for state size is (e.g.) the distance across the state, or factors associated with it (e.g. the length of time to cross from one side to another). Figure 2.1c shows a sqrt rescaling of the data. You can see that in some sense this is less extreme than the log transformation...

This template is used for displaying the name of a book, all relevant links, and transcluding the [[User:Whiteknight/Notes|Notes page]] for that book. This is mostly used at [[User:Whiteknight/All Books]]. 

{{User:Whiteknight/Color|red|Warning!}} This template makes heavy use of ParserFunctions, and may only be transcluded into one of my user pages. Attempts to edit this template by other people besides myself will likely be reverted. Plus, this template is very complex and convoluted, so any attempts to edit it will probably fail. I can't even do it right every time, and I know what's supposed to be happening.

;Parameters:
:1: Name of the book
:title: Alternative name of the book, if it should be displayed differently from how the various pages are named.
:code: The [[User:Whiteknight/Book Status Codes|status code]] of the book.
:pc: Alternative name of the personal collection, if any
:cc: Alternative name of the community collection, if any
:state: the state of the book on a sliding scale: bad, stub, expand, revise, review, candidate, featured. &lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

'''''Erigeron''''' (syn. ''Stenactis'') is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with the highest species diversity in North America.

The most widely used common name, fleabane, is shared with related plants in several other genera; another common name is summer starwort. The common name is derived from the belief that the dried plants repelled fleas.

Many species are used as ornamental plants, with numerous named cultivars such as 'Wayne Roderick', 'Charity', 'Dunkelste Aller' and 'Foersters Liebling'.

==Description==
The species are annuals, biennials or perennials. They are well-branched plants with erect stems, characterized by their numerous white, lavender or pink ray flowers and yellow disc flowers. Some members of this group have no ray flowers. The pappus (= modified calyx, forming a crown) is shorter than in Aster, and consists of bristles. The ray florets are narrower than in Aster, but are clearly longer than the involucre (= whorled bracts).

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvesting==

== Creating This Template ==
To create a page header template using this design, go to the template page and type:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Simple Header|&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Where &lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt; is the title of your book. Click &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; to create the template. This will substitute in all the necessary code and text. 

=== Options ===

You can customize the CSS style of the template by adding a second argument:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Simple Header|&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|&lt;&lt;STYLE&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you add this style parameter, it will override all the default styles from the template. The default style, which you may want to duplicate in whole or in part, is:

 width:90%; clear:both; padding:5px; margin:5px auto;

== Using This Template ==

To use this template in your book, use regular template syntax to include it at the top of every page. This template takes no arguments. 

== Notes ==

      <comment>/* Calculating Molecular Formula */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Naming Substances|next=Stoichiometry}}

==Calculating Formula Masses==
{{SideBox|In molecules but not ionic compounds, the formula mass is also known as the '''molecular mass'''.}}
The calculation of a compound's formula mass (the mass of its molecule or formula unit) is straightforward. Simply add the individual mass of each atom in the compound (found on the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|periodic table]]).   For example, the formula mass of glucose (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is 180 amu.

Molar masses are just as easy to calculate.  The molar mass is equal to the formula mass, except that the unit is grams per mole instead of amu.

==Calculating Percentage Composition==
Percentage composition is the relative mass of one substance in a compound compared to the whole. For example, in methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the percentage mass of hydrogen is 25% because hydrogen makes up a total of 4 amu out of 16 amu overall.

===Using Percentage Composition===
Percentage composition can be used to find the '''empirical formula''' of a compound, which shows the ratios of elements in the compound. However, this is not the same as the molecular formula. For example, many sugars have the empirical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which could correspond to a molecular formula of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.

{{TextBox|1=
;To find the empirical formula from percentage composition, follow these procedures for each element.
#Convert from percentage to grams (for simplicity, assume a 100 g sample).
#Divide by the element's molar mass to find moles.
#Simplify to lowest whole-number ratio.}}

For example, a compound is composed of 75% carbon and 25% hydrogen by mass. Find the empirical formula.
*75g C / (12 g/mol C) = 6.25 mol C
*25g H / (1 g/mol H) = 25 mol H
*6.25 mol C / 6.25 = 1 mol C
*25 mol H / 6.25 = 4 mol H

Thus the empirical formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Calculating Molecular Formula===
If you find the empirical formula of a compound and its molar/molecular mass, then you can find its exact molecular formula.  Remember that the molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of the empirical formula. For example, a compound with the empirical formula HO has a molecular mass of 34.0 amu. Since HO would only be 17.0 amu, which is half of 34.0, the molecular formula must be H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
; Exercise for the reader
An unknown substance must be identified.  Lab analysis has found that the substance is composed of 80% Fluorine and 20% Nitrogen with a molecular mass of 71 amu.  What is the empirical formula?  What is the molecular formula?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi SivartM,

Thanks for your work on the Mammals honor.  Glad to have you here on Wikibooks!  I upped Mammals to  100% and announced it on the PF forum. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 17:07, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

You're welcome! I finally found a few honors that I could contribute to. Awesome, thanks!

:Let me know if you want to work on importing articles from Wikipedia, especially if you're inclined to create something of a Field Guide to Reptiles.  At first I was including a mini-field guide in the honors themselves, but later decided it would be better to make a stand-alone field guide.  But the &quot;proper&quot; way to do that is by importing articles from Wikipedia rather than doing a cut-n-paste, because it preserves authorship data as required by the GFDL.  If you do cut and paste more than a couple of sentences from WP, let me know so I can merge the article history (I have admin privs on Wikibooks now, and that's required for doing an import/merge). Also drop me a note if you have any questions about formatting, etc.  And thanks again for your work.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 19:19, 15 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Fluorine ==
Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table, and is also the most reactive. Flourine is a special case as Fluorine has anomalous properties due to its small size. It has a lower electron affinity than Chlorine due to electron repulsions in the overcrowded outer shell. However, it is a stronger oxidising agent than Chlorine due to its unusually low bond energy. This is due to the repulsions between outer electrons in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.

===Production of Gametes===

----
'''Draw the structure of testis tissue as seen using a light microscope.'''

'''Outline the processes involved in spermatogenesis including mitosis, cell growth, the two divisions of meiosis, and cell differentiation.'''
:# The outer layer of cells, called '''spermatogonia''' (2n) divides by mitosis, producing more spermatogonia (also 2n).
:# Spermatogonia grow into larger cells called '''primary spermatocytes''' (2n).
:# Primary spermatocytes (2n) carry out the first stage of meiosis, producing 2 '''secondary spermatocytes''' (n).
:# Each secondary spermatocyte carries out the second division of meiosis, producing four '''spermatids''' (n).
:# Spermatids become associated with nurse cells called '''sertoli cells''', which help the spermatids develop into '''spermatozoa''' (n).
:# Mature sperm (the spermatozoa) detach from sertoli cells and eventually are carried out of the testes by fluid in the center of the '''seminiferous tubule'''.

'''Outline the origin and the role of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and lutenizing hormone (LH) in spermatogenesis.'''
:*Follicle Stimulating Hormone: Released by the '''pituitary gland'''; stimulates primary spermatocytes to undergo the first division of meiosis.
:*Testosterone: '''Released by testes'''; stimulates development of secondary spermatocytes into mature sperm.
:*Lutenizing Hormone: Released from the '''pituitary gland'''; stimulates '''secretion of testosterone''' by testes.

'''Draw the structure of the ovary as seen using a light microscope.'''

'''Outline the processes involved in oogenesis including mitosis, cell growth, the two divisions of meiosis, the unequal division of cytoplasm, and the degeneration of polar bodies.'''
:# In the ovaries of a female fetus, cells called '''oogonia''' (2n) divide by mitosis to make more oogonia cells. 
:# Oogonia grow into larger cells called '''primary oocytes''' (2n).
:# Primary oocytes start meiosis but '''stop at prophase I'''. Primary oocytes and a single layer of follicle cells form a primary follicle.
:# When a baby girl is born, the ovaries contain 400,000 primary follicles.
:# Every menstrual cycle, a few primary follicles start to develop -- During this time, the Primary oocyte completes meiosis I, forming two haploid (n) daughter nuclei - cytoplasm of the primary oocyte develops unequally, forming a secondary oocyte (n) and a small polar body (n).
:# Then, the Secondary oocyte starts second division of meiosis but stops at prophase II. The follicle cells, meanwhile, are reproducing quickly and follicle fluid is forming.
:# When the mature follicle bursts at the time of ovulation, the released egg is still a '''secondary oocyte''' (n).
:# After fertilization, the secondary oocyte completes the second division of meiosis to form an '''ovum''' with the sperm nucleus already inside.
:*Polar bodies do not develop into eggs; they degenerate.

'''Draw the structure of a mature sperm and egg.'''

'''Outline the role of the epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate gland in the production of sperm.'''
:*Epididymus - where mature sperm are '''stored''', waiting to be released into the '''vas deferens''' to become part of ejaculatory fluid.
:*Seminal vesicle - releases a sugary solution to feed sperm nutrients during their journey.
:*Prostate gland - releases an '''alkaline (very basic/high pH) solution''' that constitutes seminal fluid; alkaline solution helps provide the proper environment for the sperm while they're in the acidic environment of the female reproductive system.

'''Compare the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, including the number of gametes and the timing of the formation and release of gametes.'''
:*Number of gametes - Spermatogenesis: '''4'''; Oogenesis: '''1'''.
:*Timing of formation - Spermatogenesis: '''constantly''', beginning at puberty; Oogenesis: up to prophase I by time of birth, up to prophase II '''every menstrual cycle''', completion only at time of fertilization.
:*Release of gametes - Spermatogenesis: '''variable''' starting at puberty; Oogenesis: '''monthly''' starting at puberty.

===Fertilization and Pregnancy===
----
'''Describe the process of fertilization including the acrosome reaction, penetration of the egg membrane by a sperm, and the cortical reaction.'''
:# Acrosome reaction - When a sperm comes in contact with the protein coats surrounding the egg, the acrosome (an enzyme-filled vacuole at the tip of the sperm cell) bursts open and releases enzymes that digest the jelly-like coating of the egg.
:# Penetration of egg membrane - When the sperm membrane comes in contact with the egg membrane, the two membranes fuse, and the sperm nucleus enters the cytoplasm of the egg. This, as implied, happens after the arcosome reaction which digests the jelly-like coating of the egg to allow the sperm to penetrate the egg membrane. 
:# Cortical reaction - Once the membranes have fused, a chemical reaction occurs in the egg membrane, making it impossible for other sperm cells to enter the egg. This prevents other sperm from attempting to fertilize the egg. 

'''Outline the role of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) in early pregnancy.'''
:HCG is an embryonic hormone that '''maintains secretion of progesterone and estrogen''' by the uterus lining through the first trimester. The level of HCG in maternal blood is so high that it is present in the urine, which allows it to be detected for pregnancy tests.

'''Describe the structure and function of the placenta, including its hormonal role in the maintenance of pregnancy (secretion of estrogen and progesterone).'''
:*During the first 2-4 weeks of development, the embryo obtains nutrients directly from the '''endometrium''' (the uterus lining).
:*Tissues grow out of the developing embryo and '''mingle with the endometrium to form the placenta'''.
:*Diffusion of material between the maternal and embryonic circulatory systems '''via the placenta''' provides nutrients, exchanges respiratory gases, and disposes of metabolic wastes from the embryo.
:*Blood from the embryo travels to the placenta through the arteries of the umbilical cord and returns though the umbilical vein.
:*The embryo '''secretes hormones''' that signal its presence and controls the mother's reproductive system.
:*HCG acts like '''lutenizing hormone''' to maintain secretion of progesterone and estrogen.

{{User:Whiteknight/Esoteric}}

== Creating This Template ==
To create a page header template using this design, go to the template page and type:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Page List Header|&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|&lt;&lt;PAGELIST&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Where &lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt; is the title of your book. &lt;&lt;PAGELIST&gt;&gt; is a listing of pages in your book, typically separated by a dash, and mdash, or some other symbol. Click &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; to create the template. This will substitute in all the necessary code and text. 

=== Options ===

You can customize the CSS style of the template by adding a third argument:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Page List Header|&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|&lt;&lt;PAGELIST&gt;&gt;|&lt;&lt;STYLE&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you add this style parameter, it will override all the default styles from the template. The default style, which you may want to duplicate in whole or in part, is:

 width: 90%; clear: all; padding: 5px; margin: 5px auto;

== Using This Template ==

To use this template in your book, use regular template syntax to include it at the top of every page. This template takes two arguments, both of which are unnamed. The first argument is the name of the previous subpage, and the second argument is the name of the next subpage. page names are automatically prepended with the name of the book. This means that you cannot use this template to navigate to pages in other books.

== Notes ==

      <comment>/* Forward and Back Links */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is going to contain short code snippets that can be copy+pasted into header templates.

== Print Versions ==

Want your navigational templates to disappear on the printable version of your book? Use this parser function around your navigational template:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#ifeq: {{SUBPAGENAME}} | Print Version || &lt;!--NAVTEMPLATE--&gt; }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Where &quot;Print Version&quot; is the subpage name of your printable version. For instance, if your print version is located at &quot;My Book/My Print Version&quot;, and we wanted our navigational template to be a simple link to the TOC, we could write:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#ifeq: {{SUBPAGENAME}} | My Print Version || [[My Book]] }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Forward and Back Links ==

Want to include forward and back links into your navigational template? If our header template is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{My Template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, we can include two optional arguments in it like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{My Template|Last Page|Next Page}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

In our template, we can write this to create a forward link in our page, or no link if we don't have a &quot;previous page&quot; (such as the first page of your book):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{1|}}} | &amp;larr; [[My Book/{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Similarly, we can create an optional &quot;next&quot; link:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{2|}}} | [[My Book/{{{2}}}|{{{2}}}]] &amp;rarr; | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Putting these together, we can create a template with a forward link, a back link, and a link to the TOC in the middle:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{1|}}} | &amp;larr; [[My Book/{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] &amp;mdash; | }}
[[My Book]]
{{#if: {{{2|}}} | &amp;mdash; [[My Book/{{{2}}}|{{{2}}}]] &amp;rarr; | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Named Variables ===

If you would prefer to use named parameters instead of the default numbered parameters, you can write this instead:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{last|}}} | &amp;larr; [[My Book/{{{last}}}|{{{last}}}]] | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

and:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{next|}}} | [[My Book/{{{next}}}|{{{next}}}]] &amp;rarr; | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Simple Last and Next Links ===

If you don't want the page titles to appear in the forward and backward links, you can modify the code above to print simply &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{1|}}} | &amp;larr; [[My Book/{{{1}}}|Last]] | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

and 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{#if: {{{2|}}} | [[My Book/{{{2}}}|Next]] &amp;rarr; | }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Likewise, you can replace all the instances of the number &quot;1&quot; with the word &quot;last&quot; and all instances of the number &quot;2&quot; with the word &quot;next&quot;, if you want to use named paramters instead.

== Top Links ==

To make a link appear at the very top of the page, to the left of the page title, you can use the following span:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;top-navigation&quot; class=&quot;subpages noprint&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

The links will appear at the top of the page, and will be disabled during printing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 10: Defense Against Infectious Disease==
----
===Types of Defense===
----
'''Describe the process of clotting.'''
:*Platelets are small fragments that circulate along with erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells) in blood plasma.
:# Clotting process begins with the release of incomplete fragments of cells from the damaged tissue, resulting in the '''formation of thrombin'''.
:# Thrombin '''converts fibrinogen''' (always in the bloodstream) into the fibrous protein '''fibrin'''.
:# Fibrin captures red blood cells and immobilizes the fluid portion of the blood so as to provide the impetus for clotting.
:# Blood becomes slightly solidified (similar to a gelatin-like substance) until...
:# Platelets reach this fibrous mass and send out sticky extensions to each other. 
:# The platelets then contract, forcing out the liquid and scabbing over the wound! 

'''Outline the principles of challenge and response, clonal selection, and memory cells as the basis of immunity.'''
:*'''B cells''' make antibodies.
:*The immune system can make '''10^15''' different types of antibodies (but not all at once).
:*A few of each type of B cell are produced and they wait until the body is infected with an antigen.
:*When this occurs, they multiply to form many clones; this is called '''Clonal Selection.'''
:*A clone of B cells can '''produce large amounts of antibodies quickly''' and give immunity to a disease, only after the immune system is challenged by a disease -- this is called the challenge and response system. The immune system needs to be &quot;challenged&quot; by a disease, usually in the form of an antigen present upon it, and then the immune system responds by producing a clone of &quot;B&quot; cells which produce large amounts of antibodies to fight and eliminate the pathogen. 

'''Define active immunity, passive immunity, natural immunity, and artificial immunity.'''
:*Active immunity - Immunity '''due to antibody production''' by the organism following the invasion by pathogens.
:*Passive immunity - Immunity due to '''antibodies received from another organism''' which made them as a result of that particular organism's own active immunity.
:*Natural immunity - Immunity as the result of infection with a pathogen, as per the challenge and response method. 
:*Artificial immunity - Immunity as the result of a vaccine which contains antibodies that are used to fight the pathogen. 

'''Explain antibody production.'''
:# Macrophages '''consume bacteria with antigen molecules''' in their membranes.
:# Macrophages '''present these antigens''' on their membranes with the help of special protein structures.
:# Helper T-cells come in contact with macrophages, pick up the antigens, and incorporate them into their own protein structures - this will allow them to present the antigens to B-cells. This also causes the activation of the Helper t-cells.
:# Activated helper-T-cells activate B-cells by passing their antigen to B-cell receptors.
:# The B-cells then divide to form clones of antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory cells.

'''State that cytotoxic T-cells destroy cancer cells and body cells infected with viruses.'''
'''Cytotoxic T-cells''' destroy cancer cells and body cells infected with viruses. 

'''Describe the production of monoclonal antibodies along with one use of them in diagnosis and one use in treatment.'''

:*Monoclonal antibodies - large quantities of a single type of antibody, produced using the procedure outlined below:

''':*Production'''
::#Antigens that correspond to a desired antibody are injected into an animal.
::#B-cells producing the desired antibody are extracted.
::#Tumor cells are obtained from another source (tumor cells grow and divide endlessly).
::#B-cells are fused with tumor cells, producing '''hybridoma''' '''cells''' that divide endlessly, providing the desired antibodies.
::#The hybridoma cells are cultured and antibodies they produce are extracted and purified.
:*Treatment of rabies
::*Rabies usually causes death in humans before the immune system can control it.
::*Injecting monoclonal antibodies when a person gets infected will control the virus and at the same time, the person's body begins making its own antibodies.
:*Diagnosis of malaria
::#Monoclonal antibodies are made '''to bind to antigens in malarial parasites'''.
::#A test plate is covered with antibodies.
::#The sample to be tested is left on the plate long enough for malaria antigens (if present) to bind to antibodies.
::#The sample is rinsed off and any bound antigens are detected using more monoclonal antibodies with attached color-changing enzyme.
:::*Color-changing enzyme can be used to measure the level of infection and distinguish between different strains of malaria.

Production should be limited to the '''fusion of tumour and B-cells''' and their subsequent '''proliferation and production of antibodies'''. Detection of antibodies to HIV is one example in diagnosis. Others are detection of a specific cardiac isoenzyme in suspected cases of heart attack and detection of HCG in pregnancy test kits. Examples of the use of these antibodies for treatment include targeting of cancer cells with drugs attached to monoclonal antibodies, emergency treatment of rabies or cancer, blood and tissue tying for transplant compatability and purification of industrially made interferon.

'''Outline the principle of vaccination.'''
:*A '''weakened or dead version of a pathogen''' is injected into the body, causing the immune system to mount a primary response.
:*This results in the '''production of B memory cells'''.
:*The B-cells &quot;'''remember'''&quot; the antibodies to produce in response to the pathogen.
:*When the real pathogen strikes, a secondary response occurs, aided by the memory cell production of pathogen-specific antibodies.
:*This response is much stronger than the primary repsonse and prevents any ill effects.

'''Distinguish between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies'''
:*Polyclonal antibodies
::*A mixed population of antibodies with '''multiple responses'''. They recognize multiple '''epitopes''' (separate antigen markers - areas on the surface of a given protein macromolecule that are in turn recognized by the immune system).
::*Produced by injecting animals with a specific antigen. A series of antibodies are produced in response to a variety of different sites on the antigen.
:*Monoclonal antibodies
::*Single, '''specific antibodies''' with only one response (to just one antigen).
::*See above for production.

'''Discuss the benefits and dangers of vaccination against bacterial and viral infection, including the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) and two other examples.'''
:*Benefits of vaccination
::*Some diseases, such as small pox, '''can be eradicated'''.
::*Deaths can be prevented, ex. from measles.
::*Long-term disabilities can be prevented
:::*Rubella in pregnant women can lead to birth defects
:::*Mumps can cause infertility in men.
:*Dangers of vaccination
::*Immunity developed after vaccination '''may not be as effective''' as immunity developed in response to the actual disease.
::*Dangers of side effects of some vaccines include:
:::*Whooping cough, vaccine can cause brain damage.
:::*Pregnant women, cancer patients, and others can be harmed by cross-infection from people vaccinated with the live virus, ex. smallpox vaccine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

== Relationships between variables ==

In any experiment, the object is to gather information about some event, in order to increase one's knowledge about it. In order to design an experiment, it is necessary to know or make an educated guess about ''cause and effect'' relationships between what you change in the experiment and what you are measuring. In order to do this, scientists use established theories to come up with a '''hypothesis''' before experimenting.

== Hypothesis ==

A hypothesis is a prediction of the effects of changing one variable on another. The variable(s) that ''you'' change in the experiment are called '''independent variables''', while those that change because of changes you have made are called '''dependent variables'''. A hypothesis says something to the effect of:

Changing independent variable X should do something to dependent variable Y.

For example, suppose you wanted to measure the effects of temperature on the solubility of table sugar (sucrose). Knowing that dissolving sugar doesn't release or absorb much heat, it may seem intuitive to guess that the solubility does not depend on the temperature. Therefore our hypothesis may be:

Increasing or decreasing the temperature of a solution of water does not affect the solubility of sugar.

== Isolation of Effects ==

When determining what independent variables to change in an experiment, it is very important that you '''isolate the effects''' of each independent variable. You do not want to change more than one variable at once, for if you do it becomes more difficult to analyze the effects of each change on the dependent variable.

This is why experiments have to be designed very carefully. For example, performing the above tests on tap water may have different results from performing them on spring water, due to differences in salt content. Also, performing them on different days may cause variation due to pressure differences, or performing them with different brands of sugar may yield different results if different companies use different additives.

It is valid to test the effects of each of these things, if one desires, but if one does not have an infinite amount of money to experiment with all of the things that could go wrong (to see what happens if they do), a better alternative is to design the experiment to avoid potential pitfalls such as these.

=== Corollary to Isolation of Effects ===

A corollary to this warning is that when designing the experiment, you should choose a set of conditions that maximizes your power to analyze the effects of changes in variables. For example, if you wanted to measure the effects of temperature and of water volume, you should start with a ''basis'' (say, 20oC and 4 fluid ounces of water) which is easy to replicate, and then, keeping one of the variables constant, changing the other one. Then, do the opposite. You may end up with an experimental scheme like this one:

 Test number      Volume Water (fl. oz.)    Temperature (oC)
    1                  4                       20
    2                  2                       20
    3                  8                       20
    4                  4                       5
    5                  4                       50

Once the data is gathered, you would analyze tests number 1, 4, and 5 to get an idea of the effect of temperature, and tests number 1, 2, and 3 to get an idea of volume effects. You would '''not''' analyze all 5 data points at once.</text>

      <comment>calibration; accuracy vs precision</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

== Experimental Design ==

Perhaps the most important step in controlling experimental error is to design your experiments to produce as little systematic error as possible. In order to do this, it is important to know something about what you are measuring. As an example, suppose that you desired to measure the weight of the oxygen produced in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide: 

&lt;math&gt; H_2O_2(aq) \rightarrow H_2O(l) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) &lt;/math&gt;

You would need to ask yourself: How would you separate the oxygen from the water and unreacted hydrogen peroxide? How will you prevent the oxygen from leaking? Do you want to measure the weight directly, or by calculating it from other values (such as pressure)? 

Get into the habit of asking yourself, &quot;what could go wrong with this experiment?&quot; before you start the experiment. Then if you can, design it so that the things that could go wrong are as minor as possible, and then when performing it be as careful as possible to avoid what is left.

== Calibration and Accuracy ==

All measurement instruments need to be '''calibrated''' in some way in order to ensure that the values that are read are near the ''true'' value of the property being measured. Rulers all are compared to a standard when they are made so that when an inch is marked on the ruler, it is truly an inch.

Many instruments lose their calibration, and hence their accuracy, over time. Therefore it is necessary to ''recalibrate'' them. Instruments are generally re-calibrated by measurement of a ''standard'' or several, which have well-defined properties. For example, a scale might be calibrated by weighing a 5g weight and adjusting a dial until the reading is 5.000 g. Follow the instrument manual closely for calibration procedures, so that any bias in measurement due to measurement inaccuracy can be mitigated.

== Repeatability and Precision ==

Measurement instruments never will give you an exact answer. For example, if you are measuring the volume of a liquid in a graduated cylinder, it is necessary for you to estimate which of the hash marks on the instrument is the closest to the true volume (or to interpolate between them based on your eyesight). Most computerized measurement devices, such as many modern scales, take multiple measurements and average them to obtain accurate results, but these also have sensitivity limitations.

Manufacturers often report the ''precision'' of their instruments. The '''repeatability''' of an instrument is a measure of the precision, which is the similarity of successive measurements of an identical quantity to each other. Reproducibility is essentially the ability to, with all other conditions the same (or as close to the same as possible), achieve the same measurement value in an experiment. For example, you may measure the weight of an object with the same scale multiple times. If the reading is significantly different every time, it is possible that the instrument needs to be '''recalibrated''' or re-stabilized (for example, by cleaning out dust from the receiver, or making sure the setup is right). If it has been properly calibrated and set up and measurements still vary more than the precision claimed by the manufacturer, the instrument may be broken.

== Reproducibility ==

Another way to control errors in measurement from experiment to experiment is to constantly assess the '''reproducibility''' of the measurements. Reproducibility is measured essentially by performing the same measurement multiple times while varying one part of the experiment. For example, if you are measuring the pH of a buffer as part of a process, you may assess the reproducibility of the buffer preparation by preparing the same sample several times, independently of each other, and measuring the pH of each sample. If the variance in the pH measurements is larger than the measurement accuracy (or '''repeatability''') of the instrument, then it is likely that the preparation of the buffer is to blame for this error. Such tests can be performed on many parts of a larger process in order to pinpoint and remedy the largest control difficulties.

Another possible reproducibility test would be measuring the same sample with different pH meters. It is very important to test the compatibility of different measurement instruments before claiming that the results are comparable, and such reproducibility measurements are critical for determining the relationship between two instruments.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Beginnings - From the East to the West ==

The ancient teachings of the eastern world have always spoken about the attainment of oneness. This can be defined as a pinnacle of spiritual achievement that permanently unites the divine essence of the adept or bodhisattva (aspirant of Buddhahood or enlightenment), to the very source of all creation, the Absolute, Tao or God. In Buddhism, this process of enlightenment or true freedom (i.e. attainment of nirvana, samadhi etc.) can only be achieved through the Bodhicitta, literally meaning the ‘enlightenment of the mind’.

 “Empty your mind of all thoughts.
 Let your heart be at peace.
 …
 return to the common source.
 Returning to the source is serenity.” (excerpt from the Tao Te Ching, Chapter 16).

The mind is a central theme not just in Buddhism, but dates back to some of the earliest eastern texts of the Aryans, the Vedas. In the most infamous of these text, the Mahabharata (The Great War), Arjuna can be seen wrestling with the act of killing his kin in the 18-day war that is to unfold. At first he patiently listens to the sacred advice of Lord Krishna, but ultimately must dig deep within to understand the concept of dharmic duty. This is the essence of mindfulness, the process of turning our undivided attention and perception to the mysteries that lay within, and ultimately where we will find our answers.

In the Mahabharata, what unfolded with Arjuna was not explicitly called mindfulness. It is not until some of the early Buddhist text that we begin to see this word emerge, particularly in the ''Suttras''(Dryden &amp; Still, 2006). It was the Pali word (the language of the early Buddhist texts) ''sati'' that was translated into what we refer to as &quot;mindfulness&quot; today. There have been debates over the translation of the word ''sati'', some translations have included &quot;self-possession&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot;, or &quot;mind development&quot; (Dryden &amp; Still, 2006). To make matters more complicated ''sati'' is often found or linked with another Pail word, ''sampajanna''. &quot; Sampajanna is sometimes translated [as]‘‘awareness,’’ so sati-sampajanna becomes ‘‘mindfulness and awareness,’’as though awareness is not automatically included as part of mindfulness.&quot; (Dryden &amp; Still, 2006, p.19). One Buddhist monk, Nanavira Thera, distinguishes &quot;awareness&quot; and &quot;mindfulness&quot; in the following way: 

''&quot;Mindfulness is general recollectedness,not being scatter-brained; whereas awareness is more precisely keeping oneself under constant observation, not letting one’s actions (or thoughts, or feelings, etc) pass unnoticed.&quot;'' (Dryden &amp; Still, 2006, p. 19).

The origin of the word 'mindfulness', although not without debate, is not as obscure as the introduction to this and other eastern concepts into western thought. Eastern ideas of meditation and other forms of introspective spiritual work began to emerge in the west (mostly the United States) ''&quot;...during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s, largely influencing the American traditions of spiritualism, theosophy, and mental healing.&quot;'' (Taylor,2004,p.1). It really took root with the writings and works of Helena P. Blavatsky, co-founder of the International Theosophical Society. She began to translate Hindu texts into English making these eastern ideas more accessible to the readers in North America.

Furthermore, some who have used mindful concepts in their work acknolwdge no influence of Buddhist ideas on their work, where as others do (Still, 2005).

== Current Conceptualization == 

Mindfulness refers to a compassionate and non-judgmental moment-to-moment awareness of one’s experience. Mindfulness is different from but related to meditation. There are various forms of meditations generally divided in two broad categories: Receptive practices and concentrative practices (Goleman, 1976). Receptive meditation practice involve widening our perceptual field to become more aware of our experiences, including bodily sensations, feelings, thoughts, and our 5-sense perceptions. Concentrative meditation practices involve focusing the attention on an object (e,g., the breath or the flame of a candle) narrowing the field of attention, in order to attain states of rapture. In practice, mindfulness training involves formal meditation exercises including both concentrative (e.g., sitting mindfulness with focus on the breath) and receptive practices (e.g., being aware of any objects that manifests within the field of one’s awareness). Another important aspect of structured mindfulness training program the program is that participants are invited to integrate their mindfulness practice into their daily lives, so that they bring the same quality of attention to their work, personal care, and relationships. 

== Mindfulness-Based Therapy - Introduction ==

Discussion of the integration of mindfulness into psychotherapy can be found as early as the 1960s, with the well-known works Psychotherapy East and West (Watts, 1960) and Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism (Suzuki, Fromm &amp; DeMarino, 1960). Mindfulness is central to Hakomi (ref), Sensori-Motor Psychotherapy (ref), Core Process Psychotherapy (ref), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (ref), as well as Acceptance and commitment therapy (ref), to name a few. 

There are also programs that focus specifically on mindfulness practices, the most popular and well-researched intervention being Jon Kabat-Zinn's (1982; 1990) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR) Mindfulness-based therapies have gained tremendous popularity in the last three decades. 

The traditional MBSR program involves an 8 weekly 2-hour group sessions as well as a full day silent retreat. During the training, participants learn formal mindfulness exercises and are expected to set aside time for practice, 45 minutes a day, 6 days a week. The exercises are designed to help participants augment their awareness of moment-to-moment experience, including sensations, feelings, thoughts, while cultivating compassion and love. In addition to the mindfulness exercises, participants are invited by the group leader to reflect on deepening one’s mindfulness practice, so it transforms one’s way of life, can support choices that are healthier, life-enhancing choices, in particular when confronted with challenges. 

The initial impetus for the development of this program was Jon Kabat-Zinn's observation that many individuals with chronic health problems were not benefiting from allopathic medicine's interventions. Kabat-Zinn suggested to a group of doctors that they refer such individuals to the stress reduction program he created and he started gathering data to examine the effects of the intervention and found long-lasting effects (Kabat-Zinn 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, &amp; Sellers, 1987). 

The benefits of participation in MBSR has been demonstrated for a number of physical and mental health problems including cancer, chornic pain, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, and disordered eating (for review see Baer, 2003 and Grossman et al., 2004).

Two similar programs have been developed in recent years: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness-Based Wellness Education (MBWE). 

MBCT was designed for individuals with history of recurrent major depressive diosrder. Segal, Williams and Teasdale (2001) found that participation in MBCT prevented depressive relapse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Perspectives on Psychological Trauma ==

It has been said that whatever doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. A few people live through horrible events without experiencing much fear, but most of us react with feelings of horror and helplessness. Psychological trauma occurs in the wake of an unexpected event that is so unpleasant and shocking that the human mind and body react in an autonomic defensive manner (Thornet, 2000). For some people, surviving severe traumatic events leaves them depressed, anxious, and with other emotional scars such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

By definition, PTSD includes episodic re-experiencing of traumatic events, usually in the form of dysphoric memories.  Because these memories are vivid, frightening and unexpected, they have secondary effects, causing sufferers to doubt their sanity, their progress in recovery and their fundamental sense of security (Ochberg, 1998).  The original traumatic experience had elements of terror, horror, and/or helplessness, and persistent episodes of traumatic memory continue and compound such elements (Ochberg, 1998).  Recent findings have indicated PTSD prevalence rates of 5% and 10% respectively among American men and women (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hugues, &amp; Nelson, 1996).

The key to understanding the scientific basis and clinical expression of PTSD is the concept of “trauma” (Friedman, 1997).  PTSD is unique among other psychiatric diagnoses because of the great importance placed upon the etiological agent, the “traumatic stressor” (Herman, 1992).  Thus, traumatization is seen as being caused by the event, not because of some failing or weakness in the person.  In fact, one cannot make a clinical diagnosis of PTSD unless the client has actually met the “stressor criterion”.  Along with the diagnostic criteria of exposure to a “traumatic event” are symptoms from each of the three symptom clusters:  intrusive recollections, avoidant/numbing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms (APA, 1994). A fifth criterion concerns the duration of the symptoms (APA, 1994).  The duration criteria for diagnosis of PTSD when the above criteria have been met is one month (APA, 1994).  

Not only is PTSD typified by the automatic, involuntary symptoms such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and autonomic hyperarousal, but also consciously mediated attempts to make meaning of the trauma experience(s) (Clark &amp; Ehlers, 2000).  The automatic and involuntary symptoms are said to represent conditioned responding to environmental triggers associated with the trauma (Clark &amp; Ehlers, 2000).  Much less is known about the origins and consequences of victims’ efforts to understand their trauma(s) or about how best to treat the symptoms associated with personal beliefs about the trauma (Meichenbaum, 1994).

In children, an important issue in the experience of trauma is its effect on the attachment system and developing brain function.

== Earliest writings on trauma cases ==

Humankind has never been without traumatic events. The earliest writings of history contain evidence of the manifestation of psychological symptoms related to distressing experiences. Over time theories regarding the symptoms, causes, and treatment resulting from trauma have greatly varied. 

Initially, only women were believed to be inflicted by symptoms that had no physical explanation, such as sudden loss of sight, loss of ability to walk, or uncontrollable shaking. The earliest indication of these symptoms was recorded on an Egyptian papyrus from 1900 BC, which attributed the disorder to a wandering uterus. The use of the term, hysteria, to describe this constellation of symptoms dates back to Hippocrates (430-367 B.C.) who labeled the condition for its Greek meaning of uterus. Since this condition was only documented in women, his prescribed cure for the afflictions caused by a wandering uterus was marriage. Of note, trauma is a term widely used in psychology and its meaning is derived from the Greek word for wound. The term emerged into the neurological and psychiatric vocabulary in the 1860’s and 1870’s. Previously, the term trauma had been reserved for the description of physical wounds and had been documented in the surgical medicine literature. 

Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) was the first to explain hysteria in a physiological way.  He believed that hysteria was a direct result of a disturbed distribution of the magnetic fluid present in all humans. He appears to have been the first to document the possibility that hysterical symptoms could be present in men and women. Mesmer’s treatment for hysteria involved touching his patients with rods, which he said transmitted a magnetic force called animal magnetism from his body to the patient. He believed that this force of animal magnetism was capable of rearranging the patient’s fluids to result in healthy functioning, and thereby curing the condition of hysteria. With our knowledge today, it is widely believed that Mesmer’s approach was a predecessor of hypnotism due to his convincing manner of describing his techniques to his patients and his strong suggestions of recovery. Although Mesmer’s techniques resulted in improvement and documented cures of many of his patients, his theories and techniques were not respected by other health professionals at the time. 

With the development of the railroad in the mid 1800’s, there was also an increase in accidents and death with this initially dangerous mode of transportation. Lerner (2003) found statistics of injuries related to the railway in the United States in 1889: one out of every 117 train workers was killed and one out of every 12 workers was injured. In addition, passengers and bystanders were involved in train collisions and derailings, which in that time were common. Some accident victims seemed to complain of common symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, paralysis, and general disinterest and listlessness with no apparent physical cause. In 1866, an English physician, John Eric Erichsen (1818-1896) published several cases of this condition and coined the term “railway spine”. In addition to the abovementioned symptoms, he wrote about memory loss, confusion, diminished business aptitude, ill temper, sleep disorders, sensory impairment, attitude changes, loss of motor power, numbness and sexual impotence. Although these symptoms paralleled those of hysteria, Erichsen chose the new label of railway spine since it was previously believed that only women were inflicted with hysteria and most of his patients related to the railroad were men. 

With increasing numbers of mental health diagnoses related to trauma, treatment for these symptoms was in high demand. Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) was a neurologist who believed that hypnotism was of value in treating hysterics. Originally, his theories on hysteria were somatic in nature. Over time, he adjusted his original theories to include psychological factors. Additionally, in 1882, he began treating cases of hysteria in male patients, which he reported were growing in large numbers. He described symptoms in these males as motor and sensory disturbances due to railroad accidents, workplace accidents, and service in war. He believed that these symptoms were directly related to a traumatic stimulus in those individuals who had an inherited, constitutional disposition.

As stated earlier, symptoms of hysteria were not initially believed to be inflictions of men. However, with men fighting in the frontlines of World War I where they took the lives of the opposition, witnessed violent deaths of their fellow soldiers, and often narrowly escaped death themselves, it is not surprising that many soldiers began demonstrating symptoms of what was then know as hysteria. Soldiers were documented as suffering from symptoms such as debilitating shakes, stutters, tics and tremors, disorders of sight, hearing, and gait (Lerner, 2003). Although there is evidence of other problems during other wars, the sheer number of soldiers with these inflictions caught medical authorities unprepared and therefore drew much attention. Since it was thought unfitting to diagnose these men with a woman’s illness, new labels were created to describe these combinations of symptoms as listed earlier. Many features of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder were well-described in literary form during this time, such The Red Badge of Courage.  However, it wasn’t until World War II that there was a creation of a formal diagnostic category.  World War II had brought together soldiers, psychiatrists and other medical personnel, and they discovered that they did not always have a common vocabulary to discuss syndromes and diagnoses.  

After World War II ended, the Veterans Administration (VA) developed a diagnostic manual.  This provided incentive for the American Psychological Association (APA) to create its own first manual.  Thirteen years after his Freud’s death, the American Psychological Association (APA) published its first diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM-1) in 1952 and re-wrote his conceptualization of traumatic neurosis for Gross Stress Reaction.  During the post-war era and after there was a rise in systematic investigations of things such as the consequences of exposure to death camps and experiences of prisoners of war, as well as nonmilitary stressors such as mass catastrophes, such as fires, earthquakes and plane crashes (Adler, 1943; Andreasen, Hartford &amp; Norris, 1971). 
 
For reasons unknown, but perhaps because of the early links between military combat and stress disorders, Gross Stress Reaction was somehow dropped from DSM-II (Andreasen, 2004).  That manual was written when the United States was not engaged in any major war.  However, the scientific study of the consequences of stress continued, particularly in the area of consequences of severe burn injuries (Andreasen, 2004).

After the Vietnam War, the U.S. contained another wave of young men who had been traumatized in combat.  There was no official diagnosis to give them, and therefore, no coverage for treatment.  American veterans lobbied the APA to construct a diagnosis of “Post-Vietnam Syndrom” to recognize the long-term psychological damage incurred by soldiers in combat, in order to pave the way for therapeutic services.  Recognizing the long history of the syndrome proposed, as well as the fact that it frequently occurred in traumatized civilians as well, and being rooted in the extensive literature on stress disorders already available at the time, the APA came up with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as an operational diagnosis in DSM-III.  Criteria specified for the new diagnosis included an initial stressor that would evoke distress in almost anyone (Criterion A), a time frame, and a list of “symptoms”.  

The diagnosis began to be used widely and its application broadened steadily.  For example, it began to be used for victims of childhood sexual abuse who developed traumatic stress symptoms much later in life.  The requirement that the stressor be outside the range of normal human experience was sometimes reinterpreted to include less severe stressors (Andreasen, 2004).  In 1987, the criteria for PTSD was reworked in the DSM-III-R.  The veteran issues again faded in importance, while feminist practitioners took a special interest in PTSD.

Feminist therapists began lobbying the APA to alter the definition of PTSD so that more of their clients would fall under its auspices (Burstow, 2005).  In 1994, PTSD was revised in DSM-IV such that Criterion A now stated that the person had to either experience, witness or be confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.  The person’s response must have involved intense fear, helplessness or horror and caused clinically significant distress and impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.  This incorporated the concept of “vicarious traumatization” (i.e. emergency services, rescue workers, etc.).  The DSM-IV also added back what was formerly called Acute PTSD, which had been dropped from DSM-III-R, under a new name of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD).  In 2000, the DSM-IV-TR PTSD reformulated such that it is not required that the traumatizing event be outside the range of normal experience and explicitly makes room for common events such as childhood sexual abuse.
Currently, trauma is of particular interest, at a time when the entire world is aware of the potential for terrorism to strike – a stressor of great magnitude that could strike at any time and anywhere.  This is also a time when the U.S. is seeing the return of many traumatized young soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, the present state of our world is likely going to provide many more opportunities to study stress reactions, and the diagnoses of ASD and PTSD are likely here to stay.

:2. Symptom-referenced PTSD measures
::*PTSD Symptom Scale
::*PTSD Checklist
:3. PTSD diagnostic measures based on standard interview formats

=== Eye-movement disensitization reprocessing ===

=== Exposure Therapy ===

Keane and his colleagues first applied Exposure Therapy (ET) to the treatment of PTSD in the form of single-subject designed studies to document the effects of exposure to memories of traumatic events (Black &amp; Keane, 1982; Fairbank &amp; Keane, 1982; Kaloupek &amp; Keane, 1982).  Significant reductions in trauma symptoms, anxiety, and other related symptoms were found as a function of ET interventions.  This preliminary work led to the development of randomized clinical trials that compared Imaginal Based ET to the less intensive treatment of Anxiety Management Therapy (AMT) and wait-list controls.  The results of this study were clear.  Compared to the wait-list condition and AMT, those clients receiving ET showed significant reductions on standard psychometric instruments and on clinician ratings of symptoms, and changes were maintained at a 6-month follow-up (Caddell, Fairbank, Keane &amp; Zimmering, 1989).

More recently, many studies have appeared in the literature comparing the effectiveness of ET to Cognitive Therapy (CT).  For example, Barrowclough, Faragher, Graham, Pilgrim, Reynolds, Sommerfield &amp; Tarrier (1999) examined the effectiveness of ET and CT in the treatment of outpatients with PTSD stemming from many different traumatic events.  Both groups manifested significant improvements that were maintained at a 6-month follow-up.  No significant differences were found between the two treatments and outcomes were favorable for both groups.  Similar results have also been found by other authors, such as Astin, Nishith, and Resick (2000) who reported on the comparison of ET and CT in the treatment of rape-related PTSD.  In general, the two treatments have been found to be equally effective and more effective than wait-list control groups.

=== Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ===

Cognitive Therapy (CT) involves addressing key cognitive distortions found among people who have been traumatized.  In particular, the interventions are designed to address difficulties in safety, trust, power, self-esteem, and intimacy in the lives of survivors.  Combination treatments that include an array of cognitive-behavioral strategies have had intuitive clinical appeal because they address multiple problems that people with PTSD may exhibit, as well as incorporating techniques that have empirical support in the literature.  For example, Fecteau and Nicki (1999) examined a treatment package of 8-10 sessions including trauma education, ET, cognitive restructuring and guided behavioral practice and compared outcomes to wait-list controls.  The results of the intervention were successful as measured by clinical ratings, self-report questionnaires, and a laboratory-based psychophysiological assessment procedure.  The results were clinically, as well as statistically, significant and the treatment effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up.


=== Emotion-Focussed Therapy ===

Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) has also shown itself to be effective in helping clients deal with the sequelae of trauma.  For example, Greenberg and Paivio (1995) reported clinically meaningful, stable gains for most clients treated with process-experiential therapy (a type of EFT), and that these gains were significantly greater improvements as compared to a psychoeducational group.  In addition, Nieuwenhuis and Paivio (2001) investigated a 20-session EFT applied to adults with PTSD symptoms as a result of unresolved childhood abuse issues.  Clients in the treatment group were compared to a wait-list control group.  EFT clients showed significantly greater improvements than wait-list controls on measures of general anxiety and PTSD symptoms, global interpersonal problems, self-affiliation, and resolution of issues with abusive others.  Several other studies have also shown EFT to be effective in treating PTSD symptoms (Soulier, 1995; Clarke, 1993; Davis, Elliott &amp; Slatick, 1998).  These studies are more than adequate to support the conclusion that EFT is an efficacious and specific treatment for people suffering the effects of trauma (Elliott et al., 2003).  I would argue that EFT works well with clients dealing with PTSD symptoms because often such clients have not been able to develop the skills necessary to process their emotions due to past trauma and/or early attachment experiences.  EFT can help increase clients’ emotional intelligence and improve their emotional processing skills so they can better regulate their emotions (Watson, 2006). Clients move towards healing and wholeness in their lives as they learn to become aware of, label, express and reflect upon their emotions so that they may move more productively towards fulfillment of their needs, values and goals (Watson, 2006).

* '''Pierre Janet''' published L'Automatisme Psychologique, which was his first work to deal with how the mind processes traumatic experiences. &quot;Janet claimed that vehement emotions interfere with proper appraisal and appropriate action. Failure to confront the experience fully leads to dissociation of the traumatic memories and their return as fragmentary reliving experiences, feeling states, somatic sensations, visual images, and behavioral reenactments. A century later, Janet still provides an unsurpassed framework for integrating current knowledge about the psychodynamic, cognitive, and biological effects of human traumatization&quot; (Brown, van der Hart &amp; van der Kolk, 1989).

* '''Edna B. Foa''' has been described as one of the leading experts in post-traumatic stress disorder research. Among her many publications, are the popular books ''Posttraumatic stress disorder: DSM-IV and beyond'' (American Psychiatric Press, Inc: 1992) and ''Treating the Trauma of Rape'' (Guilford Publications, Inc.: 1997)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The concept of atom balances ==

Let's begin this section by looking at the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water:

&lt;math&gt; H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

We may attempt to do our calculations with this reaction, but there is something seriously wrong with this equation! It is not ''balanced''; as written, it implies that an atom of oxygen is somehow &quot;lost&quot; in the reaction, but this is in general impossible. Therefore, we must compensate by writing:

&lt;math&gt; H_2 + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \rightarrow H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

or some multiple thereof.

Notice that in doing this we have made use of the following conservation law, which is actually the basis of the conservation of mass:

{{box|'''The number of atoms of any given element does not change in any reaction''' (assuming that it is not a nuclear reaction).}}

Since by definition the number of moles of an element is proportional to the number of atoms, this implies that &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A,gen} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; where A represents any ''element'' in atomic form.

== Mathematical formulation of the atom balance ==

Now recall the general balance equation:

&lt;math&gt; In - Out + Generation = Accumulation &lt;/math&gt;

In this course we're assuming &lt;math&gt; Accumulation = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Since the ''moles of atoms'' of any element are conserved, &lt;math&gt; generation = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. So we have the following balance on a given element A:

{{box|For a given element A,

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \dot{n}_{A,in} - \Sigma \dot{n}_{A,out} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{NOTE|When analyzing a reacting system you must choose ''either'' an atom balance ''or'' a molecular species balance but '''not both'''. Each has advantages; an atom balance often yields simpler algebra (especially for multiple reactions; the actual reaction that takes place is irrelevant!) but also will not directly tell you the extent(s) of reaction, and will not tell you if the system specifications are actually impossible to achieve for a given set of equilibrium reactions.}}

== Degree of Freedom Analysis for the atom balance ==

As before, to do a degree of freedom analysis, it is necessary to count the number of unknowns and the number of equations one can write, and then subtract them. However, there are a couple of important things to be aware of with these balances.
* '''When doing atom balances, the extent of reaction does not count as an unknown, while with a molecular species balance it does'''. This is the primary advantage of this method: the extent of reaction does not matter since atoms of elements are conserved regardless of how far the reaction has proceeded.
* You need to make sure each atom balance will be '''independent'''. This is difficult to tell unless you write out the equations and look to see if any two are identical.
* In reactions with '''inert species''', each molecular balance on the inert species counts as an ''additional equation''. This is because of the following important note:

{{NOTE|When you're doing an atom balance you should '''only include reactive species, not inerts'''.}}

{{example|Suppose a mixture of nitrous oxide (&lt;math&gt; N_2O &lt;/math&gt;) and oxygen is used in a natural gas burner. The reaction &lt;math&gt; CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O + CO_2 &lt;/math&gt; occurs in it.

There would be ''four'' equations that you could write: 3 atom balances (C, H, and O) and a molecular balance on nitrous oxide. You would ''not'' include the moles of nitrous oxide in the atom balance on oxygen.}}

== Example of the use of the atom balance ==

Let's re-examine a problem from the previous section. In that section it was solved using a molecular species balance, while here it will be solved using atom balances.

{{example|Consider the reaction of Phosphene with oxygen: &lt;math&gt; 4PH_3+8O_2 \rightarrow P_4O_{10} + 6H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose a 100-kg mixture of 50% &lt;math&gt; PH_3 &lt;/math&gt; and 50% &lt;math&gt; O_2 &lt;/math&gt; by mass enters a reactor in a single stream, and the single exit stream contains 25% &lt;math&gt; O_2 &lt;/math&gt; by mass. Assume that all the reduction in oxygen occurs due to the reaction. How many degrees of freedom does this problem have? If possible, determine mass composition of all the products.}}

For purposes of examination, the flowchart is re-displayed here:

[[Image:Phosphate Rxn Flowchart.PNG]]


=== Degree of Freedom Analysis ===

There are three elements involved in the system (P, H, and O) so we can write three atom balances on the system.

There are likewise '''three''' unknowns (since the extent of reaction is NOT an unknown when using the atom balance): the outlet concentrations of &lt;math&gt; PH_3, P_4O_{10}, H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there are 3 - 3 = 0 unknowns.

=== Problem Solution ===

Let's start the same as we did in the previous section: by finding converting the given information into moles. The calculations of the previous section are repeated here:

*&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_{out} = \dot{m}_{in} = 100 \mbox{ kg} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{PH_3,in}= 0.5*(100\mbox{ kg})* \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.034 \mbox{ kg}} = 1470.6 \mbox{ moles PH}_3 \mbox{ in} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{O_2,in} = 0.5*(100\mbox{ kg})* \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.032 \mbox{ kg}} = 1562.5 \mbox{ moles O}_2 \mbox{ in} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{O_2,out} = 0.25*(100\mbox{ kg})* \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.032 \mbox{ kg}} = 781.25 \mbox{ moles O}_2 \mbox{ out} &lt;/math&gt;

Now we start to ''diverge'' from the path of molecular balances and instead write atom balances on each of the elements in the reaction. Let's start with Phosphorus. How many moles of Phosphorus ''atoms'' are entering?

* Inlet: Only &lt;math&gt; PH_3 &lt;/math&gt; provides P, so the inlet moles of P are just &lt;math&gt; 1*1470.6 = 1470.6 \mbox{ moles P in} &lt;/math&gt;
* Outlet: There are ''two'' ways phosphorus leaves: as unused &lt;math&gt; PH_3 &lt;/math&gt; or as the product &lt;math&gt; P_4O_{10} &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the moles of &lt;math&gt; PH_3 &lt;/math&gt; out are &lt;math&gt; 1*n_{PH_3,out} + 4*n_{P_4O_{10},out} &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the 4 in this equation comes from the fact that there are 4 Phosphorus atoms in every mole of &lt;math&gt; P_4O_{10} &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore the atom balance on Phosphorus becomes:

{{box|'''Phosphorus'''

&lt;math&gt; 1*n_{PH_3,out} + 4*n_{P_4O_{10},out} = 1470.6 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Similarly, on Oxygen we have:

*Inlet: &lt;math&gt; 2*n_{O_2,in} = 2*1562.5 = 3125\mbox{ moles O}_2&lt;/math&gt;
*Outlet: &lt;math&gt; 2*n_{O_2,out} + 10*n_{P_4O_{10},out} + 1*n_{H_2O,out} = 1562.5 + 10*n_{P_4O_{10},out} + 1*n_{H_2O,out} &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|'''Oxygen'''

&lt;math&gt; 1562.5 + 10*n_{P_4O_{10},out} + 1*n_{H_2O,out}= 3125 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Finally, check to see if you can get the following Hydrogen balance as a practice problem:

{{box|'''Hydrogen'''

&lt;math&gt; 2*n_{H_2O,out} + 3*n_{PH_3,out} = 4411.8 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Solving these three linear equations, the solutions are:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; n_{PH_3,out}=1080 , n_{O_2,out}=586, n_{P_4O_{10},out} = 97.66 &lt;/math&gt; moles}}

All of these answers are identical to those obtained using extents of reaction. Since the remainder of the solution to that problem is identical to that in the previous section, the reader is referred there for its completion.

== Example of balances with inert species ==

Sometimes it's more difficult to choose which type of balance you want, because both are possible but one is significantly easier than the other. As an example, lets consider a basic pollution control system.

{{example|Suppose that you are running a power plant and your burner releases a lot of pollutants into the air. The flue gas has been analyzed to contain 5% &lt;math&gt; SO_2 &lt;/math&gt;, 3% &lt;math&gt; NO_2 &lt;/math&gt;, 7% &lt;math&gt; O_2 &lt;/math&gt; and 15% &lt;math&gt; CO_2 &lt;/math&gt; by moles. The remainder was determined to be inert.

Local regulations require that the emissions of sulfur dioxide be less than 200 ppm (by moles) from your plant. They also require you to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions to less than 50 ppm. You decide that the most economical method for control of these for your plant is to utilize ammonia-based processes. The proposed system is as follows:

# Put the flue gas through a ''denitrification'' system, into which (pure) ammonia is pumped. The amount of ammonia pumped in is three times as much as would theoretically be needed to use all of the nitrogen dioxide in the flue gas.
# Allow it to react a specified amount of time.
# Pump it into a ''desulfurization'' system. Nothing new is injected here, it just has a different catalyst than the denitrification, and the substrates are at a different temperature and pressure.

The reactions that occur are:

# &lt;math&gt; 2NO_2 + 4NH_3 + O_2 \rightarrow 3 N_2 + 6H_2O &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; H_2O + 2NH_3 + SO_2 \rightarrow (NH_4)_2SO_3 &lt;/math&gt;

If your plant makes &lt;math&gt; 130\frac{ft^3}{s} &lt;/math&gt; of flue gas at &lt;math&gt; T = 900K &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P = 2\mbox{ atm} &lt;/math&gt;, how must ammonia do you need to purchase for each 8-hour shift? How much of it remains unused? Why do we want to have a significant amount of excess ammonia?

Assume that the flue gas is an ideal gas. Recall the ideal gas law, &lt;math&gt; PV = nRT &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; R = 0.0821 \frac{L*atm}{mol*K} &lt;/math&gt;.}}

=== Step 1: Flowchart ===

Flowcharts are becoming especially important now as means of organizing all of that information!

[[Image:Air Pollution Example.PNG]]

=== Step 2: Degrees of Freedom ===

Let's consider an atomic balance on each reactor.

* Denitrification system: 9 unknowns (all concentrations in stream 3, and &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_2 &lt;/math&gt;.) - 3 atom balances (N, H, and O) - 3 inert species (&lt;math&gt; CO_2, SO_2, inerts &lt;/math&gt;) - 1 additional info (3X stoichiometric feed) = '''2 DOF'''
* Desulfurization system: 15 unknowns - 4 atom balances (N, H, O, and S) - 5 inerts (&lt;math&gt; CO_2, O_2, NO_2, N_2, inerts &lt;/math&gt;) = '''6 DOF'''
* Total = 2 + 6 - 8 shared = '''0 DOF''', hence the problem has a unique solution.

We can also perform the same type of analysis on molecular balances.

* Denitrification system: 10 unknowns (now the conversion &lt;math&gt; X_1 &lt;/math&gt; is also unknown) - 8 molecular species balances - 1 additional info = '''1 DOF'''
* Desulfurization system: 16 unknowns (now the conversion &lt;math&gt; X_2 &lt;/math&gt; is unknown) - 9 balances = '''7 DOF'''.
* Total = 1 + 7 - 8 shared = '''0 DOF'''.

Therefore the problem is theoretically solvable by both methods.

=== Step 3: Units ===

The only weird units in this problem (everything is given in moles already so no need to convert) are in the volumetric flowrate, which is given in &lt;math&gt; \frac{ft^3}{s} &lt;/math&gt;. Lets convert this to &lt;math&gt; \frac{moles}{s} &lt;/math&gt; using the ideal gas law. To use the law with the given value of R is is necessary to change the flowrate to units of &lt;math&gt; \frac{L}{s} &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; 130 \frac{ft^3}{s} * \frac{28.317\mbox{ L}}{ft^3} = 3681.2\frac{L}{s} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; P\dot{V} = \dot{n}RT \rightarrow 2*3681.2 = \dot{n}_1(0.0821)(900) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_1 = 99.64\frac{moles}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

Now that everything is in good units we can move on to the next step.

=== Step 4: Devise a plan ===

We can first determine the value of &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_2 &lt;/math&gt; using the additional information. Then, we should look to an ''overall system balance''.

Since none of the individual reactors is completely solvable by itself, it is necessary to look to combinations of processes to solve the problem. '''The best way to do an overall system balance with multiple reactions is to treat the entire system as if it was a single reactor in which multiple reactions were occurring'''. In this case, the flowchart will be revised to look like this:

[[Image:Air Pollution Example Overall System.PNG]]

Before we try solving anything, we should check to make sure that we still have no degrees of freedom.

'''Atom Balance'''

There are 8 unknowns (don't count conversions when doing atom balances), 4 types of atoms (H, N, O, and S), 2 species that never react, and 1 additional piece of information (3X stoichiometric), so there is '''1 DOF'''. This is obviously a problem, which occurs because '''when performing atom balances you cannot distinguish between species that react in only ONE reaction and those that take part in more than one'''.

In this case, then, it is necessary to look to molecular-species balances.

'''Molecular-species balance'''

In this case, there are 10 unknowns, but we can do molecular species balances on 9 species &lt;math&gt; (SO_2, NO_2, NH_3, N_2, O_2, CO_2, H_2O, (NH_4)_2SO_3, inerts)&lt;/math&gt; and have the additional information, so there are '''0 DOF''' when using this method.

Once we have all this information, getting the information about stream 3 is trivial from the definition of extent of reaction.

=== Step 5: Carry Out the Plan ===

First off we can determine &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_2 &lt;/math&gt; by using the definition of a stoichiometric feed.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{NO_2,in} = 0.03*99.64 = 2.9892 \frac{mol}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

The stoichiometric amount of ammonia needed to react with this is, from the reaction,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{4 \mbox{ moles NH}_3}{2 \mbox{ moles NO}_2} * 2.9892 = 5.96 \frac{ moles \mbox{ NH}_3}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the problem states that three times this amount is injected into the denitrification system, we have:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_2 = 17.88 \frac{moles}{s} &lt;/math&gt; }}

Now, we are going to have a very complex system of equations with the 9 molecular balances. This may be a good time to invest in some equation-solving software.

See if you can derive the following system of equations from the overall-system flowchart above.

{{box|&lt;math&gt; NH_3: \dot{n}_4*x_{NH_3,4} = 17.88 - 4*X_1 - 2*X_2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; SO_2: \dot{n}_4*2*10^{-4} = 0.05 * 99.64 - X_2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; NO_2: \dot{n}_4*5*10^{-5} = 0.03*99.64 - 2*X_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; N_2: \dot{n}_4*x_{N_2,4} = 3*X_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; O_2: \dot{n}_4*x_{O_2,4} = 0.07*99.64 - X_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; H_2O: \dot{n}_4*x_{H_2O,4} = 6*X_1 - X_2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; CO_2: \dot{n}_4*x_{CO_2,4} = 0.15*99.64 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; (NH_4)_2(SO_3): \dot{n}_4*x_{(NH_4)_2SO_3,4} = X_2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; Inerts: \dot{n}_4*(1 - 2*10^{-4} - 5*10^{-5} - x_{NH_3,4} - x_{N_2,4} - x_{O_2,4} - x_{H_2O,4} -  x_{CO_2,4} - x_{(NH_4)_2SO_3,4} )  = 0.7*99.64 &lt;/math&gt; }}

Using an equation-solving package, the following results were obtained:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; X_1 = 1.492\mbox{ moles} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; X_2 = 4.961\mbox{ moles} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_3 = 105.62 \frac{mol}{s} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_{NH_3, 4} = 0.01884 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_{N_2,4} = 0.04238 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; x_{O_2,4} = 0.05191 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_{H_2O,4} = 0.03778 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_{CO_2,4} = 0.1415 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_{(NH_4)_2SO_3,4} = 0.04697 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_{I} = 1 - \Sigma \mbox{ (other components) } = 0.6606 &lt;/math&gt;
}}

==== Stream 3 ====

Now that we have completely specified the composition of stream 4, it is possible to go back and find the compositions of stream 3 using the extents of reaction and feed composition. Although this is not necessary to answer the problem statement, it should be done, so that we can then test to make sure that all of the numbers we have obtained are consistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who wrote this? It's horrible. It doesn't even read like it came from a book. It sounds more like someone read the titles of a book on character creation and tried to paraphrase. Someone PLEASE fix this mess.

:Yes it was horrible - hopefully the new version is better, although it needs major expansion. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

I didn't actually transwiki the material. It belonged at Wikisource to begin and was already there since all that was here was a source text. We do not host source texts here, only [[WB:AT|annotated ones]], so if you plan on merely moving source text information over to Wikibooks from somewhere without annotations please do not continue. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:58, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

:You can certainly ''use'' content from Wikisource, you just have to annotate the texts you use. This includes critical commentary and analysis. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:03, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

::No problem. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:27, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

Regarding the Tragedies, what exactly are you referring to? I see [[William Shakespeare's Works/Tragedies|this page]] and I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;unlock&quot;. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:27, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:Ah. Those page protections are there for safety purposes. Text was once there but failed to provide content appropriate for Wikibooks and so an external redirect was added. I would suggest that you work on the pages in your own namespace first, such as [[User:ABurke/Hamlet]] where you have free reign. Once you have appropriate and well-developed content ready, contact an admin such as myself and we will remove the protection so that you can move your pages. This is being done to avoid the previous situations from occurring again and again. We need annotated texts, not just text dumps. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:40, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:Furthermore, I hope you see this as a somewhat inconvenient yet important protection here. We don't want to discourage by any means. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:41, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:Sounds good. Don't be afraid to put the source text here as well. A common and useful approach is to have a large passage at the top of a page and then analyze it and such below. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:46, 17 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

| common_name = Texas Alligator Lizard
| latin_name = ''Gerrhonotus infernalis''
| image = Gerrhonotus_infernalis.jpg
| image_caption = Texas Alligator Lizard, ''Gerrhonotus infernalis''
| range = The Texas Alligator Lizard is found in the central region of Texas, and south into Mexico.
| description = The Texas alligator lizard is a medium sized lizard, attaining a maximum length of approximately 20 inches. They have a flat, wedge-shaped head. They are generally a yellow-brown color, often with darker brown and white checker patterning on the dorsal surface, and uniformly light colored, white or grey on the ventral surface. Their scales are very stiff and plate-like. They have short limbs, and a tail that can fall off to distract a potential predator, which will regrow in time.
| behavior = Texas alligator lizards are relatively slow moving, diurnal lizards, with good vision. They are often found in on rocky hillsides, where they hide amongst the stones or in limestone crevices. Their primary diet is insects and other invertebrates. Not generally aggressive, but they may bite if handled.
| reproduction = Breeding occurs year round, sometimes multiple clutches of eggs are laid per year. Females will often stay near the nesting site to protect it, but there is no parental care once the young alligator lizards hatch. The young are generally have more striking markings, and are only about 3-4 inches in length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:The Mercant of Venice|The Merchant of Venice]] is a comedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], written at some point between 1596 and 1598.  The plot of this play centers on the consequences of a merchant's failure to repay his debt to a skeevy moneylender.  There is a subplot about the merchants young heir and his search for his one true love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:The Merry Wives of Windsor|The Merry Wives of Windsor]] is a comedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]].  The date of publication is unknown to this day.  Though registered for publication in 1602, it is believed to have been several years old by that point, possibly as early as 1597.  The play tells of the romantic mishaps of Falstaff, making his second appearance in a Shakespearean play, and the two ladies that he is courting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles, Prince of Tyre]] is a comedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]].  The year it was written is up for debate.  Some scholars believe that it was written around 1607, while others claim that it was written earlier, and revised in 1607.  The play retells the ancient Grecian myth of the titular character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;includeonly&gt;==1961&amp;ndash;1962==&lt;/includeonly&gt;
Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1961 to 1962''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2006. ISBN 1560976721)

*p. 1 (January 1, 1961). In [[w:Ten-pin bowling|ten pin bowling]], the bowler gets two tries to knock down ten pins; if he/she gets the remainder of pins on the second roll, it is called a “spare”. Lucy is “picking up the spare” by knocking down Charlie Brown, the last boy standing.

*p. 2 (January 2, 1961). This strip begins what would be the longest continued narrative in ''Peanuts'' up to that time: three weeks.

*p. 3 (January 6, 1961). The end of this strip and the following three dailies are sly references to drug withdrawal, specifically [[w:heroin|heroin]]&amp;mdash;an amusingly mature theme for the comics pages, especially at a time where comics were expected to have nothing to do with political and social issues, although not surprising for ''Peanuts'', as it would explicitly tackle those kinds of issues later on, such as the Vietnam War and tear gas at campaign protests of the early 70's and late 60's, runaway licensing, and once in 1985, even triple bypass surgery.

*p. 4 (January 11, 1961). Hyannis Port (sometimes written “Hyannisport”) is an affluent residential village southwest of [[w:Hyannis, Massachussetts|Hyannis]]. It is best known as the ancestral home of the [[w:Kennedy family|Kennedy family]], including then&amp;ndash;President-elect [[w:John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], who would be inaugurated nine days later, on January 20.

*p. 10 (January 22, 1961). A reference to the biblical story of [[w:David and Goliath|David and Goliath]]. The diminutive Israeli shepherd [[w:David|David]] slew the giant Philistine warrior [[w:Goliath|Goliath]] with a rock hurled from a sling, as Linus does here with a snowball from his blanket.

*p. 11 ([http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1961/01/24 January 24, 1961]). [[w:Historical Criticism|Higher Criticism]], which in the context of this strip is synonymous to [[w:Source Criticism|Source Criticism]], is a Bible study method that is based on pulling apart the traditional text into component pieces. Richard Elliot Friedman, a modern-day practitioner of Higher Criticism, has published [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_with_Sources_Revealed a book that reprints the Bible with each source distinguished by typeface and formatting].

*p. 12 (January 28, 1961). The second appearance of Lucy’s psychiatric booth (the first was on [[Annotations of The Complete Peanuts/1959 to 1960#p37|March 27, 1959]]), and the first time it is drawn with its familiar canopy. Also note the redundant “5¢” sign at the bottom; this would later be replaced.

*p. 14 (January 30, 1961). Linus is tabulating the combined gifts from the song “[[w:The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]”. The song has twelve verses, each listing the gifts given by “my true love”; the gifts cumulate with each day/verse. Linus’s math is correct; however, the song is more commonly sung to refer to “drummers drumming” rather than “fiddlers fiddling”.

*p. 17 (February 8, 1961). [[w:Pasteurization|Pasteurization]] is the process of heating liquids for the purpose of destroying viruses and harmful organisms, named for its inventor, chemist [[w:Louis Pasteur|Louis Pasteur]] (1822&amp;ndash;1895). It is most commonly used on milk, hence Lucy’s pun here. Puns of this sort would later be almost completely delegated to Snoopy once he began typing.

*p. 18 (February 11, 1961). Speculating on the effects of television on American culture, which Snoopy parodies here, was a common theme in the early days of the Kennedy administration. It would culminate three months later with [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] chairman [[w:Newton N. Minow|Newton N. Minow]]’s “[[w:Wasteland Speech|Television and the Public Interest]]” speech, where he famously argued that television was often a “vast wasteland” with detrimental effects on the viewing public.

*{{anchor|d19610216}}p. 21 (February 16, 1961). For the rest of 1961, Linus and (less often) the other characters will sometimes be wearing [[w:American Civil War|American Civil War]]&amp;ndash;style hats, due to its centennial (specifically referred to on July 8 and November 23, 1961).

*p. 21 (February 16, 1961).  First instance of a note in Linus' lunch.

*p. 29 (March 6, 1961). The first appearance of Frieda. Like Charlie Brown and Linus, she was named after one of Schulz’s fellow instructors at the Art Instruction School in Minneapolis&lt;ref name=&quot;jubilee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulz|first=Charles M.|title=Peanuts Jubilee: My Life and Art with Charlie Brown and Others|year=1975|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|id=ISBN 0030150817}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*p. 34 (March 19, 1961). A [[w:flannelgraph|flannelgraph]] is a method of telling stories, used in real life as Lucy does here. It is generally associated with American evangelical Sunday school lessons, as a means of telling Bible stories to young children. Schulz was undoubtedly aware of the practice from his own experiences teaching Sunday school. Christian writer John Fischer said, “[t]hough it has largely disappeared from the scene, flannelgraph may very well be the closest thing to a strictly evangelical art form, for I never encountered it anywhere but in Christian endeavors, and I haven’t seen it anywhere else since. It was an evangelical quirk of the 1950s that soon went the way of sword drills and the family altar”&lt;ref name=&quot;fischer&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=2007-09-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*p. 36 (March 23, 1961).  In 1961, a television small enough to be portable was still a relative novelty.

*p. 47 (April 17, 1961). [[w:National Library Week|National Library Week]] was started in 1958 amid concerns that television was reducing reading by children&lt;ref name=&quot;ala&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=National Library Week Fact Sheet
|accessdate=2007-05-18

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*p. 48 (April 21, 1961). [[w:Dr. Seuss|Theodor “Dr. Seuss” Geisel]] (1904&amp;ndash;1991) was a popular American children’s book author, best known for his 1957 book ''The Cat in the Hat''.

*p. 54 (May 4, 1961). Lucy’s psychiatrist booth takes on its final appearance with the addition of the “The doctor is in” sign.

*p. 60 (May 19, 1961). The H-Bomb is the common form of referring to [[w:hydrogen bomb|hydrogen bomb]]s.

*p. 62 (May 23, 1961). Frieda’s cat Faron was the only cat that would ever appear in ''Peanuts''. Schulz wrote later: “One day, while searching for some kind of new story to work on, I decided to have the character named Frieda... threaten Snoopy with bringing a cat into the neighborhood. Snoopy was horrified, and, when the cat arrived, did not like it at all. Fortunately for him, I also discovered that ''I'' didn’t care much for the cat. For one thing, I realized that I don’t draw a cat very well, and secondly, if I were to keep up the relationship, I would have a traditional cat-and-dog strip, which was something I certainly wanted to avoid... the cat brought Snoopy back to being too much of a real dog. By the time the cat had come into the strip, Snoopy was drifting further and further into his fantasy life, and it was important that he continue in that direction. To take him back to his earlier days would not work, so I did the obvious and removed the cat. (My only regret was that I had named the cat after Faron Young, a country-and-western singer whom I admired very much...)”&lt;ref name=&quot;jubilee&quot; /&gt; Schulz would later introduce an “offstage” cat.

*p. 63 (May 26, 1961). “[[w:Sandbagging|Sandbagging]]” is a term mainly used in gaming or sporting contexts, meaning to feign weakness to obtain an advantage.

*{{anchor|d19610528}}p. 64 (May 28, 1961). “[[w:Just Before the Battle, Mother|Just Before the Battle]]” was an 1864 song written by [[w:George Frederick Root|George F. Root]]; it was a pro-Union song but was popular throughout America, including in the Confederacy. Linus is singing it in keeping with his [[#d19610216|Civil War centennial]] interest. He has gotten the lyrics wrong slightly: the second line is actually “I am thinking most of you”. &lt;p&gt;Schulz would often refer to this strip as one of his favorites, and also as one of the few that was based on an idea he had gotten from his children: “We were at the dinner table and Amy was talking away on a real talking streak and finally I said, ‘Can’t you ''please'' be quiet?’ and she was silent for a moment and then picked up a piece of bread and began to butter it, saying, ‘Am I buttering too loud for you?’”&lt;ref name=&quot;conrad&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Barnaby|date=1967-04-16|title=You’re a Good Man, Charlie Schulz|journal=The New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punchline would be repeated by Schulz on August 5, 1998, in honor of Amy’s birthday&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peanutscollectorclub.com/peantfaq.txt|title=alt.comics.peanuts FAQ|accessdate=2007-06-02|last=Bang|first=Derrick|date=2007-04-29|format=plaintext}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

*p. 66 (June 1, 1961). See [[Annotations of The Complete Peanuts/1953 to 1954#d19540516|May 16, 1954]].

*p. 67 (June 4, 1961). In keeping with Schulz’s attention to detail, all of Lucy’s definitions are accurate. 

*p. 75 (June 22, 1961). The “little girl” referred to in this and the next two strips is President Kennedy’s daughter [[w:Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]], who was three years old at the time they were published.

*p. 80 (July 4, 1961). Shrimp Louie (or Louis) is a type of salad with shrimp and hard-boiled eggs. The recipe is based on the better-known [[w:Crab Louie|Crab Louie]].

*p. 81 (July 8, 1961). Another reference to the Civil War Centennial. Charlie Brown is singing the “[[w:Battle Cry of Freedom|Battle Cry of Freedom]]”, a pro-Union song written by George F. Root in 1862; it was the most popular song of its day. Schroeder is singing “[[w:The Bonnie Blue Flag|The Bonnie Blue Flag]]”, a pro-Confederacy song written by [[w:Harry McCarthy|Harry McCarthy]] in 1861. See also [[#d19610528|May 28, 1961]].

*p. 83 (July 10, 1961). ''The Flabby American'' was a television program about the physical fitness of Americans broadcast on May 30, 1961.

*p. 85 (July 16, 1961). Snoopy's first appearance as a [[w:Vulture|vulture]].

*p. 102 (August 25, 1961). &quot;Clam diggers&quot; are pants that are longer than shorts but are not as long as long pants.

*p. 121 (October 8, 1961). [[w:Blackbeard|Blackbeard]] refers to the famous 18th century pirate Edward Teach, best known as Blackbeard.

*p. 139 (November 19, 1961). The first reference to Charlie Brown’s unrequited love, The Little Red-Haired Girl. Schulz based her on Donna Johnson, a fellow teacher of his at the Art Instruction School, whom he dated in 1950. He had wanted to marry her, but later that year she married another man. &lt;p&gt;Schulz said in 1997, “I was sitting home one night with my kids, and I was listening to some Hank Williams songs, and I was listening to Joni James singing, ‘Today I met you on the street, my heart fell at your feet,’ you know, and those songs were so depressing. And that was the mindset that got me going on Charlie Brown sitting at the playground, eating his lunch, and he looks across the playground, and he sees the Little Red-Haired Girl, and from that, that whole series came, one thing after another.”&lt;ref name=&quot;charlierose&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=An Interview with Cartoonist Charles M. Schulz|episodeurl=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/1997/05/09/2/an-interview-with-cartoonist-charles-m-schultz|series=Charlie Rose|seriesurl=http://www.charlierose.com/|minutes=20:30|credits=Interviewer: Charlie Rose|network=PBS|airdate=1997-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*p. 151 and 154 (December 17 and 24, 1961). Linus' quotation is Matthew 2:17-18.

*p. 170 (January 31, 1962). Linus refers to a [[w:Queen snake|queen snake]] for the first time.

*p. 204 (April 20, 1962). Myopic refers to [[w:Myopia|myopia]], or nearsightedness, which is presumably why Linus requires glasses.

*p. 212 (May 8, 1962). &quot;A pretty girl is like a melody&quot; is the title of a popular song by [[w:Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin]], originally published in 1919.

*p. 204 (June 28, 1962). An SC-54 is the [[w:Search and rescue|search and rescue]] variant of the [[w:C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymaster]] transport aircraft.

*p. 240 (July 21, 1962). [[w:Sam Snead|Sam Snead]] was a legendary professional golfer from the thirties into the sixties, while [[w:Don Carter (bowler)|Don Carter]] was a well known professional bowler during the fifties and early sixties.

*p. 251 (August 6, 1962). [[w:Casey Stengel|Casey Stengel]] was a [[w:Baseball|baseball]] player and manger, best known for managing the [[w:New York Yankees|New York Yankees]] between 1949 and 1960, and the [[w:New York Mets|New York Mets]] from 1962 to 1965.

*p. 258 (August 25, 1962). Atmospheric testing refers to the testing of [[w:Nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons]] within the atmosphere, as opposed to underground testing.  Atmospheric testing was banned under the [[w:Limited Test Ban Treaty|Limited Test Ban Treaty]], signed in August 1963.

*p. 264 (September 8, 1962). [[w:Knute Rockne|Knute Rockne]] was a well known football coach at [[w:University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame University]] from 1918 to 1930.

*p. 281 (October 15, 1962). The Sabin oral polio vaccine was a [[w:Poliomyelitis|poliomyelitis]] vaccine developed by [[w:Albert Sabin|Albert Sabin]] that could be taken orally.  It replaced the earlier [[w:Jonas Salk|Salk]] vaccine, which needed to be injected with a syringe.

*p. 288 (November 2, 1962). Linus is alluding to the expression &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&quot;.  The original phrase is &quot;Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned / Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.&quot;, taken from &quot;The Mourning Bride&quot; (1697) by [[w:William Congreve|William Congreve]]. 

*p. 293 (November 12, 1962). [[w:Rachel Carson|Rachel Carson]] was the author of the early environmentalist book [[w:Silent Spring|Silent Spring]].  As a well known author and scientist at the time, Carson will be frequently referenced in future strips as a female role model.

*p. 309 (December 22, 1962). Charlie Brown is referring to the last game of the [[w:1962 World Series|1962 World Series]], in which the [[w:San Francisco Giants|San Francisco Giants]] lost to the New York Yankees in the seventh game, after [[w:Willie McCovey|Willie McCovey's]] line drive was caught by [[w:Bobby Richardson|Bobby Richardson]].

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 1===

*'''''Licini'''''
This refers to Licinius Calvus, a fellow orator and poet of Catullus.

===Line2===

*'''''Tabellis'''''

This is the diminutive of tabula. Catullus was very fond of diminutives (see lines 4, 10 and 19) and used them to express smallness, affection, pity, or contempt; in this case, most likely smallness or affection.

===Line 4===

*'''''versiculos'''''

This is the diminutive of versos.

===Line 8===

*'''''incensus'''''

Catullus was very fond of using fire or flame as a metaphor for passion.

===Line 9===

*'''''me miserum'''''

This is a very common phrase of Catullus’s. Latin was quite comfortable with describing a personal pronoun with an adjective, but it can sound awkward in English eg. The miserable I…, the witty you…

===Line 19===

*'''''ocelle'''''

This is the diminutive of ocule and literally means “little eye”. It was a common term of endearment in Latin, and especially in Catullus. A more natural translation in English may be “my friend” or “dear one”.

===Line 20===

*'''''Nemesis'''''

Nemesis was the goddess of justice and punished men for being vain.

'''''Rosmarinus''''' is a small genus of woody, perennial herbs with fragrant evergreen needle-like leaves in the family [[../Lamiaceae/]], native to the Mediterranean region.

==Description==
&lt;!--physical description of the plant--&gt;

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
There are just two species, ''[[../Rosmarinus officinalis/]]'' (Rosemary), widespread in the Mediterranean region, and ''[[../Rosmarinus eriocalyx/]]'', native to northwest Africa and southern Spain. The latter differs from the well-known herb rosemary in its smaller leaves, only 5-15 mm long and less than 2 mm broad, and densely hairy flower stems. It also tends to be lower-growing, often under 25 cm tall and prostrate, and never exceeding 1 m tall (''R. officinalis'' can reach 1.5 m, exceptionally 2 m, tall).

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

'''''Agastache''''', or '''Giant Hyssop''', is a genus of 9–12 species of perennial herbs in the family Lamiaceae, native to eastern Asia (one species) and North America (the rest). 

==Description==
Most species are very upright, 0.5–3 m tall, with stiff, angular stems clothed in toothed-edged, lance shaped leaves ranging from 1–15 cm long and 0.5–11 cm broad depending on the species. Upright spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers develop at the stem tips in summer. The flowers are usually white, pink, mauve, or purple, with the bracts that back the flowers being of the same or a slightly contrasting color.

==Growing conditions==
They are easily grown in moist, well-drained soil and prefer a sunny position. Winter hardiness varies; the hardiest is ''A. foeniculum'', hardy to USDA hardiness zone 1 in the north of its range; ''A. nepetoides'', ''A. rugosa'', ''A. scrophulariifolia'' and ''A. urticifolia'' are hardy to zones 3–5 in the northern parts of their ranges. 

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagate from seed or cuttings.

==Harvest==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
Agastache is relatively free of pests and diseases, with the exception of powdery mildew, rust, and other fungal pathogens that can affect the leaves during hot, humid weather if air circulation is poor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Client Centered Therapies - An Introduction ==

Client-centered therapies belong within humanistic psychology. Carl Rogers is known as the father of client-centered therapy. Partly in response to the psychoanalytic and behavioral schools that emphasized interpretations or manipulations, Rogers developed a non-directive therapy focused on creating a reflective space for individuals to actualize their potential. He later changed the name of this therapy to &quot;person-centred therapy&quot;. 

In a paper written by Carl Rogers (1979), he reviews briefly the central hypothesis of his person-centred therapy. He suggests that each of us has within us the resources to achieve self-understanding, as well as to alter our self-concept, our basic attitudes, and our self-directed behaviour. Rogers (1979) proposes that these resources can be tapped only within a very specific type of environment that are characterized by what he refers to as facilitative conditions.

According to Rogers (1979), there are three conditions that facilitate this growth: 1) Genuineness/Realness/Congruence; 2) Acceptance/Caring/Unconditional Positive Regard, and 3) Empathic Understanding. 

Congruence refers to the therapist being transparent to the client, and not putting up a professional front. It would involve the therapist demonstrating conguence with what they are experiencing at the gut level, what is present in their awareness, and what they are expressing to the client. According to Rogers (1979), the more the therapist demonstrates congruence within the therapeutic environment, the more the client will be likely to change and grow in a positive manner.

Unconditional Positive Regard is the second facilitative condition and involves the therapist being with the client and accepting the client throughout therapy regardless of where they are at, and what feelings they are experiencing. Rogers (1979) believes that the more the client is prized in an unconditional manner, the more the client will be likely to grow and improve.

The final facilitative condition that Rogers (1979) proposed is empathy. The concept of empathy within therapy has been one of the heaviest researched facilitative conditions. Empathy refers to the idea that the therapist is able to capture sensitively and accurately the meaning and personal feelings that the client is experiencing. Additionally, empathy also implies that the therapist is able to successfully relay these feelings and the meaning they hold back to the client. At the very deepest level of empathic understanding, the therapist will not only be able to clarify the meaning of things in which the client is aware, but will also be able to clarify those things that are just below the client's awareness. Rogers (1979) believed that more empathic understanding was associated with greater improvements and growth within the therapy.

== Development of Client Centered Therapies ==

==== Four Waves of Rogers Therapy ====
The evolution of Roger's therapy/theory has undergone many changes throughout history. Of importance are four main periods in time that were marked by major changes. These changes are mentioned in Corey (2005) briefly, and more fully elaborated and discussed by Zimring and Raskin (1992) and Bozarth, Zimring and Tausch (2002).

During the 1940s, Rogers developed what was known as '''non-directive counselling'''. This creation was in response to the traditional directive psychoanalytic approaches of the time. Below is a list of the significance of what was put forth by Rogers in the first wave of his theory:

-emphasized that the therapist create a permissive and nondirective climate.

-challenged the concept that the &quot;counsellor knows best&quot;.

-challenged traditional procedures used by many therapists like advice, suggestion, direction, persuasion, teaching, and interpretation.

-challenged the use of diagnostic procedures because he believed that they were often inaccurate, prejudicial, and misused.

-avoided sharing information about himself, and instead focused on reflecting and clarifying the client' verbal/nonverbal communications.

-aim was to gain insight into the feelings expressed by the client.

During the 1950s, Rogers renamed his approach to counselling '''client-centered therapy'''. At this time, a very important book was published by Rogers called &quot;Client-centered Therapy&quot; (Rogers, 1951), which began to reflect an emphasis on the client, rather than a therapists use of indirective methods. Of significance during this period was:

-a shift from clarification of feelings to examining instead more heavily the phenomenological world of the client.

-a strong focus on the clients internal frame of reference in order to gain an understanding of how people behave.

-a strong focus on the actualizing tendency, as the basic motivating force that leads to client changes.

Beginning somewhat in the late 1950s, but extending all the way into the 1970s, Rogers began to address what have become known as the '''necessary and sufficient conditions of therapy'''. During this time, among other books, Rogers published his nationally recognized book &quot;On Becoming a Person&quot; (1961). Of significance during this time period was:

-his hypothesis that the facilitative conditions were related to psychotherapy improvements. This prediction triggered decades of research in psychology and related fields.

-a strong focus on becoming one's experience was introduced, which involves an openness to experience, a trust in that experience, an internal locus of evaluation, and a willingness to be in process.

-the initial expansion of Rogers' ideas to education occurred and was called student-centered teaching.

The final phase, during the 1980s and 1990s, was marked by great expansion of Rogers' ideas to many facets of life. For this reason, Rogers changed the name of his approach to '''person-centered therapy'''. This time in history was of significance because it involved:

-an expansion to education, industry, conflict resolution, administrations.

-an influence on family, health care, and cross-cultural and racial activity.

-an involvement in politics, especially the search for world peace, which led to Rogers being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

To this day, many researchers continue to be influenced by the seminal work conducted by Carl Rogers. To conclude, a list is provided below of current day researchers that have at the root of their work the ideas of Rogers (see Corey, 2005, pp. 183-184).

-Virginia Axline made use of Rogers ideas with children by using what is known as Play Therapy.

-Eugene Gendlin developed a technique known as focusing, in order to facilitate client experiencing within therapy.

-Laura Rice initiated that therapists make use of a technique known as systematic evocative unfolding as a way of recreating and potentially gaining a better understanding of a particular troubling experience.

-Leslie Greenberg from York University, and his colleagues, have encouraged therapists to facilitate emotional change within therapy, and have also applied his emotion focused therapy to couples and families.

-Jeanne Watson from OISE/UT has demonstrated the importance of empathy within therapy, and has encouraged making use of empathy to tap cognitive, affective, and interpersonal issues within therapy.

Carl Rogers' most famous and influential book was ''On Becoming a Person''

Within this book, Carl Rogers highlights some significant learnings that he had accumulated over the thousands of hours he has spent with individuals in personal distress. These particular learnings are highligted in a chapter entitled &quot;This is Me&quot;. Rogers (1961) reports that these learnings has significance for him (at that point in his life/career), but admits that he is in no way attempting to present these learnings as a guide for anyone else. A brief description of each learning is helpful other to gain a deeper understanding of Carl Rogers, the researcher, the clinician, and the man. Each has been directly quoted from his book &quot;On Becoming a Person&quot; (Rogers, 1961).

1) In my relationships with persons I have found that it does not help, in the long run, to act as though I were something that I am not.

2) I find I am more effective when I can listen acceptantly to myself, and can be myself.

3) I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand another person.

4) I have found it enriching to open channels whereby others can communicate their feelings, their private perceptual worlds, to me.

5) I have found it highly rewarding when I can accept another person.

6) The more I am open to the realities in me and in the other person, the less do I find myself wishing to rush into &quot;fix things&quot;.

7) I can trust my experience.

8) Evaluation for others is not a guide for me.

9) Experience is, for me, the highest authority.

10) I enjoy the discovering of order in experience.

11) The facts are friendly.

12) What is most personal is most general.

13) It has been my experience that persons have a basically positive direction.

14) Life, at its best, is a flowing, changing, process by which nothing is fixed.

Rogers describes these learnings as incomplete, scattered, and continuously changing. He also reports that he continues to learn and relearn them, and at times forgets to apply them. However, he mentions they are all of great importance to him and have become a large part of his inner values and ways of behaving.

==Uses==
The fresh and dried leaves are used frequently in traditional Mediterranean cuisine as an herb; they have a bitter, astringent taste, which complements oily foods, such as lamb and oily fish. A tisane can also be made from them. They are extensively used in cooking, and when burned gives off a distinct mustard smell, which can be used to flavor foods while barbecueing.

Since it is attractive and tolerates some degree of drought, it is also used in landscaping, especially in areas having a Mediterranean climate. It can in fact die in over-watered soil, but is otherwise quite easy to grow for beginner gardeners. It is very pest-resistant.

Rosemary is easily pruned into shapes and has been used for topiary. When grown in pots, it is best kept trimmed to stop it getting too straggly and unsightly, though when grown in a garden, rosemary can grow quite large and still be attractive. It can be propagated from an existing plant by clipping a shoot 10-15 cm long, stripping a few leaves from the bottom, and planting it directly into soil.

Rosemary is a useful food preservative, according to research published in 1987 by Rutgers University, New Jersey. Researchers at Rutgers patented a chemical derived from rosemary that compares favorably with BHA and BHT in its preservative properties.

Rosemary can be added as an unusual extra flavoring in lemonade.

===Medicinal uses===
Rosemary has been found to be a stimulant and mild analgesic, and has been used to treat headaches, poor circulation, and many ailments for which stimulants are prescribed. 

It can be used as a disinfectant, as a mouth wash and to treat fever or rheumatism.

Externally it can be used in hair lotions; a few drops of Rosemary oil massaged into the scalp, then rinsed with an infusion of nettles can revitalize the hair. Used in this manner, it is supposed to prevent premature baldness. Rosemary is also reported to stop dandruff.

Hungary water was first invented for a Queen of Hungary to 'renovate vitality of paralysed limbs'. It was used externally and prepared by mixing 180g of fresh rosemary tops in full flower into a liter of fresh rosemary tops in full flower into a liter of spirits of wine. Leave to stand for four days then distill. It is also supposed to work as a remedy against gout if rubbed vigorously on hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superbherbs.net/Rosemary.htm Rosemary at SuperbHerbs.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemary has a very old reputation for improving memory, and has been used as a symbol for remembrance (during weddings, war commemorations and funerals) in Europe, probably as a result of this reputation. Students in ancient Greece are reported to have worn sprigs of rosemary in their hair while studying for exams to improve their memory, and mourners would throw it into graves as a symbol of remembrance for the dead. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Ophelia says, &quot;There's rosemary, that's for remembrance&quot;.

Rosemary and its constituents carnosol and ursolic acid have been shown to inhibit the growth of skin tumors and to provide a natural anti-oxidant protection against skin cancer and photodamage.

'''''Health Precautions''''': In some cases, rosemary can cause autoimmune diseases. Rosemary in culinary or therapeutic doses is generally safe, however precaution is necessary for those displaying allergic reaction, or those prone to epileptic seizure. Rosemary essential oil is a powerful convulsant; if applied to the skin, it may cause seizures in otherwise healthy adults or children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10460442&amp;dopt=Abstract PubMed entry]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rosemary essential oil is potentially toxic if ingested. Large quantities of rosemary leaves can cause adverse reactions, such as coma, spasm, vomiting, and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) that can be fatal. Avoid consuming large quantities of rosemary if pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcomm.com/resources/imc/OneMedicineCons/ConsHerbs/Rosemarych.html Article at HealthComm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
Cut flowers off to encourage more leaf production. In hardiness zones below 7, the plant should be brought indoors in winter.

==Propagation==
Most commonly propagated via stem cuttings.

==Harvesting==
Cut leafy stems (removing flowers, if present). Dry by hanging upside down in a dark area.

==Pests and diseases==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Induction==

Induction plays a crucial role at least in two aspect throughout this
book. Firstly, it is one of main proof principles in mathematics and
of course in logics.  In particular it
can be used to investigate properties of infinite sets. Very often it
is used as ''natural induction'', namely over the natural
numbers. We will introduce it as a more general principle over well
founded partial orders, which is called  ''structural induction''.
The second aspect is, that it can be used as well to define infinite
structures, as the set of well formed formulae in a particular logic
or the set of binary trees.

We start with a very general structure over arbitrary sets, namely
partial orders.
A relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a partial order iff &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is
reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric (i.e. &lt;math&gt; ((x,y)\in R \land (y,x)\in
R \Rightarrow x=y)&lt;/math&gt;) .
Partial ordered sets (p.o. sets) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are usually written as &lt;math&gt; (A,
\leq)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition 1==
The necessary structure for our induction principle is a partial
order, such that there exist minimal elements. Given a p.o. set &lt;math&gt;(A,
\leq)&lt;/math&gt;, we define:
  
*&lt;math&gt; x &lt; y &lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\neq y&lt;/math&gt;. 
* &lt;math&gt;(A, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; is called well-founded iff there is no infinite sequence &lt;math&gt; (x_i)_{i\in N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_{i+1} &lt; x_i, \forall i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;X\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; is called a chain iff &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y \in X : x\leq y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\leq x&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;(A, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; is a total ordering iff &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a chain.
==Lemma 1==

&lt;math&gt;(A, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; is well-founded, if every non-empty subset of
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a minimal Element.
'''Proof''' can be done by contradiction and will be given as an
exercise.

We finally have the machinery to introduce the principle of complete
induction:

==Definition 2 (Complete (structural) induction)==
Given a well-founded p.o. set &lt;math&gt;(A, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; and a predicate &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;P : A \to \{true, false \}&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of induction is given 
by the following (second order) formula
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\forall x \in A\; ( \forall y \in A\; ( y &lt;x \Rightarrow P(y)) \Rightarrow P(x)) \Rightarrow \forall z \in A\; P(z) 
&lt;/math&gt;

==Lemma 2==
The induction principle holds for every well-founded set.

'''Proof:''' The proof is given by contradiction: Assume the principle is wrong;
i.e. the implication is wrong, which means, that we have to assume the 
premise as true:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\forall x \in A\; ( \forall y \in A\; ( y &lt;x \Rightarrow P(y)) 
\Rightarrow P(x))  \equiv{true}
 (premise)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and the conclusion as wrong:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\forall z \in A\; (P(z)) \equiv =false=  
 (conclusion)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hence we can assume that the set &lt;math&gt;X = \{ x \in A \mid P(x) = false\} &lt;/math&gt; is not empty.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of a well-founded set, 
it has a minimal element, say &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
From assumption (premise) we conclude
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
(\forall y \in A\; ( y &lt; b \Rightarrow P(y))
\Rightarrow P(b))  \equiv{true}
 (inst)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now we can distinguish two cases:
  
*&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is minimal in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:  Hence there is no &lt;math&gt;y \in A&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;y &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence the premise  &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in A\; ( y &lt; b \Rightarrow P(y))&lt;/math&gt; of the implication in  (inst) is true, which implies that the conclusion &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt; is true. This is a contradiction to the assumption that &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;b \in X&lt;/math&gt;!  
*&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is not minimal in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:   &lt;math&gt; \forall y \in A\; (y &lt;b)&lt;/math&gt; holds and it must be that &lt;math&gt;P(y)&lt;/math&gt; is true, because otherwise it would be that &lt;math&gt;y\in X&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; not minimal in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, again the premise  &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in A\; ( y &lt; b \Rightarrow P(y))&lt;/math&gt; of the implication in  (inst) is true, which implies that the conclusion &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt; is true. This is a contradiction to the assumption that &lt;math&gt;b \in X&lt;/math&gt;!

==An Example==
In this subsection we will carry out a proof with induction in
detail. For this we need the extension of p.O. sets:

==Definition 3 (Lexicographic Ordering)==

A p.O. set &lt;math&gt;(A,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; induces an ordering &lt;math&gt;\ll&lt;/math&gt;  over &lt;math&gt;A\times A&lt;/math&gt;: 
&lt;math&gt; \forall x,y,x\prime,y\prime \in A : (x, y) \ll (x\prime, y\prime)&lt;/math&gt;   iff
  
*&lt;math&gt; x= x\prime&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;y = y \prime&lt;/math&gt; or 
*&lt;math&gt; x &lt; x\prime&lt;/math&gt;  or  
*&lt;math&gt; x= x\prime &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;y\prime &lt;/math&gt;

==Lemma 3==

If  &lt;math&gt;(A,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is a well-founded set, then &lt;math&gt;(A\times A, \ll)&lt;/math&gt; is
well-founded as well.

==Theorem 1==
The Ackermann-function &lt;math&gt;ACK&lt;/math&gt; defined by the following recursion is a total
function over &lt;math&gt;N \times N&lt;/math&gt; 

   ACK(x,y) = 
     if x=0  then y+1 else
                      if y=0 then ACK(x-1,1) 
                             else ACK(x-1,ACK(x, y-1))


'''Proof:'''
For the induction start we take the minimal element  &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; of the
well-founded set, &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;(N \times N , \ll)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \ll&lt;/math&gt; is the lexicographic
ordering induced by &lt;math&gt;(N, \leq )&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, assume &lt;math&gt;x=0, y=0&lt;/math&gt;. By
definition of &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;ACK&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude &lt;math&gt;ACK(0,0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and hence defined.
Assume for an an arbitrary  &lt;math&gt;(m,n)&lt;/math&gt;, that 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; ACK(m', n')&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;(m'. n')  \ll (m,n)&lt;/math&gt;, if
&lt;math&gt; (m,n) \neq (m',n')
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We distinguish the following cases:
  
*&lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt;: i.e.  &lt;math&gt;ACK(0,n) = n+1&lt;/math&gt; and  hence defined. 
*&lt;math&gt;m\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;: We know that &lt;math&gt;(m-1,1) \ll (m,0)&lt;/math&gt; and   &lt;math&gt;(m-1,1) \neq (m,0)&lt;/math&gt;. From the induction hypothesis we know that &lt;math&gt;ACK(m-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, and hence &lt;math&gt;ACK(m,0) = ACK(m-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; as   well.  
* &lt;math&gt;m\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;: According to the definition of &lt;math&gt;ACK&lt;/math&gt; we have two cases to consider:   
**&lt;math&gt;(m,n-1) \ll (m,n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(m,n-1) \neq  (m,n)&lt;/math&gt;: From the      induction hypothesis we conclude immediately that &lt;math&gt;ACK(m,n-1)&lt;/math&gt; is defined. 
** &lt;math&gt;(m-1,y) \ll (m,z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(m-1,y) \neq  (m,z)&lt;/math&gt;: Independent      from the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. If we assume &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;y 'ACK(m,n-1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=n&lt;/math&gt;, we again can conclude from the hypothesis, that &lt;math&gt;ACK(m-1, ACK(m, n-1))&lt;/math&gt; is defined and hence &lt;math&gt;ACK(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; as well    
*: 
Altogether we proved, that &lt;math&gt;ACK(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x,y \geq
0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Problems==
====Problem 1 (Induction)====

Prove the following lemma: If &lt;math&gt;(A,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is well founded also &lt;math&gt;(A \times A,\ll)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: The lexicographical Order &lt;math&gt;(A \times A,\ll)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows: 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (m,n) \ll (m',n') \iff \big( m&lt;m' \lor (m=m' \land n \leq n') \big) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Problem 2 (Induction)====
How many points of intersection could &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; straight lines have at most? Find a recursive and explicit formula and show

====Problem 3 (Induction)====
Prove that a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is even if and only if &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is even.

====Problem 4 (Induction)====
Point by an indirect proof that there is not any greatest prime number!

====Problem 5 (Induction)====
Which prerequisite do you need that the following order

&lt;math&gt;(\{A,\,B,\,C,\,0,\,1,\,2\},\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is
           
#partial ordered         
#total ordered         
#well-founded?

====Problem 6 (Induction)====
An example of a well founded set is the power set &lt;math&gt;P(M)&lt;/math&gt; over a finite set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which is comparable over the relation of the subset &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;M=\{1,\, 2,\, 3\}&lt;/math&gt; then is e.g. &lt;math&gt;{1}\subseteq \{1,\, 2,\, 3\}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\{1,\, 2\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{2,\, 3\}&lt;/math&gt; are not comparable.
Give a definition of a relation &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in this way that &lt;math&gt;( P(M),\, B )&lt;/math&gt; is  total ordered and well founded.

====Problem 7 (Induction)====
Examine which of the following partial order are total and which are well founded!
  
#&lt;math&gt;(2^{\N},\subseteq)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;2^{\N}&lt;/math&gt; is the power set for natural numbers.         
#&lt;math&gt;(\N,|)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|&lt;/math&gt; marks the relation &quot;`is factor of&quot;'. 
#&lt;math&gt;(\N\times\N,\ll)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(m,n) \ll (m',n')&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;m&lt;m'&lt;/math&gt; or (&lt;math&gt;m=m'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \leq n'&lt;/math&gt;).         
#&lt;math&gt;(\N^*,\preceq)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is the lexicographical . 
#for &lt;math&gt;\N^*&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;1 \prec 1.1 \prec 3 \prec 3.3.8&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 8 (Induction)====
Give for the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; an order relation, that is
          
#both well-founded and total,         
#total but not well-founded,         
#well-founded but not total and         
#neither well-founded nor total.

====Problem 9 (Induction)====
Prove, that a partial order &lt;math&gt;(A,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is well-founded iff every non-empty partial set of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (at least) contains a minimum element.

====Problem 10 (Induction)====
A root tree consists (a) of a single node or (b) of
a node - that's the root of the tree - and at least one,
but only at most finite many (part)trees, this one is bandaged
over an edge with the root. Point formally by means of induction,
that in every tree the number of the nodes &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is
taller than the number of the edges &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;e = n-1&lt;/math&gt;.

====Problem 11 (Induction)====
Prove: If ε is a quality of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; and it is valid
          
#ε(0) and 
#&lt;math&gt; \forall n \in \N&lt;/math&gt; : [ε(n) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ε(n+1)]. 
then &lt;math&gt; \forall n \in \N&lt;/math&gt; : ε(n) is valid.

'''Note:'''  The proof can be done by the fact that the principle
of the complete induction in &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; (which should be proved) can be reduced to
the principle of the transfinite induction for well founded orders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overview=

Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are the four most abundant elements in living organisms, and account for more than 99% of atoms found in living things. Carbon is present in all organic molecules and carbon atoms can join together to form chains or ring structures.


'''Polymers and Macromolecules'''

Macro refers to something that is large, and so macromolecules simply means large molecules, and there are only three types - polysaccharides, proteins (polypeptides) and nucleic acids (polynucleotides) (poly means 'many'). Macromolecules are such because they are made of many repeating subunits that are connected to each other.

=Carbohydrates=

All carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and have hydrogen to oxygen present in the ratio 2:1 respectively.

==Monosaccharides==

Monosaccharides are sugars and are soluble - meaning that they dissolve in water, forming sweet solutions. Mono refers to one and saccharide means sugar - so monosaccharide means single sugar.  Monosaccharides are classified according to the number of carbon atoms in each molecule - trioses (3 carbons), pentoses(5 carbons) and hexoses(6 carbons).

The structure of the most common monosaccharide, glucose, in both the alpha (on the left) and beta (on the right) isomer (two forms of the same chemical are known as isomers): [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/bio4fv/page/formsofglucose.jpg].

An important note on the structure of both pentoses and hexoses is that the chain of carbon atoms is long enough to close up on itself and form a stable ring structure, as seen in the picture above.

''' Roles of Monosaccharides '''

Simple sugars, such as glucose, are often used in biological organisms as a source of energy for respiration - the carbon hydrogen bonds within them are easily broken down to release a great deal of energy which in turn helps make ATP from ADP and phosphate. Secondly, monosaccharides can be used as building blocks for larger molecules (polysaccharides).


''' Glycosidic bonds '''

If you look at the above image of glucose, you'll see a hydroxl (-OH) group on the top right of the image, highlighted in red. When two glucose molecules come together, the two hydroxyl groups line up along side each other: one combines with a hydrogen atom from the other to form water, in turn forming an oxygen bridge across the two molecules, bonding them and creating a disaccharide- this bond is called a glycosidic bond. The reaction is known as condensation, and the reverse reaction - the addition of water is a hydrolysis reaction, which breaks down di/polysaccharides into their original monosaccharides.

Formation of a glycosidic bond: [http://www.dr-sanderson.org/images/Image2.gif]


==Polysaccharides==

As we saw before, monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds in condensation reaction become disaccharides, but if more than two monosaccharides are joined together it is known as a polysaccharide. It is important to note that polysaccharides are not sugars and examples of polysaccharides include starch, glycogen and cellulose, all polysaccharides made from glucose. 

The reason glucose is converted into these polysaccharides is storage - left free in cells, glucose will dissolve and affect the osmotic potential of the cell, making it too concentrated. A condensation reaction to convert it to a polysaccharide (compact, inert and insoluble) - and when glucose is required again, the storage molecule (starch in plants, glycogen in animals) can be quickly hydrolysed in an enzyme controlled reaction.


''' Animal Storage Molecules '''

'''Glycogen''' [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Glycogen.png/350px-Glycogen.png] is the primary storage molecule in animals. Glycogen, as you can see in the above picture, is made of many 1,4 linked alpha-glucose molecules (1,4 linked means that they are linked by carbon atoms of 1 &amp; 4 of successive glucose units). These chains branch out to the side, and the branches are formed by 1,6 linkages. The chains also coil up into helical structures, making their final structure more compact (useful for storage).


''' Plant Storage Molecules '''

Starch is a mixture of two substances, '''amylose''' and '''amylopectin'''. Amylopectin is very similar to glycogen in that it is made of many 1,4 linked alpha-glucose molecules, and branches via 1,6 linkages - the main difference is that amylopectin branches less than glycogen. Amylose, on the other hand is a very long, unbranching chain of several thousand 1,4 linked glucose molecules, and as in glycogen and amylopectin, these chains curve to coil up into helical structures for compactness. Amylose chains are usually longer than amylopectin.


Cellulose is the other important polysaccharide - and is the most abundant organic molecule on earth. This is partially due to its structural role in cell walls and partially due to its slow rate of breakdown. The main difference between cellulose and the other two storage molecules you've seen is that cellulose is a polymer of beta-glucose, whereas the other two are from alpha-glucose. If you remember, the two isomers of glucose are different only in their location of the -OH and -HO group, on carbon atoms 1 and 4, respectively. See this picture [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/bio4fv/page/formsofglucose.jpg] for more details. This means that to form glycosidic bonds, subsequent glucose molecules must be at 180degrees to each other, or in other words, each must be upside down to the other to allow the -OH and -HO groups to bond. You can see the molecular structure of cellulose here: [http://woodscience.oregonstate.edu/images/Research_Cellulose(50).jpg]


These bonds result in a strong molecules because the hydrogen atoms form '''hydrogen bonds''' with oxygen atoms in the same glucose molecule and other neighboring glucose molecules. While these hydrogen bonds are individually weak, due to the large numbers of -OH groups, collectively they develop massive strength. Also, between 60-70 cellulose molecules become tightly cross linked to form bundles called '''microfibrils''', which are in turn held together in bundles called '''fibres''' by further hydrogen bonding, making the entire structure even stronger.


''' Cellulose in Cell Walls '''

Cellulose comprises around 20-40% of the average cell wall, with other molecules helping to crosslink the cellulose fibres. This is because cellulose fibres have a tensile strength almost equivalent to that of steel, meaning that it is very difficult to break cellulose, and this very strong cell wall is what allows plant cells to withstand large osmotic pressures - without it, the cell would burst when in a dilute solution. This allowance for high pressures help provide support for the plant by making the tissues rigid and are responsible for cell expansion during growth. Despite all the strength that cellulose has, it is also (very usefully), freely permeable.


=Lipids=

The most common type of lipids that you'll be expected to know about are '''triglycerides''', usually known as fats and oils. 


== Triglycerides ==

All triglycerides are made from a glycerol 'head' and 3 fatty acid 'tails'. Glycerol is a type of alcohol. The fatty acids are organic molecules and all have a -COOH group attached to a hydrocarbon tail. Fatty acids are attached to glycerol by a condensation reaction.

One of their important properties is that they are insoluble in water - but soluble in certain organic solvents, including ether, ethanol and chloroform. This is because of the hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids - which basically means that the tail is only carbon combined with hydrogen, creating no uneven distribution of electrical charge (unlike water molecules, which are polar). This means that they cannot mix freely with water molecules, and so are '''hydrophobic''' and '''non-polar'''. 

Their roles are usually as fantastic energy reserves - as you'll see in the coming paragraphs they are incredibly rich in carbon-hydrogen bonds ready to be oxidised for energy. The same mass of lipid will have more energy than the same mass of carbohydrate. Fat also provides buoyancy in the form of blubber for sea mammals - whilst providing insulation, as it does for all mammals. They can also, in unusual circumstances be used as a metabolic source of water - oxidising them for energy converts them to carbon dioxide and then water. This is useful for animals living in the desert that do not have much or any water.


== Saturated and Unsaturated ==


'''Unsaturated fatty acids''' [http://www.optimal-heart-health.com/images/Unsaturated_Fat.jpg] are known as such as due to the kink (see picture) caused by the C-C=C-C bond (the C=C part is important), that it does not contain the maximum possible amount of hydrogen, and these form unsaturated lipids. The double bond (C=C) makes the fatty acid melt more easy, for example, most oils are unsaturated (and are usually liquid at room temperature) - it also makes them easier to digest. More than one kink is known as polyunsaturated, one kink is monounsaturated. 

Saturated fatty acids on the other hand, [http://www.optimal-heart-health.com/images/Saturated_Fat.jpg], as you can see in the picture, contain the maximum amount of hydrocarbons and have no kinks. 

Animal lipids are usually saturated and thus are fats, whereas plant lipids are usually unsaturated, for example olive oil and sunflower oil - usually oils.

== Phospholipids ==

These are a special type of lipid, usually found in the plasma membrane of cells (see Chapter 1, among others). Each molecule has one end that is soluble in water, and the other which is not. This is because one of the fatty acids is replaced by a phosphate group which is polar and can dissolve in water - making it hydrophilic. The two remaining tails are still hydrophobic but the head is hydrophilic.


=Proteins=

'''Overview'''

Proteins have many important functions within organisms - and more than 50% of dry mass of most cells is protein. Their functions can include;

* All enzymes are proteins
* Antibodies are proteins
* Essential component of cell membranes (glycoproteins, transport proteins etc.)
* Structural support in the form of collagen


==Amino Acids==

Despite the range of functions listed above (which is by no means exhaustive), all proteins are made from only 20 different '''amino acids.''' All amino acids have the same basic structure - a central carbon atom which is bonded to an 'amine' group, -NH2 (on the left in the picture), and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH (on the right in the picture. The third bond  to the carbon group is always a hydrogen atom (in purple). The remaining 'R' group, in yellow, is the fourth and variable group of atoms bonded to the central carbon. This is what makes amino acids differ from each other - and it is these R groups that change the shape of protein molecules and thus their functions. See picture: [http://www.langara.bc.ca/biology/mario/Assets/aminoAcidStruc.jpg]


==The Peptide Bond==

A peptide bond is one that is formed after two amino acids join each other in a condensation reaction - one loses a hydroxyl group from the carboxylic acid group (see above picture), which leaves free the carbon atom from the first amino acid to bond with the nitrogen atom of the second - the peptide bond. This molecule is now known as a dipeptide - but can be expanded upoun with additional condensation reactions to form a polypeptide.


==Structure==

'''Primary'''

The primary structure of a protein simply refers to the type of amino acids in the polypeptide chains and the sequence inwhich they are joined. As you can guess, with 20 different amino acids, and many many different combination, there are many different possible primary structures.

'''Secondary'''

The secondary structure of a protein is the effect that amino acids have on a polypeptide chain even if they are not directly next to each other, for example the α-helix we saw earlier, that is due to the attraction of the oxygen of the -CO group of one amino acid and the hydrogen of the -NH group of the amino acid anywhere else in the chain, forming a hydrogen bond. Another shape is the β-pleated sheet, which is a looser, but straighter shape. Sometimes there is no regular arrangement - it depends on the amino acids present.

'''Tertiary'''

The tertiary structure of a protein is the way in which a protein coils up to form a precise 3D shape. This can be because of the hydrogen bonds after the coiling or folding in the secondary structures, but other bonds such as a disulphide bonds can form between cysteine amino acids. Ionic bonds occur between positive and negatively charged 'R' groups. Hydrophobic parts of the polypeptide situate themselves in the centre of the polypeptide chain (away from water) and hydrophilic parts of the polypeptire situate themselves on the outside of the polypeptide chain (next to water). All affecting the tertiary structure of the polypeptide.

'''Quaternary'''

The quaternary structure is known as the association of different polypeptide chains within one protein. The same bonds as in the tertiary structure hold together the different polypeptide chains (hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges and ionic bonds). Two examples of a proteins with a quaternary structure are haemoglobin and collagen.

== Globular and Fibrous Proteins ==

A globular protein is simply one that appears to curl up into a ball - this is usually so that the proteins non-polar, hydrophobic R groups point into the centre of the molecule,  making them water soluble, since water clusters around their outward facing hydrophilic groups, but water cannot get into the molecule. Enzymes are always globular proteins and thus globular proteins are involved in metabolic reactions. However, proteins that do not curl up into a ball, but form long strands are known as fibrous proteins, and are mostly insoluble. Keratin and collagen are examples of this.

== Haemoglobin ==

An example of a globular protein that you must know about is haemoglobin. It is a pigment that carries oxygen and is found in red blood cells. It has four poly peptide chains, two α chains, two β chains, and is almost spherical. Each polypeptide chain contains a haem group, and is important and permanent part of a protein molecule that is not made of amino acids and is known as the prosthetic group. Each of these haem group contains an iron ion, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and one oxygen molecule can bind with each iron ion. A complete haemoglobin molecule has four haem groups, and thus can carry four oxygen molecules at a time. The haem group is also responsible for the colour of haemoglobin - if haemoglobin is combined with oxygen (oxyhaemoglobin), it is bright red, else it is purple.

As with all globular proteins, the hydrophilic R groups pointing out maintain it's solubility in water - however this can be affect by a disease known as sickle cell anaemia. In this case, one amino acid of one of the β polypeptide chains, in a hydrophilic section is replaced which a different amino acid, the original being a polar amino acid, the replacement being non-polar. As you will see in the water section, this will cause problems. It makes haemoglobin much less soluble, and is unpleasant and dangerous in anyone whose haemoglobin is all of this faulty type. 

==Collagen==

As previously mentioned, collagen is a fibrous protein that is found in skin, tendons, bones, teeth, cartilage and importantly in the walls of blood vessels and it is a generally important structural protein in many animals. The reason collagen is so strong is that it consists of three polypeptide chain, each in  the shape of a helix, wound together to form a three stranded 'rope'. Nearly every amino acid in the chain is glycine, which is small, and allows the three strands to lie close together and form a tight coil, and hydrogen bonds bond the strands. 

The cross-links between the collagen(the complete 3 stranded collagen molecule) form fibres, providing it with tremendous tensile strength (withstanding large pulling forces).

=Water=

Water is a major component of every cell, usually forming 70-95% of the mass of the cell, and the human body is around 60% water. If it were not for it being a dipole (see 'Dipoles and Hydrogen Bonds' below), water would be a gas at normal earth temperatures. 

==Solvency==

Water is a good solvent for polar molecules and ions, because water collects around their hydrophilic edges and separates them. This is what happens in the process of dissolving - and so the chemical is free to move about and react with other chemicals within water. Non-polar molecules are insoluble in water and are pushed together by water if surrounded by it, for example, lipids.

It's solvency is also useful when water is used as a transport medium - in the blood, lymphatic, excretory and digestive systems of animals, and in the vascular tissues of plants.

==Thermal Properties==

The hydrogen bonds formed within water mean that it requires a relatively large amount of energy to change the temperature of water, meaning that large bodies of water are slow to change temperature and as a result are more stable habitats. This is useful in the animal body as there is a high proportion of water, and so a stable body temperature is easier to attain. Also useful in the body is that the process of evaporation transfers a large amount of energy and this is why sweating is effective in cooling the body.

A large amount of energy is required to convert water to ice and thus water is less likely to freeze. Also, ice less dense than water and thus when parts of a river, for example, freeze - the ice floats to the top and acts as an insulator for the rest of the water. This means that aquatic organisms can still survive since the whole river is unlikely to freeze.

==Cohesion==

Water molecules, partially because of their polarity, have a tendency to stick together, a property known as cohesion. This provides a high surface tension which allows very light animals to use the surface of the water as a habitat. It also means that water can move in long unbroken columns through vascular tissue in plants and is an important property in cells.

==Dipoles and Hydrogen Bonds==

Atoms in molecules are held together because they share electrons with each other. A shared pair of electrons forms a covalent bond - for example in a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms each share a pair of electrons with an oxygen atom. however, as this [http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/biochem/lecture/waterph/dipole.jpg] picture shows, there is an uneven distribution of charge, with oxygen getting more than its fair share and receiving a small negative charge, and both of the hydrogen atoms receiving less than their fair share, resulting in a positive charge.

This uneven distribution of charge is called a dipole. In water, the negative charges of the oxygen is attracted to the positive charges of the hydrogen atoms, and the attraction is called a hydrogen bond - weaker than a covalent bond but enough to have a significant effect. Molecules with dipole groups (-OH, -C=0 or &gt;N-H), are known as polar as they are attracted to water molecules (since water is also a dipole molecule). These polar molecules are hydrophilic and tend to be soluble in water. Those molecules that are non-polar are not attracted to water and are hydrophobic.

==Food Tests==

These are the important food tests - tests that tell you whether certain molecules are present in solutions.

An additional note regarding benedict's test - it requires excess benedicts reagent to react with all the present sugar.
For the non-reducing sugar test, the reason the sugar solution is heated with dilute hydrocholric acid is to hydrolyse any glycosidic bonds present, to make the sugar a reducing one, so that it may reduce benedicts and cause the colour change. However, benedict's only works in a alkaline environment and thus sodium hydroxide must be added to neutralise it.

== Inorganic Ions ==

Molecules are not the only type of substance that is important for the structure and metabolism of living organisms - they also need a wide variety of ions (see the below table). Ions are formed from individual atoms that have gained or lost one or more electrons and are therefore charged negatively or positively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''TEACHERS AS LEARNERS AND LEARNERS AS TEACHERS'''

Lauren Florin and Stephanie Sugioka -- May 2007
Edited by Patti Horne

==Introduction==	

As early as 1916 when [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey John Dewey] published his seminal work &quot;Democracy and Education&quot;, it was acknowledged that learners should become active participants in the educational process.  From this proposition it clearly follows that in learning from their own experience, students become, in a sense, their own teachers.  The changed role of the learner has, in turn, implications for that of the teacher.  Instead of the source of knowledge, teachers become facilitators of the learning process; that is, their role is to create the set of conditions under which students can best learn from their experiences.  Moreover, teachers can fulfill this role only by becoming learners themselves, and a primary source of their learning must be their students.  Simply put, teachers who learn become better teachers, and learners who teach become better learners.  Although this idea seems straightforward enough, educators have been very slow to put it into practice.  However, the rapid technological changes of the last few decades may well provide the catalyst that finally brings about these needed reforms in the field of education.

==Teachers as Learners==

'''Side bar 1''' “Who dares to teach must never cease to learn.” John Cotton Dana

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
	
As recently as the 1970s, college professors were expected to have mastered only one knowledge domain—that of their specialty.  The walls of the ivory tower were, theoretically, impermeable, and students were to concern themselves only with their text and the knowledge conveyed to them by their professors.  The professor was not expected to bring into the conversation his or her personal concerns, the interests or needs of the students, or even events in the outside world.  However, in the last two decades, the academic cocoon has been blown wide open by the forces of globalism, multi-culturalism, and multimodalism (New London Group, 2000).  No longer is it sufficient for educators to concern themselves with the narrow parameters of their chosen fields.  They are expected to relate the content of their specialties to the lives of their students and to real-world concerns.  To practice sound pedagogy, teachers must be learners in the broadest sense.  Not only must they considerably extend the content of what they learn and teach, they must also subject the ways they acquire and convey their knowledge to rigorous scrutiny—to analysis, reflection, and evaluation (Wooldridge, 2001).  Thus, for educators, the learning curve has grown steeper in almost every conceivable respect:  They must learn not only what to teach but also how to teach; they must learn not only from written texts and from other experts in their fields but also from their colleagues, their students, and their observation of events in the world outside the academy.  With knowledge doubling every year or so, 'expertise' now has a shelf life measured in days; everyone must be both learner and teacher; and the sheer challenge of learning can be managed only through a globe-gridling network that links all minds and all knowledge (Perlman, 1992). 

===Learning to Teach===
	
How, then, in this new global, multicultural environment should teachers learn to teach?  Unlike the previous static mode of instruction delivery, the current model calls for a dynamic process in which teachers should constantly learn from their practice in a &quot;dialectical union of reflection and action&quot; (Hoffman-Lipp, Artiles, &amp; Lopez-Torres, 2003, p. 249).  Moreover, even reflective praxis is insufficient for teachers to learn to teach effectively.  Teachers must be open to the larger world of politics, culture, and society; they must be able to contextualize both what they learn and what they teach within a larger conceptual framework, &quot;to conceive of their work in broader terms that incorporate sociopolitical contexts of teaching in addition to curricular and pedagogical concerns&quot; (p. 250).  No longer can educators afford to sequester themselves behind the walls of academe; rather they must subject both their own practices and the social forces around them to rigorous scrutiny if they are to learn to teach effectively.  Teachers must become continual learners.  In this world, where we have access to anything we need to know, the teacher's role has changed.  Formal learning is becoming irrelevant. Informal learning, with student centered inquiry, is much more effective and develops life-long problem solving skills. Society needs citizens who can understand and reflect on ideas, work with others towards a common goal, analyze problems and follow through with solutions. To give students these types of skills we must &quot;engage and empower them as we educate them for insight&quot; (Marzano, 2001).

===Learning from and about Students===
	
Neither can teachers afford to distance themselves from the students they teach.  In the new, learner-centered environment, they must be prepared to learn both about and from their students.  The constructivist approach to education that emphasizes the student him or herself rather than the teacher as the source of knowledge is hardly new (Dewey, 1916).  However, the belief that teacher and student should maintain a partnership based on mutual learning dominates thinking about pedagogical praxis to an ever-increasing extent—from the elementary grades to the college years.  The term &quot;dialogue education&quot; has been used to characterize this more equitable relationship between teacher and student:  &quot;Two way, open dialogue needs to be a part of all learning activities&quot; (Wikipedia, 2007).  It has been demonstrated that class discussion in which students actively participate and are encouraged to raise questions and pose problems themselves may greatly increase critical thinking skills in students (Tsui, 2002).  Thus teachers must learn how to create an environment in which students feel free to openly express and share their ideas.  The perception that learning is a mutual experience in which they participate with the instructor has also been shown to contribute to higher cognitive skills in students (Tsui, 2002).  Finally, if teachers are willing to abandon the outdated notion that they must be the sole source of knowledge and profess themselves willing and perhaps even grateful to learn from their students, they can model for their students the very learning process that they would most like their students to adopt:  &quot;Teachers should be examples of how learning works&quot; (Kaplan, 1998).
	
A perfect opportunity for teachers to learn from their students presents itself in the form of technological innovation within the classroom.  Although computer literacy is becoming increasingly important for teacher effectiveness (Selber, 2004), many teachers continue to feel threatened by technologies that they have not mastered (and that some have not even tried). As educators sometimes struggle to engage today’s technology savvy students, allowing students to serve as technology trainers would be an excellent way to provide teachers with some high tech strategies that will captivate students and really get them involved in teaching and learning.  Generation Youth and Educators Succeeding (Generation YES) is a national nonprofit organization based in Olympia, Washington, that does just that via GenYES, a program wherein students learn complex computer skills, lesson plan design, and instructional strategies so that they can serve as trainers for K-12 educators (http://www.soundout.org/teaching.html).  Teachers could learn much from their young students, many of whom possess a great facility for the manipulation of technologies of all kinds.  In being thus willing to learn from their students, teachers could not only model the learning process for their students but also validate the students' sense of self-efficacy, the affirmation of which has been shown to enhance student learning in itself (Hoyt &amp; Ames, 1997).

===Expanding Teacher Learning===
	
The content of what a teacher must learn to be effective has thus increased exponentially.  Not only must teachers learn how to use technology to enrich their teaching, they must also learn how to teach students to use it responsibly and mindfully.  Moreover, the teacher must also learn about his or her students—their families, their cultures, their communities (Kaplan, 1998).  They need to learn from and about their colleagues. In her book, A life in school:  What the teacher learned, Jane Tompkins (1996) writes movingly of the ways in which academic life tends to isolate both faculty and students from themselves, from each other, and from the world around them.  Yet disciplines and discourse communities overlap, and the educator should make an effort to participate in and foster the community of learners to which he or she belongs (Shulman &amp; Shulman, 2004).  
	
Sadly, many forces militate against the need for teachers to learn broadly and deeply.  The forces of competition, territoriality, and sheer lack of time tend to limit the sources that could enrich teachers' knowledge and improve their teaching.  Minimal professional development and lack of adequate school funding further constrict their opportunities to learn about themselves, their students, and larger cultural and political issues.  However, the forces of globalism, multiculturalism, and technological change mandate that teachers extend the boundaries of their learning beyond the strictures of their discipline and the walls of their classrooms and institutions to encompass the larger world that they must prepare their students to enter.  In this world, where we have the ability to access endless amounts of information with the push of a button, is it not our job as teachers to learn how to filter through this information in order to find the best answers to our questions?  Teachers and students can analyze the validity of data and the soundness of information together.  This collaboration brings real learning to the process and reinforces the role of collaboration as it occurs in the real world. 

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires that high quality professional development be provided for educators.  This would be in hopes of sustaining and supporting high qualified educators.  Borko (2004) identifies that professional development should be begin with these three major components: subject matter knowledge, student thinking, and instructional practices.  She proposes a three phase plan to ensure research can be conducted to see that educators are provided with an appropriate program.  Essentially professional development should begin with a single site.  The program would be evaulated when facilitators then share the program with other schools.  The final evaluation phase would then be to compare the program with other similar programs.  This focused approach to professional development could work to identify and disperse a high quality program system-wide especially when there may be limited opportunities and funds.

==Learners as Teachers==

Just as teachers have had to alter their own methods and shift from being their students’ sole source of knowledge to one of the many sources, students also have had to shift from being passive receptacles of knowledge to active participants and even to being teachers themselves.  Research in the areas of constructivist teaching practices, cooperative learning, and technology have opened new doors and have altered the roles and responsibilities of students today. 

===Learners and Constructivism===
	
In the traditional classroom, teachers stand at the front of the classroom and present the information to the students.  This process is seen as effective because teachers can present an immense amount of information in only a short period of time.  The students are expected to absorb the information that the teacher presents and then recall it later on a test.  Constructivist research has continued to show us how ineffective and inefficient this process is. Research results also found that in classes where teachers focus on imparting knowledge students indicate they are more likely to have a superficial interest in learning that subject. Conversely, when teaching focuses on students and challenging their perceptions, students report a deeper involvement with learning the subject (Trigwell, Prosser, &amp; Waterhouse, 2004). Proponents of constructivism believe that if teachers shift their teaching practices, especially in mathematics and science, test scores will increase.  The constructivist model promotes students as being active participants in the education process.  Instead of sitting back and listening to the information, students must construct their own knowledge through meaningful experiences.  In the constructivist classroom, the students drive the curriculum, focusing on specific topics that they want to study.  One example of how students can accomplish this is through project-based learning.  Students can, individually or in groups, generate questions about a real-world problem, investigate the topic through research, analyze and reflect on their findings, and devise solutions to the problem.  They then can teach the rest of the students in the class, the teacher, and even the rest of the community about their specific topic.  Essentially, they become experts on the topic.  In this style of learning, the students take responsibility for their own learning because they truly are interested in it (Curtis, 2001; Lane, 2007; Marlowe &amp; Page, 2005).

===Class Discussion and Mutual Learning=== 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Another way students become teachers in constructivist classrooms is through discussion.  Class discussions are a central component of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivist_epistemology constructivism] since the focus is on the process of learning instead of the product.  It is not important whether the students get the right answer, what is important is how their thinking evolves.  For example, the math strategy, math talk, is one in which students are given a word problem and asked to solve it.  Then, through a class discussion, the students are encouraged to share and explain their solutions to the problem and justify their reasoning.  The children are able to “gain greater understanding and ownership of mathematical concepts as they develop and express their own ideas” (Houghton Mifflin, n.d.).  Since there are numerous ways to solve any given problem, the students become each other's teachers as they discuss not only their own logic but also the faults of their peers’ logic.  This process is so effective because “hearing and analyzing others’ approaches can supply one with new perspectives; and frequent exposure to different approaches engenders flexible thinking” (Houghton Mifflin, n.d.).  The age of the child does not matter; even kindergarteners can effectively be their peers' teachers during math talk (Kamii, 2000).

===Cooperative Learning Groups===
	
A similar method in the classroom where students become the teachers is the use of cooperative learning groups.  Cooperative learning is characterized by small groups of students grouped together based on different skill levels.  These heterogeneous groups work so efficiently because each student is held accountable for his or her own participation in the group, as well as the group's being held accountable for their overall performance.  Cooperative learning can be used anytime a group needs to work together, whether it be on homework or on completing a class project.  Since students are grouped with each other based on differing ability levels, students with certain strengths are able to coach the students with weaker abilities in a given area.  This coaching, and subsequent teaching, often enables the students to learn a subject better because they are hearing it from a peer’s perspective.  Teachers often approach a topic and attempt to explain it from a level that is much too complex; however, students are often better able to explain a topic because they know where to start.  By working together as a team to help each other accomplish an ultimate goal, each individual uses his or her strength to help coach and teach the others so that everyone ends up learning up to his or her potential (Education Broadcasting Corporation, n.d; Surin, 2006).

===The Teaching Learning Community===

In a world where knowledge and information are abundant and so easily accessible, the roles of teachers and learners are transformed and blended. The walls of the classroom have been extended through new technologies and in this extended classroom roles must adapt. The teacher no longer is the imparter of knowledge and student the passive recipient.  Both become part of a collaborative learning community. In this new way of teaching and learning students are empowered. They become self directed and take responsibility for their own learning. Teachers become mentors, guides, coaches and learners themselves. Through powerful web tools such as blogs and wikis, students and teachers have opportunities to create and contribute to knowledge and share ideas. They now can share ideas and communicate with learners world wide. In doing so, both teacher and learner will see the world differently and learn to appreciate the perspectives of others.  
These new technologies, with which our students are generally quite adept, threaten to widen the divide between teacher and student if teachers are unwilling to become learners and users of technology themselves. As digitally savvy students enter the classroom, teachers have the power to close that gap if they’re willing to extend their learning and teaching for the 21st century.

===Learners and Web 2.0===

[http://www.borg.com/~rjgtoons/images/ed26.gif Here's a funny comic strip about modern technology and its interactions with the education system] 

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

More recently, technology has drastically changed how students learn in and out of the classroom.  Teachers can no longer pretend to have all of the answers because students have an immense amount of knowledge at their fingertips with the internet; more specifically, Web 2.0 enables students to be not only learners but also teachers.  Web 2.0 allows all users not only to post comments, articles, and reports on the internet but also to edit and respond to those articles and reports.  Teachers can use wikis in their classrooms and have groups of students work together or individually to research and become experts on a topic and then post their reports on the internet for all to read and learn from.  This new area of education is allowing all students to become the teachers to not only the students in their classes but to the world.  Any student who is interested and wishes to explore and research a particular topic is able to do so and publish his or her work.  This not only increases the motivation to do a good job, but since anyone can go in and edit the work, it helps students to be flexible and open to new ideas and procedures.  This technology also enables any topic to be approached from multiple perspectives.  Students in the past have grown up learning subjects such as history from only one biased perspective.  Now, individuals will be able to help contribute to online textbooks and add sections about topics that have never before been taught in the public schools.  This technology will revolutionize our education system as it becomes more widely used and accepted (Alexander, 2006; Standen, 2006). 

==Conclusion==
	
Largely as a result of technological change, the forces of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism globalism], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism multiculturalism], and multimodalism have conspired to transform and ultimately enrich the roles of both teacher and learner.  As teachers extend their learning, learners can claim full ownership of their knowledge in the process of teaching it to others.  This results in more effective teachers as well as a greater depth of understanding in students.  This model of mutual learning can reform the educational system from within and help it to realize maximum benefits for both teachers and learners.

== Purposes for New Books ==

The process of creating a new wikibook serves several purposes:

#Enables you, the contributer, to teach a subject that you know.
#Enables other readers to learn the subject, without having to pay the exorbitant prices of textbooks.
#Inspires other wikibookians to contribute to your book, making it a better resource.

It has been said that the best way to learn a subject is to teach it, and so the first point above really is a double-edged sword. Not only can you as the author help other people to learn the subject, but you yourself could gain a better understanding and appreciation for it. 

The second point above is another important one. Traditional printed textbooks are typically very expensive. On top of that is the fact that book publishers tend to create multiple editions of a book, one every couple of years. When a new edition of the book is released, the old versions become obsolete, even if they are more widely available, lower in price, and available used at a discount. Also, because wikibooks are available on the internet, books can be downloaded for free.

== Qualities of a Good Book ==

To do this, a good book needs several qualities:

#A good plan
#Solid infrastructure
#Sharp Focus
#Broad Scope

Without all these things, books will likely become either eternal stubs, candidates for a costly merger, or complete orphans. 

=== A Good Plan ===

A book needs a '''plan''', a '''direction''', a '''purpose'''. We don't need to write books that aren't helpful and informative. We don't need to reinvent any wheels. The best books are going to start out as outlines or plans. One chapter is going to lead into another. The material will be presented in a comprehensible order. 

=== A Solid Infrastructure ===

The book should have a good, solid infrastructure. Readers should be able to navigate the book with ease, and new contributors should know exactly what information should go where. The naming convention should be consistent. A book should also create the necessary custom templates that it needs, and should also find and employ some other templates too.

=== A Sharp Focus ===

A book should have plenty of focus, and not be too broad or vague. A book titled &quot;Physics&quot; is probably not as good as a set of smaller, more defined books such as &quot;Statics&quot;, &quot;Dynamics&quot;, &quot;Electromagnetic Waves&quot;, etc. When readers come to your book, in other words, they should know exactly what material it will contain. Another aspect of this is the fact that Wikibooks represents a complete library, in a sense: We already have books on the fundamentals of science, math, language, etc. Each new book does not need to cover the basics again and again. It is better to do one thing well than to do many things &quot;well&quot;.

=== A Broad Scope ===

Every book needs to have a broad enough scope to cover the topic in full. A book such as &quot;Introduction to subject X&quot; can only cover, by definition, introductory material. By that same note, &quot;Advanced Subject X&quot; by definition only covers those topics that can be considered &quot;advanced&quot;. A book about subject X should not artificially limit itself to only covering a certain aspect of subject X. A book on subject X should cover the whole thing. As an example of scope, consider the method by which university programs generally break the subject of economics into such classes as &quot;Microeconomics&quot;, &quot;Macroeconomics&quot;, et cetera. This division might be well and good for a semester-long classroom environment, but it doesn't make any sense to artificially divide the material up here on Wikibooks. Instead, we should have a single book titled &quot;Economics&quot; that will cover both the macro- and micro- sub-topics.

== Practicality == 

On a note of practicality, these requirements are also prerequisites for a book to become a [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured book]]. Gaining this distinction for your book will help it to expand and grow beyond what you can contribute yourself.</text>

== The Need for a New Book ==

Hopefully your decision to create a new book will be mitigated by a specific need here at Wikibooks. Maybe it's a gaping hole in in our coverage of a specific subject (&quot;I can't believe they don't have a calculus book!&quot;), maybe there are many smaller books on the subject that could be effectively merged into a new monolithic book, or maybe there is a book that's so large and sprawling that it needs to be split into smaller books. Also, before you create a new book here, it is a good idea to ensure that the book is actually right for Wikibooks:
*Is it allowed under [[WB:WIW|policy]]? 
*Is Wikibooks the best wiki to host this material? 
*Will other people be able to contribute to it? 
*Will other readers be able to understand this subject? 
If the answer to all these questions is &quot;yes&quot;, Then you are well on your way to being able to start your project. 

It is important to make sure that your new book is actually a valuable resource. We may not currently have a book about &quot;How to alphabetically arrange your wine bottle collection&quot;, but do we really need a book on that topic to begin with?

Finally, is this information that you are willing to write about&amp;mdash;in large quantities&amp;mdash;for a period of weeks, months, or even years? A Wikibook is a large project, and creating a good Wikibook requires strong drive, direction, and countless contributions from yourself and other users. A new Wikibook is a big deal, and you shouldn't start a new book if you aren't willing to invest the necessary time and energy into it.

== Target Audience ==

Implicitly, if there is a need for your book, then there is somebody who needs it. This vague ''somebody'' is your '''target audience''', and is who you are writing your book for. Because you are writing a textbook, your target audience will most likely be school students. However, even under the banner of &quot;school students&quot; there are a number of different classifications that are worth considering. Students can be separated by age: young children (the target audience of [[Wikijunior]]), Highschool students, University Students, and Professionals (The target audience of [[Wikiprofessional]]). Some subjects are not conducive to certain target audience, in the same way that certain styles of writing are not good for a target audience. For instance, we aren't going to attempt to teach young children about &quot;SPARC Assembly Programming&quot;. We also aren't going to try and write a children's book using big words and complicated sentences.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Use templates like {{tlx|Reading level}} on your book to give important information like this}}

Under the sub-heading of &quot;University Students&quot; also, there is a difference between different types of students. There is a distinct difference in the way a single subject can be taught between different groups of students: Statistics is taught differently between business majors (where it is taught predominantly using algebra), and mathematics students (where it is taught predominantly using calculus). Engineers generally like to learn the bottom line, while mathematicians might prefer to learn the derivations and proofs.

When considering this, there are multiple ways to go about creating a new book for your subject. Either you can make a book tailored specifically towards a single target audience (&quot;Statistics for Mathematicians&quot;), or you can make a single book (&quot;Statistics&quot;) That will consider the topic from multiple angles. For instance, you can separate the book into 2 distinct sections (one for business readers, and one for mathematics readers), or you can separate each individual page into the different sections (one section for the algebraic formulas and results, and a bottom section for the calculus derivations). I generally prefer the last option, where we can write a single book, and separate out the individual pages into the &quot;basic concepts&quot; and &quot;Advanced concepts&quot; topics. This way, everybody can read (and contribute to) the same book, but people can pick and choose which sections to read for themselves. 

In general, when we consider that the book at large can be created without considering the target audience, and that the sub-pages are created with consideration for the target audience, you the creator don't need to worry about audience until after the book is introduced. Knowing however that there is a disparity between the different types of information, it is a good idea to consider different methodologies for a particular subject when you are doing your research for the book.

== Prerequisites ==

Do not hesitate to lay down a set of necessary prerequisites that your readers must have before they attempt to read your book. Requiring a standard background among all readers makes the job of the author easier: no need to review necessary material, and no need to define common terms. When possible, link to other Wikibooks that cover the necessary material. Also, if the prerequisites of your book change as the narrative progresses (progressively harder mathematics, for instance), don't hesitate to mention that students need to refresh a particular subject before continuing on. 

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Use {{tlx|Prerequisite}} and {{tlx|Corequisite}} to show where your book lies in the learning hierarchy}}

On a related note, mention precisely what your book serves as a prerequisite for. That is, if your book sets a student up to read another more advanced book, you should mention that. If there are no other books available here on Wikibooks you can point the reader to external references for a continued study. As an author, you should also consider authoring the more advanced book, if one does not exist.</text>

There are a number of problems that need to be considered, that many people don't always take account for. 

== Being Bold ==

Not everybody who comes to Wikibooks is comfortable '''being bold''', and making all sorts of gigantic changes, additions, deletion, etc. If a book is poorly structured, it is foolish to think that anybody in the future is going to come in and make it better. It is unlikely that once a mistake is made, that it will ever be corrected. This is especially true of larger mistakes, because people will be less willing to undertake the effort to fix it. Wikibooks is home to over 3000 separate books. Even if we have 3000 active editors at any time, it is unlikely that any particular book will have even 1 regular contributor. Some books are very large, and they get that way by drawing a disproportionately large crowd of editors from the pool. If there are 1000 editors, there are probably going to be 9 editors each on the 100 biggest books, which leaves only 100 editors to manage the other 2900 books. To illustrate this fact, I am currently the primary contributor on nearly two dozen books (not the only contributor, certainly, but the most active) While other popular books can draw two dozen regular contributors to their pages. 

Beyond sheer numbers, I must reiterate that not everybody is a project leader. If every editor who came to Wikibooks, even for a short period of time, were bold and made a significant change here, Wikibooks would be far better off. If a new editor found a book, renamed all the pages to have better names, fixed the TOC to be more helpful, and created a print version, more books would draw more editors. But, alas, this is not the case. The average editor simply isn't going to make big changes, isn't going to make big contributions, and isn't going to come back in the future to see if those changes get made at all. It is paramount, therefore, that new books be started off on the right foot, to inspire confidence among readers that ''the book is going somewhere'', that ''somebody cares'', and that this is a project worth getting involved in.

== Having a Plan ==

When an author creates a new book, they typically have a plan in mind as to what the book will contain, and what direction the book will take. However, if this information isn't written down, and the author disappears, future authors will be confused and may ultimately avoid editing that book. If you have a plan for your book, make sure to write it down so that future editors know what your intentions are. If people have a plan to follow, they will be more likely to contribute to your book, and less likely to go off on a tangent that will reduce the quality of the book. Here are a few things that should be included in a good book-writing plan:

#The need behind the book (why you are making it in the first place)
#The definition of the book (scope, target audience, etc)
#Background and prerequisites
#Integrating your book with other books.

=== The Need ===

We've already discussed the need for a new book. However, when writing your plan it is a good idea to write down your rationale for why you want to write your book. This can be a good idea, so that as your planning progresses, you can double check that you are actually working towards your goals.

=== The Definition ===

Again, we have already discussed the definition of a book. We should always write down the book's definition explicitly, especially during the planning stages, so that you (and any helpers that you have) can ensure to keep all your work focused on that definition. If you add items to your outline that don't meet the book's definition, you should delete them, etc.

=== Background and Prerequisites ===

If you write down the necessary background and prerequisites for your book directly on the planning pages, you can ensure that everybody who reads your outline will be on the same page. Also, it can help you fight the urge to try and explain things again that your target audience should already know.

=== Integrating your Book ===

Your book is not always going to be a stand-alone resource, but instead will be interdependant on all the other books here at wikibooks. Other books may cite your book as a reference, and your book may cite other books as well. You can use existing books as a prerequisite for your new book, to help take care of our prerequsite problem easily. Also, your book may absorb and be merged with other pre-existing books, book stubs, and lone pages. It is a good idea to write down in your plan all existing pages and books that could have an effect on your new book. Make sure you differentiate between prerequisite books, reference books, and books that could possibly be merged into your new book. This way, when your new book is introduced to a bookshelf, you can have an organized plan as to what needs to be merged where, and what links need to be added to what books.

== A New Plan ==

When creating a new planning page, this code stub can be used to ensure you fill in all the necessary information:

 This is a planning page, not a book!
 == My Plan ==
 (discuss here why you want to create the book, the need, the definition, the prerequisites, etc)
 == Intended Table of Contents ==
 (draft your book's table of contents here.
 == Resources ==
 (list books that will be useful as resources here, including prerequisites)
 == Existing Pages ==
 (list pages here that might be merged into your new book here)

== Presentation: Following NPOV and NOR ==

The principles of '''Neutral-Point of View''' (NPOV) and '''No Original Research''' (NOR) are as fundamental to Wikibooks as they are to other Wikimedia projects. However, unlike other projects, these issues are not as strictly codified on Wikibooks. 

Here are a few points to make:
#Presenting known information in new, original, or novel ways does not constitute original research. Material, so long as that material is verifiable and unoriginal, may be presented in ways never seen before.
#The restriction of the scope of a book to a particular subset of information does not necessarily constitute a POV bias. The exclusion of certain lessons that are properly superseded by better lessons, or the exclusion of materials that are tangent to the prime narrative of the book, is acceptable.  However, material may not be added to purposefully promote it, and material may not be excluded to purposefully obscure it. When multiple sets of possibly-conflicting information are available but not all included, it is always good to leave a note about ''why'' the book has chosen to include or exclude certain materials. 
#The choice to use particular vocabulary or language in a book does not represent a bias.
#The use of new or original terms, descriptions, explanations, or demonstrations, does not represent original research ''unless'' it is the intent of the book to popularize those terms, descriptions, explanations, or demonstrations. The goals of a Wikibooks textbook are to provide information to students, and not to set a precedence among educators.

These are all just rough guidelines, of course. If you have any questions about these, and would like clarification, you can ask a message about it at the [[WB:CHAT|Reading Room]].</text>

There are a number of steps that I follow when I create a new book. In general, this is the list:

# Research the topic
# Create Outline
# Gather Resources
# Create Title
# Introduce Book

I will expand on each of these steps below.

== Research the topic ==

It is impossible to create a new wikibook, if you (the first author) don't have a solid understanding of the material. Keep in mind, you don't need to have knowledge of just a single specific subject, but you also need to understand the various periphery subjects that are going to be related to your book. Also, you will need to know where your book is headed: what are the advanced topics that are related to your subject. Any given book should have a complete set of introductory material, practical material, and advanced material, if you expect the book to attract contributors and readers. If your book attracts neither group of people it is a wasted book.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Research your topic first}}
{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Know what material you want to cover and what you need to cover}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example:As an example, I recently started a book on [[Semiconductors]]. When instituting my book, I could easily have neglected a number of topics that I eventually included: Op-Amps, Photo-Transistors, Rectifiers, etc. However, in my research I realized that these topics were closely related, and many existing books on the topic of semiconductors included material (at least in an appendix) on op-amps, rectifiers, etc. Also, when writing a book on semiconductors, I could easily have chosen to restrict my book to simply silicon semi-conductors. However, there are a number of different materials that share the same properties: Gallium Arsenide is a good example. Also, things such as vacuum tubes share similar properties, and therefore can be mentioned as well, if only in an appendix.}}

For many school and university students, there is a strong impetus to create books based on your current and past coursework. This is both a good idea and a bad idea depending on how it is implemented. First off, college courses are limited by time and space constraints. The course must satisfy a set syllabus and calendar cycle. Also, school textbooks are highly limited in many aspects: the number of pages that a textbook can be is often limited by price factors, and manufacturing/printing capacity. Classes rarely conform exactly to the material that is provided in an average textbook, either the class teaches more material than the text covers, or the text covers far more material than the class can cover. Also, when considering textbooks, there is a tendency for authors to discuss unrelated materials. The last several chapters in most books are reserved for a brief summary of advanced material.  Also, the first several chapters may contain primers and refresher material that is already available on wikibooks. No sense explaining the fundamentals of algebra in every new book, we have only to link to the relevant work on the mathematics bookshelf.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Don't base your book entirely on an existing book or a class. Neither will be right for you and your book}}

Keep in mind that some classes can sample a wide variety of topics (I had a physics class that covered electric circuits, light, gravity, and internal combustion engines, for example), while other classes may only be able to cover a small portion of another subject. As a good example, university programs usually split integral and derivative calculus into 3 or 4 separate classes. Basing a wikibook on such a model will create books that either have too little focus, or too little scope. When basing a book off previous and current coursework, make sure to combine together related material from multiple classes, ignore unrelated material, and find out what advanced topics may be learned in future classes. Even if you can't write intelligently on some topics, that doesn't mean that you can't include the topic in your new book.

== Create Outline ==

The most important step that I take when creating a new book (and the step that generally takes the longest for me) is creating an initial outline. The outline provides focus to your new book by determining what subjects you want to write about, but it also helps you to get your material into order. If you create a book, and then you decide that you don't like the page layout, or that you want things in a different order, or that you want to merge subjects or fork subjects into different pages, then the task becomes significantly harder.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Plan ahead. A little time spent early saves a lot of time spent later}}

A general rule of thumb that I follow is to only create a sub-page if you can populate that subpage with at least 4 headings. Granted, this isn't a hard and fast rule, and there are definitely instances where this might not be appropriate, but it serves as a good guideline. As a matter of practicality, having 4 headings on a page means that the page will automatically generate a table of contents. Notice that this includes sub-headings too, so if you have a lot to write about but only have 3 major headings on the page, you should be able to divide one of those up into subheadings.

I prefer a flat naming scheme for creating my own books. This means that instead of having pages like &quot;Circuit Theory/Circuit Components/Resistors/Ohms Law&quot;, we can have a single page called &quot;Circuit Theory/Resistance&quot; to cover all related material, and then make multiple top-level pages. Also, having shorter links helps on your fingers, especially when you have been typing away on your new book all day long.

Also, I never use a title page as a landing page, opting instead to link directly to the table of contents. That way, readers don't need to click an additional link to find out what a book contains, and it is easier for contributors to link directly back to the table of contents. As such, I usually include a small preface or introduction paragraph, The table of contents itself, and then a third section for further reading, extra resources, external links, etc. If you want a title page, include it separately.

On my outline, I generally separate the table of contents down into a number of different sections. Each section will contain a set of related pages and topics. I don't create a new section on the TOC unless I have at least 2 pages that can fit in it, and generally I prefer having at least 4 pages or more for each section. My thinking here, is that if you don't have enough to write about a set of topics, then those topics aren't important enough to warrant their own section in the TOC. Here is a simple framework example:

{{TextBox|
*Introduction
*Table of contents 
**Section 1: Basics 
***Page 1
***Page 2
***Page 3
**Section 2: Middle
***Page 4
**Section 3: Advanced
***Page 5
***Page 6
***Page 7
***Page 8
***Page 9
*Further Reading
}}

Now, in that example above, there is either no reason to have a separate section for &quot;middle&quot;, or else we can reclassify some of the pages under &quot;Advanced&quot;, to balance out the number of sections. If we use a flat naming scheme, this becomes even more dynamic, because we can move pages into different sections after the book has already been introduced, simply by moving a link on the page.

Also, when you are working on your outline, it is a good time to think about book navigation. How will you get from place to place in your book? will you be relying on the automatic backlinks, or will you be providing navigation links? If you want to have links, are you going to write them all out, or are you going to create a navigation template. As the creator of a book, and as the initial contributor, you need to lay a good foundation for your book so that other people will be able to come in and contribute to your book with a minimum of hassle.

Finally, the most important aspect of the outline is to get feedback. Contact other users, especially users who you think might be knowledgable in the subject, and ask them to comment/edit your outline. Feel free to make explanatory notes right on the page. Remember, this is just an outline, not yet a book. Get some input so that you can ensure that your book is good enough, well formed, well-planned, and will be able to attract contributors.

== Gather Resources ==

It is important to have at least one external resource at your disposal when writing a new book. This is important for several reasons. First, material that you write in your new book can be referenced and validated by including a citation to the external resource. Second, having a physical book, or an ebook at your disposal on the same subject enables you to &quot;borrow&quot; the layout of the various topics. This can be a big help when you are creating your outline. 

Also, you should do a wiki search on other wikimedia projects, to find related articles and books. On the bright side, if you can find a stub or a half-book that is in a state of disrepair on the same subject as your new book, can can merge them together. This will save you plenty of work and writing along the way. 

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|You can't have too much information at your fingertips when you are trying to write a book}}

A rule that I follow (and many other contributors can disagree) is that books should be simply named. This means that a book title should be descriptive enough to identify your given subject, but also easy enough that newcomers can find it and (hopefully) contribute. Also, we need to remember that &quot;[[WB:WIW|Wikibooks isn't paper]]&quot;, a guideline that many people ignore. Let's say that we have the following books on our bookshelf:

*Introduction to Control Engineering
*Chemical and Mechanical and Electrical Process Control
*Advanced Process Control with Examples
*Mechnical Control Units Design and Analysis
*Mathematical Control Engineering
...

As we can see from the above list, all these books are on the same general subject, and each of them is so hard to find that a new contributor is likely to create their own new book, and not contribute to any of the existing books. Consider, a new user comes to Wikibooks and types in &quot;Control System&quot; into the search, and gets no results. Or, they do get some results with long titles, and a low relevancy statistic. Below the banner that says the &quot;Control System&quot; book could not be found is a little red link that says &quot;you can create this page&quot;. Voila! there is now another book on this same topic, and this new user is going to start reinventing the wheel.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|You want people to be able to find your book. Simple titles help. Stealing redirects is better}}

Also, even if a new user finds one of these existing books, it may turn out that the existing list of chapters and the table of contents is too restrictive, and then the new user either needs to cram his additional information into this old book (which is like cramming a round peg into a square hole), or they need to start their own book, with a similar restrictive focus, to account for the new material. Neither of these solutions are good.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|New contributors are easily discouraged. If your book requires too much work, they won't work on it.}}

Researching on Wikibooks can acquaint you with a number of these half-books, some stubs, some books that are poorly named, or books that are poorly laid-out. When you create your new book, you can merge all of these information resources together, under a single easy-to-find page title.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|If an existing book is in bad shape and is abandoned, you should feel free to recycle that content into a newer, better book}}

== Create Title ==

As was alluded to above, the title of the book is one of the single most important factors as to whether your book will sink or swim. If you can't find your book in a search, or if the title is so long and complicated that people cant understand it, or if the title is so long that contributors don't waste the effort adding links to your book, then it is in trouble. Titles should specifically tell what your book is about, without ambiguity or confusion. Also, your book title should not immediately alienate any potential readers or contributors. 

Here are some hard and fast rules that I follow, and that I think make good sense for the rest of the community.

#Avoid qualitative additions such as &quot;Introduction to...&quot;, &quot;Advanced...&quot;, &quot;Survey of...&quot;, &quot;...For Engineers&quot;, &quot;...For scientists&quot;, &quot;...for dummies&quot;, &quot;...basics&quot;, etc. These additions in your title make your book harder to find, and they narrow down your pool of interested contributors. If you figure that a given contributor only really has the time and effort to contribute to one book on a given subject, then it doesn't make sense to make people choose between &quot;Advanced Circuit Theory&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Circuit Theory&quot;, and &quot;Circuit Theory 2&quot;. Some contributors may be intimidated by the qualifier &quot;Advanced...&quot;, in the same way that some contributors may balk at a book &quot;...for dummies&quot;. Adding qualifiers only serves to reduce the pool of potential readers and contributors.
#Drop useless words. Consider the titles &quot;Understanding Digital Circuits&quot;, &quot;Learning Digital Circuits&quot;, &quot;Digital Circuits by Example&quot;, etc. All of these books are about Digital Circuits, but they add useless words to the title. These additional words make the titles longer, harder to search for, etc. Also, if you delineate your book in such a fashion, it will provide an impetus for other contributors to create their own books to approach the subject from a different direction. If you create a book called &quot;Digital Circuits by Example&quot;, it is possible (albeit improbable) that another user could create a book called &quot;Digital Circuits with No Examples&quot;. Don't set your book up to be just one possible alternative. Make your book the definitive resource on your topic.
#Don't be too specific, but also don't be too vague. A title such as &quot;Embedded Systems using FPGAs&quot; eliminates all possible material that doesn't involve embedded systems and FPGAs, and therefore will provide impetus for a new book such as &quot;Embedded Systems using Microcontrollers&quot;, &quot;Embedded Systems using Microchip PIC Controllers&quot;, etc. Also, a name as vague as &quot;Embedded&quot;, even if it is on the CS or EE bookshelf is simply not enough. There is no need to have multiple books on the various aspects of embedded systems, we only need one book to cover the entire subject.
#Don't say in 3 words what can be said in 1. Don't name your book &quot;Semiconductor Physics&quot;, or &quot;The Physics and Principles and Uses of Semiconductors&quot;, when the same material can be covered by a book titled &quot;Semiconductors&quot;. Again, this makes your book easier to find, and it increases the number of people who will potentially contribute to your book. 
#Avoid combinations. In general, we shouldn't use the word &quot;and&quot; in a book title to combine two different topics. When possible we should try to find a single term that covers everything. Instead of &quot;Control Theory and Control Hardware&quot;, consider instead the more direct title, &quot;Control Systems&quot;. This blanket term covers both of the other terms, and at the same time maintains the focus on control.
#Don't use pseudo-namespaces. This is a big issue over on the CS bookshelf, and I personally don't like it. In general, people won't be searching wiki for &quot;Programming:Assembly&quot;, they will simply type in &quot;Assembly Language&quot;. Remember, you want people, '''especially people who aren't familiar with the wikibooks bookshelf organization''', to be able to find your book. 
#Under no circumstances should you name your book something proprietary, or something that makes no sense outside a small target audience. For example, do not name your book after a particular class from your university: &quot;EEng 321: Semiconductor systems and analysis&quot;. The qualifier &quot;EEng 321:&quot; makes no sense to people outside your particular university, and therefore other people will not want to contribute. Also, associating a given book with a particular class taught at a particular university limits the possible content of that book to the content taught in that class. 
#By the same rationale, don't intend to break up books in the same way that the material might be broken down in one of your classrooms. College programs, due to time and space constraints, break down subjects into &quot;Physics 1&quot; and &quot;Physics 2&quot;. A wikibook does not need to be the perfect size and shape to exactly fit a 1 semester course. For example, I created the [[Communication Systems]] book from a combination of coursework that I took, including classes titled &quot;Analog and Digital Communications&quot;, &quot;Telecommunications&quot;, and &quot;Communication Networks&quot;. Other books, such as an outline that I am currently working on for &quot;Analog and Digital Conversion&quot;, are subjects that I've expanded from individual sections in a class: it didn't even take a whole semester! Wikibooks isn't paper, and it also shouldn't be constrained by time or space issues. 
#Use title caps. This is not Wikipedia, we do not have to name things according to their conventions. Here at Wikibooks, we are creating entire books, not articles, and therefore we should title them like books. Use title caps, to signify that your book is an entire book, and not just an encyclopedia article. Title caps are the capitalization of all the important words in the title, such as &quot;A Book About Stuff&quot;, instead of &quot;A book about stuff&quot;. 

These rules may seem like a lot, but they are designed to make book titles informative, helpful, and succinct.

== Introduce Book ==

When it is time to introduce your book, there are a number of sub-steps:

=== Find the Right Place ===

If you have created your new book in your user namespace, you will need to move it to the main module namespace. For instance, if your book is titled &quot;User:MyUserName/My Book&quot;, you would want to move it to &quot;My Book&quot;. Likewise, all pages with names &quot;User:MyUserName/My Book/Page&quot; should be moved to &quot;My Book/Page&quot;. If you didn't create the page in your user namespace, type the new title (making sure to use proper spelling and capitalization) into the [[Special:Search|searchbox]]. This will take you to the new page (or it will give you a red link to click on, which will take you to the new page), where you can start uploading your content.

Make sure that you don't overwrite anything that is already existing. Double-check that you aren't deleting another persons work.

=== Advertise ===

Advertising your book is quick and easy using the comprehensive category system at Wikibooks. To add a new book you don't need to edit any pages except for your book. When you first create a new book, add {{tlx|New book}} to the top. This will alert people that your book is new, and it will automatically include the book in the new books list that appears on many pages.

You also need to think about properly categorizing your book. To do this, add the {{tlx|Subject}} template to your book (top or bottom of page). To figure out what subject category your book belongs in, you can browse the list at [[Subject:All Subjects]], or you can ask the experts at [[WB:SLN|New Books Staff Lounge]].

=== Absorb Stubs ===

When you introduce your book, go around to all those other half-books, stub books, and malformed books, and post notices that you intend to merge them into your new book, or that you intend to delete them outright (as inferior forks of the new book). If available, contact the major contributors from the other books, and let them know what is happening: You created a new book with X Y Z design objectives, you feel that the new book is superior in terms of planning layout and potential, and you feel that their book should be merged into yours, etc. Also, invite them to come in and help out with your new book. Often times, people are more enthusiastic about helping a large project, than having to deal with administering and supervising their own.

=== Find Contributors ===

I generally do a quick search of the User: namespace, to find other contributors who list the subject of your book as a topic of interest. Extend a personal invitation for these other users to contribute as well.

Once you have invited other contributors to help, look around Wikibooks for books on related topics. Related books are perfect places to link your book, and this will help increase traffic. For instance, the book &quot;Robotics&quot; would definitely benefit from links to books such as &quot;Embedded Systems&quot;, &quot;Digital Circuits&quot;, &quot;Mechanics&quot;, etc. This way, the people at &quot;Robotics&quot; don't need to explain all these subjects, they can use your book as a stepping stone. Don't forget to list your book at Wikiversity as well.

An additional step that can be taken is to explore the list of requested wikibooks, and see if anybody has requested a wikibook on the subject of your new book. If there is a pending request on your subject, strike it out, and post a link to your new book. If a registered user made such a request, send him a note about your new book, and invite him to help out.</text>

== Outline the Book ==

When I decide to create a new book, I generally create a new page in my user namespace to host the outline first. Then, I will begin some preliminary research (looking up the topic on the web, finding related books in a library). From my preliminary research (which generally only takes a few hours or so, initially), I create my first outline.

I try to host a particular outline on my user page for at least one month (and I have some that have been in the works for nearly a year or more). I try not to introduce books any more frequently than one per month, although when I am between semesters, or when I have a lot of time off, I can speed up the process considerably. It is important to note that getting a new book up and running is a time-consuming process. Just laying the necessary ground work, without adding any content can take an hour or more of your time. At least, that's if you want to do it right.

In the time that your outline is being hosted on your user page, it is a good idea that you post notes in related Wikibooks, and on the user pages, to try and get feedback for your outline. Sometimes however, there is no feedback to be had, so it is up to you to make sure the book is in good condition.

== Introducing the Book ==

Once I am satisfied with my outline, and I have set aside enough time to actually implement the book, I introduce the book. In an initial flurry of activity, I can usually get the book set up, posted on the main page and shelved on a bookshelf. I can also create a few basic sub pages, an introductory page, a basic list of references, etc. In the weeks that follow, I will contribute to the book significantly. After about a month, I contribute to the new book about as frequently as I do to any other book. 

I like to plan out when I introduce new books, and follow the plan pretty strictly. I try to give myself about 1 month between new books, dependent on the amount of time and energy I have to contribute. If I only am creating new books, then I don't have time to contribute to old books, and that's not a good situation at all. For this reason, I try to keep new book introductions spread out.

== Growing the Book ==

When a book has been introduced, it needs to grow. Some of the basic navigation templates should be created and implemented quickly, and they can be expanded later if needed to be more complicated. Pages should be created and filled with bullets, if nothing else. A LMOS should be created, especially if there are &quot;quirks&quot; about your book that you would like other authors to adhere to.

In many instances, material can be imported from wikipedia, or images can be found on commons that can be used in your books. Initially, it can be easy enough to simply import a wikipedia article, or to link to a bunch of images on commons. However when the initial work is completed and the form of the book is set, you can go back and integrate these materials into your narrative in a clean way.

Don't forget to dewikify any pages that you import from wikipedia, and if you do a copy+paste move, you should give attribution to wikipedia (and preferrably a link to the source) in the edit summary, the page itself, or the talk page.

== Maintaining the Book ==

Once the form of the book is set, we start the final phase of the book creation process, which is maintenance. We don't want to maintain the book as it is, we want to maintain the ''growth of the book''. The ultimate goals of a book should be:

#To be [[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured]].
#To have a presentable printable and PDF version of the book.
#To be distributed, read, and used for learning by other people.

Once your book is created, you can work towards all of these goals by adding content, improving the quality of your pages (including formatting), and by making lots and lots of small improvements.

== Development Stages ==

There is no single cannonical way to interpret the development {{tlx|stage}} or {{tlx|stage short}} templates, but this is a good way that is even and honest:

:[[File:00%.svg]] &amp;mdash; Book is a stub, contains little or no contents. Main page consists of either a paragraph or an outline with red links.
:[[Image:25%.png]] &amp;mdash; Book is expanding. New pages are being created, the TOC is being expanded and reordered. Many pages are stubs or contain very little content.
:[[Image:50%.png]] &amp;mdash; The basic TOC has been finalized, although more new chapters are added occasionally. Many pages contain significant text content, or image content, but are not integrated. Pages frequently are not properly formatted.
:[[Image:75%.png]] &amp;mdash; Book pages contain significant content, including images and other media, proper formatting, and templates. Some book-specific templates are being designed and implemented, including inter-page navigation. Book has a printable version, and possibly a PDF version. 
:[[Image:100%.png]] &amp;mdash; Book pages contain good content, including multimedia, example problems, explanations, etc. Book has a printable version and a PDF version, and possibly sub-versions of each. Book has significant meta pages including LMOS and support pages for new contributors. Book has a cover page, listings of resources, and proper notices of GFDL content.

I recommend against using development stages on individual pages, because it can take more work to update all the different stages, and all too often these stages are neglected and become out of date. Also, I recommend using the {{tlx|stage short}} template instead of the {{tlx|stage}} template, because people tend not to update the date in the latter template, which also leads to confusion.</text>

== Monolithic Books ==

Sometimes a new book is best formatted as a monolithic book (a single, large page), and some books are better served being broken up into multiple subpages. If you choose to make your book into a monolithic book, you can use your original outline as the list of headings for your page. If you want to break your book into subpages, the outline can be treated as a list of subpages to create, and a list of headings to put on each subpage. Even if your book starts off relatively small, it might become bigger in the future. It is often a good idea, therefore, not to create your books as monolithic structures, but instead to break them up into subpages in anticipation of future expansion. A little forethought can go a long way.

=== Starting Point: Single Page ===

It's natural to start creating a new book as a single page, simultaneously adding content and structure as you go. Many books start out this way, and as the format of the book takes shape, the content could optionally be broken into subpages in a logical way. This very book was started as a single page, and was later broken up into subpages when it became too long.

=== Benefits Of Single Page Formats ===

Single page books are nice for small books. They reduce the need to navigate between pages to continue reading, and they also serve as a printable version without having to create a new print version page.

== Creating Subpages ==

As a book gets larger, it's often unwieldy and unreasonable to keep the page as a single page. Large pages also put a larger strain on the server software, which can have a negative effect on the entire community. 

As a matter of practical significance, books that are in a single-page format are less likely to be considered to be [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured]] by the community. Several books have been voted against because they are large single-page books.

=== Considerations ===

Breaking a book into subpages can be difficult for a number of reasons. Copy+paste moves of content between pages can disrupt the history logs, which puts a strain on people who are looking for a particular edit. Also, pages need inter-page navigation, which can be tricky to put together, especially if the page order is not set in stone. Multiple pages also frequently benefit from categorization, a subject that we cover in another chapter.

On the other side of the coin, creating a single large page and then later breaking it into subpages can help to keep you organized while you write. Also, if you don't have a definite plan for your book, you will have to worry about constantly reorganizing and moving content between various pages. If you start out as one large page, you can find the logical break-points in the work and create subpages from that.</text>

      <comment>/* Peripheral Topics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/New Book Page}}

== Appendices ==

What differentiates a wikibook from a wikipedia article, besides relative length, is the fact that a book generally has a flow from subject to subject, an organization structure of related ideas, and a general progression. Books frequently go forward in a linear manner, with basic subjects being taught in the beginning, progressing to the advanced subjects that appear towards the end. However, in a book, there are frequently subjects that don't fit into this nice linear progression, or reference material that is best utilized by reading it in parallel with other topics in your book. This information can be included best in appendices, at the end of your table of contents. 

I find it is frequently helpful to create a template for your book that will post automatic links to the relevant appendix page(s). I generally implement such a template as a floating box on the right-hand side of the page that states something to the effect of &quot;There is more information about this subject in the appendix&quot; or &quot;There are related reference materials in the appendix&quot;. 

Since appendix materials are located outside of the main book progression, you really dont need to agonize over them when creating your outline. Frequently, appendix materials are already created in stub books that your new book will gobble up.

== Peripheral Topics ==

Frequently you will find material that sort-of fits into your book, but it certainly doesn't belong anywhere else, but at the same time isn't worthy of deletion. Such things like historical notes, tangent subjects, etc can be included in additional appendix and &quot;further reading&quot; pages. Since these aren't references that are useful for following the main progression of your book, they aren't called appendices. Peripheral pages consists of materials that maybe don't strictly &quot;belong&quot; in your book, but are interesting enough not to be deleted outright. Also, such tangents can enhance the learning experience of some readers. 

For example, in the [[Communication Systems]] book that I created, there are some tables (lists of frequencies, lists of Fourier transforms, etc) that are useful resources for the main progression and therefore are appendices. There is other information that I found in a stub book that I merged on the life and history of Claude Shannon. This material wasn't necessarily part of the main progression of the book, but it was well-enough written and informative enough that it didn't deserve deletion. I posted it in an extra page, and made a link to it from the appropriate places.</text>

== Formatting ==

Once a new book is created, the issue about how to format the book is raised. I personally think that the book should use a minimal amount of formatting when it is first created because a new book is subject to far more alterations than a large, well-established book is. In the first few months your book is going to undergo many changes, if not at your hands, then at the hands of the other contributors. As such, it doesn't make sense to format your book rigidly, or to expect other contributors to use large blocks of boiler-plate code for each new page, or each new section. To make a book look good, it should be consistent. Each page should use the same navigation scheme, and therefore navigation is probably best handled by a template. If you want to add cool formatting and all sorts of special tables and CSS markup to your page, I suggest making a single template page or example page, and then apply the markup to the rest of the pages after they have been established.

== Local Manual of Style ==

I find that it's a good idea to post a list of all templates that are specifically designed for your book. I personally put this list on the talk page of the main page of the book. This way, new contributors can read about the various templates and will be able to contribute to the book more effectively.

Another option is to establish a [[WB:LMOS|Local manual of style]] (LMOS), which is essentially a guideline for all contributors to follow. A LMOS can help to prevent arguments and disputes further down the line, as more contributors join the project. 

== Formatting Templates ==

There are a number of templates available for adding specially formatted text and other objects to your text. It is generally preferable to use a pre-made template than to create an entirely new template for your book. Many of the general templates have been parameterized so that their look and style can be altered to suit your book. If you don't find a template that you want to use, you can consider making your own. However, make sure that all the contributors to your book know about these templates and how to use them properly. This usually requires the creation of template documentation, which can be costly in terms of time.

== Navigation Links ==

I am on the fence about putting &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; navigation page links in the page-header template, if one is used. Keep in mind that this can be a tedious process for new pages, because links need to be altered when a new page is added, and you need to make sure that no pages are left out of &quot;the loop.&quot; I do like the idea of using optional parameters in a template to optionally add forward and backward links, if needed. However, adding optional links is difficult for new users to master, and therefore can probably just be ignored for a new book. 

== Conclusion ==

Again, this is the most important point: New books should refrain from having a lot of formatting, templates, or boiler-plate code. New books will undergo heavy editing, reconfiguring, and even reformatting before they are well established. The biggest rule that people should take with them is: '''Work on content first, Formatting later'''.</text>

== Categorizing ==

Another point that is worth mentioning is that a new book should be properly categorized. Categorizing a book properly won't help attract as much attention as listing it on the main page, or putting it on an appropriate bookshelf, but having things neatly and correctly categorized will help to give your book the professional &quot;look and feel&quot; that is the hallmark of a good and stable book here on wikibooks.

Categorizing a book on Wikibooks can be very easy. The most important thing to determine is what subject your book belongs to. Go to [[Subject:All Subjects]] and read through the list of currently existing subjects. If you find one that your book fits into, you are well on your way. If you can't find a good one for your book, ask about it at [[WB:SLN|The New Books Staff Lounge]]. If other wikibookians can't find a proper category for your book (and they usually can), a new one can be created.

Categorizing your book is simple, and requires only a few short steps.

== Categorization Templates ==

There are a few important categorization templates that, if used properly, can help to categorize your new book properly without needing to deal with the technical details of page categorization. 

=== Subject ===

The most important categorization template that your book can use is the {{tlx|Subject}} template. This template lists books by subject, and helps to ensure that the books are properly listed in the [[Subject:All Subjects|Subject Pages]].

To list your book with the {{tlx|Subject}} template, check the list at [[Subject:All Subjects]], and pick the subject that best describes your book. Use the template with this subject. For instance, if your book was about mathematics you would write {{tlx|Subject|Mathematics}}. The subject template can be used with multiple subjects, especially if your book does not fit into any one particular subject very well.

In general, avoid creating a new subject tag unless your book absolutely doesn't fit in anywhere else. Ask for help at [[WB:SLN|the new books chat]] or the [[WB:PROJECT|project chat room]] for help in creating a new subject page, if you don't know how to do it.

=== Alphabetical ===

List your book in the alphabetical listing. To do this, use the {{tlx|Alphabetical}} template, using the first letter of the book as the first argument. For example, use {{tlx|Alphabetical|R}} if your book starts with R.

=== Prerequisites and Corequisites ===

Many books have prerequisite topics that readers should be familiar with before they start reading. Use the {{tlx|Prerequisite}} and {{tlx|Corequisite}} templates on your book to specify these types of relationships.

=== Reading Level === 

Books tend to fit into a specific reading level. This is determined by the age and education levels of the target audience. Use the {{tlx|Reading level}} template to specify which reading level a particular book uses. See [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels]] for an explanation of the various levels in use.

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/New Book Page}}

== Naming Conventions ==

It is important at the offset of a new book for the originial contributor to pick a naming scheme and to stick to it. I am a strong advocate of the &quot;Forward Slash&quot; convention, and I also am an advocate of a flat naming scheme. Granted, there are other ways to name a book, but pick one and stick to it.

== Template Names ==

Make sure that all the book-specific templates that you use in your book have the title of your book in the name of the template. This will help ensure that other people don't try to hijack your templates, and it will also ensure that you won't be taking away template space from other projects. Instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Page Header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, use something like {{tl|Signals and Systems Page}}.

Templates that are used in the book should be named either: &quot;Template:&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;/&lt;&lt;TEMPLATE NAME&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;Template:&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;TEMPLATE NAME&gt;&gt;&quot;, or something similar. I prefer the first form, although several of my earlier books still imploy the second form.

== Category Names ==

Also, make sure any categories that you create for use with your book are named appropriately. The category names that you employ should mirror the title of your book, or use the title of your book as a prefix. That way, everybody knows that your category goes with your book, and you also aren't stealing any namespace from other books who might need it.</text>

These are the general steps that I have followed whenever I wanted to create a new book on Wikibooks.  My first book, [[Reverse Engineering]] taught me a lot of lessons about book creation, and I have spent a lot of time fixing and reformatting that book to be a good resource. One of my more recent books, [[Control Systems]] was in planning for a pretty long time, but because of the extra time, was able to reach a good stable state in a matter of days. 

For interested readers, I maintain a page in my user space with my upcoming projects listed, and even described. This page is known as [[User:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|My Book Foundry]], and people are welcome to come see what projects I have planned, and what books I will be introducing in the future. 

Even though this book doesn't represent official Wikibooks policy or official guidelines, I feel that it can be a useful resource for dedicated editors who sincerely want to create new books, and expand Wikibooks. We have the potential and the tools here to truly create a valuable resource for students around the world, and if we put thought and planning into it, we can help to utilize that potential. I would love to hear from other contributors about this guide (positive or negative), and I would love to hear about the experiences other people have had in creating new books and new modules here on Wikibooks. Good luck, and happy writing.</text>

== Concurrency ==

Concurrency in Haskell is mostly done with Haskell threads. Haskell threads are user-space threads that are implemented in the runtime. Haskell threads are much more efficient in terms of both time and space than Operating System threads. Apart from traditional synchronization primitives like semaphores, Haskell offers Software Transactional Memory which greatly simplifies concurrent access to shared memory.

The modules for concurrency are Control.Concurrent.* and Control.Monad.STM.

== When do you need it? ==

Perhaps more important than '''when''' is '''when not'''.  Concurrency in Haskell is not used to utilize multiple processor cores; you need another thing, &quot;[[Haskell/Parallelism|parallelism]]&quot;, for that.  Instead, concurrency is used for when a single core must divide its attention between various things, typically IO.

For example, consider a simple &quot;static&quot; webserver (i.e. serves only static content such as images).  Ideally, such a webserver should consume few processing resources; instead, it must be able to transfer data as fast as possible.  The bottleneck should be I/O, where you can throw more hardware at the problem.  So you must be able to efficiently utilize a single processor core among several connections.

In a C version of such a webserver, you'd use a big loop centered around &lt;code&gt;select()&lt;/code&gt; on each connection and on the listening socket.  Each open connection would have an attached data structure specifying the state of that connection (i.e. receiving the HTTP header, parsing it, sending the file).  Such a big loop would be difficult and error-prone to code by hand.  However, using Concurrent Haskell, you would be able to write a much smaller loop concentrating solely on the listening socket, which would spawn a new &quot;thread&quot; for each accepted connection.  You can then write a new &quot;thread&quot; in the IO monad which, in sequence, receives the HTTP header, parses it, and sends the file.

Internally, the Haskell compiler will then convert the spawning of the thread to an allocation of a small structure specifying the state of the &quot;thread&quot;, congruent to the data structure you would have defined in C.  It will then convert the various threads into a single big loop.  Thus, while you write as if each thread is independent, internally the compiler will convert it to a big loop centered around &lt;code&gt;select()&lt;/code&gt; or whatever alternative is best on your system.

== Example ==

{{HaskellExample|Downloading files in parallel|&lt;pre&gt;
downloadFile :: URL -&gt; IO ()
downloadFile = undefined

downloadFiles :: [URL] -&gt; IO ()
downloadFiles = mapM_ (forkIO . downloadFile)&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

== Software Transactional Memory ==

Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a mechanism that allows transactions on memory similar to database transactions. It greatly simplifies access to shared resources when programming in a multithreaded environment. By using STM, you no longer have to rely on locking.

To use STM, you have to include Control.Monad.STM. To change into the STM-Monad the atomically function is used. STM offers different primitives (TVar, TMVar, TChan and TArray) that can be used for communication.

The following example shows how to use a TChan to communicate between two threads. The channel is created in the main function and handed over to the reader/writerThread functions. The readerThread waits on the TChan for new input and prints it. The writerThread writes some Int-values to the channel and terminates.

{{HaskellExample|Communication with a TChan|&lt;pre&gt;
import Control.Monad.STM
import Control.Concurrent
import Control.Concurrent.STM.TChan

oneSecond = 1000000

writerThread :: TChan Int -&gt; IO ()
writerThread chan = do
        atomically $ writeTChan chan 1
        threadDelay oneSecond
        atomically $ writeTChan chan 2
        threadDelay oneSecond
        atomically $ writeTChan chan 3
        threadDelay oneSecond

readerThread :: TChan Int -&gt; IO ()
readerThread chan = do
        newInt &lt;- atomically $ readTChan chan
        putStrLn $ &quot;read new value: &quot; ++ show newInt
        readerThread chan

main = do
        chan &lt;- atomically $ newTChan
        forkIO $ readerThread chan
        forkIO $ writerThread chan
        threadDelay $ 5 * oneSecond
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Series LC ==
A circuit of one Capacitor and one inductor connected in series
===Circuit Impedance===
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_L + Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = j\omega L + \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{j\omega C} (j\omega^2 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = LC&lt;/math&gt;

===Natural Response===
At equilibrium , the total volatge of the two components are equal to zero
: &lt;math&gt;L\frac{dI}{dt} + IR = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dt} = - I \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dI}{I} = - \frac{R}{L} \int dt &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;ln I =  - \frac{t}{T} + C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I =  e^(- \frac{t}{T} + C)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I =  A e^(- \frac{t}{T})&lt;/math&gt;

The Natural Response of the circuit is a Exponential Decrease in time

===Resonance Response===
: &lt;math&gt; Z_L - Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt; V_L + V_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;  V_C = - V_L &lt;/math&gt;

In Resonance, Impedance of Inductor and Capacitance is equal and the sum of the Capacitor and Inductor's voltage are equal result in Standing Wave Oscillation . Therefore, Lossless LC series can generate Standing Wave Oscillation

==LC in Parallel==
A circuit of one Capacitor and one inductor connected in parallel
===Circuit Impedance===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z} = \frac{1}{Z_L} + \frac{1}{Z_C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{1}{j\omega L} + j \omega C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{1}{j\omega L} (j \omega^2 + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Gandalf in the books and House are INTPs.

I agree, House is definitely an INTP, not an INTJ. [[Special:Contributions/125.238.44.148|125.238.44.148]] ([[User talk:125.238.44.148|talk]]) 09:13, 3 July 2009 (UTC)

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''Voltage applied across a resistor makes a proportional current flow through the resistor.''&lt;/span&gt;


[[Image:Block_diagram_450.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. How do we convert voltage into current?&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Problem: ''How to convert voltage into current'' ==

Have you noted that, in low-voltage electronics, the electrical attributes voltage and current carry information rather than energy? And, for some reasons, we prefer voltage as a data carrier? As a result, most electronic circuits have voltage inputs and outputs.

Unfortunately:), there are also current-input and current-output devices. Examples: an ''ammeter'' has only a current input, a current source has only a current output, a ''bipolar transistor'' has a current input and a current output, a ''tube'' and an ''FET transistor'' have a voltage input and a current output, a [[w:Transimpedance amplifier|transimpedance amplifier]] and a Norton amplifier have a current input and a voltage output, etc. In these cases, we need devices converting the electric attributes carrying information from voltage to current and vice versa.

In this story, we begin revealing the secret of the famous (so much as Ohm's law) ''voltage-to-current converter'', which changes the electrical data carrier from voltage to current (Fig. 1). As usual, there are two versions of this circuit - passive (&quot;bad&quot;) and active (&quot;good&quot;); here, we begin with the &quot;bad&quot; passive version. Then, in another story dedicated to the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter| &quot;good&quot; active version]], we will show that the two versions are not independent. Instead, there is a close interrelation between the two circuits: the active version came from the passive one (the active version comprises the passive one, it is just an improved passive version). In this way, we will show the evolution of the famous circuit moving, step-by-step, from simple to complex.

== Basic non-electrical idea: ''Pressure causes flow'' ==

Have you ever asked yourself questions about causality in our world: &quot;Which came first, the egg or the hen?&quot; (troubling philosophers from the remote past to the present day:), &quot;What causes what - pressure causes flow or flow causes pressure?&quot; etc. As it is hard for us to answer this primary questions we might just assume that both the alternative answers are possible.

Well, let's first begin with the more popular assumption that ''pressure causes flow''. Really, we may observe many situations in life, where a pressure-like quantity puts in motion a flow-like one through an impediment. Here are some examples:  ''pneumatic'' (imagine a constant pressure pump moves air through a closed loop of pipes - you may carry out such a funny experiment by using an old-fashioned air cleaner, which sucks and blows air through a closed loop made from a corrugated hose), ''water'' (remember famous communicating vessels where the height difference between the two vessels causes water to flow), ''thermal'' (if we warm up a metal bar on the one side, heat begins flowing to the other side), ''mechanical'' (imagine that a motor drives a belt - energy is flowing along this &quot;circuit&quot;), ''informational'' (someone tells a story to somebody else - data flows through the phone line), ''money'' (the rich give money to the poor:), etc. If you need more examples, just look around and you will find a lot of ''pressure-causes-flow'' (more generally, ''difference-causes-movement'') analogies. Let's finally generalize all these situations.

If we apply a pressure to an impediment, a flow begins flowing. In this arrangement, ''the pressure-like, flow-like and impediment-like attributes are interrelated''. Usually, ''the output flow-like variable is proportional to the input pressure-like one''; so, we may say that ''the impediment converts the pressure like variable into a flow-like one''.

== Basic electrical idea: ''Voltage causes current'' ==

=== Building the circuit ===

[[Image:Building_v-to-i_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Fig. 2. In the basic Ohm's voltage-supplied circuit, the resistor R acts as a simple voltage-to-current converter.]]

In electricity, we might ask ourselves the electrical version of the philosophical &quot;egg or hen&quot; question above, &quot;What causes what in Ohm's law - voltage causes current or current causes voltage?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-1.htm Elementary passive converters with current output] is a teacher's story about the simplest electric converters.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, as it is hard to answer this primary question we might assume that both the alternative answers are possible.

In this story, we will begin with the more popular assumption that ''voltage causes current'' in the most elementary Ohm's circuit supplied by a voltage source (Fig. 2). As we know, if we apply a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; across a resistor R, a proportional current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R begins flowing through the circuit. We may say that this is a ''voltage-causes-current'' formulation of Ohm's law: '''I = V/R'''.

In this voltage-supplied circuit, the resistor R determines the current flowing through it. We usually say that the resistor converts the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; into a proportional current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; or it serves as a simple ''voltage-to-current converter'' - a linear circuit with transfer ratio k = I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; [mA/V].

&lt;center&gt;''A bare resistor can convert a voltage into a current.''&lt;/center&gt;

=== Exploring the circuit operation ===

We may present the circuit operation and Ohm's law in a more attractive manner than I = V/R, if we visualize the invisible electrical quantities by means of voltage bars and current loops (Fig. 2). They are based on the famous ''water tower'' and ''fish tank'' hydraulic analogies. In this &quot;geometrical&quot; presentation, the height of the voltage bars is proportional to the corresponding voltages (drops) and the thickness of the current loop is proportional to the magnitude of the current (see also an interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/class1/v-to-i-old-page6-1.html animation]).

Then, we may present the circuit operation (and Ohm's law) graphoanalytically - Fig. 3. As the voltage across  and the current through the two 2-terminal components (the voltage source and the resistor) are the same, we may superimpose their IV curves on a common coordinate system. The intersection of the two lines is the ''operating point'' A; it represents the current magnitudes of the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and the current I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. When we vary the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; of the input voltage source, its IV curve moves horizontally (see also an interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/class1/v-to-i-old-page6-3.html animation]). As a result, the working point A slides over the IV curve of the resistor R; its slope represents the converter's ratio.

[[Image:V-to-i_converter_iv_curves_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|Fig. 3. Graphoanalytical presentation of the circuit operation]][[Image:V-to-i_converter_voltage_diagram_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|Fig. 4. Voltage distribution over the resistor R]] &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

Finally, we may present the circuit operation by another attractive graphical interpretation of Ohm's law - the voltage diagram (the voltage distribution along the resistive film inside a linear resistor) - Fig. 4. In this geometrical presentation, local bars with corresponding height represent the local voltage drops (for simplicity, we may draw only the envelope of the voltage diagram). We may intuitively derive the idea of voltage diagram from many examples of human routine: hydraulic [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/assets/unit1/unit1-page5-4.html], pneumatic, mechanical, thermal, etc. These analogies help to understand that the local voltages along the resistive film decrease gradually (linearly) from the left to the right when the input voltage varies. Actually, this arrangement reproduces the famous Ohm's experiment [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-3.htm] (see also another interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/class1/v-to-i-old-page6-5.html animation]). In this arrangement, the tangent of the angle α represents the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Applications ==

=== V-to-I converter acting as an output device ===

[[Image:V-to-i_current_source_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Voltage-controlled current source&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Voltage-controlled current source.''' Almost all the natural electrical sources are constant voltage sources (primary and secondary batteries). Actually, there are no constant current sources in nature (excepting inductor, Van der Graaf generator and photodiode); if we need a current source, we have to build it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm Reinventing the constant current source] reveals the philosophy of the constant current sources.&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, we connect a voltage-to-current converter (a resistor R) in series with the input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - Fig. 5. The building formula is:

''Current source = Voltage source + Voltage-to-current converter''

If we shorten the circuit output with an ideal current load (just a piece of wire), it will generate a constant current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R.

A real load (an LED on Fig. 5) introduces some voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;; as a result, the current decreases (see the section about [[#Imperfections|imperfections]]).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;/&gt;

=== V-to-I converter acting as an input device ===

[[Image:V-to-i_converter_voltmeter 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Compound voltmeter = V-to-I converter + ammeter&lt;/center&gt;]]'''Compound voltmeter.''' A meter movement (a galvanometer) is actually an ammeter. In order to measure a voltage by an ammeter, we connect a voltage-to-current converter (the so called &quot;multiplier&quot; resistor R) before the ammeter (Fig. 6). In this way, we may present the classic voltmeter as a composed device consisting of two components:

''Compound voltmeter = Voltage-to-current converter + Ammeter''

''The multiplier resistor of a classic voltmeter acts as a voltage-to-current converter.''

[[Image:V-to-i_converter_rc integrator 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. V-to-V RC integrator = V-to-I converter + I-to-V C integrator'&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Compound passive converters:''' Similarly, in the popular passive circuits of capacitive integrator, inductive differentiator, logarithmic converter, etc., the resistor acts as a voltage-to-current converter (Fig. 7):

''V-to-V RC integrator = V-to-I converter + I-to-V C integrator''

''V-to-V RL differentiator = V-to-I converter + I-to-V L differentiator''

''V-to-V RD log converter = V-to-I converter + I-to-V D log converter''

In these circuits, the respective I-to-V converters introduce some voltage drop, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the current decreases and an error appears (see the section about [[#Imperfections|imperfections]]). 

[[Image:V-to-i_converter_trans_switch_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. The base resistor Rb acts as a voltage-to-current converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Transistor base resistor.''' A BJ transistor is a current-controlled device; it actually &quot;shorts&quot; the input source (more precisely speaking, we may drive the transistor by a small voltage V&lt;small&gt;IN&lt;/small&gt; &lt; V&lt;small&gt;BE0&lt;/small&gt;). In order to drive a transistor by a relatively high voltage (for example, in the circuit of a transistor switch), we connect a base resistor in series with the base-emitter junction. It acts as a voltage-to-current converter thus endowing the transistor with a voltage input (Fig. 8.):

''Voltage-input transistor = V-to-I converter + current-input transistor''

With the same purpose, resistors are connected to the inverting and non-inverting inputs of a Norton op-amp [http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-72.pdf], in order to apply a voltage.

''The transistor's base resistor acts as a voltage-to-current converter.'' &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:V-to-i inv ampl 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. Op-amp inverting amplifier = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Op-amp inverting amplifier (an input part).''' In the op-amp inverting circuits the op-amp keeps the voltage of the inverting input at zero level (the so-called virtual ground). As a result, the circuit behaves as a current-controlled device, which &quot;shorts&quot; the input source connected to the inverting input. In order to drive the op-amp by a voltage (for example, in the circuit of an op-amp inverting amplifier), we connect a resistor acting as a voltage-to-current converter between the input voltage source and the inverting input (Fig. 9):

''Op-amp inverting amplifier = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V converter''

''Op-amp V-to-V RC integrator = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V C integrator ''

''Op-amp V-to-V RL differentiator = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V L differentiator''

''Op-amp V-to-V RD log converter = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V D log converter''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== What are the input/output resistances? ==

[[Image:V-to-i_in_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. The input resistance of the passive V-to-I converter is R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]


It is interesting to investigate the input and output resistance (for concreteness, let us assume a resistive load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). 

'''Input resistance.''' First, connect an ammeter ''in series with'' and a voltmeter ''in parallel to'' the converter's input; then vary the input voltage to investigate the input resistance. Looking from the side of the input source we see two resistors connected in series; so, the input resistance is R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. As you can see, it depends on the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:V-to-i_out_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11. The output resistance of the active V-to-I converter is R.&lt;/center&gt;]]


'''Output resistance.'''  Now, connect a voltmeter ''in parallel to'' and an ammeter ''in series with'' the converter's output; then, vary the load resistance (voltage) and observe the current to investigate the output resistance. Looking from the side of the load, we see only the resistor R; so, the output resistance is R&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = R. Here we suppose that the input voltage source is perfect (i.e., it has zero internal resistance).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Imperfections ==

[[Image:V-to-i_load_influence_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 12. The real load affects the current.&lt;/center&gt;]]


Real loads act as imperfect current loads dissipating energy (for example, simple ammeter, current measuring resistor, a diode, etc.) or storing energy (a capacitor, secondary battery, an inductor, etc.) They have some resistance (linear or non-linear), capacitance or inductance, which cause a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to appear across the load (Fig. 12). As a result, now the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead only the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;; as a result, the current decreases.  You can explore the circuit operation in a more attractive way, if you click ''Exploring'' button in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-i-old.html movie] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-i-old.html Passive voltage-to-current converter] is an animated ''Flash'' tutorial revealing the philosophy of the passive version.&lt;/ref&gt; or if you go to ''Stage 2'' in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html Op-amp circuit builder] ([http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/et_2003/builder/builder.pdf movie philosophy]) is an interactive ''Flash'' tutorial that shows how to transform any passive converter into an active one (choose the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the library on the right side to build a voltage-to-current converter).&lt;/ref&gt;

The same problem exists in the water analogy of [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step3 communicating vessels], where the height difference between the vessels determines the flow rate instead only the height of the input water pressure source to determine it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Improvement ==

'''Classic remedy.''' In some cases (e.g., when the passive voltage-to-current converter is a part of a current source), we may apply a paradoxical trick from our humane routine - ''depreciate a harmful quantity by another many times bigger harmful quantity''. In electricity, this is the well-known classic remedy to decrease the error caused by the load: ''increase both the excitation voltage V and the resistance R to suppress the load voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. As a result, the output current remains the same but the influence of the load (even, if it varies) decreases; thus we get a comparatively constant current source. If we go too far, we will &quot;invent&quot; the classic &quot;electricity&quot; definition of the ideal current source, where an infinite voltage divided by an infinite resistance gives a finite current. For example, imagine that we build 1mA current source first by using 10V voltage source and 10K resistor, then - 100V and 100K, after - 1000V and 1000K, ...and finally - infinite V and infinite K. Only, imagine what power the resistor will dissipate in this compromised solution! In addition, we usually can not change the input voltage V and the resistance R. How to solve the problem then?

'''Looking for a perfect remedy.''' Note, that a strange contradiction exists in the simple voltage-to-current converter: from one side, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is useful as it serves as an output voltage; from the other side, this voltage drop is harmful as it decreases the actual current-creating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R. How can we solve this contradiction? Remember what we do in life when something bad appears. If you do not manage to find a remedy, visit the related story about [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|active voltage-to-current converter]] to get an answer.

The passive voltage-to-current converter is not so much popular circuit as the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|passive current-to-voltage converter]]. Actually, it exists in almost every basic electronics book but the authors do not discern it. As a result, there are few sources where it is presented rather implicitly than manifestly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:The Tempest|The Tempest]] is a comedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]].  The play's date is a subject of not insignificant debate.  Some scholars place it at around 1610, while others at around 1603 or 1604.  The story revolves around a sorcerer, his daughter and the young noble who seeks to win her heart.

== Types of Reactions ==

There are several guidelines that can help you predict what kind of chemical reaction will occur between a mixture of chemicals.
{{TextBox|1=
* Several pure elements mixed together may undergo a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Synthesis Reactions|synthesis reaction]].
* A single compound may undergo a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Decomposition Reactions|decomposition reaction]].  It often forms water or hydrogen gas.
* A pure element mixed with an ionic compound may undergo a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Single Replacement Reactions|single replacement reaction]].
* Two different ionic compounds are very likely to undergo a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Double Replacement Reactions|double replacement reaction]].
* An organic compound (containing carbon and hydrogen) can usually react with oxygen in a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Combustion|combustion reaction]].
}}

However, not all elements will react with each other.  To better predict a chemical reaction, knowledge of the ''reactivity series'' is needed.

==Reactivity==

When combining two chemicals, a single- or double-replacement reaction doesn't always happen. This can be explained by a list known as the '''reactivity series''', which lists elements in order of reactivity. The higher on the list an element is, the more elements it can replace in a single- or double-replacement reaction.  When deciding if a replacement reaction will occur, look up the two elements in question.  The higher one will replace the lower one.

Elements at the very top of the series are so reactive that they can replace hydrogen from water.  This explains the explosive reaction between sodium and water:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{Na}_{(s)} + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} \to 2\hbox{NaOH}_{(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Elements in the middle of the list will react with acids (but not water) to produce a salt and hydrogen gas.  Elements at the bottom of the list are mostly nonreactive.

Elements near the top of the list will corrode (rust, tarnish, etc.) in oxygen much faster than those at the bottom of the list.

===The Reactivity Series===
{{Wikipedia|Reactivity series}}
{{RightHalf|
* Red: elements that react with water and acids to form hydrogen gas, and with oxygen.
* Orange: elements that react very slowly with water but strongly with acids.
* Yellow: elements that react with acid to form hydrogen gas, and with oxygen.
* Grey: elements that react with oxygen (tarnish).
* White: elements that are often found pure; relatively nonreactive.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Balancing Equations|next=Types of chemical reactions}}

== Limiting Reactants ==

When chemical reactions occur, the reactants undergo change to create the products.  The ''coefficients'' of the chemical equation show the relative amounts of substance needed for the reaction to occur.  Consider the combustion of propane:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_3\hbox{H}_8 + 5\hbox{O}_2 \to 3\hbox{CO}_2 + 4\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For every one mole of propane, there must be five moles of oxygen.  For every one mole of propane combusted, there will be three moles of carbon dioxide and four moles of water produced (along with much heat).  If a propane grill is burning, there will be a very large amount of oxygen available to react with the propane gas.  In this case, oxygen is the '''excess reactant'''.  There is so much oxygen that the exact amount doesn't matter—it will not run out.

On the other hand, there is not an unlimited amount of propane.  It will run out far before the oxygen runs out, making it a '''limiting reactant'''.  The amount of propane available will decide how far the reaction will go.

{{TextBox|1=
; Example
&lt;center&gt;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/center&gt;

''If there are three moles of hydrogen, and one mole of oxygen, which is the limiting reactant? How much product is created?''

Twice as much hydrogen than oxygen is required. However, there is more than twice as much hydrogen. Thus hydrogen is the excess reactant and oxygen is the limiting reactant.  If the reaction proceeds to completion, all of the oxygen will be used up, and one mole of hydrogen will remain.  You can imagine this situation like this:

&lt;center&gt;3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}}
The reactant that is left over after the reaction is complete is called the &quot;excess reactant&quot;. Often, you will want to figure out how much of the excess reactant is left after the reaction is complete. to do this, first use mole ratios to determine how much excess reactant is used up in the reaction. 

Here are the ratios that need to be used:

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\text{moles  of  limiting  reactant}}{1} \right )	*\left ( \frac{\text{coefficient  of  product}}{\text{coefficient of limiting reactant}} \right )	=  \text{moles of excess remaining}&lt;/math&gt;

== Percent Yield ==
Usually, less product is made than theoretically possible. The '''actual yield''' is lower than the '''theoretical yield'''. To compare the two, one can calculate '''percent yield''', which is &lt;math&gt; \frac{actual~yield}{theoretical~yield} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;.

The percent yield tells us how far the reaction actually went.

== Characteristics of Gases ==

Gases have a number of special characteristics that differentiate them from other states of matter. Here is a list of characteristics of gases:

{{TextBox|1=
;Characteristics of Gases:
* Gases have neither '''definite shape''' nor '''definite volume'''. They expand to the size of their container.
* Gases are '''fluid''', and flow easily.
* Gases have '''low density''', unless compressed.  Being made of tiny particles in a large, open space, gases are very compressible.
* Gases '''diffuse''' (mix and spread out) and '''effuse''' (travel through small holes).
}}

=== Standard Temperature and Pressure ===

{{Wikipedia|Standard conditions for temperature and pressure}}

''Standard Temperature and Pressure'', or '''STP''', is 0 °C and 1 atmosphere of pressure.  Expressed in other units, STP is 273 '''K''' and 760 '''torr'''.  The Kelvin and torr are useful units of temperature and pressure respectively that we will discuss later in the following sections.
{{-}}

=== Avogadro's Law ===

[[File:Amedeo Avogadro2.jpg|left|thumb|Amedeo Avogadro, the Italian chemist. Avogadro's Law is named after him and his discoveries about the behavior of gases]]
{{wikipedia|Avogadro's Law}}
'''Avogadro's Law''' states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. So both one mole of Xenon at STP (131.3 grams) and one mole of helium at STP (4.00 grams) take up 22.4 liters. Even 1 mole of air, which is a mixture of several gases, takes up 22.4 liters of volume. 22.4 L is the standard molar volume of a gas.

{{Eqn|Avogadro's Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n} = k\,&lt;/math&gt;.

where:
:''V'' is the volume of the gas.
:''n'' is the number of moles of the gas.
:''k'' is a proportionality constant.

The most important consequence of Avogadro's law is that the ''''ideal gas constant''' has the same value for all gases. This means that the constant

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_1\cdot V_1}{T_1\cdot n_1}=\frac{p_2\cdot V_2}{T_2 \cdot n_2} = const&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''p'' is the pressure of the gas
:''T'' is the temperature of the gas

has the same value for all gases, independent of the size or mass of the gas molecules.
{{-}}

=== Pressure ===

Gases exert pressure on their containers and all other objects.  Pressure is measured as force per unit area.  A barometer is a device that measures pressure. There are a number of different units to measure pressure:
*'''torr''', equal to millimeters of mercury (mm Hg): if a glass cylinder with no gas in it is placed in a dish of liquid mercury, the mercury will rise in the cylinder to a certain number of millimeters.
*atmosphere ('''atm'''), the pressure of air at sea level.
*pascal ('''Pa'''), equal to one newton (N) per square meter. A newton is the force necessary to accelerate one kilogram by one meter per second squared.

You should know that '''1 atm = 760 torr = 101.3 kPa'''.

== Ideal Gases ==

{{Wikipedia|Ideal gas}}

Gases are complicated things composed a large numbers of tiny particles zipping around at high speeds. There are a number of complex forces governing the interactions between molecules in the gas, which in turn affect the qualities of the gas as a whole. To get around these various complexities and to simplify our study, we will talk about '''ideal gases'''.

An ideal gas is a simplified model of a gas that follows several strict rules and satisfies several limiting assumptions. Ideal gases can be perfectly modeled and predicted with a handful of equations.

Ideal gases follow, among others, these important rules:

{{TextBox|1=
'''Rules of Ideal Gasses'''

# The molecules that make up a gas are a point masses, meaning '''they have no volume'''. 
# Gas particles are spread out with very great distance between each molecule. Thus, '''intermolecular forces are essentially zero''', meaning that they neither attract nor repel each other.
# If collisions do occur between gas particles, these '''collisions are elastic''', meaning there is no loss of kinetic (motion) energy.
# Gas molecules are in '''continuous random motion'''.
# Temperature is directly proportionate to kinetic energy.
}}

{{Info|'''Note:''' Ideal gases never truly exist (because the nature of gases is so complicated), but gases are often close enough to an ideal gas that the equations still hold fairly accurate.}}

=== Ideal Gas Law ===

Ideal gases can be completely described using the '''ideal gas law''':

{{Eqn|Ideal Gas Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\ pV = nRT   &lt;/math&gt; 

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\ p  &lt;/math&gt; is the absolute pressure of the gas, 
:&lt;math&gt;\ V  &lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the gas,
:&lt;math&gt;\ n  &lt;/math&gt; is the number of moles of gas,
:&lt;math&gt;\ R  &lt;/math&gt; is the ideal gas constant,
:&lt;math&gt;\ T  &lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature, in Kelvin.

=== Ideal Gas Constant ===

The ideal gas constant, ''R'',  is a constant from the ideal gas equation, above, that helps to relate the various quantities together. The gas constant represents the same value, but the exact numerical representation of it may be different depending on the units used for each term. The table at right shows some values of ''R'' for different units. Here is the value of ''R'' using Joules for energy, Kelvin for temperature, and moles for quantity:

{{eqn|Ideal Gas Constant}}
:&lt;math&gt;R = 8.314472\ \ JK^{-1}mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

{{-}}

=== Real Gases ===

All '''real gases''' (or ''non-ideal'' gases) deviate from the ideal gas laws that we discussed above. These deviations can occur for several reasons:

* Real molecules have mass and volume. They are too big and no longer behave like ideal point masses
* Low volumes and high pressures cause molecules to be close enough for intermolecular forces.  Polar molecules exaggerate the problem.
* Low temperature means low kinetic energy. At lower temperatures, intermolecular forces become significant and cannot be ignored like they are in ideal gasses
* Other complicated factors may prevent ideal behavior.

When these issues are present, gas molecules attract each other, and may even condense into a liquid.  Gases act most like ideal gases when the molecules have low mass (small volume), are not polar, and are at high temperature and low pressure. Noble gases like Xenon or Argon act the most like ideal gases because they are mostly electrical neutral and non-interactive.

==Kinetic Molecular Theory==
This theory describes why gases exhibit their properties.  It only applies accurately to ideal gases.  Because there is no such thing as an ideal gas, the '''Kinetic Molecular Theory''' can only approximate gas behavior. It is still very useful to chemists.

{{Wikipedia|Kinetic theory}}

The Kinetic Molecular Theory explains the pressure, temperature, kinetic energy, and speed of gases and their molecules.  See Wikipedia for the exact equations of the Kinetic Molecular Theory, as well as detailed explanations.  What is most important is understanding the general concepts, not the specific equations.

=== Kinetic Energy and Temperature ===
Kinetic energy is the mechanical, or movement, energy.  It is given by the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2_{rms}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is mass and
:&lt;math&gt;v_{rms}&lt;/math&gt; is the average velocity

Explained with words, kinetic energy is dependent on the product of a particle's mass and its velocity squared.  The more kinetic energy, the faster a particle moves.  Conversely, the faster a particle moves, the more kinetic energy it has.

The Kinetic Molecular Theory states that kinetic energy and temperature are directly proportionate.  Thus, a double in temperature will result in a double in kinetic energy and an increase in velocity by a factor of 1.4 (the square root of 2, see the KE equation). This means that the higher the temperature of a gas, the faster the individual particles in that gas are moving.

A hotter gas has more kinetic energy than a colder gas.  If two gases are at the same temperature, they will have the same kinetic energy.  The lighter-massed gas will have a higher average speed for its particles at the same energy level.  It is important to know that gas temperature '''must be measured in kelvin'''.  Zero degrees Celsius is 273 kelvin.  One Celsius degree is equal to one kelvin, but the kelvin scale has water's freezing point at 273 and boiling point at 373.  It is necessary to use kelvin because temperatures must always be positive when using the Kinetic Molecular Theory.

{{TextBox|1=
;Question for the reader:
A gas's temperature is increased from 20 °C to 40° C.  What factor does its kinetic energy increase?  Velocity?
}}

{{Info|Keep in mind that gases are all about averages. For a temperature increase, there will be an average increase in the kinetic energy of the particles in that gas. Even in a very hot gas there will be some particles moving very slowly. However, the average will be high.}}

=== Pressure and Collisions ===

Pressure exists because the gas molecules are in continuous random motion, and they will constantly strike the walls of their container.  Pressure will increase as the speed of the molecules increases, due to greater forces of collision.  Pressure will also increase as the mass of the molecules increase.  A small, slow molecule has less momentum than a large, fast molecule, which explains their difference in pressure.

{{TextBox|1=
;Question for the reader:
There are two jars of ideal gas, for example.  In Jar A there is nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  In Jar B there is methane gas (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  Both jars are at the same temperature.  Which will have greater pressure?
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Question for the reader:
Now, Jars A and B both have propane gas (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).  Jar A is at 300 K and Jar B is at 500 K.  Which will have greater pressure?

== Gas Laws ==

As the result of many different scientists and experiments, several ''gas laws'' have been discovered.  These laws relate the various '''state variables''' of a gas.
{{TextBox|1=
; State Variables of a Gas
* Pressure (P)
* Volume (V)
* Temperature (T)
* Molar mass (n)}}
These gas laws can be used to compare two different gases, or determine the properties of a gas after one of its state variables have changed.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;

|&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_1}{V_1} = \frac{n_2}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|'''Avogadro's Law''' states that equal volumes of all ideal gases (at the same temperature and pressure) contain the same number of molecules.

|&lt;math&gt;P \times V = constant&lt;/math&gt;

|&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{T} = constant&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|'''Charles's Law''' states that volume is proportional to temperature (when pressure is constant).  Remember that temperature must be measured in Kelvin.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{T} = constant&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|'''Gay-Lussac's Law''' states that pressure is proportional to temperature (when volume is constant).

===Combined Gas Law===

Combining Charles's Law, Boyle's Law, and Gay-Lussac's Law gives us the '''combined gas law'''.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \times V}{T} = constant&lt;/math&gt;
|For a gas with constant molar mass, the three other state variables are interrelated.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_1 \times V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 \times V_2}{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|The Combined Gas Law can be used for comparisons between gases.
|}

==Ideal Gas Law==

When Avogadro's Law is considered, all four state variables can be combined into one equation.  Furthermore, the &quot;constant&quot; that is used in the above gas laws becomes the Universal Gas Constant (R).

To better understand the Ideal Gas Law, you should first see how it is derived from the above gas laws.
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;V \propto n \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V \propto \frac{T}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is simply a restatement of Avogadro's Law and the Combined Gas Law.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;V \propto \frac{n \times T}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
|We can now combine the laws together. 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{\frac{n \times T}{P}} = R&lt;/math&gt;
|Let R be a constant, and write the proportion in the form of an equation.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \times V}{n \times T} = R&lt;/math&gt;
|Rearranging the fraction gives one form of the '''ideal gas law'''.
|}
 
The ideal gas law is the most useful law, and it should be memorized.  If you know the ideal gas law, you do not need to know any other gas laws, for it is a combination of all the other laws.  If you know any three of the four state variables of a gas, the unknown can be found with this law.  If you have two gases with different state variables, they can be compared.

There are three ways of writing the ideal gas law, but all of them are simply algebraic rearrangements of each other.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;PV = nRT \,&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the most common form.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{PV}{nT} = R&lt;/math&gt;
|This form is useful for predicting the effects of changing a state variable.  To maintain a constant value of R, an change in the numerator must result in a proportional change in the denominator, and vice versa.  If, for example, the pressure is decreased in a constant-volume container, you can use this form to easily predict that the temperature must decrease.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_1V_1}{n_1T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{n_2T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|Because R is the same constant for all gases, this equation can be used to relate two gases to each other.

{{Info|
;Rules for Using the Ideal Gas Law
*Always convert the temperature to kelvins (K).
*Always convert mass to moles (mol).
*Always convert volume to liters (L).
*It is preferable to convert pressure to kilopascals (kPa). R, the Universal Gas Constant, would be 8.314 (L·kPa)/(mol·K).}}

==Kinetic Molecular Theory==

{{Wikipedia|Kinetic theory}}
The Kinetic Molecular Theory attempts to explain the gas laws.  It describes the behavior of microscopic gas molecules to explain the macroscopic behavior of gases.  According to this theory, an ideal gas is composed of continually moving molecules of negligible volume. The molecules move in straight lines unless they collide into each other or the walls of their container.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
|The '''pressure''' of the gas on the container is explained as the force the molecules exert on the walls during a collision.  Pressure is equal to the average force of collisions divided by the total surface area of the container.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2}{3k_B} K&lt;/math&gt;
|The '''temperature''' of the gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; denotes the average kinetic energy of the molecules, and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Boltzman constant'' (1.388 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt;).
|}

The gas laws are now explained by the microscopic behavior of gas molecules:
*Boyle's Law: The pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume.  A container's volume and surface area are obviously proportional.  Based on the pressure equation, an increase in volume (and thus surface area) will decrease pressure.
*Charles' Law: the volume of a gas is proportional to its temperature.  As the volume (and surface area) increases, the pressure will decrease unless the force also increase.  When pressure is constant, the volume and temperature must be proportional.  The temperature equation above explains why:  the energy of the molecules (and their collision force) is proportional to temperature.
*Gay-Lussac's Law: The temperature of a gas is directly proportional to its pressure.  An increase in temperature will increase the kinetic energy of the molecules (shown by the temperature equation).  Greater kinetic energy causes the molecules to move faster.  Their collisions with the container will have more force, which increases pressure.
*Avogadro's Law: Equal volumes of all ideal gases (at the same temperature and pressure) contain the same number of molecules.  According to the Kinetic Molecular Theory, the size of individual molecules is negligible compared to distances between molecules. Even though different gases have different sized molecules, the size difference is negligible, and the volumes are the same.

===Derivation of Ideal Gas Law===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| colspan=2 | Suppose there are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; molecules, each with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, in a cubic container with side length &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Even though the molecules are moving in all directions, we may assume, on average, that one third of the molecules are moving along the x-axis, one third along the y-axis, and one third along the z-axis. We may assume this because the motion of the molecules is random, so no direction is preferred.
|-
| colspan=2 | Suppose the average speed of the molecules is &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. Let a specific wall of the container be labeled A. Because the collisions in Kinetic Molecular Theory are perfectly elastic, the speed after a collision is &lt;math&gt;-u&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the average change in ''momentum'' (the product of mass and velocity) per collision is &lt;math&gt;2mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Each molecule, on average, travels a distance of &lt;math&gt;2s&lt;/math&gt; between two consecutive collisions with wall A. Therefore, it will collide &lt;math&gt;u/2s&lt;/math&gt; times per second with wall A.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2mu \times \frac{u}{2s}=\frac{mu^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
| The average change in momentum per molecule per second.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{Nmu^2}{3s}&lt;/math&gt;
|Therefore, this is the total change in momentum per second for the &lt;math&gt;(1/3)N&lt;/math&gt; molecules that collide into wall A. This is the momentum per second that was exerted onto wall A.  Because force equals the change in momentum over time, this value is the force exerted on wall A.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{Nmu^2}{3s} \times \frac{1}{s^2}=\frac{Nmu^2}{3s^3}&lt;/math&gt;
| Pressure is defined as force per unit area, so this is the pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of the gas.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;PV=\frac{Nmu^2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| Because the volume of the container is &lt;math&gt;V=s^3&lt;/math&gt;, we can rearrange the equation.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{1}{2}mu^2&lt;/math&gt;
| The kinetic energy of a single particle is given by this equation.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;PV=\frac{2}{3}NK&lt;/math&gt;
| Substitute kinetic energy into the &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; equation.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;PV=N k_B T&lt;/math&gt;
| Substitute the temperature equation (from the previous section).
|-
| &lt;math&gt;PV = N_A n k_B T&lt;/math&gt;
| Avogadro's number &lt;math&gt;N_A&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of molecules per mole.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;R = k_B N_A&lt;/math&gt;
| By definition, the ideal gas constant is equal to the Boltzmann constant times Avogadro's number.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;
| The ideal gas law is derived from the Kinetic Molecular Theory.
|}

==Deviations from the Ideal Gas Law==

In an ideal gas, there are no intermolecular attractions, and the volume of the gas particles is negligible. However, there is no real gas that can perfectly fits this behavior, so the Ideal Gas Law only approximates the behavior of gases. This approximation is very good at high temperatures and low pressures.

At high temperature the molecules have high kinetic energy, so intermolecular attractions are minimized.  At low pressure the gas occupies more volume, making the size of the individual molecules negligible.  These two factors make the gas behave ideally.

At low temperature or high pressure, the size of the individual molecules and intermolecular attractions becomes significant, and the ideal gas approximation becomes inaccurate. 

==Eudiometers and Water Vapor==

{{Helpful hint|hint=In calculations for a gas above a liquid, the vapor pressure of the liquid must be considered.}}

A '''eudiometer''' is a device that measures the ''downward displacement'' of a gas. The apparatus for this procedure involves an inverted container or jar filled with water and submerged in a water basin. The lid of the jar has an opening for a tube through which the gas to be collected can pass. As the gas enters the inverted container, it forces water to leave the jar (displacing it downward). To fill the entire container with gas, there must enough gas pumped into the container to expel all of the water.

[[Image:DDofgas.jpg|frame|center|Gas is created by burning a substance that releases methane.  The ''eudiometer'' on the right was full of water before the gas was created.  By measuring the change in volume, the amount of gas can be calculated.]]

As seen in this diagram, the downward displacement involves water. Therefore, in the container where the gas is collected, there is unwanted water vapor. To account for the water vapor, subtract the pressure of water vapor from the pressure of the gases in the container to find the pressure of the collected gas.  This is simply a restatement of Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_{total} = P_{water~vapor} + P_{gas}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The pressure of water vapour can be found on [http://eweb.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/chemeng/water.html this webpage].

==Diffusion and Effusion==

=== Diffusion ===
'''Diffusion''' is the process of a substance spreading out to evenly fill its container or environment.  In a solution, a concentrated solute diffuses to spread evenly in its solvent. In air, gas molecules diffuse to mix thoroughly. Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to low concentration. Diffusion explains why an open bottle of ammonia will fill an entire room with odor.  The gas molecules escaping from the bottle spread out to fill their new container: the room.  As a result, the whole room smells.  Upon opening the windows, the gas will diffuse into the environment.

{{Info|Diffusion occurs because the gas molecules are in continuous random motion. This motion is called '''Brownian Motion'''.  The molecules will eventually reach anywhere they can.}}

Diffusion is also the process of two gases mixing together, if both stored in the same container.  They will spread out evenly, resulting in a solution (homogeneous mixture).

=== Effusion ===
'''Effusion''' is the process of gas molecules escaping from a small hole in the container.  Effusion explains why fumes are noticeable near a leaky fuel pipe.

{{Info|Effusion is also explained by the continuous random motion of the molecules.  The random motion prevents molecules from avoiding the small hole.  Slowly but steadily, gas molecules will pass through the hole.}}

Effusion obviously depends on the size of the hole.  If small enough, effusion may not occur because, like a beach ball hitting a basketball hoop, the molecules can't fit.  Larger holes obviously allow molecules to escape faster.  If the hole is large enough, the process may be considered diffusion instead of effusion.

Effusion can be seen with balloons.  Effusion proves that the balloon has holes in it, even though it looks totally impassable.  When left alone for several days, a balloon filled with helium will eventually deflate.  If that balloon were filled with hydrogen, it would deflate in less time because the molecules are smaller and escape with ease.
and you can try that

==Graham's Law of Effusion==
{{SideBox|Graham's Law can be used to approximate diffusion.  However, diffusion involves two or more gases interacting with each other, so the equation is not accurate.}}
The more massive a gas is, the slower it effuses.  The relationship is given by '''Graham's Law'''.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{Rate_1}{Rate_2} = \sqrt \frac{M_2}{M_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where M is the molar mass of a gas molecule.&lt;/center&gt;

As an example, assume there are two identical containers with holes.  Container A has hydrogen gas (M=2 g/mol) and Container B has helium gas (M=4 g/mol).  If the hydrogen gas effuses at a rate of 4 mol/hr, the helium gas would effuse at a slower rate (being heavier).  Using Graham's Law, we can see that it would effuse at a rate of about 2.8 mol/hr.

Topic 1: System and Models

'''system'''	– a collection of interrelated parts that work together by way of some driving process.	
	
'''surroundings''' – everything around the system being studied

	
'''open system''' – exchanges energy and matter with surroundings. Most ecosystems are open.

'''closed system''' – exchanges energy but not matter with surroundings. Our planet is [usually] closed.

'''isolated system''' – exchanges neither energy nor matter with surroundings. Laboratory experiments are usually isolated.


- First Law of Thermodynamics: Conservation of energy.

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. There is a fixed amount of energy in the universe. Therefore living organisms must get their required energy from their environment and surroundings.


-Second Law of Thermodynamics: In an isolated system entropy tends to increase spontaneously.

When energy is converted from one form to another, some of the energy is degraded into less-usable heat which disperses into the environment. Thus the amount of energy remains the same, but its usability decreases.

'''Entropy''' measures the amount of disorder in the universe – usable energy is more organized whereas less-usable energy is more diffuse/disorganized. Entropy increases naturally, or spontaneously.

	
'''Equilibrium''' – A state of balance among the components of a system

Stable equilibrium - The condition of a system in which there is a tendency for it to return to a previous equilibrial condition following disturbance

Steady-state equilibrium – The condition of an open system in which there are no changes over the longer term, but in which there may be oscillations in the very short term. There are continuing inputs and outputs of matter and energy, but the system as a whole remains in a more-or-less constant state.

Dynamic equilibrium –	there is no specific ‘average’ state; the system has different average states at different times. After a disturbance, the system may move to a different ‘average’ state.

      <comment>/* Databases */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We give a simple example of applications of FMT first and then some typical examples.

==FMT everywhere==
Some simple examples that show how elementary the issues are that FMT cares about:
*...

==Databases==
A typical application area of FMT is database theory:
* Consider a companies' database that contains all managers together with the 'is superordinate' relation amongst them.  In a proper hierarchy the database should contain no circles, i.e. a manager can not be a superordinate of his superordinate.  Querying this corresponds to checking a graph for cyclicity.  As from above this cannot be done in First Order Logic (FO).
* Say two managers want to find out if one of them is more powerful than the other.  They need to query the database if the number of their subordinates is equal, i.e. the cardinalities of the sets of subordinates (say, directly and indirectly) is equal.  This can't be done in FO (&quot;FO cannot count&quot;).  This is the reason SQL is extended by a counting function.
* Consider a database &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of airports and connection flights among them, where &lt;math&gt;F(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;means there is a direct flight from airport &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to airport &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. We can write an order-zero query of the direct reachability of airport &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from airport &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;q_0(a, b)  = F(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now in order to query connections with one change of plane we write

&lt;math&gt;q_1(a, b) = \exists_c F(a, c) \and F(c, b)&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt;Q_1(a, b) = q_0(a, b) \or q_1(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; 

for connections with zero or one change.  Thus in order to extend this to reachability (of no matter how many changes) we have to write 

&lt;math&gt;Q = \bigvee_{k\in\mathbb{N}} q_k&lt;/math&gt;

which is not a FO expression.  So we are fine with FO for a restricted reachability up to a certain k but not for reachibility as
it appears in graph theory.  In fact it can be shown that reachability cannot be queried in FO.

Ecosystems are the biotic and abiotic factors in a specified area that interact with one another.

== 2.1. Structure ==

'''biotic factor''' - A living, biological factor that may influence an organism or ecosystem, such as producers-plants,consumers-animals etc

'''abiotic factors''' – A non-living or physical factor that may influence an organism or ecosystem. For example, precipitation, wind, sunlight, soil, temperature, pH, salinity, light, temperature



# Understanding the interaction of the biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem can help us to see why particular human activities may be a problem for human survival.

# Example: The loss of ozone in the stratosphere increases the quantity of UV radiation on the surface of the planet. In the same way that humans experience sunburn from too much sun exposure, so do plants. Excessive UV may damage or destroy plant protein and DNA, killing the plant.



'''Trophic level''' - The position that an organism occupies in a food chain, or a group of organisms in a community that occupy the same position in food chains. And is mainly considered as feeding level.

Producers/Autotrophs - Organisms that make their own food. Usually plants through photosynthesis.
Primary consumers - Organisms that consume producers.
Secondary consumers - Organisms that consume primary consumers.

Herbivores - Organisms that eat plants, but no meat.
Carnivores - Meat-eaters.
Omnivores - Organisms that eat both plants and meat.

Heterotrophs - 
Decomposers -


species - A group of organisms that interbreed and produce fertile offspring.

population - A group of organisms of the same species living in the same area at the same time, and which are capable of interbreeding.

community - A group of populations living and interacting with each other in a common habitat.

ecosystem - A community of interdependent organisms and the physical environment they inhabit.

habitat - The environment in which a species normally lives.
	
niche - A species' share of a habitat and the resources in it. An organism's ecological niche depends not only on where it lives but on the role it plays in the ecosystem.
  fundamental niche - The part of the habitat in which a species can live ''in the absence of'' competitors and predators
  realized niche - The part of the habitat that the organism ''actually'' occupies.


'''biome''' – large, relatively distinct terrestrial region characterized by similar climate (temperature and precipitation), soil, and organisms.


competition – [– ,–] Two species (interspecies competition) or two populations of the same species (intraspecies competition) compete for the same resources. Both sides are harmed.

symbiosis – biological interaction where two different species are in direct contact with each other.

  commensalism – [0 , +] One species benefits, the other is unaffected
  amensalism – [0 , –] One species is harmed, the other is unaffected
  mutualism – [+ , +] Both species benefit
  predation – [+ , –] One species benefits, the other is harmed. The prey is usually killed quickly.
  parasitism – [+ , –] One species benefits, the other is harmed. The host is killed slowly if at all.

'''succession''' – a change over time in the types of species that occupy a given area.
  '''primary succession''' – ecological succession in an environment that has not been previously inhabited (no soil is present).
  '''pioneer communities''' – the first organisms to colonize (or recolonize) an area.
  '''secondary succession''' – ecological succession in an environment that was exposed to some type of disturbance (soil is already present).

'''sere''' – a sequence of communities over ecological time. Each stage of succession is called a seral stage.

  lithosere – succession on bare rock

== Liquids at a Molecular Level ==

Liquids have some intermolecular bonding, but it is not nearly as strong as that of a solid.  As a result, the molecules are somewhat close together, but they are not tightly packed.  Instead, they are free to slide past each other.  Liquids occur at temperatures above the ''melting point'' of a substance, but below its ''boiling point''.  At the melting point, the molecules are moving slow enough to form rigid bonds and become a solid.  At the boiling point, the molecules are moving so fast that they cannot form any bonds and become a gas.

==Characteristics of Liquids==
[[Image:Dispersion.gif|thumb|Diffusion is the chaotic mixing of fluids.  The jar on the left has warmer water.]]
Liquids have '''definite volume''', but '''indefinite shape'''.  They are free to form droplets and puddles when they are not inside a container.  When a liquid is inside a container, it will take its shape.  Unlike gases, a liquid will not change its volume to spread out and completely fill a container.  There is enough intermolecular bonding to give liquids a definite volume.

Liquids are '''fluid''', able to flow and take any shape.  This occurs due to the weak intermolecular bonding that allows the molecules to slide past each other freely.  As a result of being fluid, liquids exhibit many interesting properties that solids do not, including capillary action and diffusion.

Liquids, like gases, undergo '''diffusion''' when mixed.  This can be seen by adding food coloring to water.  Different liquids, when added, will chaotically spread out and mix together.  Diffusion will occur faster when the liquid is warmer because the increased kinetic energy allows the molecules to move faster and collide more frequently.

Liquids are usually considered '''incompressible'''.  The molecules are already close together, so it is difficult to compress them any more.  Under very high pressures, liquids will actually compress, but not very much.

Liquids, unlike gases, have a distinct '''surface'''—they need not take their container's shape.  This allows the formation of droplets and puddles. 

== Special Properties ==

=== Cohesion and Adhesion ===
[[Image:Spider web Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Water droplets ''adhere'' to a spiderweb.  Their round shape is caused by ''cohesion''.]]
The molecules of a liquid are attracted to each other.  This is called '''cohesion'''.  Molecules like methane are non-polar, so they are held together only by van der Waals forces (the weakest).  These molecules will have minimal cohesion.  In contrast, water molecules use hydrogen bonding (very strong), so they display strong cohesion.  A cohesive liquid will form more spherical droplets and have much higher ''surface tension'' (explained below).

{{Wikipedia|Adhesion}}
Adhesion is the attraction of a liquid molecule to its surroundings.  Adhesive liquids will demonstrate ''capillary action'' (explained below).  They are also more &quot;wet&quot;.  Mercury is very cohesive, but not adhesive. As a result, it doesn't leave behind residue as it rolls across a surface.  Water, on the other hand, is much more adhesive.  When water rolls across a surface, it wets that surface because some of the molecules adhere to it.

===Surface Tension and Capillary Action===
When water drops are on an ''impermeable'' (waterproof) surface, they tend to form beads. This is due to its '''surface tension'''. Liquid molecules pull at each other, and as a result they decrease their surface area. The molecules at the boundary of the liquid are pulled in, causing a droplet shape.  When water is on a ''permeable'' surface, it spreads out, as can be seen with water on a paper towel. This '''capillary action''' explains how water in the ground reaches the top of trees that are hundreds of feet tall.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Capillary Attraction Repulsion (PSF).jpg|Adhesive liquids (like water but not mercury) will rise up a narrow tube.
Image:WassermoleküleInTröpfchen.svg|Cohesive liquids have ''surface tension'' to hold themselves into droplets.
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Pressure ===
Liquids will distribute pressure evenly.  This concept, known as ''Pascal's Law'', is crucial for equipment like hydraulic brakes.  It is a result of their incompressibility.

{{Helpful hint|hint=If there is no atmospheric pressure (a vacuum, like outer space), liquids cannot form.}}
Liquids will '''evaporate'''.  Although the average kinetic energy of the molecules is too low to overcome bonding and become a gas, individual molecules will occasionally have above-average energy and break free from the surface of the liquid.  The molecule then escapes escapes to the gas phase.  At the same time, however, a gas molecule may hit the surface of the liquid and slow down enough to join the liquid.  A glass of water left outside in the sun will eventually become empty.  The sunlight adds energy to the molecules, allowing some to escape as a gas. Eventually, all molecules will escape. The tendency of a liquid to evaporate depends on its intermolecular forces. '''Volatile''' liquids tend to evaporate quickly have relatively weak intermolecular forces keeping the molecules together, making it easier for them to escape the liquid phase. Conversely, non-volatile liquids do not evaporate to any visible extent due to the presence very strong intermolecular forces.

The evaporation increases with temperature.  It can be measured by '''vapor pressure''', the amount of pressure exerted by the evaporated gas above the liquid's surface.  Vapor pressure increases with temperature, and once it reaches the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere, the liquid will boil. Vapor pressure also depends on the intensity of intermolecular forces in the liquid. 

=== Viscosity ===
'''Viscosity''' refers to the liquid's resistance to flow. For example, [[w:Maple syrup|maple syrup]] has a relatively high viscosity when compared to water because maple syrup flows much slower than water, which flows relatively quickly and easily. The difference in viscosity between these two liquids is due to the attractive forces within the specific liquid. In order to flow, molecules must roll and move over each other. A solution with low attractive forces would allow the molecules to move in a more free and easy manner, decreasing the viscosity.

In most cases, the viscosity of a liquid decreases as the temperature of a liquid is increased. Increasing the temperature of a liquid causes the molecules to have a higher [[w:Kinetic energy|kinetic energy]]. This increase in kinetic energy breaks down the intermolecular forces present in the liquid. Since viscosity is dependent on these attractive forces, the viscosity will decrease when the kinetic energy is increased.

== Characteristics of Solids ==
'''Shape and volume''' are both definite in solids.  Although solids have a rigid shape, a large amount of force can cause deformation to the structure of a solid.  There are three types of deformation:
{{TextBox|1=
* ''Brittle'' deformation causes bonds to break in an irregular way.  Shredding paper and shattering glass are good examples.
* ''Elastic'' deformation is temporary.  The molecules will return to their original positions as soon as the force is removed.  Rubber bands and tires are elastic, as well as steel rods and wooden boards.
* ''Plastic'' deformation is permanent.  Plastic deformation can be observed by bending a metal spoon.}}
[[Image:Ductility.svg|thumb|(a) Brittle; (b) and (c) shows ''ductility'']]
Most materials are capable of all three types of deformation.  Small amounts of stress cause elastic deformation, but large amounts will cause plastic deformation.  In the event of repeated deformation or tremendous stress, brittle deformation occurs.

Solids are '''incompressible'''.  Solids may break or deform under stress, but they tolerate little compression.  For instance, a wooden plank will break if force is applied, but it will not compress like a sponge.  The only reason sponges compress is because they contain air pockets and undergo elastic deformation.  Otherwise, solids will not compress.  At the molecular level, this happens because the intermolecular bonds do not change size without breaking.

Some solids, usually metals, have properties like '''ductility''' and '''malleability'''.  A ductile material can be stretched into long, thin wires.  A malleable substance can be hammered into very thin sheets.  Gold and copper are some of the most malleable and ductile substances known.  These properties occur as a result of the [[General Chemistry/Metallic bonds|metallic bonding]].

== Solids at the Molecular Level ==

Solids occur when there is enough intermolecular bonding to hold the molecules of a substance into a relatively rigid structure.  The molecules are close together, and their movement is restricted to vibration.  Solids occur at the lowest temperatures and highest pressures.  As the temperature of a solid increases, so does the kinetic energy of its molecules.  At the ''melting point'', the molecules have enough energy to overcome their bonds and '''melt''' into a liquid.  Likewise, a liquid will '''freeze''' once its molecules are not moving fast enough to avoid strong intermolecular bonds.

Compounds that have ionic bonding or metallic bonding are most likely to be found in the solid phase due to their high melting points.  Also, covalent network substances (like diamond or quartz) are solids because the atoms are secured with covalent bonds, requiring extreme amounts of energy to separate them.

=== Types of Solids ===
{{Wikipedia|Crystal structure}}
* '''Crystalline''' solids have a molecular structure with a specific geometric shape.  The solid has a specific melting point at which all molecules begin to break free of their bonds. Substances like salt, diamond, and quartz are crystalline solids.  These solids usually form by cooling a liquid slowly, so that the molecules have time to arrange themselves in a crystalline structure as their bonds form.
* '''Amorphous''' solids have a molecular structure with no specific shape.  The solid melts over a range of temperatures because the amount of energy needed to break the bonds varies from molecule to molecule. Substances like coal and glass are amorphous.  Amorphous solids usually form when a liquid is cooled quickly, so there is no time for the molecules to arrange themselves into a crystal.

Crystalline solids are typically harder and more rigid.  Coal and diamond are both made from elemental carbon, but coal is amorphous and diamond is crystalline.  Because of its crystal structure, diamond is one of the hardest substances known, whereas coal can be scratched away with a fingernail.  The crystal structure also explains diamond's brilliant, transparent appearance.  Coal is black and dull because the disorder of the atoms does not allow light to pass.

{{Info|Ionic solids and metallic solids are always crystalline.  Covalent network solids can be crystalline or amorphous.  Van der Waals solids are always amorphous.}}

=== Packing and Unit Cells ===
[[Image:Sodium-chloride-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png|thumb|The unit cell of sodium chloride]]
In crystalline solids, the atoms are arranged in a specific pattern.  The smallest repeating part of this pattern is called the '''unit cell'''.  The unit cell may have more atoms than the empirical formula of a substance because the geometric shape may require several atoms.  In the case of sodium chloride, the empirical formula contains only two atoms, but the unit cell has 27 atoms.

The molecules of a solid are ''close packed''.  They arrange themselves in the densest shape possible.  Usually, two different patterns occur.
* ''Face-centered cubic'' or '''FCC'''
* ''Hexagonal close-packed'' or '''HCP'''

[[Image:ImgSalt.jpg|thumb|left|Halite, or rock salt, exhibits FCC packing.]]
FCC crystals have three alternating layers, described as ABCABCABC (every third layer is the same).  The layers are arranged so that each unit cell is half-way between the two unit cells above or below it.  HCP crystals have two alternating layers, described as ABABABAB (every other layer is the same).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Simple Programs===
Python is such a simple language even a non-programmer could understand it. Here are some examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This program prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on the screen.
Even longer programs can be easily understood

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

  # Stuff after number signs are comments that have no functionality
  # They are useful for explaining how things work though.
 name = raw_input(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)  # Asks the person using the program what their name is
  if name == &quot;John&quot;:                     # If the person types John and presses enter
       print &quot;Hello, John! How are you?&quot; # The program prints Hello, John! How are you?
  elif name == &quot;Teddy&quot;:                  # If the person types Teddy and presses enter
       print &quot;Go away!&quot;                  # The Program prints Go Away!
  else:                                  # If the person types any thing else and the presses enter
       print &quot;Good day,&quot; , name          # The Program prints Good day followed by what the person typed
&lt;/source&gt;

===Weird Features===

Some weird features of Python include the fact that grouping is shown by how indented a line is. For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 if value == input:
    do this
&lt;/source&gt;

is not the same as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 if value == input:
  do this
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead, some languages prefer to have everything written like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 {if value
     == input[d
   o
       this
    ]
&lt;/source&gt;

In other languages, you can organize it in any way you want. It's different in Python.

      <comment>/* Optical isomerism */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Geometric isomerism ==
'''Geometric isomerism''', also known as '''cis-trans isomerism''', is commonly observed in alkenes.

''Cis'' is Latin for &quot;on this side of&quot; and refers to the isomer that has both substituents on the same side of the carbon-carbon double bond.

''Trans'' is Latin for &quot;across&quot; and refers to the isomer that has the substituents on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Cis-dichloroethylene-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''cis''-1,2-dichloroethene&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Trans-dichloroethylene-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''trans''-1,2-dichloroethene&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Cis-but-2-ene-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''cis''-but-2-ene&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Trans-but-2-ene-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''trans''-but-2-ene&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Rotation around an alkene double bond is restricted ===
[[Image:Ethylene-HOMO-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|A model of ethene, showing the regions of high electron density above and below the double bond]]

In alkenes, there is no free rotation about the double bond, unlike in alkanes. Consequently, groups attached to a double bonded carbon cannot exchange places. Therefore, the ''cis'' and ''trans'' isomers are separable compounds because they cannot interconvert.

Alkenes such as ethene (shown to the right) have a carbon-carbon double bond. In such a double bond, there is significant electron density above and below the plane of the bond. Rotation around the bond is greatly restricted by a large energy barrier. For rotation to occur, groups attached to one of the double-bonded carbons would have to temporarily occupy this high electron density region, resulting in very high repulsion between the electrons in the group and the electrons in the double bond.

Sometimes ''cis'' and ''trans'' isomers can interconvert, but this usually requires UV light to provide the energy to overcome the high rotational energy barrier.

=== Rotation around an alkane single bond is free ===
In alkanes, the situation is different. There is free rotation about the carbon-carbon bond because there are no regions of electron density above and below the bond that repel rotating groups. Whereas alkenes have ''cis'' and ''trans'' '''isomers''', alkanes have ''eclipsed'' and ''anti'' '''conformers'''. Unlike geometric isomers, conformers can interconvert with ease and cannot normally be isolated from each other — they are both molecules of the same compound, just in different rotational orientations.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:1,2-dichloroethane-anti-front-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''anti'' conformer of&lt;br&gt;1,2-dichloroethane&lt;br&gt;(front view)&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Optical isomerism ==
For compounds to exhibit optical isomerism, they need two have two '''non-superimposable mirror images'''.

For the purposes of this A-level, that means '''tetrahedral carbon with four different groups attached'''.

One approach is to store your template as a user prop and write it out when you need a new document.


storeDoc below is run once when you are preparing your application:
&lt;pre&gt;
on storedoc
  answer file &quot;Choose a template to use:&quot;
  if it is &quot;&quot; then exit storeDoc
  put it into tFile
  open file tFile
  read from file tfile until end
  close file Tfile
  define the UDoc of this proj
  set the uDoc of this proj to it
end storeDoc
&lt;/pre&gt;


newDoc when you want a new document:
&lt;pre&gt;
on newDoc
  ask file &quot;Name your doc:&quot;
  if it is &quot;&quot; then exit newDoc
  put it into tFile
  put the fileType into toldType
  set the fileType to RUNXMDOX
  --Or your standalone's creator and file Type
  open file tfile
  write the uDoc of this proj to file tfile
  close file tfile
  set the fileType to toldType

  set the itemdel to colon
  put last item of tfile into tWindowName
  set the name of wd 1 of proj tFile to tWindowName

  open proj tFile
end newDoc
&lt;/pre&gt;


With bundled apps it would also be possible to just store a template somewhere in the bundle and copy it out when you need a new project.

Obviously things can get a bit more complex if you want to open an untitled document which works like a standard document and needs to be explicitly saved.

== Print Versions ==

A print version has a singular purpose: to be printed. A printable version is typically not intended to be read in the web browser, but instead to be printed onto actual paper. For that reason, many of the templates that are used on print versions look lousy on the web browser, but look great when printed. Wikis present duality: On the internet they are very flexible, dynamic, and easy to edit. However, without some special effort, they tend to produce books which look lousy when printed. Printable versions of the book are very valuable to ensure it can reach the largest possible audience, but require special care to minimize author effort and maximize aesthetics.

A printable version which is difficult to update and maintain will fall back from the bleeding edge of the most recent version of the book. The result is a printable version which never reflects the most recent fixes and additions, and therefore is an anchor to prevent the book from growing. Also if you create a boring and repetitive task, such as having to make all edits twice (once for the wiki and once for the printable version), authors are going to be less likely to do both and may be less likely to do either. What's needed is a way to automatically fold all changes made on the wiki into the printable version with a minimum of repetitive effort from the authors and editors. A little bit of work upfront preparing things like navigation templates, print versions, and collections can help to automate this process and keep all versions of the book aligned.

=== Navigation Templates ===

Navigation templates often use colors and HTML/CSS formatting that doesn't always translate well to a printed medium. If your book has large navigation templates, it might be worthwhile to make them &quot;disappear&quot; in the printed version. This can be accomplished in one of several ways:

#Use &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;noprint&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the template to prevent it from being printed
#*'''Pros''': Doesn't print, can be used on any page (so individual chapters can be printed without the navigation template).
#*'''Cons''': Appears on the printable version, so it can cause worry. Even though it appears on the screen, it doesnt get sent to the printer, decreasing the relationship between &quot;what you see&quot; and &quot;what you get&quot;. Also, may still appear in a PDF generated using the [[Help:Collections|collections extension]] (more testing is needed to confirm this).
#Use parser functions to make the template invisible on the printable version page
#*'''Pros''': Don't appear on the printable version pages at all.
#*'''Cons''': Can be difficult to program them correctly. Templates will still appear on individual chapters, which means if you print an individual chapter you will see the templates. Templates generated in this way are also not portable between books, or even between multiple print editions in the same book.
#Use [[:Category:Exclude in print]]
*'''Pros''': Won't appear in PDFs or publish-on-demand books generated through the [[Help:Collections|collections extension]].
*'''Cons''': Will appear in normal print versions, and PDF versions generated by hand.
#Use printable template substitutions
#'''Pros''': Allows templates to be formatted differently on-wiki and in generated [[Help:Collections|collections]].
#'''Cons''': Doesn't have any effect in normal printable versions, or hand-generated PDF versions.

In reality, no single solution above is useful in all cases, and a combination of them is typically needed. It's important to keep print versions, PDF versions, and collections in mind when creating your new book because these are the most common vectors through which readers will be exposed to your book once it is written.

=== Cover Pages ===

A cover page is certainly optional, but it adds a certain professional look to a book that is hard to beat. Besides the printable and PDF versions, the cover page might never be seen at all on Wikibooks, so authors tend to view it as &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot;.

Some publishers may prefer a &quot;cover image&quot;, which will be dependent on the form factor used by the publisher. Since we only use PediaPress right now for print-on-demand publishing, and since they don't currently allow custom cover art, this point is basically moot. However, if a PDF of a book is taken to a different publisher, different rules and capabilities may apply. For printable versions and PDFs creating a cover page using HTML and wikitext is usually sufficient and easy to do once and forget about. For other applications such as publishing, different rules and requirements might be made that can't be easily done on the wiki. 

=== Licensing ===

In printed versions it is of paramount importance to include a copy of the GFDL. This can be accomplished by adding this template to the beginning of the book (right after the cover page):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{GFDL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

And adding this to the end of the book:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
= GNU Free Documentation License =
{{:GFDL}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Failure to take these easy steps could cause large problems, not only for you as an author, but for the entire Wikibooks project. Notice that the GFDL is automatically included in a collection.

=== Creating a Print Version ===

Creating a print version can be a difficult task. However, several Wikibooks users have created automated print version creator tools. These tools frequently require either the use of custom User JavaScripts or the use of external programs (most of the external programs for the purpose are written in Perl).

If you would like to use a custom User JavaScript for the purpose, I have written a tool for the creation of print versions:

{{User:Whiteknight/Print Version Gadget}}

Note: You won't be able to see this tool until you install the custom javascripts. Instructions to installing the javascripts are located at [[User:Whiteknight/Javascripts]]

== PDF Versions ==

There are three different schools of thought to the creation of a PDF version:

#Direct conversion of the printable version into a PDF, typically though some sort of PDF creation software. 
#Translation of the text and the formatting to LaTeX, and then creation of a PDF.
#The use of an automatic translator program, to convert Wiki syntax directly to a PDF, or to LaTeX and then to PDF.

The first approach relies on the MediaWiki software to convert the Wiki to HTML, and then the converter program to create the PDF. There are many free options to perform this conversion, and many professional software packages as well. It is important to remember that if you are using a &quot;Print to PDF&quot; converter, that you modify your print options to remove unnecessary page headers and other artifacts.

The second approach is the most time-consuming and also the most difficult to keep up to date. However, the benefit to this is that the book has available both a LaTeX version ''and'' a PDF version, which can be downloaded independently. This can be the most difficult option, especially if the authors of the book are not familiar with LaTeX formatting.

The third option is to use some sort of automatic converter program to convert the Wiki syntax into an appropriate form. The problem with this option, while it could conceptually be the easiest to use, is that no suitable converter software programs have been created for this purpose. There are programs in the works, of course, and dedicated volunteers are always working to improve these packages. 

A PDF version is the easiest version for a person to download and read. PDF versions can be read offline, and unlike a web browser, PDF versions are typically WYSIWYG, which means that the formatting does not magically change when you print it. As a caveat, remember that PDFs are static files that are not amenable to easy editing. Also, if the PDF is generated by hand and not through the collections extension, it can be hard to update or reproduce.

== Collections ==

Collections are easy to make, often by directly copying the TOC of the book and making a few minor formatting changes. Like a printable version, collections use pages on the wiki directly and are therefore kept up to date with all changes made to pages in the book. Collections can be used to create PDF versions of the book, but also for print-on-demand publishing from [http://www.pediapress.com PediaPress]. Automated tools such as my [[User:Whiteknight/Visual Book Designer|Visual Book Designer gadget]] can be used to create collections automatically from an outline or an existing book TOC. This feature is under active development still, so there are some bugs and limitations with it.

Because Collections stay updated with the most recent changes on the wiki (like print versions) and can be easily downloaded and distributed (like PDF versions), and because they have the added benefit of print-on-demand publishing, they are probably going to become the primary method of organizing and printing books in the future. Because the interface isn't quite as polished as I would like, and because it's not obvious enough how to get a PDF from a book to a new user, I'm not ready to say that print versions and PDF files need to be phased out yet, but it's definitely going to happen eventually. 

=== Creating Collections ===

Collections can be created in two different ways:

#Go to every page that you want in the collection and click the &quot;Add wiki page&quot; link on the left-hand side of the page. Repeat this for all pages in the book. Once you have added all the pages to the collection that you want, go to [[Special:Collection]] to save it, convert it to PDF or ODT, or purchase a Print-on-demand copy from PediaPress.
#Create a wiki page using a [[Help:Collections|particular syntax]]. This syntax is similar in some regards to how TOCs are created, but it's probably too simplistic to serve as a TOC by itself.

Luckily, my [[User:Whiteknight/Visual Book Designer|Visual Book Designer]] is already equipped to create Collections pages from an outline or from an existing book TOC. Load the book into the gadget (click '''File''' -&gt; '''Load TOC''' to get an existing book), and then click '''File''' -&gt; '''Save (as personal collection)''' or '''File''' -&gt; '''Save (as community collection)''' to create the collection page.

=== Loading Collections ===

To load an existing collection, go to the collection page and click the &quot;Load collection&quot; link on the left side bar. If you already have an active collection, you will be given the option to overwrite your collection with the saved collection, or to append one to the other.</text>

== What is a Child Version? ==

A typical wikibook is going to have a large number of pages, not all of which are needed for a single course of study. Consider the [[Calculus]] book: Calculus is typically broken up into multiple semesters of study. Students only need to learn about certain sections in each course, and any additional materials (even if they fall under the umbrella of &quot;calculus&quot;) are just wasted in a printed book. 

A child version, in essence, is a reuse of existing book pages in a second printable version. The pages in the primary printed version are rearranged, and unnecessary chapters are removed, in order to put the focus on a particular subset of the available information.

== Print Versioning ==

'''Print versioning''' is a verb that I use to describe the act of creating multiple print versions (child versions) of a book to suit different needs of the target audience. Consider the [[Control Systems]] book. The topic of Control Systems (or, more generally, &quot;Control Engineering&quot;) is typically broken down into sub-sections based on the length of the class (semester, trimester, year), and the level of the students. For instance, in my university, this topic was broken down into 3 semesters, and each semester used a different textbook!

Textbooks also need to follow certain standards. At the university level, things are a little more lax, but at the grade school level, there are clear standards in place that need to be met for a textbook to be considered as an acceptable text. Unfortunately for Wikibooks, these standards vary from place to place, and it would be impossible to write separate books on the same topic for different localized sets of standards. However, There are some good alternatives:

#Break material down into atomic chunks, and list a &quot;suggested reading order&quot; for each different localized set of standards.
#Create separate Tables of Contents (TOC) and separate print versions for each new localization, transcluding pages from a &quot;master work&quot; containing all pages. 

The second option is the best, and makes the best use of the wiki software. In this way, we only need to write all the content of the book once, and people can then prepare individual TOCs and print versions to suit their specific needs.

== Creating Child Versions ==

Creating a child version is typically as easy as copying your existing printable version to a new page, and rearranging the pages as necessary. Sometimes it is useful to create some meta-content pages for the child version, to specify what kinds of materials do and don't belong in that child version. Occasionally, it can be a good idea to create a separate TOC for the child version, although any inter-page navigation that your book uses (forward and back links) won't function properly in your child versions.

== Reading and Writing Versions ==

For a book that is sufficiently old and established, it might be worthwhile to create versions of the book that are specifically designed to be read, but not edited. The raw content pages can be transcluded into a &quot;formatting page&quot;, which contains necessary formatting to make the content more aesthetically appealing. To my knowledge there are currently no books that use this practice, although Several books attempted it in the past.</text>

Good point.  Plus instructions without mentioning 'microwave'.  I imagine every American house must have a microwave yet in countries where people eat properly, are healthy rather than obese and enjoy cooking you will not find a microwave!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

This book is constantly growing and developing, to encompass a global community of scholars here at Wikibooks.

Catullus is a common first choice for students of Latin. His poems are concise and elegant and not laden with unnecessarily complex grammar and vocabulary. But more importantly, he is a fun loving personality, who wrote about many themes as common today as they were then; love, betrayal, friendship, and rivalry. He is also one of the few writers of whom a nearly complete body of work has survived, the Carmina. While this may not have been the original order that Catullus intended, it tells us a rich and fluent story of his experiences, something like an ancient stream of consciousness and internal thoughts. This is a valuable window into the life of a fascinating man.

His works are also valuable for their literary excellence. Catullus was of the era of “Golden Latin”, considered in the past to be the pinnacle of Roman literature. He has also been classed with the Latin “Neoterics” or “poetae novi” as Cicero degradingly called them. These were young poets and writers who broke away from the conventions of long epics and historical writing to try to express themselves through short, light hearted verses about the ordinary concerns of the average man. Horace, Ovid and Propertius were also part of this new literary revolution. Whilst epic and historical narratives are important resources for a historian, it is the complaints and celebration of an ordinary man that speaks across the millennia. Lust for a beautiful girl, a sinking feeling of despair and a tortured mind, forced to accept the truth are as relevant to modern humankind as they were to the Ancient Romans. Many of the techniques and ideas in Catullus’s poetry are still common in today’s popular writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many mathematics students have trouble understanding the reason why set theory is important. This is true especially since the introduction many students receive to mathematics is based upon arithmetic and algebra, rather than calculus. To understand why set theory is important, we should look at the fundamental question of what mathematics is. The engineer's viewpoint of mathematics is that it is a tool to solve problems, the scientist uses it to describe reality, the statistician uses it to build models, but what is mathematics to the mathematician?

==Who Cares?==
Descartes said it well when he said that &quot;mathematics is a more powerful instrument of knowledge than any other that has been bequeathed to us by human agency.&quot; In mathematics, we have a fully formalized discipline - there is no subjectivity, because everything is based upon rules and definitions. While these rules are taught to children as the immutable &quot;way that mathematics works,&quot; they are in fact only conveniences. Any defined set of rules is a valid construct in mathematics, but some (the ones that are studied) are more interesting than others. For instance, if we were to redefine equality of numbers so that any two numbers were equal, we would have a well defined system, but there are very few interesting things to say about it, since every proposition is true in such a system.

To answer our second question, then, mathematics is the building of interesting systems. We are still left with a confusion about why we would discuss this particularly in the context of set theory, which leads us to some history of the concept. In the middle of the 19th century, mathematics was formless and void—the Greek concept of rigorous proofs had been displaced by vagueness, and the rigor of a coherent set theory was still in the future. It was around this time that De Morgan and Boole began to write about logic, as a branch of mathematics. This was important to mathematics, because until this point, mathematical proofs were convincing arguments, but were not formalized. 

With the rediscovery of formal mathematics, Georg Cantor asked some very puzzling questions about infinity that undermined some very obvious notions. For instance, he started to claim that there was more than one infinity, and that they were different sizes. The furor and disputes, which were partially caused by ambiguousness in Newton's works concerning infinity and infinitesimals, led to a formalization of what numbers are. Because of this, all of modern mathematics was re-built using set theory, so that all of modern mathematics is in some sense just applications of the notion of a set.

==What is a Set?==
Before commencing our study of sets, we will comment on what a set is, and why they are used in mathematics. In many ways, a set is the simplest possible conceptual object, from which the rest of mathematics can be rigorously developed. It is conceptually easiest to start where set theory does. Everything in set theory is formed based on the empty set, denoted &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{\} \,&lt;/math&gt;. Other sets can contain the empty set, so that the set &lt;math&gt;\{\emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt; is a simple set containing only the empty set. We can build sets of varying complexity based on this idea; &lt;math&gt;\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}&lt;/math&gt; would be a set containing two items: the empty set, and the set containing the empty set.

== The Role of Assumptions ==


Imagine that we have some observations, and we want to use them to conclude something about the world around us. Statistics can help us in the common case when the observations are composed of a systematic component combined with random chance effects. A classic &quot;toy&quot; example is that of dice. Let us say that we wish to analyse the following result, obtained by rolling a die five times.

{|align=&quot;center&quot;
! !!Rolls
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[image:D6 2.svg|20px]]||2
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[image:D6_3.svg|20px]]||3
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[image:D6_6.svg|20px]]||6
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[image:D6_6.svg|20px]]||6
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[image:D6_6.svg|20px]]||6
|}

Although as a general rule, your first step should be to plot your data, there is little point in this instance. The dataset is so small that we can get a feel for it by just inspecting the numbers. The main striking feature is that we seem to have a preponderance of 6's, although this could, of course, be due to chance.

We could just treat the sequence {2,3,6,6,6} as a unique, arbitrary sequence of events. But this is rather pointless: data is usually analysed in order to seek general patterns, and by generalizing, increase our understanding. In this case, we might wish to use the result to decide whether the die is loaded in favour of sixes, and so if it can be relied upon to play a game. 

Naively, we might hope to analyse this with a completely open mind; to approach the situation with no prior assumptions. A moment's thought should reveal this is impossible. For example, imagine that the die was a fraudster's dream: a sophisticated miniature machine that could be pre-programmed to give a particular sequence of numbers each day. If could, for example, be programmed to give a 2, followed by a 3, then three 6's, and spend the rest of the day rolling 1's. In this case, the results tally exactly with what we have observed, but they do not tell us anything about the subsequent behaviour of the die. Although it explains the data perfectly, most people would (quite reasonably) adopt the prior assumption that the &quot;miniature machine&quot; explanation was highly unlikely. 

This is, of course, an extreme example, but it illustrates the point. Whether or not we realise it, we ''always'' examine data with prior notions of what is a reasonable explanation and what is not. Statistical analysis is the process of formalising these explanations, then using the data to choose between them. A good way to do this is by describing the '''assumptions''' that we have made in each case. For example, the following two assumptions are common to nearly all explanations that we might want to test.

; The Assumption of Honesty : We assume that the data has been collected and reported “honestly”. This might not be the case if the data has been deliberately altered, or certain values have been “censored”. In our toy example, this might happen if say, the first four rolls were all 1's but the observer discarded these because this seemed  an &quot;unusual pattern”. Although dishonesty might seriously alter our conclusions, all we can do is to assume it has not taken place.

; The Assumption of Random Error : We assume that the data have been affected by a process of “random chance”, causing the results to vary from one instance to the next in an unpredictable manner. In this case of the die, small changes in the way in which it is thrown and its subsequent tumbling and contact with the surface combine to produce one of six outcomes.  Statisticians often (somewhat confusingly) refer to this process of chance as the source of “error” in the data. Describing the way in which chance works usually entails a whole set of other assumptions, which is the focus of  [[../Chapter 3| Chapter 3]].

=== Making the assumptions clear === 
The problem with making any assumptions is that they are just that: assumptions. They may or may not not be true. When trying to convince others with our analysis, we are asking them to take our assumptions on trust. For this reason we should try to make widely accepted assumptions and, more importantly, ensure they are completely explicit. That way, others can decide for themselves if the analysis is to be trusted. We can encapsulate this most easily and concisely by formulating a '''model''' of the underlying process.

== Modelling reality ==

A common way of understanding the world around us is to describe it in terms of a '''model'''. The more

Many basic statistics books teach simple tests, such as the t-test or sign-test. These are all based on an underlying model.

So what does an appropriate model look like? There are various ways in which we can 

=== Some verbal models ===

Testing a particular model.
; Model 1 — a completely biased die : the die always gives a 6 when thrown. No extra assumptions are needed here, and in this extreme case, there is no error process.
We can easily disprove this by a single observation. However, we can never prove it. This turns out to be generally true. It is impossible to prove that something is the case, because there could always be a 


; Model 2 — a fair die: Here is a more complicated model, with the following assumptions
:* Each roll has 6 possible outcomes, with a number from 1-6 selected each time. This is sampling &quot;with replacement&quot;. Defines the set of possibilities (the sample space)
:* The assumption of independence: one roll does not tell us anything extra about what will happen on a subsequent roll.
:* The assumption of homogeneity: the chance of any outcome is the same for each roll
:* Fairness: There is an equal chance of any of the 6 being chosen each number being equally probable. The 

If the model contains an element of chance, how can we know whether ***

Once we have our models, we could either
* try to disprove this model (although, because in this case there is always a slight chance of 6 in a row, we can never completely
* compare the models in order to find out which is better

The simplest is simulation (compare to likelihood)

=== Simulating a model ===

One of the major ways in which we can use models is simulation. This will be a major way in which models are explored in this book. To do so, we need to convert the various models described above into simulations. The &quot;fair die&quot; model above provides a good, simple example. We will convert this model to a simulation in R. This involves learning a little about how R deals with numbers, so you should check that you are comfortable with the idea of '''functions''' in R, as described [[../Statistics and R#Functions|previously]].

== Testing Models ==

We can try to disprove a particular model, or select between different models using some informed judgement

Various ways to test a model. E.g. compare results from the simulation with the observed ones

We now have a simple method of simulating data produced by the model. How can we 

Now that we can simulate  How do we ***. We are unlikely to get exactly the sequence we observed. A classic method is to use a '''sample statistic'''. If we got 3 fives or 3 ones we would also be surprised. Link to idea of probability space.

The sample statistics

 {{Code:Interpreted
|title=Combining functions
|code=RCode
|To calculate our sample statistic, we first need a way of counting the frequency of each number in a vector. R provides function called tabulate() which does exactly that. We can then use the function max() to find the most frequent
|&lt;pre&gt;tabulate(c(2,3,6,6,6))         #an example: we can see that the &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;max(tabulate(c(2,3,6,6,6)))         #simply confirms what  &lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Belarusian''' is an East-Slavic language spoken by over 9 million people as a first language in Belarus and in other countries. The languages most similar to Belarusian are Russian, Ukrainian and Polish. At first, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian were considered during the Kievan Rus era (c.862- c. 1240) as one common language known as Old Russian or old East Slavic. Slowly, the languages evolved due to subjugation from Polish-Lithuania as well as Austrian empire, which is marked by a large number of Polish (and other loan words) words in Ukrainian and Belarusian.

[[File:Flag of Belarus.svg|thumbnail|300px|The flag of Belarus]]

Belarusian exists in two forms, the official and the classical. This is due to the 1933 reform of the Belarusian language, which was not recognized by all Belarusians. The official (post-reform) language is dominant in Belarus while the classical (pre-reform) variety is maintained mainly by Belarusian emigrants in European and American countries. The official language is often referred to as наркамаўка &quot;narkamauka&quot; (i.e. the language of the narkam - narodnyi kamisaryiat, the soviet executive body that carried out the 1933 reform) while the classical variant is called тарашкевiца &quot;tarashkevitsa&quot; (the language of Bronislav Tarashkevich, who adopted the classical grammar and spelling of the language).

Belarusian historically had three alphabets: Cyrillic, almost identical to Russian, which is the official alphabet; Latin, similar to Polish or Lithuanian, which used to dominate in Polish-dominated Belarus during the interwar era, was never popular among Belarusians and is very rarely used even today; and Arabic, which was used by Muslim people during the Mongolian era (1240-1480) and by Muslims is now a kind of curiosity.

This book is based on Cyrillic &quot;narkamauka&quot; modern spelling reform of 1933, though we shall pay attention to spelling and grammar peculiarities of the classical variant.

Belarusian (sometimes obsoletely called Byelorussian or Belorussian, meaning &quot;White Russian&quot;) can be a very tricky language to learn, especially if you don't have at least a basic knowledge of either Russian or Ukrainian. However, if you do know some Russian or Ukrainian, you'll be surprised how similar they are as they share the same alphabet (with a few cosmetic differences among themselves), the same grammatical rules, pitfalls, and a common history among them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sets and elements ==

A mathematical ''set'' is defined as an unordered collection of distinct elements. That is, elements of a set can be listed in any order and elements occurring more than once are equivalent to occurring only once.

We say that an element ''is a member of'' a set. An ''element'' of a set can be anything. It's easiest to begin with only numbers as elements. For that reason, most of the examples in this book will only include numbers, but this is only a technique to make the topic less abstract.

=== Terminology ===

For a set ''A'' having an element ''x'', the following are all used synonymously:

: ''x'' is a member of ''A''
: ''x'' is  contained in ''A''
: ''x'' is included in ''A''
: ''x'' is an element of the set ''A''
: ''A'' contains ''x''
: ''A'' includes ''x''

=== Notation ===

We specify a set by specifying its members.  The curly brace notation is used for this purpose.

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is the set containing 1, 2, and 3 as members.  Or, {mother, this ipod, my school, the planet Jupiter, 12} is also a set. The curly brace notation can be extended to specify a set by specifying a rule for set membership. (&quot;|&quot; means &quot;such that&quot;.)

: &lt;math&gt;\{x\ |\ x = 1\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 2\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is again the set containing 1, 2, and 3 as members.

: &lt;math&gt;\{x\ |\ x\ \mathrm{is\ a\ natural\ number}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is the set of all natural numbers. This form or representing set can be generalized as:

: &lt;math&gt;\! \{x\ |\ P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;

where P(x) is a statement about the variable x. The set defined by above notation is a set of all objects x such that P(x) is true.

A modified epsilon notation is used for set membership.  Thus

: &lt;math&gt;x \in A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

means that x is a member of A.  We can also say that x is not a member of A:

: &lt;math&gt;x \notin A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Characteristics of sets ===

A set is uniquely identified by its members.

: &lt;math&gt;\{x\ |\ x\ \mathrm{is\ an\ even\ prime}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{x\ |\ x\ \mathrm{is\ a\ positive\ square\ root\ of}\ 4\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{2\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the sets A and B are said to be equal if and only if every element of A is also an element of B, and every element of B is an element of A.

All the above expressions specify the same set even though the concept of an even prime is different from the concept of a positive square root.  Repetition of members is inconsequential in specifying a set.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{x\ |\ x\ \mathrm{is\ an\ even\ prime\ or}\ x\ \mathrm{is\ a\ positive\ square\ root\ of}\ 4\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 1\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 2\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the same set.


Sets are unordered.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{3,\ 2,\ 1\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{2,\ 1,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the same set.

Sets can have other sets as members.  There is, for example, the set

: &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,\ 2\},\ \{2,\ 3\},\ \{1,\ \mathrm{Newton}\}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Some special sets ===

As stated above, sets are defined by their members. However some sets are given names to ease referencing them.

The set with no members is the ''empty'' or ''null'' set.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varnothing\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{x | x \ne x\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the empty set.

A set with exactly one member is called a ''singleton''.  A set with exactly two members is called a ''pair''.  Thus {1} is a singleton and {1, 2} is a pair.

== Subsets, power sets, set operations ==

=== Subsets ===

A set ''S'' is a ''subset'' of set ''A'' if every member of ''S'' is a member of ''A''.  We use the horseshoe notation to indicate subsets.  The expression

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2\} \subseteq \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

says that {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3}.  The empty set is a subset of every set.  Every set is a subset of itself.  A ''proper subset'' of ''A'' is a subset of ''A'' that is not identical with ''A''.  The expression

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2\} \subset \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

says that {1, 2} is a proper subset of {1, 2, 3}.

=== Power sets ===

A ''power set'' of a set is the set of all its subsets.  A script 'P' is used for the power set. Note that the empty set and the set itself are members of the power set.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\{1,\ 2,\ 3\} = \{\varnothing,\ \{1\},\ \{2\},\ \{3\},\ \{1,\ 2\},\ \{1,\ 3\},\ \{2,\ 3\},\ \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Union ===

The ''union'' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'', is the set that contains all the members of ''A'' and all the members of ''B'' (and nothing else).  That is,

: &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \{x | x \in A\ \mathrm{or}\ x \in B\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As an example,

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\ \cup\ \{2,\ 3,\ 4\} = \{1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Intersection ===

The ''intersection'' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'', is the set that contains everything that is a member of both ''A'' and ''B'' (and nothing else).  That is,

: &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{x | x \in A\ \mathrm{and}\ x \in B\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As an example,

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\ \cap\ \{2,\ 3,\ 4\} = \{2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Two sets are ''disjoint'' if their intersection is empty. That is, if ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint sets,

:&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relative complement ===

The ''relative complement'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted ''B'' \ ''A'' (sometimes ''B'' &amp;minus; ''A''), is the set containing all the members of ''B'' that are not members of ''A''.  That is,

: &lt;math&gt;B \setminus A = \{x| x \in B\ \mathrm{and}\ x \notin A\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As an example,

: &lt;math&gt;\{2,\ 3,\ 4\} \setminus \{1,\ 3\} = \{2,\ 4\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Absolute complement ===

If we define a ''universe'', or a set containing all of the elements we wish to consider, then we can discuss the ''absolute complement'' of a set. For a universe ''U'', define the absolute complement of a subset ''A'' of ''U'' to be 

:&lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute complement of ''A'' is denoted by &lt;math&gt;A^C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\complement_U A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\complement A&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[w:ISO 31-11|ISO 31-11 standard]]) if ''U'' is fixed.

== Some properties of set operations ==

=== Union and intersection ===

Based on the preceding definitions, we can derive some useful properties for the operations on sets. The proofs of these properties are left as an exercise to the reader. 

The union and intersection operations are symmetric. That is, if ''A'' and ''B'' are sets,

: &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = B \cap A&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = B \cup A&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, they are associative. That is, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are sets,

:&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, union distributes over intersection and intersection distributes over union. That is, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are sets,

:&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;

=== De Morgan's laws ===

Two important propositions for sets are ''De Morgan's laws''. They state that, for sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'',

:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus (B \cup C) = (A \setminus B) \cap (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \setminus (B \cap C) = (A \setminus B) \cup (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;

When ''A'' is a universe to which ''B'' and ''C'' belong, De Morgan's laws can be stated more simply as,

:&lt;math&gt;(B \cup C)^C = B^C \cap C^C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(B \cap C)^C = B^C \cup C^C&lt;/math&gt;

== Families of sets ==

A set of sets is usually referred to as a ''family'' or ''collection'' of sets. Often, families of sets are written with either a script or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_(script) Fraktur] font to easily distinguish them from other sets. For a family of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt;, define the ''union'' and ''intersection'' of the family by,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathfrak{A} = \bigcup_{A \in \mathfrak{A}} A = \{x | x \mbox{ is in some } A \in \mathfrak{A}\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap \mathfrak{A} = \bigcap_{A \in \mathfrak{A}} A = \{x | x \mbox{ is in all } A \in \mathfrak{A}\}&lt;/math&gt;

For a family of sets, we say that it is ''pairwise disjoint'' if any two distinct sets we choose from the family are disjoint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter contains the most &quot;pure maths&quot; concepts of the book. It is intended to demonstrate 3 main concepts of probability, using two complementary graphical methods. This may make it easier to understand the concepts of likelihood and Bayesian techniques used in the next chapter. However, If you already know some probabiltiy theory, or are willing to accept the 3 probabilty concepts below, then you may wish to move on the Chapter 3.

A link to the wiki prob book

# Mutually exclusive additivity p(a or b) = P(a) + P(b)
# p(a and b), 
## concept of independence
# Conditional probability
## Bayes' Theorem

Methods to use

Do this graphically. I have a few ideas of how.

'''''Melissa''''' a genus of five species of perennial herbs native to Europe and Asia. The name ''Melissa'' is derived from a Greek word meaning bee, owing to the abundance of nectar in the flowers which attracts bees.  

==Description==
The stems are square, like all other plants in the mint family. The leaves are borne in opposite pairs on the stems, and are usually ovate or heart-shaped and emit a lemony scent when bruised.  Axillary spikes of white or yellowish flowers appear in the summer.

==Growing conditions==
They are very frost hardy plants which prefer full sun or light shade if summers are hot. They are quick growing, and look especially good along paths, herb gardens, or among ferns when grown in pots. Slightly moist, well-drained soil is best.  ''M. officinalis'' has become naturalised in many parts of the world.

==Species==
*''[[../Melissa axillaris/]]'' (Benth.) Bakh.f.
*''[[../Melissa bicornis/]]'' Klokov
*''[[../Melissa flava/]]'' Benth. ex Wall.
*''[[../Melissa officinalis/]]'' L.
*''[[../Melissa yunnanensis/]]'' C.Y.Wu &amp; Y.C.Huang

==Uses==
The most commonly grown species of this genus is ''Melissa officinalis''. It is native to southern Europe. It can grow up to 1.5 m high and is grown mainly for its lemon-scented leaves.  Small white flowers appear in late summer, which attract bees. It spreads rapidly, and can become an [[invasive species]] if left unchecked. The leaves can be used for a calming herbal tea, fruit salads, jellies, iced tea, and a substitute for lemon peel in cooking.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagate from seed sown in spring. Variegated forms are propagated by root division or from young spring cuttings.

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

'''Lemon balm''' (''Melissa officinalis'')is a perennial herb in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region.

==Description==
It grows to 70-150 cm tall. The leaves have a lemon scent and taste. At the end of the summer, little white flowers full of nectar appear. These attract bees, hence the genus name ''Melissa'' (Greek for 'honey bee'). Its flavour comes from the terpenes citronellal, citronellol, citral, and geraniol. Lemon Balm grows in clumps and spreads vegetatively as well as by seed. In mild temperate zones, the stems of the plant die off at the start of the winter, but shoot up again in spring. 

==Growing conditions==
This herb can be easy to cultivate in United States Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zones 4 to 9. In zone 4, it needs winter mulch and a well-drained sandy soil to survive. In zone 7, it can be harvested through late autumn. It is moderately shade-tolerant, much more so than most herbs. In dry climates, it grows best in partial shade.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
It is used as a flavouring in tisane and ice cream, but its most common use is to make herbal teas. It makes a particularly refreshing iced tea, especially when mixed with other herbs such as spearmint. It is also often paired with fruit dishes or candies.

Lemon balm essential oil is very popular in aromatherapy. The essential oil is commonly co-distilled with lemon oil, citronella oil, or other oils.

The crushed leaves, when rubbed on the skin, are used as a repellant for mosquitos.

Lemon Balm is also used medicinally as a herbal tea, or in extract form.  It is claimed to have antibacterial, antiviral properties, and it is also used as a mild sedative or calming agent.  At least one study has found it to be effective at reducing stress, although the study's authors call for further research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kennedy | first = D.O. | coauthors = W. Little, A.B. Scholey. | year = 2004 | title = Attenuation of laboratory-induced stress in humans after acute administration of Melissa officinalis (Lemon Balm) | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 607-613}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its antibacterial properties have also been demonstrated scientifically, although they are markedly weaker than those from a number of other plants studied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nascimento | first = G.G.F. | coauthors = J. Locatelli, P.C. Freitas, G.L. Silva | year = 2002 | title = Antibacterial activity of plant extracts and phytochemicals on Antibiotic-resistant bacteria | journal = Brazilian Journal of Microbiology  | volume = 31 | issue = 4}} &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
It can be easily grown from stem cuttings rooted in water, or from seeds. Under ideal conditions, it will seed itself prolifically and can become a nuisance in gardens.

==Harvesting==
Harvest fresh, using the leaves.

      <comment>/* Belarusian Alphabet */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Belarusian Alphabet==

The Belarusian alphabet is based on the Cyrillic writing system. It is virtually identical to the Russian alphabet, differing from it just in a few points:
* ''i'' is used instead of ''и''
* ''ў'' letter, specific to Belarusian, is used to denote short ''u'' sound
* ''шч'' combination is used instead of ''щ''
* ' (апостроф/apostrophe) is used instead of ''ъ'' or the hard sign.

The Belarusian alphabet contains 32 letters:

'''Аа''' - a  - pronounced like ''a'' in ''art''

'''Бб''' - be  - pronounced like ''b'' in ''body''

'''Вв''' - ve  - pronounced like ''v'' in ''van''

'''Гг''' - he  - has no correspondence in English; the voiced analog of ''х''; occasionally pronounced like ''g'' in ''guest''

'''Дд''' - de  - pronounced like ''d'' in ''desk''

'''Ее''' - e/ye  - pronounced, depending on position, either like a long ''e'' after consonant as in  ''Lenin'' or ''ye'' in ''yes'' (Initially, after vowel or any of the two signs).

'''Ёё''' - o/yo  - pronounced, either like ''o'' in ''shore'' (only after Ч, Ш, Ж or ШЧ)  or ''yo'' in ''York''. Either way, ''always stressed''

'''Жж''' - zhe - pronounced like ''s'' in ''pleasure''

'''Зз''' - ze  - pronounced like ''z'' in ''zoo''

'''Іі''' - i   - pronounced like ''i'' in ''machine''

'''Йй''' - i nieskladovaye &quot;non-syllabic y&quot; - pronounced like ''y'' in ''toy''

'''Кк''' - ka - pronounced like ''k'' in ''kitten''

'''Лл''' - el - pronounced like ''l'' in ''lamp''

'''Мм''' - em - pronounced like ''m'' in ''map''

'''Нн''' - en - pronounced like ''n'' in ''net''; pronounced like a Spanish ñ after i or e.

'''Оо''' - o - pronounced like ''o'' in ''sort'': usually, but not ''always'' stressed

'''Пп''' - pe - pronounced like ''p'' in ''park''

'''Рр''' - er - differs largely from English ''r'' sound; similar to Italian ''r'' in ''ridere''

'''Сс''' - es - pronounced like ''s'' in ''Sun''

'''Тт''' - te - pronounced like ''t'' in ''top''

'''Уу''' - u - pronounced like ''u'' in ''put''

'''Ўў''' - u nieskladovaye &quot;non-syllabic u&quot; - pronounced like the ''w'' in ''know''

'''Фф''' - ef - pronounced like ''f'' in ''fox''

'''Хх''' - kha - pronounced harder than English ''h'' sound; similar to German ''ch'' in ''Buch''

'''Цц''' - tse - pronounced like ''ts'' as in ''cats''; similar to German ''z'' in ''Zeit'' or Italian ''z'' in ''canzone''

'''Чч''' - cha - pronounced like ''ch'' in ''chalk''

'''Шш''' - sha - pronounced like ''sh'' in ''shelf''

'''Ыы''' - y - pronounced like ''y'' in ''myth''

'''Ьь''' - miakki znak &quot;soft sign&quot; - not pronounced: softens previous consonant and, if in any position except the end, separates syllables

'''Ээ''' - e - pronounced like ''e'' in ''end'': if found after a consonant, it is shorter than the previous &quot;e&quot; mentioned above.

'''Юю''' - yu - pronounced like a yu as in &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;; 

'''Яя''' - ya - pronounced, like &quot;ya&quot; in &quot;yard&quot; or &quot;Goya&quot;

'''NOTE'''. In tarashkievitsa, letter '''Ґґ''' (ge) is also used to denote the sound ''g'' (as in english ''guest''). Narkamauka uses ''г'' letter instead. The position of ''ґ'' in the classical Belarusian alphabet is immediately after ''г'', before ''д''. Thus there are 33 letters in tarashkievitsa. Sometimes in tarashkievitsa combinations '''ДЖдж''' and '''ДЗдз''' are given the status of letters on their own.

==Exercises==
===1. Cities===

Try to read and recognize the names of some cities. Confer the hint below if you have difficulties. Note that &quot;'' ́''&quot; is a stress sound (which is normally omitted). Also note that proper names in Belarusian, as in most other languages, are capitalized.

'''Масква́'''

'''Ло́ндан'''

'''Варша́ва'''

'''Амстэрда́м'''

'''Стамбу́л'''

''Hint'': Maskva (Moscow), Londan (London), Varshava (Warsaw), Amsterdam, Stambul (Istanbul)

===2. Animals===

Try to read and remember Belarusian names of some animals. Confer the pronunciation hint below if you have difficulties. Pay special attention to the stress - like Russian and Ukrainian, there is no fixed stress position in Belarusian, and stressing the wrong syllable (or even missing out a sign) can create misunderstandings. Virtually every book and dictionary concerning these three languages place an accent in the tonic syllable, so make sure you do the same . Note that ''о'' is normally stressed in Belarusian.

'''кот''' - a cat (male)

'''ко́шка''' - a cat (female)

'''саба́ка''' - a dog

'''каро́ва''' - a cow

'''каза́''' - a goat (female)

'''бара́н''' - a sheep (male)

'''пту́шка''' - a bird (general)

'''варо́на''' - a crow

'''саро́ка''' - a magpie

'''ка́чка''' - a duck

'''жа́ба''' - a toad

'''слон''' - an elephant

''Hint'': kot, koshka, sabaka, karova, kaza, baran, ptushka, varona, saroka, kachka, zhaba, slon

      <text xml:space="preserve">FMT studies logics on finite structures.  An outline of the most important of these objects of study is given here.

==Logics==
The logics defined here and used throughout the book are always relational, i.e. without function symbols, and finite, i.e. have a finite universe, without further notice.


===Fragments of FO===
The subsequent restrictions can analogously be found in other logics like SO.
* MFO ...
* ESO and USO ...
* FO&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ...

===Second Order Logic (SO)===
[[w:Second-order logic|Second-order logic]] extends first-order logic by adding variables and quantifiers that range over sets of individuals.  For example, the second-order sentence &lt;math&gt;\forall S \, \forall x \, ( x \in S \lor x \not \in S)&lt;/math&gt; says that for every set ''S'' of individuals and every individual ''x'', either ''x'' is in ''S'' or it is not. That is, the rules are extended by:
* If X is a n-ary relation variable and t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are terms then X t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a formula
* If φ is a formula and X a relation variable then &lt;math&gt;\exists_X \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula

===Fragments of Second Order Logic===
* The fragment monadic second-order logic ('''MSO''') only unary relation variables (&quot;set variables&quot;)are allowed.
* The existential fragment ('''ESO''') is second-order logic without universal second-order quantifiers, and without negative occurrences of existential second-order quantifiers.
* '''USO''' ...

===Infinitary Logics===
====Notion====
The intention is to extend FO by an infinite disjunction element over a set ψ of formulas (of infinitary logic)

&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \psi&lt;/math&gt; 

So the following infinitary logics can be defined
* &lt;math&gt;L_{\infty \varpi}&lt;/math&gt; where ψ is an arbitrary set of formulas, e.g. uncountable
* &lt;math&gt;L_{\varpi \varpi}&lt;/math&gt; where ψ is a countable set of formulas 
* &lt;math&gt;L_{\infty \varpi}^n&lt;/math&gt; ...
====Definition====
syntax ...

semantics ...

====Properties====

===General Quantifier Logics===

===Fixed Point Logics===

===Counting Logics===

==Structures==

===Finite Graphs===

===Kinds of Finite Graphs===

===Strings===

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''''Dumbledore's Army''''' (D.A.) is the secret [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] group founded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], with assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]].

== Event Details ==

Professor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts']] new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|fifth year]], only lectures on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]-approved theory from the textbook, and refuses to teach real defensive magic. Within the first two weeks of classes, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] has seen how stultifying and useless this form of teaching is, and with the assistance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], suggests to Harry that it would be a good idea to have someone teach the students real Defence Against the Dark Arts, rather than the useless &quot;conciliation techniques&quot; currently being taught only through books. When Harry agrees to this, Hermione tentatively suggests that the appropriate teacher would be Harry himself. Harry is surprised when Ron agrees that he is the logical choice.

Although Harry initially feels he is unqualified to teach Defensive Arts to any interested classmates, he reluctantly agrees after Hermione and Ron convince him he has gained considerable knowledge on the subject through their experiences in the past four years. Hermione then invites &quot;a couple of students&quot; to meet at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]] on their next [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade weekend]] to discuss forming a group to learn real Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry is stunned when Hermione's &quot;couple of students&quot; ends up numbering 25; Hermione simply says &quot;The idea did seem quite popular.&quot; The group originally calls themselves the ''Defence Association'', or D.A. for short.

The Members Of Dumbledore's Army include: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbott]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Susan Bones|Susan Bones]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Terry Boot|Terry Boot]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dennis Creevey|Dennis Creevey]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Anthony Goldstein|Anthony Goldstein]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Padma Patil|Padma Patil]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvarti Patil]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alicia Spinnet|Alicia Spinnet]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred Weasley, George Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Seamus Finnigan is a late-joining member; not present at the initial meeting in The Hog's Head, the first meeting he attended turned out to be the final meeting of the group.

Shortly after the initial meeting, a new Educational Decree is posted by Umbridge banning unapproved student groups. Harry and Ron are convinced that someone has told Umbridge about the DA, but Hermione says nobody could have. She reminded Harry and Ron that she had passed a parchment around that everyone had signed their names on in the meeting. The parchment was jinxed so that anyone who betrayed the group after signing it would break out in severe facial blemishes. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] to speak to Harry about this organization. He reveals that Umbridge's choice of teaching philosophy is because the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] is worried that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] may be trying to raise a private army of students to attack the Ministry itself. Umbridge has been placed at the school as a teacher by the Ministry, and remains loyal to the Ministry. Sirius Black mentions to Harry that he knows that they are starting the Defensive Arts group. He says that a heavily veiled witch that Harry and Hermione had noted was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] in disguise, there to keep an eye on Harry's activities for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order]]. Sirius passes on a message from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Ron's mother]] forbidding Ron from having anything to do with the DA, and appealing to Harry and Hermione to likewise give up the idea. Sirius himself, however, says he strongly supports the idea of the group.

There is concern for some time as to where the group can have meetings. Various suggestions are made and rejected for practical reasons. Finally, Harry happens to ask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] if he knows of a place, and Dobby tells Harry about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. This is a room which appears when a person really needs it, in the form that the person needs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass on the description of the Room to other members of the Defence Association, and then go to the room themselves. When it appears for them, it is perfect, stocked with everything they need for a Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Hermione, who has been unsure about using the Room of Requirement for a meeting place due to its nature, agrees that it is a good idea. At their first full meeting, they change the name of the group to &quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot; to show their loyalty to the Headmaster and to mock the paranoia of the Ministry of Magic.

Meetings are irregular, as they have to be fit around the three different participating house's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] practices. Hermione provides fake [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]] that allow DA members to send messages. The spell used to do this is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|Protean Charm]], which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Terry Boot|Terry Boot]] says is &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level magic]]&quot;. For several months, Harry secretly teaches the signed up students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. Under Harry's effective tutoring, the D.A. members learn many advanced defensive techniques, starting with the simple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament charm]] and proceeding to the NEWT-level [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]]. Neville struggles to learn these charms throughout the meetings, but eventually he becomes very successful. Many of the members of the DA find themselves considering ''Dumbledore's Army'' to be like a second family.  

''Dumbledore's Army'' abruptly ends in March when D.A. member and Ravenclaw student [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]] reveals its existence to Umbridge. Umbridge then sets a raid by her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Inquisitorial Squad|''Inquisitorial Squad'']], comprised of Slytherin students and led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], to bring in those behind the DA. Umbridge's attempt to detain members of the Army is thwarted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], who defies Umbridge's orders and warns Harry. Harry sends the rest of the group away, and is the only group member captured. He is taken to Dumbledore's office, where he finds Dumbledore, along with Umbridge, the Minister for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] (along to record the meeting), and a pair of Aurors, one of whom ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]]) Harry recognizes as being in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]].

Umbridge's star witness, Marietta, proves less than useful, as it seems Kingsley has performed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory charm]] on her secretly to keep Harry out of trouble. However, the membership list for the D. A. was retrieved by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]], and the title on the paper, &quot;''Dumbledore's Army''&quot;, causes some consternation. This title allows Dumbledore to claim responsibility for forming the group, thus protecting the students in general and Harry in particular. The Ministry's subsequent attempt to arrest Dumbledore results in his spectacular departure from Hogwarts. Umbridge is appointed Headmistress in his place, but is apparently not able to enter the Headmaster's office.

It is later implied that Umbridge illegally used a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|truth potion]] on Marietta to get her to tell the details about Dumbledore's Army, though it seems the original impetus had to be Marietta's. For betraying Dumbledore's Army, permanent purple pustules spelling &quot;SNEAK&quot; had erupted across Marietta's face courtesy of Hermione's jinxed parchment.

With the appointment of a competent Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry's sixth year]] ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]), there is little need to re-start Dumbledore's Army. Harry does put out a call to the members of the DA for assistance when he knows Dumbledore will be leaving the school temporarily, but only five members respond: Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, and Ginny Weasley. Providing them with the remnants of his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|''Felix Felicis'' luck potion]], Harry sets them to watch the Room of Requirement, where Draco has been working, and Severus Snape, who he believes is working with Draco.

In what would be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Harry's seventh year]], Neville, Luna, and Ginny restart Dumbledore's Army as a means of rebelling against Hogwarts' new emphasis on Dark Arts at the hands of headmaster Snape, Dark Arts teacher [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]], and Muggle Studies teacher [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], all of whom are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. The DA falls on hard times as its members are hunted down; Luna is captured, Ginny escapes with her family, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|Neville's grandmother]] is targeted in an unsuccessful attempt to put pressure on Neville (although [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]], who is sent to capture her, is thwarted, winding up in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]]). The DA retreat to the Room of Requirement, from which they recruit new members and continue guerrilla raids on the school. When Harry eventually returns to the school to hunt for the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], there are many rebelling Hogwarts students in the Room of Requirement. Neville, using the Galleons that Hermione had earlier enchanted to tell about meetings, recalls the rest of the D.A. The members of the Order of the Phoenix come along with them, along with many other wizards, triggering the final, climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle]].

== Notable Consequences ==

When meeting in the Hog's Head, Harry expresses some doubts that they may be overheard by someone, suggesting that a veiled witch in the corner might be Umbridge. Umbridge is not present, as it turns out, but there are in fact two eavesdroppers: the witch is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], there for the Order of the Phoenix, and also present is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Willy Widdershins|Willy Widdershins]], the comprehensively bandaged wizard at the bar drinking Firewhiskey, who promptly reports back to Umbridge. It is as a direct result of this meeting that Umbridge causes promulgation of Educational Decree number Twenty-Four which prevents unapproved student groups. This has the side effect of banning the Quidditch teams. The fact that the Slytherin Quidditch team is approved and reforms immediately, while the Gryffindor team is not allowed to reform for a month, is an indication of how Umbridge will tend to abuse her powers.

Cho Chang has joined the D.A. largely because Harry was there. Cho makes use of the end of the last D.A. meeting before Christmas to kiss Harry in private. We can see from his response to this, as related to Hermione, that he is extremely unsure of himself around Cho.
 
The continued unapproved meetings of the D.A., in violation of Educational Decree number Twenty-Four, are eventually betrayed, and an attempt is made to apprehend the group. In the end, due to a timely warning from Dobby, the only group member caught is Harry himself. Pansy Parkinson enters the Room of Requirement and retrieves the membership list. Cornelius Fudge has been summoned to witness the bringing of the group to justice; on seeing the membership list heading, his paranoia asserts itself, and he tries to arrest Dumbledore. Dumbledore escapes, dramatically, and Umbridge is appointed Headmistress, although she is never able to get into the Headmaster's office after Dumbledore's departure.

Marietta Edgecombe's defection not only betrayed Dumbledore's Army, but ultimately doomed Harry and Cho Chang's relationship. When Cho defends Marietta's actions and is angry that Hermione secretly jinxed the parchment the D.A. members signed, Harry angrily lashes out, calling Hermione's plan &quot;brilliant.&quot; Cho is deeply offended and storms off in tears; she and Harry do not speak to one another for two years.

Unfortunately for Umbridge, students have acquired what she vigorously prevented them from having: Defence Against the Dark Arts knowledge. The D.A. members use their new-found skills on several occasions. When Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna are captured by Umbridge's ''Inquisitorial Squad'', they escape with defensive jinxes and hexes. The students use Defensive Arts during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Department of Mysteries]], fending off [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] until Order of the Phoenix reinforcements arrive. When Draco and his minions attempt to Curse Harry on the Hogwarts Express, D.A. members come to his rescue, jinxing the Slytherins until they are unrecognizable. Members of Dumbledore's Army use what they have learned to assist with the defence of the school at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|the battle under the Astronomy tower]]. And it is largely members of Dumbledore's Army who make up the core of the guerrilla resistance against Snape's rule in the seventh book.

For Neville Longbottom the D.A. is a timely opportunity to improve his dueling skills.  After the escape of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], Neville is determined to become proficient in Defence and works very hard at D.A. meetings.

The D.A. is very important to Luna Lovegood who experiences, for the first time, a fellowship with her peers.  In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] Luna tells Harry how much she misses the D.A. meetings and what the friendship of the D.A. means to her.

== Analysis ==

Curiously, it is Hermione who takes action against Umbridge by forming ''Dumbledore's Army''. Although she believes in strictly adhering to school rules, she never hesitates to break them when she believes they are wrong or a nobler purpose is served. In this instance, she not only takes on Umbridge, but the entire Ministry of Magic, who are convinced Dumbledore may be creating a secret wizard army against them.

There are two people in Dumbledore's Army who do not completely seem to belong there. These are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]] and Marietta Edgecombe. Smith is confrontational, to the point that at the organizational meeting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] feels compelled to threaten him with a pointed metal object that he produces from a Zonko's Joke Shop bag. Smith also does not seem to want to sign the parchment that Hermione passes around, where they swear not to tell anyone about the D.A. Granted, he is not the only one to express reluctance; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] hesitates, saying he is a prefect, and if the parchment were found... He only signs when Hermione points out that she's not going to leave this bit of parchment lying around. From the beginning, we have a feeling that the D.A. is doomed, that it will accomplish at least some part of its purpose, but will ultimately fall to Umbridge and her cronies; and Zacharias Smith's continuing skepticism makes him a lead candidate for that betrayal.

Marietta is along because Cho is going, and she is always very quiet, limiting her interaction to sighs and non-verbal displays of impatience. When the actual betrayal takes place, we fully expect Zacharias to have been the agent, and are very surprised when it turns out to be Marietta.

Even before Harry gets the teaching up to that level, Hermione is seen doing two [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-class]] spells here. The first is the parchment, on which everyone signs their names at the organizational meeting. As mentioned above, the parchment is charmed so that anyone who betrays the D.A. will break out in horrendous blemishes. When Hermione mentions this to Ron and Harry, after the promulgation of the Educational Decree banning student organizations, they are both very impressed; Ron in particular recognizes that this is very advanced magic. One wonders why Hermione had not told the rest of the D.A. of this charm, once they had all signed; Marietta might have chosen a different course of action had she known that betraying the D.A. to Umbridge would result in her wearing the word &quot;Sneak&quot; across her face for at least a year.

The second is the Galleons; every Galleon has on it a serial number, that of the gnome who cast it. Hermione has made fake Galleons for the D.A., which look like real ones except that the serial number changes to indicate the date and time of the next meeting. When Hermione passes these out at the second regular meeting, everyone present is amazed that she is capable of performing a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|Protean Charm]], it being such advanced magic.

It is noted that Seamus had joined Dumbledore's Army for only its last session before it was discovered and disbanded. This timing is, in fact, rather important. Harry has noted and tried to work around the fact that there are an even number of people (including himself) in the DA; most often, he has the students pair up so they can practice on each other, and as he cannot generally be one of the pairs, as he has to inspect and correct the other students, he often creates a single group of three, Neville, Hermione, and Ron. In the final session, Marietta Edgecombe is not present because she is telling Professor Umbridge about the group; Harry would be much more likely to notice her absence if suddenly he could pair everyone up. Seamus's presence, by keeping the number of working students odd, prevents Harry noticing that Marietta is missing, and thus helps provide the necessary surprise.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry finds out that he and Dumbledore are going to both be leaving the school for a while, and while he cannot be sure what Draco's mission is, or whether he has accomplished it, he has at the very least a great suspicion that it has been completed successfully. Although Dumbledore reassures him that the school is protected by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] and members of the Order of the Phoenix, Harry does not feel that is enough. For reasons of his own, he feels that Draco's task may have resulted in an increased danger to Hogwarts in a way that the Order had not anticipated. When appealing to Dumbledore seems ineffective, Harry tries to re-activate the D.A., with very limited success: only Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna Lovegood come forward. However, the five of them, with a little help from Harry's remaining stock of Felix Felicis potion, manage to turn the tide of the battle.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Neville and Ginny re-activate Dumbledore's army as a means of rebelling against the headmaster, Severus Snape. As there are two other Death Eaters teaching at the school, and the teaching has become a lot darker and more abusive, this is not a complete success. However, the organization is in place, and is working out of the Room of Requirement, when Harry reaches Hogwarts. Additionally, when Neville uses the Galleons to summon the D.A., all of the past members of the D.A. (with the possible exception of Marietta Edgecombe) arrive as well, forming the nucleus of a fighting group that will largely save Hogwarts.

Surprisingly, the choice of which student enters the Room of Requirement when the DA is broken up to retrieve the parchment is important. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], when he was at Hogwarts, apparently discovered the Room of Requirement. It seems that most people who discover it are looking for some place to hide something; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] had discovered it when looking for a place to hide her sherry, and the Twins had been looking for a place to hide themselves from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], for instance. Voldemort, presumably looking for a place to hide something he had done, had thus managed to open the door onto a warehouse full of a thousand years worth of magical junk. He apparently instructed Draco Malfoy, over the summer, as to how to get into that aspect of the Room. It is in that aspect of the room that Draco was working on his technique for getting Death Eaters into Hogwarts throughout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry's sixth year]]. If Draco had ever seen the inside of the room prepared for D.A. meetings, he might have had a better idea of what the room actually was; as it is, though, only Pansy has seen that aspect of the room, and Draco, in his superior way, likely would not bother to ask her what the inside of the room looked like, assuming, once he got instructions on how to enter, that the DA had been practicing in the junk warehouse.

Have you seen the

It seems almost too simple to actually work,
when compared to the complex process that all my electronic books describe.
(Generally, they have different-looking formulas for &quot;inverting&quot;, &quot;non-inverting&quot;, and &quot;summing&quot; configurations --
this method uses the same formula for all of them).

== About [[Circuit Idea/How to Create Sinusoidal Oscillations]] ==

Hello,

Do you have any further plans for [[Circuit Idea/How to Create Sinusoidal Oscillations]]? I found it by the merge tag, but right now it looks like just a deprecated copy of an old revision of [[Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?]], so there wouldn't be anything to be actually merged.

Thanks, [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:03, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:Sorry, I have not checked my talk. Yes, you are right, as far as I can remember, ''How to create...'' is abandoned version because of the title. IMO, it has just to be deleted.

:I would like to ask you whether you like this story about creating sinusoidal oscillations. If so, please, restore the link to this page that I placed on [[w:LC circuit|LC circuit]] Wikipedia page a year ago (see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LC_circuit&amp;diff=188126081&amp;oldid=182693285 old version]). I have problems with a few wikipedians that remove systematically my Wikipedia edits and links to these Wikibooks stories (see for example this [[w:Talk:Voltage-to-current converter#This page needs to be removed|talk page]] where my user name is [[w:User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]]).

::Thanks for clarifying the status of &quot;How to...&quot;, I will change the templates in the duplicate to speedy deletion.

::As for the Wikipedia issues, sorry but I would prefer to abstain from entering a content dispute in this way, specially one about a subject in which I am no specialist. Exactly because I am not a specialist, though, I feel I am in a position to humbly suggest you to look at this conflict from a different perspective. From what I can read from the arguments, the rejection of your contributions at Wikipedia has more to do with editorial divergences rather than factual accuracy. Your  (forgive me for this reductionist description) analogy/abstraction-based approach to teaching electronics is certainly interesting and has didactic merit. For it to be properly developed, however, it needs a calm, measured pacing of text and a well-developed &quot;narrative&quot; to provide context; and a Wikipedia article is just too terse a medium for that to happen. In essence, then, what I am suggesting is that you leave behind those stressful arguments at Wikipedia and focus on Wikibooks, where you have more space and leeway to properly structure your approach to teaching circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General History of Statistics'''

The historical development of the field of sequence statistics as discussed in this chapter represents the common denominator of genetic biometry. From its onset at the end of pre-dynastic period (about 3100 BCE) associated with Nilotic African graphemics to the present genomic age, sequence statistics considers probability the core of information.

Among the southern Luo in this particular subject, one finds the proverb ''Obaro nyar Wasare'' that is intended to conceal the meaning of probability and information research. Kwame Gyeke of Ghana suggests the importance of many proverbs from the Akan people. But this Nilotic proverb is the origin of limiting relative frequency, often recited by the wise people to reveal '''variation''', '''frequency''' and '''estimation''' of the living being. In the work of Odhiambo Akoko (Paul Mboya 1953), ''Luo Kitgi gi Timbegi'', for example, the science is revealed in the sense that one’s character and behavior in general is by far a reflection on one’s customs and traditions in which one operates. 

The proverb teaches a bout ''kit Wasare'' concreted by ''rieko te'' in linear and circular order and means the amount or measure of understanding as well as the totality of what can be known to come from a parent, ''Wasare'' in linear form and taught by a teacher to the daughter of  ''Wasare ma adiera.'' 

Similarly, in decoded Egyptian hieroglyphics, Wasare is the ''Osiris'' or ''Ra''  whose daughter, ''mesia'' is ''ma adier'', the truth, ''ma’at''  who is ''nyar re'' the daughter of ''Ra''.  In effect, from the Luo ''yud jaot'' (''jaodi'') which is finding a consort (''Tehuty'') and  ''kido'' which is  heredability comes the pharaonic ''udjat'', the “sound eye” and ''khed'', building a mathematical process with a living yardstick. It is  this living yardstick that through Latin, ''metiri'' and old French, ''mesure'', we get the origins of the English word ''measure'' that therefore is the ultimate source of biological mathematics as we know it today to have come from the Luo.

Genetic information relies heavily on modernized conventional concepts of statistics and probability in symbols to which we now turn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section deals with an overview of Shakespeare's plays.

He is usually said to have written 37 plays, though others have been convincingly attributed to him over the past few decades, each of these as a co-author with another writer.  There is also at least one lost play, ''Cardenio''. 

These plays changed over time, as his writing skills developed, and as he came to understand the needs and desires of his audience.  Appreciation of the play also depended on the ability of the actors at that time.

Shakespeare's plays are grouped in 4 periods.  More specifically, the third period is full of tragedies such as Othello, Hamlet and King Lear.
Shakespeare wrote in four different genres: comedy, tragedy, romance and historical.

Many of his plays are taken from other stories or plays. Although most of these sources are unknown, they must have been popular and very well-known in Elizabethian times. We can say, for instance, that Antony and Cleopatra came from Plutarch's account of Antony. Speculations on these have the potential to be very interesting and controversial.

When you go to see or read a Shakespeare play it is important to know all about the social, historical and dramatic context. It is also important to focus on the poetry of the play, as this is was the most important linguistic tool used by Shakespeare that was particularly effective in portraying deep emotion.

In Elizabethian times there was no scenery or costuming as such, and only a few theatres. These features have therefore been created and modified over the last 500 years, often contributing to vast differences between interpretations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Troilus and Cressida|Troilus and Cressida]] is a comedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], written in 1602.  This play is a retelling of the Grecian myth of the Trojan War, with a subplot about the romance of the two titular characters.  The play is somewhat of an anomaly in the works of Shakespeare, as it contains elements of tragedy, history and comedy.  It appears to constantly tread a line between broad, slapstick-style comedy and terrible tragedy.

      <comment>/* Conduct */ badly considered behavior that somehow leads to tolerable results</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a collection of questions that could be asked on a [[User:Fasten/Mentoring_Handbook#Questionnaire|questionnaire for parents and protégés]]. (first sketch)

Protégés should be encouraged to mention after-thoughts at any time, also several weeks or months after filling out the questionnaire.
Parents and protégés could be allowed to read the questionnaire first and to agree on what questions should be answered verbally and what questions they would like to leave out entirely. Parents could also be allowed to keep one or two prints of the questionnaire and to hand in a more well considered version. Spontaneous answers to previously unknown questions may be suitable to find out how much consideration somebody had given to a topic before being asked.

: Related topic: Code of conduct of the mentoring organization. (e.g. privacy)

== Silly questions ==

* Do you have a rule to help each other in your family? (good topic, insufficient question)
* Are you a democratic family? (good topic, insufficient question)
* How often do family members disagree and fail to make up? (possibly too personal, undiplomatic, numbers are secondary)

== Conduct ==

* What official agreements or rules do you have in your family?


* Who decides what and when in your family? Do you hold a family council on occasion?
* Is that satisfactory?


* Do you have a culture of disagreement or are your disagreements uncultivated? ([[wikipedia:false dilemma|false dilemma]]: The missing middle ground is the large area of badly considered behavior that somehow leads to tolerable results. Offering a false dilemma allows the readers to object; the answer to the next question should help to distinguish a culture of disagreement from badly considered behavior)
* Please describe your culture of disagreement abstractly. (e.g. do you consider making up mandatory, of no importance or anything in between)


* If you were a family of superheros, what would be your respective super powers? This question is slightly funny so it isn't taken too seriously.
: (e.g. can-break-own-rules, can-break-rule-X, can-fail-to-help, can-follow-a-whim, can-let-others-do-the-work, can-leave-a-mess, can-fail-to-educate)

== General education inside the family ==

(for the protégé)

* Do your parents educate you?
* How often?
(please specify an estimate number and a scale: daily, weekly, monthly, in the last year, in the last ten years, ever)
* Would you wish your parents to educate more often?
* Would your parents be qualified as educators or would you wish them to be more qualified (e.g. to read up on a topic first)?
* Are there any other persons (inside or outside your extended family) you would wish to educate you more often?

== General education outside the family ==

(for the protégé)

* What topics interest you most?
* What are the school subjects you like best?
* Are there school subjects you would like best, irrespective of the way they are taught in school? (This could be an indicator for a need for extracurricular learning in relation to a school subject)
* What activities outside school are related to these topics?
* What related activities do you know you might like to try?
* What books have you read lately? (parents and protégé)

== Hobbies ==

* What are your hobbies? (parents and protégé)


* What hobbies do you share inside the family? (please specify all groups of family members that share hobbies and their hobbies)


* What hobbies do you share with friends? (please specify groups or social circles and the related hobbies)

== Socializing, Social skills ==

* Do you have a boy friend/girl friend? (At what age does that question make sense?)
* Number of best friends? (Does that question make sense? At what age? A protégé could be asked to explain the difference between best friends, personal friends and good acquaintances.)
* Number of personal friends? (rough estimate, parents and protégé)
* Number of good acquaintances? (rough estimate, parents and protégé)

* Have you trained any soft skills explicitly? (parents and protégé)
* What social skills would you ascribe to yourself? (parents and protégé)
* What soft skills would you like to improve? (parents and protégé)
* What social skills would you like to see developed? (parents about protégé)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Gases|next=Behaviour of Gases}}

==Phase Diagrams==
Phase diagrams predict the phase of a substance at a certain pressure and temperature.

[[Image:Phase-diag2.svg]]

The '''triple point''' is where all three phases of matter can exist in equilibrium. Points that are on a line are where two phases of matter can coexist.

The '''critical point''' is the highest pressure and temperature that the three normal phases can exist. Any further, and the characteristics become a blend of liquid and gas.

==Changes in State==
[[Image:Phase change - en.svg|thumb|300px]]

If the temperature and pressure change and move across a line in the diagram, the phase will also to change. There are six ways this can happen:

*Solid to liquid:  '''melting'''
*Liquid to solid:  '''freezing'''
*Liquid to gas:  '''evaporation'''
*Gas to liquid:  '''condensation'''
*Gas to solid:  '''deposition'''
*Solid to gas:  '''sublimation'''

The diagram on the right also shows the ''plasma'' state of matter.  A [[w:Plasma|plasma]] is simply a gas that has been completely ionized, so that there is a mixture of positive ions and electrons.  It has interesting electrical properties, but it is not important in the scope of General Chemistry.

===Energy Changes===
{{Helpful hint|hint=The ''kinetic energy'' of a molecule is directly proportional to its temperature.  ''Potential energy'' is used to break bonds.}}
If you boil water, it never goes above 100 degrees Celsius. Only after it has completely evaporated will it get any hotter. This is because once water reaches the boiling point, extra energy is used to change the state of matter and increase the potential energy instead of the kinetic energy. The opposite happens when water freezes. To boil or melt one mole of a substance, a certain amount of energy is required. These amounts of energy are the '''molar heat of vaporization''' and '''molar heat of fusion'''. If that amount of energy is added to a mole of that substance at boiling or freezing point, all of it will melt or boil, but the temperature won't change.

[[Image:Phase Heat Diagram.png]]

The graph shows the temperature of ice as heat is added.  Temperature increases linearly with heat, until the melting point.  Then, the heat added does not change the temperature.  That heat energy is instead used to break intermolecular bonds and convert ice into water.  At this point, there is a mixture of both ice and water.  Once all ice has been melted, the temperature again rises linearly with heat added.  At the boiling point, temperature no longer rises with heat added because the energy is once again being used to break intermolecular bonds.  Once all water has been boiled to steam, the temperature will continue to rise linearly as heat is added.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The England of William Shakespeare's time was one marked by changes in social, political, religious, philosophical, and artistic perceptions. This period is usually referred to as The Renaissance (1485-1660)during which innumerable changes in the culture of England became manifest. In the beginning, many scholars point to the end of the middle ages as the beginning of the Renaissance. This is often tied to the deposing of King Richard III who was killed in battle and dropped unceremoniously into an unmarked grave, naked and unmourned. This allowed the accession to the throne of the long reigning House of Tudor, beginning with Henry VIIII (1485-1509). With the rise of the Tudor monarchs a new era was begun. The cultural changes of the Renaissance had been an ongoing process in Europe for a hundred years before, most notably in Italy and France. 

At the core of this change was the idea of &quot;renewal&quot; or &quot;rebirth&quot; - the meaning of the word '''''renaissance'''''. Among those things reborn was the interest in the learning from the classical ages, primarily Greek and Roman culture. In the Middle Ages, such interests were actively repressed by a dominating church and its partner the Feudal System. Both of these kept the majority of people in England tied to the values of the church and the control of the feudal lords for whom they worked. Literacy was almost non-existent among the masses, and any attempt to educate people other than for work in the church or government was actively and brutally discouraged. After the Renaissance is allowed to expand into England, a passion for literacy, learning, and creativity emerged. The works of the ancients of the Classical Period were gathered up from the monasteries and studied widely. The increase in the interest in the ideals of the Romans and Greeks created a new hunger for a philosophical perspective the people of England could embrace. That philosophy was '''''humanism''''', the belief system which advocated the improvement of the human condition based on the pursuit of '''''virtues''''' drawn from the teachings of the ancient philosophers such as Cicero. Humanism was not an attempt to discredit Christianity; rather, the humanists pursued the knowledge of the classics in order to bring them into harmony with the teachings of the church. Contrary to the perception of many, the Renaissance actually emerged from the attempts of the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Italy to discover and add to scholarship to develop this harmonic relationship between what was '''''secular''''' and what was '''''religious'''''. 

Another factor in the leaps and strides of the Renaissance in England was the arrival of the printing press developed by Johannes Gutenberg (1400?-1468). The press made publication of large numbers of books and as a result the wider distribution of material on which to build a greater literacy among the people of England. In 1476, years after it had been invented and widely used in Europe, the printing press arrived in England. The owner of that first press, William Caxton (1422?-1491) published over one hundred titles and began the flood of literacy that was to continue in England. Why such a delay? England was a remote island off the west coast of Europe and had long been considered a barbaric and unenlightened land by some in Europe who believed the centers of advanced civilization existed in Italy, France, and Spain. 

While literacy was on the rise, so was an increased sense of national identity which, for the English, was a necessary redefining of themselves and the development of a culture of its own and not just a patchwork of cultures resulting from occupying forces and peoples which had been underway since the time of the Roman occupation begun by Julius Caesar. Since that time, wave after wave of invaders attempted a permanent occupation of the island. As the Celts and the Bretons were displaced by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, so were they by the Norman invasion of 1066 a.d. and the ongoing presence of the Roman Catholic church with its Italian and European habits and traditions. The renaissance enabled the increasing numbers of literate English to develop their own identity, accommodating their past and developing their own virtues and values of their own.

With the Tudor monarchs also came a newer, stronger, more determined line of Kings and Queens who shaped the political and cultural change in England. Henry VII began the reign of the House of Tudor which would produce five monarchs. His rise to the throne ended the famous War of the Roses to place the Welsh nobleman on the throne to shape the changes to come. His son, the highly intelligent, fiery, zealous, progressive, insistent Henry VIII did as much to shape the new English identity as any other monarch. He wrote books, created a new religion to suit his own purposes, built a navy, and executed all who stood in his way (including two wives, several close friends, and political enemies). After Henry VIII died, his children each replaced him in turn, starting with the son Edward VI (r. 1547-1553) who ruled and died a child while the country was ruled by relatives who acted in his name to preserve the advances of his father. Upon his death of tuberculosis, Mary Tudor ascended the throne (r.1553-1558); the half-Spanish, half-English daughter of Catherine of Aragon ruled the nation ruthlessly. Her goal was to return Roman Catholicism to England and solidify an alliance (or absorption) with Spain. She married King Philip II of Spain, alarming the general population of England who feared that Spain was on the verge of an invasion. When Mary (often referred to a &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;) died of natural causes, the throne became the possession of Queen Elizabeth (now referred to as Elizabeth I). After a shaky start, Elizabeth ruled intelligently and decisively, displaying all the necessary characteristics and courage of a King such as her father. Perhaps an early example of feminism, Queen Elizabeth decided early on to refuse to marry and take a back seat to power. Forever known as the &quot;Virgin Queen&quot; (a fond misnomer as she had dalliances with many men during her lifetime), Elizabeth ruled with a brilliant mind. Under her reign (1558-1603) she led a nation in relative peace, economic expansion, and the highest point of English cultural nationalism in the whole period of the Renaissance. Elizabeth's reign was highlighted by her stunning and complete defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, led by the Royal Navy her father had built (with a bit of help from bad weather and the treacherous and rocky Irish coastline). 

Throughout the Renaissance in England, but especially under the reign of the Tudors, the arts flourished and became a central interest for the English. One of the most explosive of these expansions of art was that of the theater. Drama had been long confined to the church pageant both in the medieval church and later in which a primitive (by later standards) form of drama emerged. The medieval church pageants served to teach the parishioners basic concepts of the teachings of the church, present the standards of morality, and continue the reinforcement of the Roman Catholic Church as the center of Truth and Moral teaching. When these dramas grew longer and more sophisticated, they moved out of doors into the courtyards and streets of towns and cities. These plays depicted the personification of moral precepts, interactions between masked actors called &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; and so forth. The topics were narrowly defined to the doctrines of the church, the origins of man, the fall of man, sin, and other such topics. These repeated festival performances generated an appetite for more complex theater among the English, who now were beginning to read the Roman plays and to a lesser extent at first, the Greek plays. Thus was created the environment for the English Renaissance Theater to be born. Watching year after year Morality Plays required at least a basic understanding of the world of &quot;make-believe&quot; needed to watch a group of ordinary persons portraying the actions and speaking the words of real and imaginary persons and abstract moral concepts. This appetite for entertaining visual representations of life led directly to the appetite for the new theater of England's small body of artisans who sought to broaden and deepen these plays into more local, topical, humanistic, and relevant representations of life. Out of this association of artists emerged a new voice, that of William Shakespeare.

In the midst of the reign of the Tudors was born William Shakespeare, a son of a merchant in the small town of Stratford-on-Avon. Shakepeare was baptised April 26, 1564 and most scholars assume he was born a few days earlier, by tradition, on April 23. Shakespeare was the son of John Shakepeare, glover and moderately successful businessman, and Mary Arden. Very little is known of Shakespeare's life, as he kept no journal and little in the way of historical evidence has survived. It is widely assumed that he attended the Stratford Grammar School, since he could have attended free because of his father's position in city government. Tradition says that Shakespeare worked for a time as a school teacher, but there is no direct evidence of this. At the age of eighteen he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior. Their marriage produced three children, Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. The daughter grew up and was married, but the only son, Hamnet, died tragically at age eleven, an event which would have lasting impact on his father.

Shakespeare seems to have left Stratford (and his family) for London in 1587. By 1592 scholars have found evidence that he was already heavily involved in the theater, having written ''Henry VI'' which was attacked in print by Robert Greene, a Cambridge graduate who was down on his luck and suffering from illness. He died just as his attack on Shakespeare went to press, and a friend of Greene's came to Shakespeare's defense, and so the young actor and playwright was noticed in the public eye. Most of what we know of Shakespeare's life from 1592 through his death derives from the plays themselves, as well as dramatis persone list of the plays in which he acted, and records of appearances at court. Early on, Shakespeare made a name for himself as a playwright, and he performed regularly in his acting company, first The Lord Chamberlin's Men, and later The King's Men. His early association with the very popular tragedian Richard Burbage and the great comic actor actor William Kemp put Shakespeare in good company. Though the acting profession was not a highly regarded profession, the theater was popular and profitable. Shakespeare also made his mark as a poet with his two acclaimed narrative poems &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (1593) and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; (1594), and with his sonnets. 
Shakespeare's playwriting is traditionally divided into three periods, The Early Period (also the most prosperous period of his life)(1592-1601), The Tragic Period (1600-1610), and the Later Period (1610-1616). These three divisions of his work reveal much about the development of his vision as a writer. Some have suggested that these periods reflect the evolution of the man along with his art, while others caution that reading too much into these divisions may give readers a false impression of the diversity and liveliness of Shakespeare himself. Scholars also caution that to ignore his poetry throughout this period is to miss an enormous contribution of Shakespeare. 

In his Early Plays a remarkable explosion of work came from his pen. In a matter of four years (1592-1595) he wrote seven popular plays of wide variety. He began developing the categories of interest he would pursue his whole career: History plays, Latin (or Roman) plays, Comedies, and the Tragedies. These plays are as follows:
&quot;Richard III&quot;                        (1592-1593)- History
&quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;               (1592-1593)- Comedy
&quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;                   (1593-1594)- Roman
&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;            (1593-1595)- Comedies
&quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;
&quot;Love's Labor's Lost&quot;
&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;                   (1594-1595)- Tragedy
The latter play, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is sometimes referred to as an imperfect tragedy as it begins and apparently runs toward a comedy's resolution, but exactly halfway through the play it shifts directly into tragedy. This has led some to use the term &quot;tragi-comedy&quot; with this play. Further, ''Romeo and Juliet'' remains the play most often taught in schools around the world. By 1596 Shakespeare's income and status was growing briskly. He solidified this status by buying a huge manor house in Stratford and applying to the Heraldic College for a ''coat of arms''. This plan was successful and his status rose both at home and in London. Over the next four years he continued to act, write, and now became a shareholder of a theater. He was respected by the literary community of the day and was solidly a part of aristocratic society. By 1600 he had given six command performances in the Court of Queen Elizabeth. 

Shakespeare's writing in these early years continued with his cycle of history plays about the kings of the Wars of the Roses, his most famous Roman play, ''Julius Caesar'' more comedies, and his masterwork of tragedy ''Hamlet''. These plays are as follows:
''Richard II''                          (1595-1596)- History
''Henry IV, Part One''                  (1596-1597)- History
''Henry IV, Part Two''                  (1596-1597)- History
''Henry V''                             (1599)     - History
''Julius Caesar''                       (1599)     - Roman
''A Midsummer Night's Dream''           (1595-1596)- Comedy
''The Merchant of Venice''              (1596-1597)- Comedy
''Much Ado About Nothing''              (1598-1599)- Comedy
''As you Like It''                      (1598-1600)- Comedy
''Twelfth Night''                       (1600-1601)- Comedy
''Hamlet''                              (1600-1601)- Tragedy
''The Merry Wives of Windsor''          (1600-1601)- Comedy

These nineteen plays, plus his beginning attempt, ''Henry VI'' make the early period of Shakespeare's career. Twenty plays, rising fame, increased wealth, and dominating influence made this portion of his career a profound achievement. This end of this time frame also signaled the coming end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. When her successor, James I (r.1603-16XX) came to power he would increase favor and sponsorship of Shakespeare and the arts. James was a prolific supporter of the theater in these years, and as a result, Shakespeare's wealth grew, enabling him to make shrewd business deals and acquire property in Stratford and London.

In spite of its name, Shakespeare's &quot;Tragic Period&quot; is called that primarily because of the powerful and masterful tragedies he wrote during that period. No evidence suggests that this was a tragic period for Shakespeare himself, and to draw the loose connection between this period and some mysterious and unidentified hardship on the playwrite would be only weak conjecture. This period of his creative life was his most mature and artistically developed of any time in his life. From 1600 through 1607 he wrote three more profound tragedies, another Roman play, and two comedies. In this short time he managed to create some of the most influential and long-studied plays in history. Whatever his vision was at this time, his art was never better. After ''Hamlet'' in 1601 these are the seven plays of this period:
''Othello''                            (1601-1602)- Tragedy
''King Lear''                          (1605)     - Tragedy
''Macbeth''                            (1605-1606)- Tragedy
''Antony and Cleopatra''               (1606-1607)- Roman
''All's Well That Ends Well''          (1602-1603)- Comedy
''Measure for Measure''                (1604)     - Comedy

For a short while Shakespeare produced no plays, and seems to have been busy with performances and seeing to his investments. By 1610 he returned to Stratford and took up residence in his home there. 

The Later Period, from 1610 until his death in 1616 has generated much interest and speculation about the evolving mind of Shakespeare. His plays of this period include two more tragediesand his last history play, and five comedies (which have caused as much debate as his tragedies). These five plays are also called &quot;romances&quot; by some scholars, and even &quot;tragi-comedies&quot; as they represent a sort of &quot;darker&quot; side of Shakespeare's vision. ''The Winter's Tale'' and ''The Tempest'' contain some of the most quotable of Shakespeare's lines and deal with comical scenes transmitting seriously deep concerns. Unlike the other two &quot;periods&quot; of his work, these eight plays are written in groups from tragedy to comedy to history:
''Timon of Athens''                    (1607-1608)- Tragedy/Roman
''Coriolanus''                         (1607-1608)- Tragedy/Roman
''Pericles''                           (1607-1608)- Comedy/Romance
''Cymbeline''                          (1609-1610)- Comedy/Romance
''The Winter's Tale''                  (1610-1611)- Comedy/Romance
''The Tempest''                        (1611-1612)- Comedy/Romance
''The Two Noble Kinsmen''              (1612)     - Comedy/Romance
''Henry VIII''                         (1613)     - History

As Shakespeare's life wound to a close, he remained active until just a few days before his death. He traveled back and forth from New Place in Stratford to London regularly, and lived to enjoy time with Susanna and her Husband Dr. John Hall and his granddaughter Elizabeth. He died on April 23, 1616, just three days short of his fifty-second birthday. He could not have lived a more prosperous and brilliant life. Though laced with tragedy, such as the loss of his only son in his childhood, and spending so much time away from home, Shakespeare managed to keep his family together and obtain success at the same time.

Remarkably, his work has never been out of print, though it saw little print in his lifetime, and to this day his plays are produced in dozens of languages in hundreds of countries. His sonnets are unmatched in the poetry of his day in quality and quantity. His plays are studied in schools around the world and it has been said that not a day passes that somewhere in the world actors are presenting one of his plays. William Shakespeare has given the Renaissance and all times forward much to think about and much to enjoy. When he was buried under the floor of the church at Stratford, he left the following epitaph forbidding the removal of his bones:

''Good Friend, for Jesus' sake forbear&lt;br /&gt;
''To dig the dust enclosed here!&lt;br /&gt;
''Blest be the man that spares these stones,&lt;br /&gt;
''And curst be he that moves my bones.''

==Types of Solutions==

A '''solution''' is a homogenous mixture, composed of solvent(s) and solute(s). A '''solvent''' is any substance which allows other substances to dissolve in it. Therefore, it is usually present in the greater amount. '''Solutes''' are substances present in a solution. Note that when a solute dissolves in a solvent, no chemical bonds form between the solvent and solute.

Solutions have variable composition, unlike pure compounds whose composition is fixed. For example, a 500 mL solution of lemonade can consist of 70% water, 20% lemon juice, and 10% sugar. There can also be a 500 mL solution of lemonade consisting of 60% water, 25% lemon juice, and 15% sugar.

{{Info|The most common type of solution is an '''aqueous''' solution, which is a solution where water is the solvent. Aqueous solutions are quite important. For example, acids and bases exist typically as aqueous solutions.}}

When two liquids can be readily combined in any proportions, they are said to be '''miscible'''. An example would be alcohol and water. Either of the two can totally dissolve each other in any proportion.  Two liquids are defined as '''immiscible''' if they will not form a solution, such as oil and water. Solid solutes in a metallic solvent are known as '''alloys'''.  Gold is an example of an alloy.  It is too soft in its pure form, so other metals are dissolved in it.  Jewelers may use 14-karat gold, which contains two-thirds gold and one-third other metals.

==Variables Affecting Solubility==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Factor
! Concept
! Example
|-
| ''Surface area''
| More surface area gives more opportunity for solute-solvent contact
| Powdered sugar will dissolve in water faster than rock candy.
|-
| ''Temperature''
| Solids are more soluble in hot solvents, gases are more soluble in cold solvents
| Sugar dissolves more readily in hot water, but CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolves better in cold soda than warm soda.
|-
| ''Polarity''
| Non-polar compounds dissolve in non-polar solvents, and polar compounds dissolve in polar solvents. If one liquid is polar, and the other isn't, they are immiscible.
| Alcohol and water are both polar, and they are miscible.  Oil is non-polar and is immiscible in water.
|-
| ''Pressure''
| Gases dissolve better under higher pressure, due to greater forces pushing the gas molecules into the solvent.
| Leaving the cap off a soda bottle will let the carbonation out.
|-
| ''Agitation''
| If a solution is agitated by stirring or shaking, there is an increase in kinetic motion and contact of particles. Therefore, the rate of solubility increases.
| Everyone knows to stir their coffee after adding sugar.
|}

{{Info|In general, the rate of solubility is dependent on the intermolecular forces between substances. The maxim '''&quot;like dissolves like&quot;''' will help you remember that substances must both be polar or non-polar to dissolve.}}

==Dissolving at the Molecular Level==
[[Image:Na+H2O.svg|thumb|A sodium ion in ''solvation'' with water.]]

# The forces between the particles in the solid must be broken. This is an endothermic process called ''dissociation''.
# Some of the intermolecular forces between the particles in the liquid must also be broken. This is endothermic.
# The particles of the solid and the particles in a liquid become attracted. This is an exothermic process called ''solvation''.

=== Example: Dissolving NaCl ===

When sodium chloride is added to water, it will dissolve.  Water molecules are polar, and sodium chloride is ionic (which is very polar).  The positive ends of the water molecules (the hydrogens) will be attracted to the negative chloride ions, and the negative ends of the water molecules (the oxygens) will be attracted to the positive sodium ions.  The attractions are strong enough to separate sodium from chloride, so the solute ''dissociates'', or breaks apart.  The solute is then spread throughout the solvent.  The polar water molecules prevent the ions from reattaching to each other, so the salt stays in solution.

*When a solution can hold no more solute, it is said to be '''saturated'''.  This occurs when there is an ''equilibrium'' between the dissolved and undissolved solute.
*If more solute can be added, the solution is '''unsaturated'''.
*If a solution has more solute than is normally possible, due to the lowering or heightening of temperature, it is said to be '''supersaturated'''. If disturbed, the solution will rapidly form solid crystals.
* '''Solubility''' is the measure of how many grams of solute can dissolve in 100 grams of solvent (or in the case of water, solute per 100 milliliters.)

===Hydration===
Sometimes, compounds form crystals with a specific amount of water in them. For example, copper(II) sulfate is written as CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; • 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  For every mole of copper(II) sulfate, there are five moles of water attached.  The atoms are arranged in a crystal lattice.  Even if dried, the compound will still be hydrated.  It will not feel moist, but there are water molecules within the crystal structure of the solid.

Intense heat will release the water from the compound.  Its color may change, indicating a chemical change.  When the '''anhydrous''' compound is dissolved in water, it will become hydrated again.

===Heats of Solution===
Some chemicals change temperature when dissolved. This is due to a release or absorption of heat.  The specific change is known as the '''heat of solution''', measured in kJ/mol.

===Electrolytes===
Some substances break up into ions and conduct electricity when dissolved. These are called '''electrolytes'''. All ionic compounds are electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes, on the other hand, do not conduct electricity when dissolved. Electrolytes are the reason that tap water conducts electricity. Tap water contains salts and other ions.  If you have purified water, you will find that it does not conduct electricity at all.  Upon dissolving some salt, it conducts electricity very well.  The presence of ions allows electrons to move through the solution, and electricity will be conducted.

==Solubility Practice Questions==

1. In a mixture of 50 mL of benzene and 48 mL of octane, 
:a) which substance is the solute?
:b) would these two substances form a solution?

2. Solutions are formed as physical reactions. Using this principle, name two ways in which solutes can be separated from solvents.

3. Three different clear, colourless liquids were gently heated in an evaporating dish. Liquid A left a white residue, liquid B left no residue, and liquid C left water. Identify each liquid solution as a pure substance or a solution.

4. Compare three bottles of soda. Bottle A was stored at room temperature (25°C), bottle B was stored at 10°C, and bottle C was stored at 30°C.
:a) If you wanted a fizzy drink, which bottle would you choose?
:b) If you wanted to change the gas pressure of bottle C to that of bottle B, what could you do?

A is any letter variable, B is any numerical expression, C is numerical expression, and D is numerical expression.&lt;br&gt;The For loop first loads the value of B into variable A, and then repeats the code until the End tag, adding the value of D (or 1 if D is not specified) to variable A, until A is greater than C (less than C if D is negative), and then jumps to the End tag without executing the commands.&lt;br&gt;For example, the code below will display &quot;A&quot; two times.&lt;br&gt;:For(A,1,2)&lt;br&gt;:Disp &quot;A&quot;&lt;br&gt;:End&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explanation:&lt;br&gt;Start - 1 is loaded into A, Disp &quot;A&quot; is executed, 1 is added to A (A=2), Disp &quot;A&quot; is executed again, 1 is added to A (A=3), A&gt;2, so Disp &quot;A&quot; is not executed again and the program moves on to the next set of commands. Note that you can specify a negative value for D (For(A,2,1,-1)), which would have the same effect if replaced with the For( command in the program above, except that A will start as 2 and end as 0. A can also be used within the code inside the For loop if needed, and it is not recommended to alter A within the For loop for novice programmers, even though it is legal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: in argument For(A,B,C[,D]), if D is negative and C&gt;B, -or- if D is positive or not specified and B&gt;C, the For loop is not executed at all, but the value of B is still stored into A. Also, the increment value (D) cannot be Zero, if D=0 your program will stop with an error. If B=C, your For loop will be executed once. The values of B,C, and D cannot be changed within the For loop (they can be set to different values, but they will not affect the conditions of the loop).

== Dialogue==

[[Image:61thomas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Traditional American yellow school bus]]

''Read the following dialogue then practice it with a partner if possible.  Does John live in Nottingham?  Does John play football?

John is meeting Mr. Roberts for a job interview in Manchester.

(''[[Media:B2_unit6.ogg|listen]]'')
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!John
|What would you like to know, sir?  
|-
!Mr. Roberts
|Could you tell me about your hobbies and what you do in your free time?
|-
!John
|When I was younger I used to play football every week. I even played for my local team.  Unfortunately, I don't have time to play any more.  When I have the time I usually go to the theatre, play tennis or walk in the countryside.
|-
!Mr. Roberts
|Do you drive?
|-
!John
|I can drive but I don't have a car any more.  I don't need one because I always use the bus.
|-
!Mr. Roberts
|Have you always lived in Manchester?
|-
!John
|I didn't use to live in Manchester.  I used to live in Nottingham but I moved here to find work.
|-
!Mr. Roberts
|OK thank you Robert.  I will contact you in the next few days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The best entry point to understanding the meaning of this tragedy is to look up every instance of the word &quot;nothing&quot; in the text. It will appear more than 15 times. Then note the events that occur at the same time or immediately after the utterance of the word &quot;nothing&quot;. In all but one or two cases, what happens is not &quot;nothing&quot; but a big &quot;something&quot;.

So we know that this play is about &quot;big somethings&quot; and &quot;little nothings&quot; and the fact that most of the people in the play mistake little nothings for big somethings and vice-versa. For example, the wearing of regal clothing, the attendance to the king of a knightly retinue, the swearing out loud of filial love. And from that we can see that this play is trying to show that reality is internal, rather than external.

And then we can follow the king as he loses all of his external trappings, even to the point of losing his sanity on the moor, purging himself of his pride and dependence on those &quot;little nothings&quot; that he put such value on previously.

At the end he finally understands that everything he thought was important was actually unimportant and what he thought was unimportant was actually important. But it is too late. Shakespeare was convinced that the job of the king was to keep his country unified and healthy (cf. Hamlet). But King Lear gave his country to his children who started a war to gain control. That is the worst of his sins and he must die for it.

      <comment>Comment on a comment about genetic information and probability.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''We have to be realistic'''

We cannot simply write about some tribes in Africa and think that we are advancing the field of molecular genetics. 

Biometry is a big thing. It is about measuring life on Earth. It is not a joke. We cannot pretend that  by mentioning the many tribes on  the continent of Africa, their myths and proverbs on behaviors toward other people’s children will do the trick for us. And then to even claim that, somehow, we have established the origin of probability used in computing information and insist that it comes from some African tribe is to stretch the truth beyond imagination. Let us be realistic. 

Numbers in sequence statistics are the number of possible sequences, they are the  solutions over time that increase geometrically in  either or both of possible  states and time, where time is the number of events.  Thus solution = states^events. Shanon and Weaver(1949) and even  Denbigh and Denbigh (1985) have mentioned several advantages to relate information to logarithm. 

We should only accept the African routes of genetic information if this relation of information to logarithm is established within the African mathematical foundation. Simple and clear!
:'''The Acceptable Plan'''
:I agree with you and accept the plan showing African mathematical arts as the origin of genetic information. I will show this by working on the origin of probability and information for equally likely outcomes. [[User:Odhiambo|Odhiambo]] 23:11, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:'''The Unacceptable Proposition'''
I share your reservations about the way in which tribes in Africa have been referred to without adequate detail or example. Biometry is not only a big thing, it is most likely one of the oldest branches of human intellectual enquiry. I caution however against your statement that it stretches the truth beyond imagination to say that the origin of probability (theory? practice?) could have originated in an African tribe.  Ask yourself why you believe that so improbable? All sorts of things create need for probability theory (he loves me, he loves me not...).  What does it take to develop a probability theory  (Shakespearean English?)? What does it take to record it? A feather?  Mice? 

Ironically, writing about tribes in Africa is the biggest area of potential growth and enquiry in the field of molecular genetics/genomics right now (2008).  Given that human genetic diversity is highly concentrated in Africa.  African tribes probably contain much of the mystery of how the human genome evolved-- a horizontal recording of the sequence of the ascent (descent?) of human kind, so why not human knowledge? (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza).

You might also recognise that  &quot;Shanon and Weaver(1949) and Denbigh and Denbigh (1985)&quot; are members of a mysterious tribe (Information Theorists), complete with publication date 'scarifications', as far as the vast majority of humankind are concerned. Note that this is not to say they are not influential-- it is just invisible to most people.  Same for the Luo or any other African tribe as far as you and I are concerned-- their influence on our world may be just as invisible.  Relatively few 'outsiders' have actually investigated what knowledge exists in African tribes, how it is encoded etc, but that is not good enough grounds for assuming that a well developed Luo probablility theory is beyond the stretch of any imagination (remember this is a global forum!). 

My own understanding of the Genetic Code-- which forms the centerpiece of Genetic Information and Probability -- is that it is the same sort of situation.  If you told a multi-subunit conformationally dynamic protein that it was originally encoded in DNA it would probably just laugh at you:- 

&quot; What? All my 4-dimensionality encoded in that tangled one- dimensional string?&quot;  

Isn't that the central problem of molecular biology today? The genetic code translates between two languages, which is the same as translating between two sets of sequence probabilities. In the case of life on earth, as my little imaginary protein comment suggests, it also relates two sets of dimensionalities.  I am not familiar enough with Shannon to know if this is all Information Theory 101, but it still seems to be molecular biology 601 since we still insist on thinking of genetics as a string of letters on paper instead of real 4 dimensional molecules embedded in a resin of structured water. 

I will add some of my own thoughts about African tribes, ancient egypt, probability, Shannon, Rumer and others now that I have found this rather interesting forum. eluem_blyden@yahoo.com</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A good number of Shakespeare's plays have been lost to time.  Others have been mis-attributed or wrongly attributed to other authors.  One example of this is &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen.&quot;  While it was originally considered to be a dual authorship between Shakespeare and John Fletcher, it is currently considered to be &quot;canon&quot;, or primarily a Shakespearean work.

[[Image:Offset.png|right|frame|Offset lithography printing process]]

'''Offset printing''' is a widely used [[printing]] technique where the inked image is transferred (or &quot;offset&quot;) from a plate first to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the nonprinting areas ink-free.

The advantages of offset printing include:
* Consistent high image quality &amp;mdash; sharper and cleaner than [[letterpress printing]] because the rubber blanket conforms to the texture of the printing surface
* Usability on a wide range of printing surfaces in addition to smooth paper (e.g., wood, cloth, metal, leather, rough paper)
* Quick and easy production of printing plates
* Longer plate life than on direct litho presses &amp;mdash; because there is no direct contact between the plate and the printing surface.


==History==
The first lithographic offset [[printing press]] was created in [[England]] around [[1875]] and was designed for printing on metal. The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the litho stone to the surface of the metal. About five years later, the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber, which is still the most commonly used material.

The first person to use an offset press to print on paper was most likely [[United States|American]] Ira Washington Rubel in [[1903]]. He got the idea accidentally by noticing that whenever a sheet of paper was not fed into his lithographic press during operation, the stone printed its image to the rubber-covered impression cylinder, and the next impression had an image on both sides: direct litho on the front and an image from the rubber blanket on the back. Rubel then noticed that the image on the back of the sheet was much sharper and clearer than the direct litho image because the soft rubber was able to press the image onto the paper better than the hard stone. He soon [http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=395 decided to build a press] which printed every image from the plate to the blanket and then to the paper. Brothers Charles and Albert Harris independently observed this process at about the same time and developed an offset press for the Harris Automatic Press Company soon after.

Harris designed his offset press around a rotary letterpress machine. It used a metal plate bent around a cylinder at the top of the machine that pressed against ink and water rollers. A blanket cylinder was positioned directly below, and in contact with, the plate cylinder. The impression cylinder below pressed the paper to the blanket in order to transfer the image to the sheet (see diagram). While this basic process is still used today, refinements include two-sided printing and web feeding (using rolls of paper rather than sheets).

During the [[1950s]], offset printing became the most popular form of commercial printing as improvements were made in plates, inks and paper, maximizing the technique's superior production speed and plate durability. Today, the majority of printing, including [[newspaper]]s, is done by the offset process, although [[digital printing]] has greatly increased in popularity due to demand and cost advantages for low quantity runs.

==Present day==
Offset printing is by far the most dominant form of commercial printing due to its quality in respect of volume and paper costs, with this market being split between sheet-fed offset for low to medium volume (any job too large to be economic for [[laser printer]]s or [[digital press]]es, but too small for web offset) and web offset for medium volume up to the 1-2 million copies market.  (For high volume, a [[rotogravure]] press is often used.)  The principal difference here is that sheet-fed litho machines are fed with sheets of paper whereas web offset machines (which are larger) are fed with reels of paper and run at higher speeds; the basic offset technology remains the same. Modern offset presses increasingly use [[computer to plate]] systems.

Private or hobby presses, engaged in patient production of limited editions of fine quality books, often use [[letterpress]] as well as offset methods, some &quot;purists&quot; preferring the slightly embossed look resulting from the direct impression of inked type upon fine paper. These books are sometimes printed from hand-set foundry type (individual pieces of movable, lead-alloy type). [[Flexography]], a form of letterpress, is still used in the printing of high-quality premium labels, in ticket printing, and in envelope manufacturing/printing, though is now no longer the dominant technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Titus Andronicus|The Tragedy of Titus Andronicus]] is a tragedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], written around 1590, though records have shown that an early version had been drafted as early as 1577.  The play tells the history and downfall of the titular character, a general who at first is welcomed to his home city with open arms as a military hero.  However, as time passes, he slowly slips into madness, taking his family and a good portion of the cast with him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cross-Battery Assessment ==
The Cross Battery Assessment model takes as it starting point the idea of multiple intelligences in multiple areas. The model includes a distinction between fluid (ability to reason) and crystallized (facts) intelligence. 
This model has become quite popular of late. Recently, popular cognitve and achievement tests have started including this model explicitly in their structure. These include the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ-III COG) and the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition (WJ-III ACH). The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II) also specifically addresses  this model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Irving Yalom:'''
Irving Yalom 1951 -

Home: New York City.
School: Interpersonal, with a psychoanalytical background - although he uses a &quot;Here and Now Focus.&quot; Yalom may claim himself to be an existentialist as his therapy deals with &quot;existential factors&quot;, but he does not take a phenomenonlogical approach to therapy.
He was educated at Stanford University, and was strongly influenced by psychodynamic and phonomenological thinking, as well as by other mental-health professionals, such as social workers. 
He has been extremely influential in the practice of group psychotherapies, and has published numerous books, including &quot;The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy&quot; (1996) and xistential Psychology&quot;. Yalom has also written a book on Nietzsche


'''Influences on Yalom:''' Yalom was most notably influenced by Harry Stack Sullivan  who believed that pathology derives from interpersonal perceptual problems. In dealing with these problems, Yalom, unlike Sullivan, sought to work them out in a group setting, with a &quot;Here and Now Focus&quot;. In this focus, the therapist facilitates interaction in the group, with issues taking place in the group. Members are discouraged from talking about their past issues or events occurring outside the group. When one member of the group expresses some interactional problem, they are asked to find someone within the present group who is similar to a person they would deal with in their regular lives. Conflicts and other issues are worked out, in vivo.

During this interaction, Yalom asks clients to observe themselves in the interaction. What he is attempting to create here is what he calls a Self Reflective Loop. While observing what they do &quot;here and now&quot;, what they are feeling, saying and doing, they may learn how they really act outside the group.

In Yalom's view, the group is a microcosm of other social groups, such as families, and even society itself. In order to reinforce the effects of the group, Yalom feels that therapy should become  the most important event in a client's life (i.e., temporarily, for the duration of therapy).

In Yalom's group therapies, newness and experimentation during  therapeutic interactions are emphasized. Members collect feedback as they try out new behaviors.

Yalom has outlined the processes underlying his group therapies, calling them the ''curative factors in group therapy''. These are outlined below - 
'''
The Curative Factors in Groups Therapy '''

#Instillation of Hope: Establishing a sense among group members that change and resolution are possible. 
#Universality: The sense that group members experience similar pain and struggles. 
# Imparting of information: Group members share information about recovery, strategies, resources, and behaviours (i.e., what to do).
# Altruism: The very nature of the therapy, in which group members help each other (while getting help) is reciprocal. This reciprocity gives way to feelings of altruism - which in itself has the capacity to make one feel better. 
# The corrective recapitulation of the primary family group: The group environment mimics the primary family, and the group member can therefore experience what it is like to be in a more supportive environment (if his/her family experiences were negative). 
# Development of socializing techniques: Therapy is a place to be with others, to listen, and to talk to others.  Therefore, Yalom views that very act ov socializing to be therapeutic. 
# Imitative behavior: Therapy is a place where you can try behaviors that others have found successful. This process relates to the process of altruism mentioned above, in that group members can experiment ''in vivo'' with the advice they learn from others. 
# Interpersonal learning: The process of learning how to adopt and take on other perspectives - other than one's own.
# Group cohesiveness: Being a part of a group instills a sense of belonging, which a priori includes a sense of being important to each other.
# Catharsis: Therapy should be a place to vent and explore feelings and get relief from them.

In Yalom's view, two processes work together to produce change:  Group Cohesiveness and Catharsis. Cohesiveness is what causes members to cathect to the group - i.e. it is what makes their feedback emotionally motivating - and thus a force of change. When a member cathects to the group, s/he is motivated to change behaviors that are unacceptable to the group. When the group matters to the individual, the individual becomes more like the group, and thus changes. Therefore, the group must become important to all the group's members if cohesiveness is to be established.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dynamic Assessment ==

Dynamic Assessment is characterized by an approach first forwarded by Feurstein (1979). Feurstein spoke of the Learning Potential Assessment Device. Feurstein's background was in Israel, working with children displaced by the Holocaust. Feurstein found that on traditional intelligence tests, these children often scored in the very delayed range, but he saw the progress they made with support and the &quot;spark&quot; for learning they had. He thus spoke of the &quot;potential&quot; of children and focused on this ability to change rather than any score. His approach is based on a series of learning tasks with children. Once a child's strategies are uncovered with support (we would characterize this now as &quot;testing of the limits&quot;) he would use this knowledge to help children see how to apply these strategies in other situations, specifically within academic tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is sometimes said that before the 17th century, there was no distinction between conscience and consciousness (both being referenced by the same Latin word 'conscius--from 'conscientia').  One feature of the soul being its ability to know itself, and the soul being witnessed also by God, there was a sense in which conscience was a knowledge of the inner life shared with God. In fact, Henig (2006) proposes that Descartes did not invent an entirely new sense of conscience, but if anything adapted this Augustinian sense of the term.  The Augustinians themselves can be said to have adapted this use of conscius from the Latin Stoics like Seneca. On the other hand the Ancient Greek philosophers were clear that there was a problem of mind and the work of Descartes can be seen as more directly connected with Aristotle rather than with medieval philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)===

Some of the controversies surrounding ADHD include whether it is overdiagnosed, whether it is a &quot;new disorder&quot;, who diagnoses are made to benefit (children or teachers and parents), the appropriateness of medicating young children, the high rates of co-occurrence with a variety of other disorders (i.e., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, depression, Tourette's Disorder), and whether the disorder persists past childhood. 


====History====

Contrary to much popular belief, the symptoms of ADHD have been recognized for more than 150 years. In 1844 Dr. Heinrich Hoffman wrote the following story about a little boy he called Fidgety Philip:

{{quote|Let me see if Philip can

Be a little gentleman

Let me see, if he is able

To sit still for once at table:

Thus Papa bade Phil behave;

And Mamma look'd very grave.

But fidgety Phil,

He won't sit still;

He wriggles

and giggles,

And then, I declare

Swings backwards and forwards

And tilts up his chair,

Just like any rocking horse; -

&quot;Philip! I am getting cross!&quot;   
   
See the naughty restless child

Growing still more rude and wild.

Till his chair falls over quite.

Philip screams with all his might.

Catches at the cloth, but then

That makes matters worse again.

Down upon the ground they fall.

Glasses, plates, knives, forks and all.

How Mamma did fret and frown.

When she saw them tumbling down!

And Papa made such a face!

Philip is in sad disgrace.    
 
Where is Philip, where is he?

Fairly cover'd up you see!

Cloth and all are lying on him;

He has pull'd down all upon him.

What a terrible to-do!

Dishes, glasses, snapt in two!

Here a knife, and there a fork!

Philip, this is cruel work.

Table all so bare, and ah!

Poor Papa, and poor Mamma

Look quite cross, and wonder how

They shall make their dinner now.}}   
 

Interestingly, this poem covers many known aspects of ADHD: the hyperactivity, the inability to make predictions, and family relation difficulties.

====Diagnosis====

The DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD propose three different subtypes for the disorder:

Predominantly Inattentive Type,
Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type, and
Combined Type.

Although these subtypes were intended to clarify prognosis and treatment, there is some suggestion that the subtypes really represent a developmental progression, with young children with ADHD more likely to show the hyperactive-impulsive type, school-age children more likely to show combined type, and adolescents and adults more likely to show the inattentive type.

There is some controversy around the &quot;laxness&quot; of this definition. ICD-10 for instance, uses far stricter criteria for its nearest equivalent disorder to ADHD: hyperkinesis. While appoximately 5% of US children meet criteria for DSM-IV ADHD, only 1% meet criteria for hyperkinesis.

Barkley, a prominent researcher and theorist on ADHD, has proposed that the main deficit in ADHD is in behavioural inhibition. Further to this point, he feels that the inattentive subtype of ADHD is a separate disorder from the hyperactive-impulsive and combined types.

There is accumulating evidence to suggest that ADHD does indeed persist into adulthood. Current conceptualizations of the disorder in adults, suggest some common symptomology with depression. A problem with diagnosing ADHD in adulthood is that the diagnostic criteria have been set up around what one would see in a child with the disorder and that these criteria are not necessarily appropriate for use with children.

====Treatment====
=====Pharmacological Treatment=====

Two main types of medications are used to treat the core symptoms of ADHD. These are stimulants and non-stimulants. Other medications, most often atypical antipsychotics are used at times to address behavioural difficulties.

The main stimulant medications are Ritalin (generic: methylphenidate), Concerta (a slow-releasing version of Ritalin), and Dexedrine

The first non-stimulant medication approved for treatment of ADHD was Straterra, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Effexor is also often used in children with co-occurring anxiety and ADHD.

Clonidine, an atypical, is often used in children with Tourrette's Disorder and ADHD.

=====Behavioural Treatment=====

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
In chemistry, the standard conditions are defined as:
* a ''specified'' temperature
* 1 atm pressure
* 1 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; concentration

To indicate that a quantity was measured under standard conditions, a superscript plimsoll line symbol, &lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;, is added to the quantity's symbol.

== Why do we use standard conditions? ==
=== Measurements depend on conditions ===
If you measure a physical quantity (like enthalpy change), you will get different values under different conditions. For example, the enthalpy change of a particular reaction will be different at different temperatures, different pressures or different concentrations of reactants.

=== Using standard conditions avoids infinitely long data tables ===
You could imagine having tables of values for every possible combination of physical quantity, temperature, pressure, concentration and so on. In practice, this is unfeasable and unnecessary. A more elegant solution is to define a set of conditions (called '''standard conditions''') and always measure physical quantities under these conditions. You can calculate the value of the physical quantity under non-standard conditions using appropriate mathematical techniques.

=== Standard conditions can often be used unmodified ===
Often, you won't even need to adjust the value of a quantity measured under standard conditions to what it would be if it were measured under specific non-standard set of conditions. For example, if you are looking at trends in the periodic table by comparing, say, ionisation enthalpy, the pattern should be equally clear under standard conditions or not.  In fact, having the values for different elements all measured under the same conditions saves a great deal of effort — imagine having to adjust hundreds of pieces of data to correct for the fact that they were each recorded under different conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Antony and Cleopatra|The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra]] is a tragedy by [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]].  The date that the play was written is a source of debate among modern scholars.  Some believe that it was written between 1606 and 1607, while others say that it was between 1603 and 1604. The play is a retelling of the classical story of the love affair between Marc Antony and Cleopatra, the Queen of the Nile.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.

== Metabolics ? ==
Hello, I have noticed that you have started to add lots of good content into wikibooks &lt;s&gt;but I don't understand why you put every subpage of the book into the main namespace, don't you like the default way books are structured? Will your new structure add any benefit?  The down side is that it seems to go against the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and makes them very hard to navigate. I will ask you that if possible you move them under a single cover/subject/toc and attempt to address the taggs added to some pages, that would help us a lot.&lt;/s&gt; Txs. And keep that content coming.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:31, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

:I have noticed that you saw the problem and you are addressing it. You can tag empty pages (pages made in error that don't have any purpose) with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, or you can just move the page and the old one will become a redirect that if you don't tagg as delete someone will if no links to it are active. I will tag some of the empty pages to help you out.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:39, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

Thanks you, I was just thrown this project so i'll try to address as much as I can. [[User:Guiltyblade| Guiltyblade]])

:You can backtrack your edits on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Guiltyblade| your contribution] list (it's on the menu also) and you can use [[Special:Prefixindex]] to check any prefix, for instance [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Metabolomics&amp;namespace=0 there] it will show every page under that Metabolomics namespace.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:49, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

:Ok seems all is cleared now. Txs.  Any problem I can help just ask.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:04, 4 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

==1. Name five uses made of natural materials by the Northwest Indians. ==
;Vermilion: Vermilion was used as a red pigment.
;Cedar: Cedar planks were used for building longhouses.  Red and yellow cedar was also used for totem poles, ceremonial masks, rattles, food containers, bentwood boxes, spoons, spindles, hats, capes, effigies.
;Rush: Mats, skirts, hats, rattles, baskets, temporary dwellings were made from rush (tules).
;Dog &amp; Mountain Sheep hair: Hair from a wooly dog bred by these peoples for this purpose, or mountain sheep was combined with cedar bark and spun into yarn, which was then woven into blankets.  They also used down feathers from ducks and geese.
;Buffalo: The inland tribes made tipis, clothing, bags and pouches, clothing, backrests, pictographs, parfletches, drums, rattles, moccasins, buffalo robes, padding out of the hides. Glue, needles &amp; thread out of the sinew.  Cooking pots from the stomach, rattles from hooves, brain tanning produces a high quality leather.

==2. Name five uses made of the yucca plant by the Southwest Indians. ==
;Food: The fruit of the yucca were a staple of the southwest diet.
;Cordage: The fibers of the yucca plant were spun into rope.  This rope was in turn used for many things including '''sandals''', '''belts''', '''rope ladders''', and '''fishnets'''.
;Paintbrush: The fibers of the yucca were chewed into a fine fringe and used as a paintbrush for decorating pottery.
;Shampoo: The roots of the yucca plant were pounded and whipped into cold water to make suds.  (Soap plant is different from the Yucca and can be used to wash the finest linens and silks.)
;Basketry: The leaves of the yucca plant were woven into baskets.

==3. Name five uses made of the birch tree by the Eastern Woodland Indians. ==
The bark of the Birch tree, especially the Paper Birch, were used for making the outer covering of their '''canoes'''.  Bark was also used for making '''bowls''' and '''tipis'''.  The bark contains a resinous oil and peels into papery-thin strips which ignite easily with even the slightest spark, and thus, the bark was also used as '''tinder'''.  The wood of the birch contains the same resinous oil, and burns even when wet.  It was therefore used as '''firewood'''.  Birch bark was also used for making '''torches''' which they used for night fishing.

The bark was also used for brewing a '''wintergreen tea ''' high in vitamin C.  '''Fans''' were also manufactured, and were used both for creating a cool breeze and for fanning fires.  Birch bark was also used for making '''armguards''' and '''quivers''' for archery, '''rattles''', and for '''wrapping food'''.

==4. Know 15 plant foods introduced to us by the Indians. Include four plant names used today. ==
Squash, corn, and beans were known as the &quot;Three Sisters&quot; by Native Americans. The Three Sisters were the three main indigenous plants used for agriculture. These were usually planted together, with the cornstalk providing support for the climbing beans (pinto, kidney, navy, black, pink, cranberry beans, etc.), and shade for the squash. The squash vines provided ground cover to limit weeds and deter animals. The beans provided nitrogen fixing for all three crops.

Native Americans ate from about 1000 different species of plants. Now grocery stores sell food items made from about 100 species of plants. However the 1000 species do not all grow in the same area. Go to http://plants.usda.gov and see plant range maps of every known plant in North America.

==5. Describe Indian stalking and tracking. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stalking and tracking}}

==6. Name five rocks and/or minerals and uses made of them by the Indians. ==
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Chacoan turquoise pendant.jpg|Turquoise pendant

&lt;/gallery&gt;
# '''Flint''', used for making arrowheads, knives, and other cutting tools.
# '''Obsidian''', used the same way as flint.
# '''Clay''', used for making pottery and effigies.
# '''Turquoise''', used for adornment and ceremonies.
# '''Argillite''', used in art.
# '''Vermilion''', used as body paint, combined with &quot;glue&quot; was used for pictographs on hides and rawhides.
# '''Soapstone''', used for carvings, bowls, cooking slabs, and other objects.
# '''Granite, quartzite, basalt, sandstone, and slate''', used for making hammers, axes, adzes, hoes, bowls, vases, and other items.

==7. Explain one way in which arrowheads were made by the Indians. ==
A '''flintknapper''' is an individual who shapes flint or other stone through the process of knapping or lithic reduction, to manufacture stone tools.

Knapping is done in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the final product. 
For stone tools flint is worked using a fabricator, such as a hammerstone, to remove flakes from a core of tool stone. Stone tools can then be further refined using wood, bone, and antler tools to perform pressure flaking.

There are many different methods of shaping stone into useful tools. The three simplest techniques are mentioned below.

===Hard Hammer Precussion===
[[Image:Hard_Hammer.jpg|thumb|left|An example of hard hammer percussion.]]
Hard hammer techniques are used to remove large flakes of stone. Early flintknappers and hobbyists replicating their methods often use cobbles about the size of a baseball or softball of very hard stone, such as quartzite or hard granite. This technique can be used by flintknappers to remove broad flakes that can be made into smaller tools.

===Soft Hammer Precussion===
[[Image:Soft_Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|An example of soft hammer percussion]]
Early flintknappers could have used simple hammers made of wood or antler to shape stone tools. Soft hammer techniques are more precise than hard hammer methods of shaping stone. Soft hammer techniques allow a flintknapper to shape a stone into many different kinds of cutting, scraping, and projectile tools. 

===Pressure Flaking===
[[Image:Pressure_Flaking.jpg|thumb|left|An example of pressure flaking]]
Pressure flaking involves removing narrow flakes along the edge of a stone tool. This technique is often used to do detailed thinning and shaping of a stone tool. Pressure flaking involves putting a large amount of force across a region on the edge of the tool and (hopefully) causing a narrow flake to come off of the stone. Modern hobbyists often use pressure flaking tools with a copper or brass tip, but early flintknappers could have used antler tines or a pointed wooden punch.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==8. Define pictograph. What are Indian petroglyphs and where can you find them? ==
A '''pictograph''' is an image drawn or painted on a rock face.  A '''petroglyph''' is an image carved into a rock face.  Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often (but not always) associated with prehistoric peoples.  
&lt;gallery&gt;

==9. Describe the use of seashells by the Indians. ==
[[Image:Wampum william penn greaty treaty.jpg|thumb|600px]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
'''Wampum''' is a string of white shell beads fashioned from the North Atlantic channeled whelk shell, and was used by Native Americans who regarded it as a sacred or trade representative of the value of the artist's work. Wampum was also used for engagement, marriage, and betrothal agreements, as well as for ceremony and condolence ceremonies. 


Shells were also used for jewellery, as weapons, and for decoration of tipis, clothing and objects such as bags, backrests and ownership sticks.

==10. Name at least ten materials used in making Indian arts and crafts. ==
# Leather
# Fur
# Feathers
# Hair
# Antler
# Bone
# Shell
# Wood
# Bark
# Yucca
# Gourd
# Rush
# Stone/Vermillion
# Clay
# Copper
# Gold
# Silver
# Torquoise
# Sinew
# Hooves
# Stomach
# Bladder
# Prickley Pear Cactus
# Red &amp; Yellow Cedar
# Brains,ash,urine
# Corn husks
# Tendons
# Soap plant
# Moss
# Pipestone
# Raw hide
# Flint
# Obsidian
# Turtle shell
# Grass
# Cattail leaves
# Pitch (glue)
# Char coal

==11. Make a craft item, using any of the materials named in requirement ten (10). ==
'''Note: The ''official'' version calls out requirement 9 rather than 10, but this is almost certainly a typo.'''


Native Americans were masters of many crafts which Pathfinders might enjoy learning.  One possibility for meeting this requirement is to make a pair of moccasins.  

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Make moccasins}}

Be sure to look into the [[../Leather Craft|Leather Craft]] and [[../../Recreation/Pioneering|Pioneering]] honors if you choose to make moccasins, as making moccasins meet a requirement in each of these.

If moccasins do not appeal to you, you could try your hand at beadwork:
* http://www.guidetobeadwork.com/book/index.html
You can also decorate your moccasins with beadwork.

Or perhaps you would enjoy pottery (see the [[../Pottery|Pottery]] honor for details) or some other craft.

==Pest profiles in [[Horticulture|A Wikimanual of Gardening]]==
Thanks for doing some indexing!!! There are actually a lot of &quot;profiles&quot; in [[:Category:Horticulture/Pests|Category:Garden pests]] if you're looking to see what's here. I haven't done any indexing for a while, but there are plenty of pages to be found in the book using the category structure. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:41, 18 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pronunciation - consonants==

In this lesson, we shall pay special attention to the consonant system of the Belarusian language, which is much more complex than that of English.

First of all, all consonants are divided in two major groups: voiced consonants and surd ones. Voiced consonants are pronounced with the participation of your vocal cords, while with surd consonants no voice is produced and they totally consist of the noise produced by your lips, teeth, tongue, palate et al. Most voiced consonants have their surd counterparts, and vice versa. To pronounce a surd analog of a voiced consonant you just need to &quot;turn off&quot; the voice.

The following chart represents the system of Belarusian consonants arranged in &quot;voiced&quot;-&quot;surd&quot; pairs.

Note that only &quot;hard&quot; consonants are dealt with so far, and there exist nearly as much &quot;soft&quot; consonant sounds.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Voiced
! Surd
! English analogs
|-
| б
| п
| ''b'' in ''big'' - ''p'' in ''pig''
|-
| в
| ф
| ''v'' in ''van'' - ''f'' in ''fan''
|-
| г
| х
| ''no correspondence''
|-
| (г)
| к
| ''g'' in ''gate'' - ''k'' in ''Kate''
|-
| д
| т
| ''d'' in ''dime'' - ''t'' in ''time''
|-
| дж
| ч
| ''j'' in ''joke'' - ''ch'' in ''choke''
|-
| дз
| ц
| ''ds '' in ''fads'' - ''ts'' in ''bats''
|-
| ж
| ш
| ''s'' in pleasure; ''sh'' in ''ship''
|-
| з
| с
| ''z'' in ''zoo'' - ''s'' in ''Sue''
|}

The voiced consonants ''й'', ''л'', ''м'', ''н'', ''р'' and ''ў'' have no surd pairs.

The sounds ''б'' and ''п'', ''в'' and ''ф'', ''з'' and ''с'', and ''м'' are pronounced the same as English ''b'' - ''p'', ''v'' - ''f'', ''z'' - ''s'' and ''m''.

''Ф'' is a queer sound for Belarusian and its occurrence in a word almost certainly indicates a borrowing (most probalby from Greek).

The sound ''к'' is pronounced like English ''k''. In rare occasions, letter ''г'' is pronounced like English ''g'' in ''garden''. As was mentioned earlier, in tarashkievitsa, a special letter ''ґ'' is used to denote this sound.

The sounds ''ж'' and ''ш'' are like English ''s'' in ''pleasure'' and ''sh'' in ''ship'', but are pronounced harder. This means that you should move your tongue a bit down and backward to pronounce Belarusian ''ж'' and ''ш'' (relative to its position while pronouncing the English sounds).

The combination ''дж'' is pronounced as a single sound, which is like ''j'' in ''jam''. Its surd mate is ''ч''. Again, Belarusian ''дж'' and ''ч'' are harder than English ''j'' and ''ch''.

Note that in Belarusian, ''п'', ''ф'', ''к'', ''т'' and ''ч'' before stressed vowels are pronounced with no aspiration characteristic to English surd consonants.

Also note that Belarusian sounds ''д'', ''т'', ''л'' and ''н'' are pronounced with your tongue tip between the teeth, just as in English ''th'' sound.

The sound ''ц'' is present in English but does not occur at the start of a word, unlike in Belarusian. In other European languages it is usually denoted by the letter ''z'': ''Zeit'', ''Zimmer'', ''Zahn'' in German; ''zio'', ''pazione'', ''pranzare'' in Italian. The sound ''дз'' is uncommon for Belarusian and occurs in just a few Belarusian words, most of which are imitative (like ''jingle'' or ''clink'').

Another sound pair that might cause problems to an English speaker is the ''г'' - ''х'' pair. The sound ''х'' is present in German (''ch'' in ''auch'', ''hoch'' or ''Tuch'') and Spanish (''j'' in ''rojo'' or ''junto''). To pronounce it, try to say ''k'' as a fricative, i.e. keep saying it for a long span of time, e.g. five seconds. To do so, you will need to move your tongue a bit down to let the air out of your larynx. But it is a mistake to move your tongue too low and pronounce it like English ''h'' in ''hand''.

The sound ''г'' is a voiced analog of ''х''.

The sound ''р'' differs substantially from the English ''r'' sound. If you have heard the ''r'' sound in Spanish (''rosa'') or Italian (''marrone'') you know how to pronounce it. It is a rolling sound resembling a roar of a motorbike engine on the top gear. This sound is the hardest to pronounce among Belarusians themselves (as well as Russians).

The sound ''й'' corresponds to the English sound ''y'' in ''yes'' or ''yellow''. In English, it can never be a final sound. In Belarusian, however, it is a common practice. E.g. the word ''май'' (May) is pronounced with final consonant ''й''. It is a mistake to vocalise it, like in English ''my''.

The sound ''ў'' is actually a semivowel. But this sound is worth a separate observation.

==Grammar - This is a X==

Let's translate &quot;this is a cat&quot; into Belarusian. The Belarusian for ''this'' is '''гэ́та''', so the result will be

'''Гэта кот.'''

You see that in this sentence there is (1) no article and (2) no linking verb. Actually, there exists a verb corresponding to English &quot;is&quot;, but it is in most cases omitted.

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 2===

*'''''Vatiniana - Vatinius'''''

Vatinius was a henchman of Caesar's. During a speech of Calvus's, he is said to have stood up and shouted &quot;rogo vos, iudices, num, si iste est disertus, ideo me damnari oportet?&quot; which means &quot;I ask you, jury, if because that man is eloquent, It is right for me to be found guilty?&quot;

===Line 3===

*'''''Calvus - a.k.a. Licinius Calvus'''''

Licinius Calvus was a friend and possibly fellow poet of Catullus's (see [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/50|Poem 50]])

*'''''explicasset - he had explained'''''

read &quot;explicavisset&quot;, this was a common shortening in Latin.

===Line 5===

*'''''di magni - lit. great gods'''''

lit. Great Gods! but in a contempory context &quot;Good Heavens&quot; or something similar is probably more appropriate.

=Vocabulary=

===Line 1===

*'''[[wikt:corona|corona]]''' - crowd

===Line 4===

*'''[[wikt:aio|ait]]''' - he said

===Line 5===

*'''[[wikt:salaputinium|salaputinum]]''' - little man (derisive)

=Connotations of the Text=

===Line 1===

*'''''ni'''''

read &quot;nisi&quot;, which means 'unless'.

*'''''oculis'''''

&quot;if I did not love you more than my eyes&quot; is unnatural in English. This may be better translated as &quot;If I did not love you more than myself&quot; or &quot;If you weren't the apple of my eye&quot;.

However, the meaning &quot;eyes&quot; would still make sense, as the eyes are a precious organ of any human being - and a thing to be cared for.

*'''''amarem'''''

even though this is imperfect it is translated as present in English.

===Line 2===

*'''''Calve'''''

Licinius Calvus was a friend of Catullus's.

===Line 3===

*'''''Vatiniano'''''

Vatinius was a man whom Calvus had prosecuted in court. (see [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/53|Poem 53]])

===Line 6===

*'''''clienti'''''

The Romans had a system of patrons and clients. The patrons protected their clients in court and gave them financial help, and in return the clients may have given the patrons political support and occasionally little presents of gratitude such as this book of poetry.

===Line 9===

*'''''Sulla'''''

Here, Sulla refers to a man Calvus defended in court.

===Line 10===

*'''''mi'''''

read &quot;mihi&quot;

This line literally translates to &quot;it is not badly for me, but well and happily&quot;.

===Line 12===

*'''''di magni'''''

Literally &quot;Great Gods&quot; but in a contemporary context something like &quot;Good Heavens&quot; is probably more appropriate.

*'''''libellum'''''

diminutive of &quot;liber&quot; - book. Catullus was very fond of diminutives and used them to express smallness, affection, pity, or scorn depending on the context. Here it is probably used to express scorn.

===Line 14===

*'''''misti'''''

Read &quot;misisti&quot;, yet another common way of shortening words in Latin.

===Line 15===

*'''''Saturnalibus'''''

The Saturnalia was a festival for Saturn that began on the 17th of December. It was the biggest festival of the year; the Roman equivalent of Christmas.

===Line 16===

*'''''salse - smartarse, clever'''''

Meaning &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;witty&quot;, the original meaning of the word is &quot;salt&quot;. This is because the Romans used the salt to enhance the flavour of their meat and other food, and so, the poet uses metaphorical salt, or &quot;wit&quot; to enhance his work.

===Lines 18 - 19===

*'''''Caesios, Aquinos, Suffenum'''''

Nothing is now known about Caesius and Aquinus, although we can deduce from this poem that they were bad poets. Catullus attacks Suffenus as a writer of endless bad verses in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/22|Poem 22]]

===Line 21===

*'''''vos'''''

refers to the poets Catullus has gathered.

*'''''malum pedem'''''

literally &quot;bad foot&quot;. In Latin as well as English &quot;foot&quot; was used to mean a section of a line of poetry.

===Line 23===

*'''''pessimi poetae - worst poets'''''

Here the alliteration of '''p''' shows Catullus' disgust for the aforementioned poets. This technique, whilst placed at the end of the line leaves a lasting impression on the reader, and Catullus' opinion on low-quality work stays with us. It could also be a subtle hint of Catullus, asserting how his work is superior.

=Vocabulary=

===Line 2===

*'''[[Wikt:munus|munus, -eris]] ''n.''''' - gift, present

===Line 5===

*'''[[Wikt:tot|tot]]''' - so many

*'''[[Wikt:perdere|perderes]]''' - pester, burden, annoy, destroy

===Line 7===

*'''impiorum''' - Roman piety was defined as dedication to gods, country, and family and was the greatest virtue. So impiety or &quot;impiorum&quot; was considered the greatest vice.

===Line 8===

*'''repertum''' - sought after

===Line 10===

*'''[[Wikt:beate|beate]]''' - happily

===Line 11===

*'''[[Wikt:dispereo|dispereunt]]''' - this word contains &quot;pereunt&quot; (they perished) which is made up of per + eunt (through + gone). This prefix &quot;dis-&quot; is emphatic.

===Line 13===

*'''[[Wikt:scilicet|scilicet]]''' - scire + licet = it is possible to know = obviously

===Line 16===

*'''salse''' - smartarse, clever fiend, clever one

===Line 18===

*'''scrinia'' n.pl.''''' - shelves

===Line 23===

*'''saecli''' - curses

== Language course ==

Welcome on Wikibooks!
I’m new to this wiki as well. I’m living in the Northeast of Germany and might help you correcting your German language course for English native-speakers. My English is not so well that I could compose disquisitions filling pages, but in case I catched on well your [[LIL German 1|project description page,]] that’s not what I would have to do. I would expunge some mistakes—such as '''Student''' ''(SHTOO-dent),'' which is actually stressed on the last syllable—and record some texts with the microphone that I’m going to buy next week.

== welcome ==

Dear Lutonia,
Welcome to WikiBooks.

Thank you for contributing your language course books.
Most of the books here are still undergoing revisions,
so feel free to go ahead and post your current draft here
even if you don't feel it is &quot;finished&quot;.

Would you like someone else to post them here for you?

'''Sooty mold''' is a fungus which grows from the sugary honeydew secreted by aphids, scales, the whitefly, and other insects which suck sap from their host plants. 

==Symptoms and Signs==
The name itself is descriptive, as sooty mold is a black, powdery coating on the leaves. Look for sooty mold on new growth and leaves, since these insects prefer soft tissue. The fungus itself does little harm to the plant; it merely blocks sunlight and very rarely may stunt a plant's growth and yellow its foliage. Thus, sooty mold is essentially a cosmetic problem, as it is unsightly and can take over a plant in a matter of days or weeks.

==Life Cycle==


==Host Range==
Sooty mold affects ornamentals such as azaleas, gardenias, camellias, crepe myrtles, and laurels.  Plants located under pecan or hickory trees are more susceptible to sooty mold because honeydew-secreting insects often inhabit these trees, and the honeydew can drip down to the plants below. 

==Controls==
{{Phytopathcontrol|
| Exclusion = Control hemipteran pests to avoid the creation of honeydew
| Cultivation = 
| Cultural Controls = Overhead irrigation
| Physical Removal = 
| Chemical Controls (organic) = Soaps
| Chemical Controls (synthetic) = 
| Biocontrols = 
| Disposal = Safe in all compost systems
}}

== Treatment ==
There are several means of treating sooty mold. In essence, they all boil down to controlling the pest(s) secreting the honeydew on the plant. Without honeydew there is no sooty mold. 

Some options include:
*Using systemic insecticides such as orthene, malathion, or diazinon. Always follow all instructions on such fungicides, and never use these on plants which produce fruit or vegetables.
*Using insecticidal soap, dish soap, or detergent dissolved in water and sprayed on the plant. Allow to sit and then use a hose to wash off the sooty mold. Most recommend one tablespoon per gallon of water. (Note: this only removes the sooty mold, and some of the insects. It does not solve the long-term insect problem.)

The above treatments do not permanently stop sooty mold or the insects which secrete honeydew. It is best, if you grow plants prone to the fungus, to use these treatments preventively.</text>

==Concentration==
The '''concentration''' of a solution is the measure of how much solute and solvent there is.  A solution is ''concentrated'' if it contains a large amount of solute, or ''dilute'' if contains a small amount.

===Molarity===
Molarity is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  It is abbreviated with the symbol M, and is sometimes used as a unit of measurement, e.g. a 0.3 molar solution of HCl.  In that example, there would be 3 moles of HCl for every 10 liters of water (or whatever the solvent was).

{{Info|Molarity is by far the most commonly used measurement of concentration.}}

===Molality===
Molality is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.  It is abbreviated with the symbol m (lowercase), and is sometimes used as a unit of measurement, e.g. a 0.3 molal solution of HBr.  In that example, there would be 3 moles of HBr for every 10 kilograms of water (or whatever the solvent was).

{{Yellow Warning|One kilogram of water is one liter of water (near room temperature), but the molality is ''not'' the same as the molarity.  The molarity is the ratio of solute to solution, whereas the molality is the ratio of solute to solvent.}}

===Mole Fraction===
The mole fraction is simply the moles of solute per moles of solution.  As an example, you dissolve one mole of NaCl into three moles of water.  Remember that the NaCl will dissociate into its ions, so there are now five moles of particles: one mole Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, one mole Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and three moles water.  The mole fraction of sodium is 0.2, the mole fraction of chloride is 0.2, and the mole fraction of water is 0.6.

The mole fraction is symbolized with the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; (chi), which is often written simply as an X.

{{Info|The sum of all mole fractions for a solution must equal 1.}}

==Dilution==
''Dilution'' is adding solvent to a solution to obtain a less concentrated solution.  Perhaps you have used dilution when running a lemonade stand.  To cut costs, you could take a half-full jug of rich, concentrated lemonade and fill it up with water.  The resulting solution would have the same total amount of sugar and lemon juice, but double the total volume.  Its flavor would be weaker due to the added water.

{{SideBox|Chemists often keep highly concentrated solutions of useful chemicals.  They can quickly obtain more dilute solutions of known concentration by this method.}}
The key concept is that the amount of solute is constant before and after the dilution process.  The concentration is decreased (and volume increased) only by adding solvent.
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=20px
| &lt;math&gt;moles_1 = moles_2&lt;/math&gt;
| Thus, the number of moles of solute before and after dilution are equal.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M \times V = moles&lt;/math&gt;
| By definition of molarity, you can find the moles of solvent.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M_1 \times V_1 = M_2 \times V_2&lt;/math&gt;
|  Substituting the second equation into the first gives the '''dilution equation'''.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

To determine the amount of solvent (usually water) that must be added, you must know the initial volume and concentration, and the desired concentration.  Solving for &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation will give you the ''total'' volume of the diluted solution.  Subtracting the initial volume from the total volume will determine the amount of pure solvent that must be added.

==Ionic Solutes==
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they separate into ions. This process is called '''dissociation'''. Note that because of dissociation, there are more moles of particles in the solution containing ions than there would be with the solute and solvent separated.

If you have two glasses of water, and you dissolve salt into one and sugar into the other, there will be a big difference in concentration.  The salt will dissociate into its ions, but sugar (a molecule) will not dissociate.  If the salt were NaCl, the concentration would be double that of the sugar.  If the salt were MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the concentration would be triple (there are three ions).

===Solubility Rules===
Not all ionic compounds are soluble.  Some ionic compounds have so much attractive force between their anions and cations that they will not dissociate.  These substances are ''insoluble'' and will not dissolve.  Instead, they clump together as a solid in the bottom of solution.  Many ionic compounds, however, will dissociate in water and dissolve.  In these cases, the attractive force between ion and water is greater than that between cation and anion.  There are several rules to help you determine which compounds will dissolve and which will not.

{{TextBox|1=
;Solubility Rules
# All compounds with Group 1 ions or ammonium ions are soluble.
# Nitrates, acetates, and chlorates are soluble.
# Compounds containing a halogen are soluble, except those with fluorine, silver, or mercury. If they have lead, they are soluble only in hot water.
# Sulfates are soluble, except when combined with silver, lead, calcium, barium, or strontium.
# Carbonates, sulfides, oxides, silicates, and phosphates are insoluble, except for rule #1.
# Hydroxides are insoluble except when combined with calcium, barium, strontium, or rule #1.}}

Sometimes, when two different ionic compounds are dissolved, they react, forming a '''precipitate''' that is insoluble. Predicting these reactions requires knowledge of the [[General_Chemistry/Predicting_Chemical_Reactions|activity series]] and solubility rules. These reactions can be written with all ions, or without the '''spectator ions''' (the ion that don't react, present on both sides of the reaction), a format known as the '''net ionic equation'''.

For example, silver nitrate is soluble, but silver chloride is not soluble (see the above rules).  Mixing silver nitrate into sodium chloride would cause a cloudy white precipitate to form.  This happens because of a [[General Chemistry/Types of chemical reactions#Double Replacement Reactions|double replacement reaction]].

==Electrolytes==
When solutes dissociate (or if a molecule ''ionizes''), the solution can conduct electricity. Compounds that readily form ions, thus being good conductors, are known as '''strong electrolytes'''. If only a small amount of ions are formed, electricity is poorly conducted, meaning the compound is a '''weak electrolyte'''.

{{Info|A ''strong electrolyte'' will dissolve completely.  All ions dissociate.  A ''weak electrolyte'', on the other hand, will partially dissociate, but some ions will remain bonded together.}}

==Colligative Properties==
Some properties are the same for all solute particles regardless of what kind. These are known as the '''colligative properties'''.  These properties apply to '''ideal solutions''', so in reality, the properties may not be exactly as calculated.  In an ideal solution, there are no forces acting between the solute particles, which is generally not the case.

===Vapor Pressure===
All liquids have a tendency for their surface molecules to escape and evaporate, even if the liquid is not at its boiling point. This is because the average energy of the molecules is too small for evaporation, but some molecules could gain above average energy and escape. '''Vapor pressure''' is the measure of the pressure of the evaporated vapor, and it depends on the temperature of the solution and the quantities of solute. More solute will decrease vapor pressure.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;20px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;P_{solution} = P_{pure~solvent} \times \chi_{solvent}&lt;/math&gt;
| The vapor pressure is given by '''Rauolt's Law''', where &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is the mole fraction of the solvent.  Notice that the vapor pressure equals that of the pure solvent when there is no solute (&lt;math&gt;\chi = 1&lt;/math&gt;).  If &lt;math&gt;\chi = 0&lt;/math&gt;, there would be no vapor pressure at all.  This could only happen if there were no solvent, only solute.  A solid solute has no vapor pressure.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;P_{solution} = P_{1} \times \chi_{1} + P_{2} \times \chi_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| If two '''volatile''' substances (both have vapor pressures) are in solution, Rauolt's Law is still used.  In this case, Rauolt's Law is essentially a linear combination of the vapor pressures of the substances.  Two liquids in solution both have vapor pressures, so this equation must be used.
|}

The second equation shows the relationship between the solvents.  If two liquids were mixed exactly half-and-half, the vapor pressure of the resulting solution would be exactly halfway between the vapor pressures of the two solvents.

Another relation in '''Henry's Law''', which shows the relationship between gas and pressure. It is given by C&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = k P&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; , where C is concentration and P is pressure. As the pressure goes up, the concentration of gas in solution must also increase. This is why soda cans release gas when they are opened - The decrease in pressure results in a decrease in concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the soda.

{{TextBox|1=
;Exercise for the reader
At 50 °C the vapor pressure of water is 11 kPa and the vapor pressure of ethanol is 30 kPa.  Determine the resulting vapor pressure if a solution contains 75% water and 25% ethanol (by moles, not mass).}}

===Boiling Point Elevation===
A liquid reaches its boiling point when its vapor pressure is equal to the atmosphere around it. Because the presence of solute lowers the vapor pressure, the boiling point is raised. The boiling point increase is given by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_{solution} = K_b \times m_{solute}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The reduced vapor pressure increases the boiling point of the liquid only if the solute itself is '''non-volatile''', meaning it doesn't have a tendency to evaporate. For every mole of non-volatile solute per kilogram of solvent, the boiling point increases by a constant amount, known as the '''molal boiling-point constant''' (&lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt;).  Because this is a colligative property, &lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt; is not affected by the kind of solute.

===Freezing Point Depression===
{{SideBox|This explains why roads are salted in the winter.}}
A liquid reaches its freezing temperature when its vapor pressure is equal to that of its solid form. Because the presence of the solute lowers the vapor pressure, the freezing point is lowered. The freezing point depression is given by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_{solution} = K_f \times m_{solute}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Again, this equation works only for non-volatile solutes.  The temperature of the freezing point decreases by a constant amount for every one mole of solute added per kilogram solvent.  This constant (&lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt;) is known as the '''molar freezing-point constant'''.

===Osmosis===
[[Image:Pressione osmotica.jpg|thumb|Osmosis results from the tendency for concentration to distribute itself evenly.]]
If you studied biology, you would know that '''osmosis''' is the movement of water through a membrane. If two solutions of different molarity are placed on opposite sides of a ''semipermiable membrane'', then water will travel through the membrane to the side with higher molarity. This happens because the water molecules are &quot;attached&quot; to the solvent molecules, so they cannot travel through the membrane.  As a result, the water on the side with lower molarity can more easily travel through the membrane than the water on the other side.

The pressure of this osmosis is given in the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\pi = MRT&lt;/math&gt;

Where pi is the pressure, M is molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

===Electrolytes and Colligative Properties===
When one mole of table salt is added to water, the colligative effects are ''double'' those that would have occurred if sugar were added instead. This is because the salt dissociates, forming twice as many particles as sugar would. This dissociation, called the '''Van't Hoff Factor''' describes how many particles that are dissociated into the solution and must be multiplied into the Boiling Point Elevation or Vapor Pressure Lowering equations.

{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;1~mol~\hbox{C}_6\hbox{H}_{12}\hbox{O}_{2(s)} \to 1~mol~\hbox{C}_6\hbox{H}_{12}\hbox{O}_{2(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
|Sugar is a covalent molecule.  No dissociation occurs when dissolved.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;1~mol~\hbox{NaCl}_{(s)} \to 1~mol~\hbox{Na}^+_{(aq)} + 1~mol~\hbox{Cl}^-_{(aq)} = 2~mol~particles&lt;/math&gt;
|Table salt is an ionic compound and a strong electrolyte.  Total dissociation occurs when dissolved, doubling the effects of colligative properties.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;1~mol~\hbox{MgBr}_{2(s)} \to 1~mol~\hbox{Mg}^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2~mol~\hbox{Br}^-_{(aq)} = 3~mol~particles&lt;/math&gt;
|Magnesium bromide is also ionic.  The colligative effects will be tripled.
|}

Though extremely useful for calculating the general Van't Hoff Factor, this system of calculation is slightly inaccurate when considering ions. This is because when ions are in solution, they may interact and clump together, lessing the effect of the Van't Hoff factor. In addition, more strongly charged ions may have a smaller effect. For example, CaO would be less effective as an electrolyte than NaCl.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preliminaries==
As a running example  consider the simple digital
circuit in figure 1 consisting of an or-gate (&lt;math&gt;or1&lt;/math&gt;)
and two inverters (&lt;math&gt;inv1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;inv2&lt;/math&gt;). The system description
is given by the following propositional formulae, where the
formulae are labeled in order to facilitate recognition of
corresponding parts in figure 1. The mnemonic used in the names
within the formulae is the following:
  
*The symbols &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; denote &quot;or&quot;, &quot;and&quot; and &quot;not&quot;   respectively.  
*&lt;math&gt;i1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i2&lt;/math&gt; are denoting inputs in the or-gate, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; an inverter and &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; denotes the output of a gate. 
*&lt;math&gt;high&lt;/math&gt; is a predicate which is intended to denote the fact, that the value   specified by its arguments is &quot;of high voltage&quot;, i.e. is on. 
*&lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; is a predicate which stands for &quot;is abnormal&quot;, i.e. the expression &lt;math&gt;\lnot(ab(inv1))&lt;/math&gt; can be read as &quot;the inverter one is not abnormal.&quot;


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
OR1: {\lnot(ab(or1)) \to high(or1, o) \leftrightarrow (high(or1, i1) \lor 
high(or1, i2))} 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;math&gt;                   
INV1: {\lnot(ab(inv1)) \to high(inv1, o) \leftrightarrow \lnot(high(inv1,
i))} 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;

INV2:{\lnot(ab(inv2)) \to high(inv2, o) \leftrightarrow \lnot(high(inv2,
i))} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
CONN1:{high(inv1, o) \leftrightarrow high(or1, i1)} 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
CONN2:{high(inv2, o) \leftrightarrow high(or1, i2)} 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

These formulae contain labels which express their intended meaning: OR1 stands
for a formula describing the function of the or-gate, IN1 ind IN2 are describing
the (identical) behavior of the two inverters: CONN1 and CONN2 are specifying
the way the inputs of the or-gate are connected with the outputs of the
inverters.  Note, that in this description the inputs and outputs of the system
are not yet defined.
We observe from the graphical description that both inputs of the circuit have low voltage and the
output also has low voltage, i.e. we could state this by the formulae 
&lt;math&gt; \lnot high(inv1, i),\; \lnot high(inv2, i),\;&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; \lnot high(or1, o)&lt;/math&gt;

This example demonstrates how a proposition like &lt;math&gt;high(inv1, o)&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to formally describe the behaviour of an electronic
circuit. Note that  &lt;math&gt;high(inv1, o)&lt;/math&gt; can be read intuitively as “the
output of inverter 1 is high”, and of course this sentence can be
further simplified by ignoring the phrase structure and by
understanding it as a simple string: “the_output_of_inverter_1_
is_high”. If we would proceed with the other propositions in the
same manner we would get formulae like this:




&lt;center&gt;''the_output_of_inverter_1_is_high'' &lt;math&gt; \leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''the_input_of_inverter_1_is_high''&lt;/center&gt;


This formula consists of two propositions which are connected via a
double  arrow. It is easy to see that formulae get rather
lengthy by this way and hence we can further abbreviate the
propositions by simpler strings like &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, which results
in a formula &lt;math&gt;P_1 \leftrightarrow P_2&lt;/math&gt;. It should be clear by the above
argumentation that this formula carries for our purposes the same
information as  &lt;math&gt; high(or1, i1) \leftrightarrow high(inv1, o)&lt;/math&gt;. The only
difference is that with the latter form some intuition is associated
with the reader -- for our  formal logical framework this is
irrelevant and we will focus on arbitrary propositions. 


In the following we will systematically avoid any intuition to real world
meaning in the design of our language. We will focus solely on the study of the
logical aspects, which can be expressed by our language and not to a certain
intended meaning. In other words, our previous introduction of the logical
formulae, which described the toy electronic circuit was too much oriented on a
interpretation, which was triggered by the picture. 



We will introduce the syntax of propositional logic by a very simple inductive
definition and then we specify a formal semantics by another single definition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Amazing! 

Who would have thought that my summers working at a quick print shop in [[w:Long_Beach,_California|Long Beach, California]] would come in handy? Okay, so perhaps I didn't learn everything, but I learned enough to be able to understand most of the honor requirements. Subsequently, I worked a stint at an ink manufacturer/supplier for a short while, so I got to see a lot of printing shops, presses, etc., and learn a lot of the 'then' technology.

Many thanks to my uncle(s) - if they read this they would know who they are.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|next=Buffer Systems|prev=Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases}}

== Ionization of Water ==
Water is a very weak electrolyte.  It will dissociate into hydroxide and hydronium ions, although only in a very small amount.  Because pure water is completely neutral, it always dissociates in equal amounts of both hydroxide and hydronium.  Once acidic or basic substances have been added to pure water, the concentration of the ions will change.  Regardless of which acid-base theory is used, acids and bases all have one important thing in common:
{{TextBox|1=
* All acids increase the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration of water.
* All bases increase the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration of water.}}

Furthermore, the concentration of hydrogen ions multiplied by the concentration of hydroxide ions is a constant.  This constant is known as the ''ionization constant of water'', or '''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  At room temperature it equals 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_w = [\hbox{H}^+] \times [\hbox{OH}^-] = 1.00 \times 10^{-14} mol^{2}/L^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In a neutral solution, the concentrations of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are both equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;.  Using the above equation, the concentration of one ion can be determined if the concentration of the other ion is known.  This equation further demonstrates the relationship between acids and bases: as the acidity (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) increases, the basicity (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) must decrease.

== The pH Scale ==

To measure the acidity or basicity of a substance, the pH scale is employed.
{{TextBox|1=
;The pH Scale
* A completely neutral substance has a pH of 7.
* Acids have a pH below 7
* Bases have a pH above 7.}}

pH usually ranges between 0 and 14, but it can be any value.  Battery acid, for example, has a negative pH because it is so acidic.

[[Image:PH_scale.png|thumb|300px|Various pH values.]]

=== Definition of pH ===

The pH scale is mathematically defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;pH = -\log{[\hbox{H}^+]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substances that release protons or increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (or hydronium ions) will lower the pH value.

=== pOH ===

There is also a less common scale, the pOH scale.  It is defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;pOH = -\log{[\hbox{OH}^-]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substances that absorb protons or increase the concentration of hydroxide ions will lower the pOH value.

The sum of pH and pOH is always 14 at room temperature:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;pH + pOH = 14&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Calculating pH===

A strong acid or strong base will completely dissociate in water, so the concentration of the acid/base is equal to the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  If you know the concentration of the acid or base, then you can simply plug that number into the pH or pOH formula.  The sum of pH and pOH will always equal 14 at room temperature, so you can interconvert these two values.

If you know the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and need to know the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (or vice versa), use the definition of K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; above.  The product of the two ion concentrations will always equal 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature.

==Titration==
''Titration'' is the controlled mixing of a solution with known concentration (the '''standard solution''') to another solution to determine its concentration.  One solution is acidic and the other is basic. An ''indicator'' is added to the mixture.  An indicator must be selected so that it changes color when equal amounts of acid and base have been added.  This is known as the '''equivalence point'''. This does not necessarily mean that the pH is 7.0. {{SideBox|Polyprotic acids have multiple equivalence points.}}

Once the equivalence point has been reached, the unknown concentration can be determined mathematically.

==Practice Questions==

1) 5.00g of NaOH are dissolved to make 1.00L of solution.
:a What is the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;?
:b What is the pH?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cars, light vans and trucks have similar engines so the oil level verification procedures are similar.

An engine will have an oil filler cap, usually on the very top of the engine and easily accessible from the hood or bonnet of the vehicle.

The oil dipstick is the main indicator of oil level. To check the level, ensure that the motor is &lt;b&gt;turned off&lt;/b&gt;, locate the dipstick and pull the stick out of the housing. This stick will be quite long because it needs to reach down to the bottom of the engine.

After the engine has been running, the dipstick will be covered in oil. You need to clean it with a clean rag or kitchen paper. Do not use a dirty rag because this may allow dirt to enter the engine and damage the motor.

The dipstick will have marks that indicate the lower, upper and possibly the ideal oil levels. Not enough oil will cause damage to the engine from overheating and excessive wear resulting in possible destruction of the engine. Too much oil can seriously damage the engine because oil is incompressible and a large volume of it can stop the motor components from rotating correctly.

If you need to add engine oil, remove the oil filler cap as shown.

When the cap has been removed, add enough oil to the motor to ensure that the level is between the two level indicator marks.

Add the oil about a pint or half a liter at a time and check the level by using the dip-stick.

Now I want to write Card class in Java. I don't want to use any advanced facilities, such as enums, so It will use strings and ints only. This class will be very short and simple. Short main will be provided. Afterwards, I'll give explanation about struts in C. Afterwards, I'll rewrite this class procedurally. History of arrival C++ from C will be discussed. Afterwards, I'll explain what is constructor. Afterwards what is class and methods vs function and procedural (function and procedural comparison will be added to [[Computer Programming/Procedural programming|Procedural programming]] book and in this book just mentioned). Pack class will be provided. I'll finished on theory about what is object as state &amp; behaviour. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 22:36, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

== Overloading and Overridding ==
{{:User:Alexsmail/Computer_programming/Object_oriented/Examples/OverLoading}}

How compiler choses &quot;wrong&quot; answer. Again about difference between overloading and overriding from complier point ot view (sameAs() and sameAs2() is completely different. Even though semantic is the same as in example. [[m:en:Double dipsatch|Double dipsatch]] (extra).  http://java-x.blogspot.com/2007/01/implementing-visitor-pattern-in-java.html Visitor patter (extra). &lt;!-- http://java.sun.com/developer/JDCTechTips/2005/tt0208.html#2 --&gt;
Double dispatch as &quot;beyond OO&quot;. Why conceptually compiler is right? (Remind that signature is part method definition). Brief description of Visitor Design Pattern.
 
== Title of this book ==

&quot;Object oriented&quot; by itself is very awkward in English.  You should really consider adding something on to its name, which is why I proposed 'Object oriented philosophy' in the first place.  Also, if you're going to revert somebody's changes, for example, my renaming of this book, or my removal of the book links, it would really be helpful if you made a small explanation why.  Thanks, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:30, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

: I think your are right. I have to right some explanation. I deleted word philosophy because, this book is not about a philosophy. More precisely, it is not only about philosophy. See, quote above. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 15:50, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

== Purpose of this book? ==
No offense, but this book doesn't seem to be of much utility.  What does it contribute or plan to contribute that http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_programming/Object_oriented_programming has not already covered?  And why don't you just modify that book if you aren't satisfied with its topical coverage?

== Functional Programming ==
I wanted to write my own book, but in completely different manner. I want to start from Functional Programming first. Can I begin my own book? I am new in wikibook... [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 15:55, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

:If you don't intent into duplicate content creating a new book with a new approach and directed to a different audience is possible, but it will split the number of possible contributors Try to see if no one objects first to the changes (I've checked the history log for contributors and it seems the only registered users contributing content are [[User:Augustus.saunders]] and [[User:BillKress]] try posting a note on their talk page or directly contact them by email if available), give it a week if no one objects you can reshape the book, try to find another place/context to any content you will be removing if possible. See [[Wikibooks:Be bold]], and thanks for asking first...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:53, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

::I have post note to their talk page. Why not to create another book on the same issue? I want to include Procedural Programming too as the basis. Every chapter will be look like: breaf description of the concept, real world example, sample example on Java, lengthly discussion with more sophisticated examples using C++ example to clarify two different implementation of the same concept (and highlight difference between concept and interface) and lengthly theoretical part. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 17:49, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

:::If you avoid a direct &quot;collision&quot; with a pre existing book, I don't think anyone will cause problems.  You should also take a look into [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]], this is a draft of a policy, in there you may get a feeling on how some of the community feel about this type (if not exactly the same) situation, or take a look on the multiple books on C++.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:17, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

:::: I read about forking. In this case, it is ok. Because I want to introduce different approach. So, we can co-exist. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]]
:::: I didn't get the answer from your contributors. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 11:01, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

Ok if no one is working on it then you may decide to reshape the book or start a new one, you have given every chance to anyone to object to it, it is now up to you.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:08, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}

== Electric Fields ==

The  '''electric field''' is a physical  field that is produced by electrically charged objects and which affects the behaviour of charged objects in the vicinity of the field. The electric field extends indefinitely throughout space and describes the electric interaction. 

Using Coulomb's Law, we can place point changes anywhere in relation to other charges, and determine the force on that point change. The electric field is a vector field where every single point in space is assigned a force vector, depending on the field's effect on the point charge. 

== Mathematical Representation ==

There are different mathematical ways of representing the electric field. The first one views the electric field as a three-dimensional vector field. This vector field has a value defined at every point of space and time and thus is often regarded as a function of the space and time coordinates. As such, it is often written as '''E'''''(x, y, z, t)''. If the field is '''electrostatic''', it is customary to leave the ''t'' term out of the description. Also, if we are using vector notation instead of Cartesian coordinates, we can write the field as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{E}(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

The electric field is defined as the limit of the force on a point charge ''q'', divided by the value of the point charge, as the charge goes to zero. Mathematically:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \lim_{q \to 0}\frac{\mathbf{F}_q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

We take the limit for a very important reason: if we add a charge to our system that is greater than 0, then the test point charge will affect the system and change it. We take the limit and reduce our test charge to zero so that it doesn't affect the rest of the system.

Using our charge density function &amp;rho;, we can calculate the force on a point charge ''q'' induced by a large object with uniform charge (such as a charged dielectric). We do this by extending our version of Coulomb's Law for ''n'' charges to a similar law with continuous charge distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}')(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')}{4 \pi \epsilon |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|^3} dV&lt;/math&gt;

At each point '''r''' of the field, there is an associated force given by Coulomb's Law.

== Electric Field (due to point charges) ==

Another way to consider the '''E''' field, instead of an abstract mathematical equation, is to consider a single point charge. We place the point charge into the field at various locations, and &quot;measure&quot; (using Coulomb's Law) the effect of the field on the point charge. We can use these measurements to draw lines of '''equipotential''', lines where the force on the point charge is equal.

We use an infinitely small point charge in making these measurements because the addition of a non-infinitessimal charge to a system would affect the field, and would place a force on the other particles in the field.

== Electrostatic Fields ==


If the electric field ('''E''') is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an electrostatic field. For instance, if the following relationship holds true, the field is electrostatic:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(x, y, z, t_1) = \mathbf{E}(x, y, z, t_0)&lt;/math&gt;

If this equation holds for all values of ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the field is electrostatic. If this equation does not hold true, then the field changes with time and it is called '''electrodynamic'''.

== Notation ==

We know that the electric field is a function of position (and possibly time), and so it is customary in most applications to drop the arguments all together. We will denote the electric field with a bold letter '''E''' throughout the rest of the book. This is a very standard notation for the electric field, and many books on the subject will refer to it simply as the '''E''' field, or &quot;E field&quot; for short. We will also follow this convention throughout the book.

== Electric Field Lines ==

To help us visualize the electric field, we use a graphical notation known as '''electric field lines'''. Electric field lines are lines that connect charges of opposite signs. As a matter of general convention, we say that lines come out of a positive charge, and go in to a negative charge, as such:

[[Image:Electric Field Lines.svg|center|600px]]

When drawing our field lines, we have a few general rules:

#Lines do not cross or overlap.
#A line must start at a positive charge, and end at a negative charge.
#Lines should curve evenly, and should not have any angles in them.

[[Image:Dipole.jpg|center|200px]]

If we draw out all our lines, we will start to see our electric field.

== Potential Function ==

For electrostatic fields, the curl is zero (as can be verified). This means that the force is conservative; there is potential energy function, such that the difference in potential energy of any two points is the amount of work needed to move charge from one point to another in any path.

Like electric fields, it would be desirable if we define the potential energy as a property of the field. This could no longer be the potential energy; clearly, the greater the charge, the more work needed to move it. However, we can define a ''potential'' that is the work per charge, that is an intrinsic property of the fields. The potential has units of joules per coulomb. This is used so commonly it is given its own name, the ''volt''.

We set &amp;phi;('''r''') to be the '''potential function''' for a position inside an electric field. We can define the potential function in terms of the E field:

{{eqn|Potential Function}}
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{\mathbf{r} \to \infty} \mathbf{E} \cdot dl&lt;/math&gt;

Or, if we differentiate both sides, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

Often, it will be easier for us to find the potential function then to find the E field directly.

Using the Gauss' Law, we can relate the potential function of a field to the charge density of a point in the field as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi = - \rho/\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

We will discuss the potential function in more detail when we talk about electrical energy.</text>

Traditionally schools in the United States have had two distinct tracks that they would guide students into, either &quot;academic&quot; or &quot;vocational&quot;.&lt;ref name=SCANS&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Applied academics is the bridge between these two tracks, and potentially can lead to the merger of the two.

Applied Academics is an approach to learning and teaching that focuses on how [[w:list of academic disciplines|academic subjects]] (communications, mathematics, science, and basic literacy) can apply to the real world.&lt;ref name=Hocking&gt;

The purpose of this textbook is to help teachers implement applied academic techniques into their curriculums.  This textbook will attempt to use its own advice as much as possible, and teach both the &quot;Why&quot; and the &quot;How&quot; of applied academics and have the reader apply what they learn.  Because of this, it is very important that the exercises given in the book are done, as they are far more important than the reading. As one teacher has pointed out &quot;If I could simply learn by reading, I would be a great golfer!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;

== Why Should You Teach Using Applied Academics? ==
Most teachers are either teaching a traditional academic subject or a vocational subject. The view of the applied academics philosophy is that we should all be teaching both.  But coming to this conclusion may require convincing for either type of teacher.

=== Why Should Vocational Classes Teach Applied Academics? ===

In today's global labor marketplace, workers who wish to earn higher wages must be able to understand more than just how to do a task, they must understand why they are doing the task, and how to improve the process of doing a task.&lt;ref name=SCANS&gt;
{{cite paper

&lt;/ref&gt;  

Further, for U.S. vocational classes, the reauthorization of the U.S. Carl Perkins Act has placed an increased emphasis on academics for career and technical education students.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web 
| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/reauth/perkins.html
| title=Reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act
| publisher=U.S. Department of Education
| accessdate=2007-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; And has begun to require academics to be placed within career and technical education classes.

There is a common saying: &quot;Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish he eats for life&quot;.  This shows the first step in someones intellectual progress, from simply being at the whim of the universe to knowing how to do something on their own.  But simply teaching a person how to do something is only the first level.  If the person can understand why things occur, such as why certain fish appear in certain locations, or why a boat floats, and learns how to apply this extra knowledge, that man in the saying not only could eat when the fishing was good, but could go out to sea and bring back fish to sell.  And when the fish start to become scarce, he might recognize that the population of fish may be dieing out due to overfishing.  Without having good mental models of what is occurring while fishing the man can not adapt, and is still at the whim of the universe.

This analogy gains a lot of traction in today's world.  Workers are not only competing in the local labor market, they are competing in the global labor market.  Those who will succeed are those who have a deeper understanding of not just how to do something, but why they are doing it, and most importantly how they can apply this knowledge creatively to new situations.

=== Why Should Traditional Academic Classes Teach Applied Academics? ===

Many academics and academic institutions believe that there is a distinction between learning to make a living and building the foundation for a life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url=http://aaweb.csus.edu/catalog/current/First%20100%20Pages/GE.asp
| title=CSUS Catalog - General Education
| publisher=California State University Sacramento
| accessdate=2007-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and some go so far as to regard vocational training as the training for slaves not free humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| last=Adler
| first=Mortimer J.
| url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlervoceducation.htm
| title=General Education vs. Vocational Education 
| accessdate=2007-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

These views seem to be underpinned by the assumption that a person can not have both a liberal education (traditional academics) and a vocational one.  The applied academic philosophy takes the view that vocational and traditional academics will enhance each other. And modern vocational education philosophies are being built around the notion that workers need advanced critical thinking skills to be competitive, which in fact can be very compatible with traditional academics.

This has been proven by research into the cognitive sciences which has shown that people learn best when they combine theory with application. Because although &quot;learning to know,&quot; &quot;learning to do,&quot; and their &quot;application&quot; are often separated, there is no effective learning or understanding of one kind without the other two. Most school learning is symbol-based. When symbolic activities become detached from meaningful context, school learning becomes a matter of learning rules and saying or writing things according to the rules. Outside school, actions are intimately connected with things and events. When people are engaged with things and situations that make sense, they do not forget what their calculations or what their reasonings are about. Their mental activities make sense in terms of immediate effects, and their actions are grounded in the logic of immediate situations.&lt;ref name=SCANS&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, a recent study about why students drop out of high school found that 81% of the dropouts said there should be more opportunities for real-world learning.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Why should art teachers use applied academics? ===

=== More Reasons to Teach with Applied Academics ===

Another way of viewing using applied academics, is that students get &quot;2 for the price of 1&quot;.  Since cognitive science has shown that people learn better by seeing both the theory and application, students can get the benefit of both, and because they are learning quicker and better, get them within approximatly the same period of time as each would be taught alone.  Hence it would take nearly half the time to teach two complimentary topics together, than it would be to teach them seperate.

In some instances, it might even be possible to teach 3 subjects at the same time and have each compliment the others.  For instance, a class could teach pre-algebra to help make business decisions and use a spreadsheet program to do the calculations.  Or a student could learn how to use a word processing program to create resumes and cover letters, and learn English at the same time.

=== Exercise ===
To be succesful at teaching with applied academics, it is important to have &quot;buy-in&quot; to the concept.  If you don't truly believe that it is important to incorporate the applied academic concept throughout your curriculum, then you will not be as succesful at doing it. 

Go to the Wikiversity Teaching with Applied Academics page for this exercise, and [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Teaching_with_Applied_Academics/Why write out your own thoughts about why you agree or disagree with the applied academics philosophy], or reply back to someone else.  Your intention with any replies should be constructive dialogue that helps all parties learn in the end, even if this dialogue is in the form of disagreements.

== How to Teach with Applied Academics ==

The underpinning of Applied Academics is to '''always''' link theory and practice.  Whether this be with traditional academics, or with other theories.

=== For Vocational &amp; Skills Based Classes  ===

For classes that teach a lot of application, such as vocational classes, the key to teaching with applied academics is to attempt to always be able to answer the question of &quot;Why does it work this way&quot; whenever students learn how to do an activity.  The key is that students should gain a larger model in their minds than just the task at hand, so that they can apply this mental model to new situations.

Some examples of teaching theory along with application:

* An American construction class learns that most load bearing walls have stud boards at every 16 inches.  They should learn that this is done so that the wall is up to code, that it is known that this width will generally support the roof, and that by following standards it makes it easier for everyone involved in the project.  These three pieces of theory all support the task and facts at hand, and can be applied to situations beyond the immediate one.  Further the class may learn that many constructions projects are moving to using studs every 24 inches because they use significantly less lumber, provide more opportunity for insulation, and allow for a faster build time. &lt;ref&gt;

  | accessdate = 5/21/2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A job skills class is learning about how much they can earn in a variety of career choices.  Beyond the current job market data, they should learn that the job market is governed by the economic principle of [[w:supply and demand|supply and demand]] in [[w:labor markets|labor markets]].  From this they should learn that those careers that are needed by the most number of businesses, but have the least number of qualified applicants will in general earn the most money.

* A computer class is learning about buying a computer, during the class they are told that they should buy what they need for their current needs and buy more later.  This should be supported with &quot;[[w:Moore's Law|Moore's Law]]&quot; that shows computers double in capability nearly every year and a half, but are offered for approximately the same price.

* A [[w:Business English|Business English]] class is learning that it is OK to have one space after a period (.) when typing a business letter when using a computer, but must have two spaces when using a typewriter.  The class should learn that computers can have variable-width typefaces, where each character can be a different width, and that typewriters only have monospaced typefaces which has the same width for any character.  Further the class should learn that it is most important to know about the audience who will be reading the document, and different companies have different standards, and those should be followed.&lt;ref&gt;

  | accessdate = 5/21/2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting actions with theory will require the teacher to often think deeper about a subject, so that they can help the students to think deeper.

One of the problems that can arrise is that there are often contradictory theories.  In this case, usually only one of the theories supports the action or fact that is being taught, and therefore that would be the theory that should be taught.  But if the theories are very controversial or contentious then teachers should explain the other theories and actions as well, even if they do not subscribe to them.

Using theory to support practice does not mean that the teacher delves into all the nuances of the theory, but should be able to explain it at a level that can directly relate to the practice being taught.

=== For Traditional Academic Classes ===

Traditional Academic classes can teach using applied academics by '''always''' being able to give an accurate example of where the subject being taught can apply to the real world.  Further, it is best if students are given the opportunity to participate in practicing where the subject is used in the real world.

For example:

* In mathematics, when students are taught exponents, they should learn how this can be applied to knowing how difficult it is to break a computer password.  For instance a password that consists of 8 lower case letters will have 26^8 or 208,827,064,576 possible [[w:combinations|combinations]].

* In English, students should see how good communication skills can assist them in a job, and how not having good English skills could be very detrimental to their careers.

* In history, students should see how events of the past may influence them today or how they are similar to events today.

When giving real life examples, it is best if the students can actually participate in them, and the more relevant they are to the students &quot;world&quot;, or future world, the better.  Examples that in and of themselves are theoretical or the students can not see the relevance in will do little good.

Further, many traditional academic courses should also explain the theory behind why things occur.  For instance, in English, it is important for students to always understand that they audience they are writing for affects the way that they write.  Also, they should understand that language is built upon consentual agreement about the rules of the language.

The [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Public_Pupil_Pizza_Project Public Pupil Pizza Project] is being created to help teach several traditional academic subjects, while simultaneously teaching the technology tools to help with these subjects, and showing how the subjects can apply to running a Pizza Restaurant.

===Exercises===
'''If you teach vocational or skills based courses, then:'''

1. Identify one theory that you think would be relevant to something you are teaching, and include it in your lesson.

2. Every time you teach a topic, ask yourself &quot;Why does it work this way?&quot;, and make sure you can answer that question.  Keep some quick notes (journal) of the topics and the theory that support them.  If you teach something and can not answer the question &quot;Why does it work this way?&quot;, do some research to find the answer.

'''If you teach traditional academic courses, then:'''

1. Identify one topic that you can teach the class how to apply to the real world, preferably in a hands on method.

2. Every time you teach a topic, ask yourself &quot;How does this apply to the real world?&quot;, and make sure you can accurately answer this question.  Keep some quick notes (journal) of the topics and the application to the real world.  If you teach something and can not answer the question &quot;How does this apply to the real world?&quot; do some research to find the answer.

You can [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Teaching_with_Applied_Academics/How document what you have done with these], by going to the journal section of the Wikiversity class, and writing what you taught and the piece of theory that supports what you taught.  By sharing this information on Wikiversity you will not only help yourself, you will also be benefiting other instructors.

== Where can Applied Academics be Used ==
One of the main points of applied academics is that it bridges subjects that are often believed to be disparate.  And in fact, applied academics shows that no piece of human knowledge is completely independent from other pieces of knowledge.

But given that most school systems currently have distinct disciplines that they teach, here is a look at some examples of how these traditional subjects can start to bridge with applied academics.

=== Career and Technical Education (Vocational Education) ===

=== Traditional Academics ===

=== The Arts ===

== Summary ==

The concept of Applied Academics is relatively simple to understand: '''Always''' connect theory with practical examples and practice, and vice versa.

But understanding the concept doesn't mean you have truly learned it.  It is only in implementation.  That is why the exercises are critical to do.  Don't be fooled that they only occupy a minor amount of space in this book, completing them should literally take your whole teaching career.

= I am learning English for travel =

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Revise and practice the present continuous (progressive) and learn vocabulary related to sports and hobbies.

==Dialogue==

''Richard is travelling to school with his son Michael.

(''[[Media:B2_unit2.ogg|listen]]'')
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!Richard
|Look at the children, Michael.  What are they doing?  
|-
!Michael
|They're playing football, Daddy.  The boys are kicking the ball and the girls are watching them play.
|-
!Richard
|And what about the older boys over there?  What are they doing?
|-
!Michael
|They're walking the dog and talking on their mobile phones.  Dad, can I have a mobile phone?
|-
!Richard
|Er, ask your mother, Michael.  And what is that old lady doing?
|-
!Michael
|She's waiting for a bus.
|-
!Richard
|And what are we doing?
|-
!Michael
|We're driving to school.
|}

== Grammar Focus - Present Continuous ==

[[Image:Malta pecheur 002.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Fishing is the most popular hobby in the UK]]

The ''Present Continuous'' is commonly used to talk about current present actions - things happening at this moment.

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Present Continuous||3}}
! Situation
! Form
! Example
|-
| + POSITIVE
| subject + be + verb + ing
| I am learning English at the moment
|-
| - NEGATIVE
| subject + be + not + verb + ing
| I'm not eating a banana because I'm learning English
|-
| ? QUESTION
| be + subject + verb + ing ?
| Are you eating a banana or learning English?
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* ''present continuous'' describes actions happening at the moment.  Use ''present simple'' to describe actions which are always true, e.g. NOT &lt;strike&gt;&quot;I am living in London&quot;&lt;/strike&gt; but &quot;I live in London.&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* ''present continuous'' can also be used to talk about arrangements in the future - &quot;I am meeting John at 10pm on Friday.&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* ''present continuous'' is only used with verbs which describe an action.  Use the ''present simple'' with verbs which describe states, e.g. NOT &lt;strike&gt;&quot;I am being happy&quot;&lt;/strike&gt; but &quot;I am happy&quot; because &quot;to be&quot; describes a state not an action.
|}

== Vocabulary - Sports &amp; Hobbies ==

When we want to talk about doing a hobby we often have a choice of verbs we can use.  This table shows the appropriate verb to use with different sports.  Basically we use '''play''' with ball sports, '''do''' with exercises and martial arts (Asian sports like judo and karate) and '''go''' with sports that end with ''ing'' like swimming.

{| {{English/B2/Table|Vocabulary|Sports Verbs||3}}
! Verb
! Sports
! Example
|-
| play
| football, tennis, rugby, hockey, baseball, badminton
| Let's play football
|-
| do
| exercise, yoga, aerobics, judo, karate
| Have you ever done yoga?
|-
| go
| skiing, bungee-jumping, parachuting, kayaking, fishing
| Shall we go skiing on the weekend?
|}

== Speaking about Hobbies ==

''Work with a partner, if you can, and ask/answer these questions. If you're on your own you should think about these questions and write your answers instead.''

* What sports and activities do you do regularly?  How often do you practice?
* What sport are you playing or watching next week?
* How do you feel when you are playing this sport?
* What sports do you hate playing or watching?
* Do you have a favourite football team?  Have you ever seen them play?

== Exercises ==

Try these questions to see if you can use present continuous and present simple correctly.  The answers can be found [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|here]].

''Complete the following sentences using the present simple or present continuous:''

# Look at that bad man!  He ________ (smoke) a cigarette on the bus.
# I _________ (study) for my exam at the moment.
# Do you have any children?  Yes, I __________ (have) two sons.
# What are you doing tomorrow evening?  I _________ (meet) my wife for dinner.
# Are you busy?  Yes, I ________ (take) a shower.

Chào Cumeo, Wikibooks là dự án để mọi người tham gia viết sách giáo khoa. Có thêm thông tin giải thích về Wikibooks tại [[w:vi:Wikibooks|Wikipedia tiếng Việt]]. Tôi cũng không hiểu rõ mục đích của Wikiversity, nhưng hình như nó cung cấp tài liệu giúp thầy giáo dạy về các chủ đề.

Tôi không phải là ''chủ'' của Wikibooks tiếng Việt, nhưng là một &quot;quản lý&quot; ở đấy. Quản lý chỉ có quyền đặc biệt là xóa trang và cấm những người phá hoại wiki. (Thực sự các wiki này không có chủ nào, nhưng Quỹ Wikimedia là tổ chức đang phục vụ Wikibooks từ các máy của họ.) Vài tháng nay có nhiều người đến Wikibooks tiếng Việt và dựng lên trang trước khi đọc [[:vi:Trợ giúp:Mục lục|các trang hướng dẫn]] ở đấy. Không may là tôi bận rộn ở trường vài tháng nay, nên không có đủ thì giờ xóa hay viết lại những trang không chính xác...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tourism is an important industry for Vietnam. Few countries have changed so much over such a short time as Vietnam. Only thirty-odd years after the savagery and slaughter of the American War, this resilient nation is buoyant with hope. It is a country on the move: access is now easier than ever, roads are being upgraded, hotels are springing up and Vietnam’s raucous entrepreneurial spirit is once again alive and well as the old-style Communist system gives way to a socialist market economy. As the number of tourists finding their way here soars, the word is out that this is a land not of bomb craters and army ordnance but of shimmering paddy fields and sugar-white beaches, full-tilt cities and venerable pagodas – often overwhelming in its sheer beauty. 

The speed with which Vietnam’s population has been able to put the bitter events of its recent past behind it, and focus its gaze so steadfastly on the future, often surprises visitors expecting to encounter shell-shocked resentment of the West. It wasn’t always like this, however. The reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975, ending twenty years of bloody civil war, was followed by a decade or so of hardline centralist economic rule from which only the shake-up of doi moi – Vietnam’s equivalent of perestroika  – beginning in 1986, could awaken the country. 

This signaled a renaissance for Vietnam, and today a high fever of commerce grips the nation: from the flashy new shopping malls and designer boutiques to the hustle and bustle of street markets and the booming cross-border trade with China. From a tourist’s point of view, this is a great time to visit – not only to soak up the intoxicating sense of vitality and optimism, but also the chance to witness a country in profound flux. Inevitably, that’s not the whole story. Doi moi is an economic policy, not a magic spell, and life, for much of the population, remains hard. Indeed, the move towards a market economy has predictably polarized the gap between rich and poor. Average monthly incomes for city-dwellers remain at around US$50, while in the poorest provinces workers may scrape by on as little as US$15 a month – a difference that amply illustrates the growing gulf between urban and rural Vietnam. There is an equally marked difference between north and south, a deep psychological divide that was around long before the American War, and is engrained in Vietnamese culture. Northerners are considered reticent, thrifty, law-abiding and lacking the dynamism and entrepreneurial know-how of their more worldly-wise southern compatriots. Not surprisingly, this is mirrored in the broader economy: the south is Vietnam’s growth engine, it boasts lower unemployment and higher average wages, and the increasingly glitzy Ho Chi Minh City looks like Bangkok and Singapore than Hanoi.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Catullus==

*Welcome aboard! Familiarise yourself with the demands of the project by going to: [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus]] and having a look at the &quot;mission statement&quot; and information.

*Also, here are some '''model examples''' of fine comprehensive work.

*[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/7|Poem 7]]
*[[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/51|Poem 51]]  

*If you look around the poems that are generally either half {{stage|50%|date}} or three quarters {{stage|75%|date}} then those will be the ones with needed vocab help.

*Alternatively you might like to add extra literary notes to &quot;Connotations of th Text&quot; section of each. If you know how to scan you can do that too. Click [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/94/94A|here]] for an example of that.

*Overall there are lots of poems to be done as well as some Appendices and the Preface.

*There is a standard template [[User:Alakazam38#Template|here]] on my user page. 

*You'll be put into the project news as standard, and I'll inform the others about you. Welcome to the project, and I hope you enjoy it! :D

== Scansion ==

*No, I don't think we need it for every poem. Most scansion is unremarkable, but that that is exceptionally slow or fast or elided or whatever it may be, can certainly be commented on, along with the effect it makes. As it is, Poem 94 is the only one with a scansion note so far. What may come up, is when we tackle the mammoth poems of 60-64 which are at least 100 lines long, so I'm sure there will be '''tonnes''' to scan there. For example, Poem 64 is '''405''' lines long!!

*If you look to the top of most poems that are marked as completed, such as 2, 3, 5, 7 etc, look above the text itself. That's the way I'd like the thing formatted, with a link to the Appendix. Thanks, I am quite proud of that Appendix. :D So yeah, if you went ahead and formatted that that would be great.

      <comment>/* Null Space */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Among the three important vector spaces associated with a matrix of order m x n is the '''Null Space'''. Null spaces apply to linear transformations.

==Range==
Let T be a linear transformation from an m-dimension vector space X to an n-dimensional vector space Y, and let x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; be a basis for X and let y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be a basis for Y, and consider its corresponding n × m matrix,

&lt;math&gt;M=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1m} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2m} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3m} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nm} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The image of X, T(X), is called the range of T. T(A) is obviously a subspace of Y.

Since any element x within X can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=1}^m c_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;T(x)=T(\sum_{i=1}^m c_i x_i)=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i T(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

implying that the range of T is the vector space spanned by the vectors T(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) which is indicated by the columns of the matrix. By a theorem proven earlier, the dimension of the vector space spanned by those vectors is equal to the maximum number of vectors that are linearly independent. Since the linear dependence of columns in the matrix is the same as the the linear dependence of the vectors T(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), the dimension is equal to the maximum number of columns that are linearly independent, which is equal to the rank. We have the following important conclusion:

The dimension of the range of a linear transformation is equal to the rank of its corresponding matrix.

==Null Space==

For example, consider the matrix:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 2 \\
  2 &amp; 4 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;. 

The null space of this matrix consists of the set:

:&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Null Space}(A) = \left\{\mathbf{\begin{pmatrix}
  -2r \\
  r  
\end{pmatrix}
} : r \in \mathbb{R} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

It may not be immediately obvious how we found this set but it can be readily checked that any element of this set indeed gives the zero vector on being multiplied by A. Clearly, 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  -2 \\
  1  
\end{pmatrix} \in \hbox{Null Space}(A)&lt;/math&gt; as 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 2 \\
  2 &amp; 4 
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
  -2 \\
  1  
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\
  0  
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Null Space as a vector space==

It is easy to show that the null space is in fact a vector space. If we identify a n x 1 column matrix with an element of the n dimensional Euclidean space then the null space becomes its subspace with the usual operations. The null space may also be treated as a subspace of the vector space of all n x 1 column matrices with matrix addition and scalar multiplication of a matrix as the two operations. 

To show that the null space is indeed a vector space it is sufficient to show that 

&lt;math&gt; x_1,x_2 \in \hbox{Null Space}(A)\Rightarrow x_1 + x_2\in \hbox{Null Space}(A)&lt;/math&gt; 

and

&lt;math&gt;x \in \hbox{Null Space}(A) \Rightarrow \alpha x \in \hbox{Null Space}(A)&lt;/math&gt;


These are true due to the distributive law of matrices. The details of the proof are left to the reader as an exercise.

==Properties==
===Null spaces of row equivalent matrices===

If A and B are two row equivalent matrices then they share the same null space. This fact, which is in fact a little theorem, can be proved as follows:

Suppose x is an element of the null space of A. Then Ax = 0. Also since A is row equivalent to B so &lt;math&gt;B = E_1E_2\cdots E_kA&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is an elementary matrix. (Recall that an elementary matrix is the matrix obtained from I from performing any elementary row operation.) Now, 

&lt;math&gt;Bx = E_1E_2\cdots E_kAx = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and so x is in the null space of B as well. So the null space of A is contained in that of B. Similarly the null space of B is contained in that of A. It is now clear that A and B have the same null space.

==Basis of Null Space==

As the null space of a matrix is a vector space, it is natural to wonder what its basis will be. Of course, since the null space is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, its basis can have at most n elements in it. The number of elements in the basis of the null space is important and is called as the '''nullity''' of A.
To find out the basis of the null space of A we follow the following steps:
# First convert the given matrix into [[Linear_Algebra/Row_Reduction_and_Echelon_Forms|row echelon form]] say U.
# Next circle the first non zero entries in each row.
# Call the variable &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; as a basic variable if the first column has a circled entry, and call it a free variable if the first column doesn't have a circled entry. Similarly call the variable &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; basic if the second column has a non zero entry and free otherwise. In this way name n variables &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2...,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; for any i, is a free variable, then let &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; be the solution obtained by solving the system Ux = 0 where all the free variables are exactly 0, except for &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; which is 1. If &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a free variable don't do anything.  
# Repeat the above step for all the free variables getting vectors &lt;math&gt;v_2,v_3&lt;/math&gt; etc in the process.
# The set &lt;math&gt;\{v_1,v_2...\}&lt;/math&gt; is the required basis.

The key point in the above algorithm was that A and U have the same null space. For a complete proof of why the algorithm works we refer the reader to the excellent text book given in the references by Hoffman and Kunze. 

Let us look at an example:

Suppose &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; -1 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The first step involves reducing A to its row echelon form U. 

Now &lt;math&gt;U = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 3 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; -1 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We encircle the first non zero entries in each row by brackets:

&lt;math&gt;U = \begin{pmatrix}
  (1) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 \\
  0 &amp; (1) &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 3 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; (1) &amp; 4 &amp; -1 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Clearly the free variables are &lt;math&gt;x_4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_5&lt;/math&gt; and the rest &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; are basic variables. Now we shall solve the system Ux = 0 with &lt;math&gt;x_4 = 1, x_5 = 0&lt;/math&gt; to get the vector &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we need to solve, 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 3 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; -1 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_1\\
  x_2\\
  x_3\\
  1\\
  0
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0\\
  0\\
  0\\
  0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces to the following system on matrix multiplication:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  x_1 + 2\\
  x_2 - 1\\
  x_3 + 4\\
  0
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0\\
  0\\
  0\\
  0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear from here that &lt;math&gt;x_1 = -2,\ x_2 = 1,\ x_3  = -4,\ x_4 = 1,\ x_5 = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the solution. 

Thus &lt;math&gt;v_1=(-2,\ 1,\ -4,\ 1,\ 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; is found to be &lt;math&gt;(-2,\ -3,\ 1,\ 0,\ 1)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The set &lt;math&gt;\{v_1,v_2\}&lt;/math&gt; is the basis of the null space and the nullity of the matrix A is 2. In fact this method gives us a way to describe the null space as well which would be:
&lt;math&gt;\{\alpha v_1 + \beta v_2 : \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; (Why?)

==Implications of nullity being zero==
The example given above gives no hint as to what happens when there are no free variables in the row echelon form of A. All we said that in step 4 of our algorithm was that if &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a free variable then ''don't do anything''. Following that logic, if no variable is free then we keep on doing nothing, leading to the conclusion that ''if no variable is free then the basis of the null space is an empty set i.e. &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;''. In that case we say that the nullity of the null space is 0. Note that the null space itself is not empty and contains precisely one element which is the zero vector. 

Now suppose that A is any matrix of order m x n with columns &lt;math&gt;c_1, c_2,...c_n&lt;/math&gt;. Each &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in the m-dimensional space. If the nullity of A is zero, then it follows that Ax=0 has only the zero vector as the solution. 

More precisely,

&lt;math&gt;Ax = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  c_1 &amp; c_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; c_n
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_1\\
  x_2\\
  \vdots\\
  x_n
\end{pmatrix}
=
x_1c_1 + x_2c_2 + \ldots + x_nc_n = 0
&lt;/math&gt; 

has the trivial solution only. This implies that nullity being zero makes it necessary for the columns of A to be linearly independent. By retracing our steps we can show that the converse is true as well.

Let us examine the special case of a square matrix, i.e. when m = n. Now if the nullity is zero then there is no free variable in the row reduced echelon form of the matrix A, which is say U. Hence each row contains a pivot, or a leading non zero entry. In that case U must be of the form,
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots\\ 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

or U must precisely be the identity matrix I.
Conversely, if A is row equivalent to I then Ax = 0 and Ix = 0 have the same solutions, due to their being equivalent. Since Ix = 0 has only the trivial solution x = 0, so does Ax = 0. It follows that the null space of A is merely {0} and so the nullity of A is 0. 

Thus nullity of A is 0 &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; A is row equivalent to I.

Now if A is row equivalent to I then &lt;math&gt;A = E_1E_2\cdots E_k&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is an elementary matrix. Since a product of invertible matrices is invertible and each &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is invertible so A is invertible. Conversely if A was invertible, and U its row reduced echelon form then &lt;math&gt;U=E_1\cdots E_kA&lt;/math&gt; which is clearly invertible (by virtue of being a product of invertible matrices). Now a matrix containing a zero row can never be invertible (why?), so U has pivots in each row. It follows that there are n pivots all equal to 1, with zeros above and below them and so U = I. Thus A is row equivalent to I. 

In summary, A is row equivalent to I &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; A is invertible.

We can collect the entire argument in this section, to state the:

'''Theorem''': For a square matrix of order n, the following are equivalent:
# A is invertible.
# Nullity of A is 0.
# A is row equivalent to the identity matrix.
# Columns of A are linearly independent.
# The system Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution.       
# A is a product of elemenatry matrices.

It will be a good exercise for the reader at this stage to try to rewrite the proof of the theorem in detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Syntax==

For the definition of the syntax we have to assume a set of atomic formulae,
which we take as the start of an inductive definition. With the help of three
junctors and brackets as punctuation symbols we inductively define more complex
formulae. 

==Definition 1 (Syntax of propositional Logic)==

Assume a 
  
*countable set of atomic formulae &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,3,\cdots &lt;/math&gt;, 
*the junctors &lt;math&gt;\land, \lor&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;, 
*the punctuation symbols &lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The set of propositional formulae is
defined by the following induction:
  
*Atomic formulae are formula. 
*If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are formulae, then &lt;math&gt;(F\land G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(F\lor G)&lt;/math&gt; are formulae. 
*If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula 
The different kinds of formulae are called 
conjunction, disjunction and 
negation. Note, that this is just a convention about wording, until now, we
did not give any semantics to these junctors, which would justify these
denotations.

This definition of the set of formulae also introduces a partial order in a very
natural way, if we consider the concept of a subformula.

==Definition 2 (Subformula)==
A ''subformula'' of a formula is a substring, which is
a formula.

Note that the relation &quot;is subformula&quot; is indeed a partial order.

The set of formulae together with the subformula-relation is a
well-founded relation.

In order to facilitate notations We introduce the following abbreviations:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; A, B, C &lt;/math&gt;      instead of    &lt;math&gt;P_1, P_2, P_3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (F_1 \to F_2)&lt;/math&gt;   instead of           &lt;math&gt; (\lnot F_1 \lor F_2)&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; (F_1 \leftrightarrow F_2)&lt;/math&gt; instead of    &lt;math&gt;((F_1 \land F_2) \lor (\lnot F_1   \land \lnot F_2))&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; \bigvee^n_{i=1} ~F_i   &lt;/math&gt; instead of    &lt;math&gt; (\cdots ((F_1 \lor F_2) \lor F_3)   \lor \cdots \lor F_n)&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;  \bigwedge^n_{i=1} ~F_i  &lt;/math&gt; instead of  &lt;math&gt;  (\cdots ((F_1 \land F_2) \land   F_3) \land \cdots
 \land F_n)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

These notations (except the first one) are simple abbreviations; whenever those
arrow-symbols or indexed junctors occur in a formulae, the corresponding
subformula can be substituted according to this definition.

Coming back to our previous example you can see that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\lnot(ab(or1)) \to high(or1, o) \leftrightarrow (high(or1, i1) \lor high(or1, i2))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
can be written as a formula according to the above definition by
introducing parenthesis:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
(\lnot(ab(or1)) \to( high(or1, o) \leftrightarrow (high(or1, i1) \lor  high(or1, i2))))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The parenthesis are introduced in order to avoid any ambiguity. In
order to increase readability, we will omit them whenever this is
possible.
If we additionally apply the above abbreviation rules we would result in the
following formula:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
(\lnot \lnot(ab(or1)) \lor &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
( high(or1, o) \land ( ( high(or1, i1) \lor  high(or1, i2)) \lor 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 
(\lnot high(or1, o) \lor \lnot   ( high(or1, i1) \lor  high(or1, i2)) ) )))

&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Introduction===
The world is changing and so must education.  The Center for Gifted Education at the College of William and Mary suggests five generalizations about change. In no particular order, they are as follows: change is linked to time, change may be positive or negative, change may be perceived as orderly or random, change is everywhere, and change may happen naturally or be caused by people (Center for Gifted Education, 1998).  Whatever the generalization, one thing is certain—change is inevitable. The first public schools were established in the United States in the 1600s. Since that time, the world has become a much different place than it was when the Puritans first landed on Plymouth Rock. If the United States is to retain its place as a world power, it is critical that education be responsive to the needs of an ever-changing world.  To thoughtfully consider and eventually implement any type of education reform, one must consider three critical change areas: teachers, school leadership, and the needs of students academically and social-emotionally.

===A Changing Demographic===
Although the changing role of women in society has done wonders for girl power, it has had a detrimental affect on public education. Up until the 1970s, women aspiring to be something other than a housewife had few career choices other than those available in education, as clerical support, or in the lower echelons of the healthcare industry. Because choices were so limited, the small percentage of women earning bachelors degrees most frequently entered the teaching profession. Equal rights for women ushered in an era of intellectual, financial, and personal freedom that the typical American woman had never before experienced.  The best and the brightest women were no longer enrolling in college to pursue fields of study traditionally dominated by women.  No longer limited to teacher education programs, the best and the brightest women began to explore other fields of study.  This led to a decline in female teacher quality as evidenced in a recent study by three University of Maryland economists. The results of their study conclude that “the likelihood that a highly talented female (one ranked among the top 10 percent of all high schoolers) will become a teacher fell from roughly 20 percent in 1964 to just over 11 percent in 2000” (Hoxby &amp; Leigh, 2005).

===The Trickle Up Affect===
Since most school administrators were teachers at some point, administrators come from a pool of educators that are no longer considered the best and the brightest. This has had a negative impact on schoolhouse administration, particularly as the role of principal has changed.  Traditionally, a principal has been seen as a manager of people rather than a manager of a community of learners.  The role of the principal typically entailed resolving personnel issues, addressing discipline concerns, and staying abreast of school finances. Today’s principal must be radically different. Today’s principal must be a team leader rather than a manager. This requires the principal to relinquish control over many aspects of the school day “so that staff members can assume ownership of broad education issues” (Murphy &amp; Schiller, 1992). The principal must establish the goal and vision; furthermore, he or she must move his or her team of highly competent and capable educators towards realization of that goal and vision.  As the team leader, the principal must be well versed in all facets of curriculum and instruction and capable of fostering “positive learning climates characterized by high expectations for all” (Murphy &amp; Schiller, 1992). This requires dynamic leadership. To prepare principals for this new role, training in “instructional leadership, planning for school improvement, administrative leadership, organizational ability, school environment and climate, communications, community and public relations, professional development and personal qualities” is necessary (Murphy &amp; Schiller, 1992).

===What Should Kids Learn and How and When Should They Learn It?===
Countless aspects of society have experienced significant change since the first public schools were established in the New England states in the 1600s. At that time and for a significant period thereafter, the United States was largely an agricultural society. Although the nation is now largely industrial and technological, the school day and school year are still based on the needs of an agricultural society. As society has moved from one that is agricultural in nature, the public school system has not.  Students are still expected to attend school for roughly seven hours each day for ten months out of the year. The school schedule is not typically crafted with the needs of the learner in mind.  In fact, today’s school schedule is often at odds with the schedules of many families. The family of yesteryear most often consisted of a father who worked outside of the home and a mother who stayed home and managed the household. This is no longer true. Today’s students may hail from households that consist of two parents who work outside of the home, or that are headed by a single parent who works outside the home, while other students are being raised by elderly grandparents.  For today’s families the daily school schedule can create childcare issues and may lead to frequent absenteeism.  Families may benefit from year round school schedules or adjusted school hours.  In addition, many teachers feel that, after the long summer break, too much time is spent reviewing material taught during the previous year. Given the consistent breaks during the year-round school system, less time would have to be spent on reviewing material. Students who have opportunities to learn throughout the day and the year learn best. These students are primarily kids from upper middle class homes whose parents have the resources to provide educational opportunities outside of school. As we work to close, or better yet, prevent, the achievement gap, lengthening the school day and/or the school year seems to make perfect sense. But year round schools are not a new idea and continue to face many obstacles, including cost and public acceptance and lack of supporting research. In addition, simply allocating more time is not enough. Effective use of time is critical and even within our current school calendar, precious little of the six and a half hour day is spent in engaged quality teaching and learning. If we really want to make a difference we must rethink how to use time more effectively to increase engaged learning time.

===Coping with Student Diversity===
Perhaps the greatest challenge faced by schools today is student diversity.  “Students come to class with different levels of competence and academic preparation, different degrees of motivation to succeed in school work, different social skills and levels of maturity” (The Keys to Effective Schools, 2007).  Along with these differences, there are differences in race and culture, socio-economic status, and belief systems. Despite all of these differences among students, for the most part, education continues to be geared toward white, middle class students.  Some would argue for the need for a national curriculum; however, because of student differences, it is imperative that any common, national curriculum be differentiated to address the varying needs of all learners. In addition to academic needs, school reform must include programs that address the diverse social and emotional needs of a diverse student body. These programs may include guidance and counseling, character education, medical services on premises, a full-time social worker as a member of the school staff, social services available on premises, and multicultural education.

===America’s Perfect Storm===
A lack of highly qualified teachers, the limited presence of dynamic leadership, and the level of diversity among learners’ academic and social-emotional needs have all been created in part by societal changes.  The Educational Testing Service (ETS) published a report entitled America’s Perfect Storm:  Three Forces Changing Our Nation’s Future (2007).  This report describes how the United States is currently in a “perfect storm” due to three forces: the differences in skill distributions, the changing economy, and the trends in demographics.  The authors suggest that if America does not change its present course, then it is doomed for disaster.  The first force is the gap in literacy and numeracy skills among both children and adults.  According to research, the achievement gap in reading and math between students of different socioeconomic groups and racial groups has not decreased in the last twenty years.  Internationally, the American students’ scores on standardized tests are average; however, the gap between the nation’s highest and lowest scoring students is among the highest in the world.  Not only does testing indicate where problems may lie, but national surveys reveal that many working adults do not have the literacy skills to compete in the workplace.  The second force is the country’s ever-changing economy.  Due to the shift over the last fifty years in the types of jobs that are prevalent, adults who do not possess a high level of education are not able to earn as much money or take part in company sponsored training programs that further their skills.  The third force stems from the demographic changes in the United States over the past twenty years.  There has been an increasing number of immigrants from Hispanic countries.  These immigrants traditionally do not have high levels of education; over half do not have a high school diploma, and eighty percent of those do not speak English very well.  This &quot;demographic shift&quot; has quickly emerged as a major impetus for education reform, because, compared with the white majority, the two largest minority groups (Hispanics and African Americans) are achieving at much lower levels in schools (National Task Force on Early Childhood Education for Hispanics, 2004).  This achievement gap will have profound effects on the future workforce and ability of this workforce to compete in the international world.  Each of these forces is individually important; however, when analyzing the impact that they have together is something that will continue to grow.  It is crucial that the necessary steps be taken through education reform so that America does not end up at the bottom.  It must be ensured that certain segments of the population be given the chance to succeed in life (Braun, ''et al.'' 2007).

===Reform in Education===
Based on this report, most would argue that the public education system is in need of an overhaul. There are so many reform programs available that it makes it quite difficult to decide which is most effective and most beneficial to students. Within twenty years, the United States went from President Ronald Reagan calling for the abolishment of the U.S. Department of Education in 1982 to President George W. Bush enacting the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) in 2001, a sweeping education reform law. At present with NCLB in place schools that do not make adequate yearly progress for five consecutive years have one of five reform options:  reopen the school as a public charter school, replace all or most of the school staff including the principal, enter into a contract with a private management company, turn the school over to state control, or engage in any other major restructuring of the school's governance arrangement (NCLB, 2002).  In between Reagan and Bush, the nation has seen Outcomes Based Education (OBE) evolve from President George H.W. Bush’s First National Summit on Education held in 1989 and later the passing of President Bill Clinton’s Goals 2000: The Educate America Act.  Each president and political party has had much to say about education, but has anyone really gotten it right? The problem is that every administration implements a program, but before it has been given enough time to see if it is effective a new administration comes in and implements a new plan.

Perhaps even more fundamentally, the many failed attempts at federal reform call into question whether education policy should in fact be initiated at the federal level.  Up until the middle of the twentieth century, public schools were largely governed at the local level—by principals, mayors, and town boards of education (Kirst, 2004).  However, beginning in the 1950s, when the federal government stepped in to implement racial integration in the schools, a tendency toward centralization of school governance has become increasingly prevalent.  This trend accelerated in the early 1980s with the publication of such studies of A Nation at Risk, which claimed that the United States was falling behind in its ability to compete in a global economy as a result of its poor performance in educating its citizenry.  Operating on the premise that local districts could not be trusted to initiate and implement effective policy, federal and state governments arrogated more and more power to themselves.  Currently the state makes most of the important decisions concerning school governance, and the federal government indirectly wields considerable power as a result of tying the substantial educational funding it provides to specific conditions that must be met at the state and local levels (Kirst, 2004).

	The most pressing problem created by this tendency toward increased centralization is the disenfranchisement of local education officials and educators.  When most education policy is decreed from on high by a governor with perhaps little professional educational experience and the members of his appointed state board of education, who remain largely invisible to the local school community, then local officials, school administrators, and the teachers themselves are forced to carry out policies that they have had almost no role in creating.  And yet if these policies prove ineffective, the public inevitably blames the local officials, administrators, and teachers, since this group is most visible and most likely to be &quot;held accountable&quot; (Epstein, 2004).  The teachers, in particular, who have the most intimate knowledge of the student population and, in all likelihood, the best information for improving student performance, have virtually no power to create or administer education policy (Kirst, 2004).  On the other hand, those who have only limited contact with the student population and very little professional expertise in education—presidents, governors, and other bureaucrats—have considerable power to make and implement major education policy reforms.  It is thus not surprising that none of these reforms has succeeded in substantially improving the quality of education in America.

If these ineffective methods of reform are allowed to continue and if the local education authorities and educators continue to be denied the power to make and implement sounder policy, our education system is doomed to failure. This being said, the question arises as to how we are ever going to get the United States out of this “perfect storm”?  Recently, two reform proposals have been written that do look at reforming the complete educational system.

===American Schools:  The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge===
American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge (2000), written by Drs. Dwight Allen and Bill H. Cosby, Jr., is an interesting proposal that suggests that the United States government treat education as a matter of national security and fund it accordingly.  According to the Office of Management and Budget for the White House, in the year 2005 the Department of Education was allocated $56 billion dollars, while the Department of Defense was allocated $401.7 billion dollars.  The future, and ultimate safety, of America depends on education.  If the nation does not have well-educated citizens who can intellectually compete with the minds of others across the globe, then national security is in jeopardy.  Allen and Cosby propose that the government spend $100 billion dollars a year on education, and in their book they provide a breakdown of exactly how that money will be spent.  They also propose that schools provide year round schooling, looping, and suggest that schools remain open from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. to allow students to follow a schedule that best fits them, as well as providing a place for students to go to do homework and study.  Another problem is that American citizens do not have the necessary skills required in the workplace.  The SCANS report was released in 1989 and outlines the basic skills that are needed for all students whether they plan to go on to college or a vocational school.  Not only does the report outline the basic reading, writing, math, listening, and speaking skills, but it also outlines thinking skills and personal qualities that all students need (US Department of Labor).  Allen and Cosby believe that the SCANS report is a good beginning to a curriculum, but more needs to be added to it.  

Another major focus in education reform involves the teachers.  In order for teachers to maintain a high enough standard to be effective, teacher education must be redefined to include a minimum of one to two years of a clinical practice, attract the best and the brightest students to the field of education and keep quality teachers in the field by paying teachers on the level of doctors, lawyers, and engineers, and change the way teachers interact and communicate with each other so that they are able to observe each other and provide and receive high amounts of feedback.  Finally, Allen and Cosby propose that a national experimental school administration be established.  There would be 100 NESA school districts established throughout the country.  The schools in these districts would be state of the art and would participate in the new education research practices.  These schools can be used as comparison schools and would be required to be in place for a minimum of twenty years (Allen &amp; Cosby, 2000).

===Tough Choices or Tough Times===
An alternative reform proposal, Tough Choices or Tough Times (2007) written by the New Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, begins its report by refuting the basic premise of the American Schools reform proposal.  It believes that spending more money on the overall system currently in place will not work, and even proposes that money can be saved by being more efficient with current resources.  What must happen is that the whole system must change.  The commission has devised a set of ten recommendations that it believes will change the system and allow the future generation to be successful in the workforce.  Some of these recommendations include altering the programmatic schema of high school to include board examinations after tenth grade to prove that students have mastered a set of skills before they continue on to either community college, vocational school, or more advanced high school studies like Advanced Placement courses and International Baccalaureate programs.  Upon completion, any student hoping to attend a university must take and pass another set of tests. Another recommendation is to recruit the next generation of teachers from the top percentile of high school graduates, as well as exponentially raise the salary for teachers based on their effectiveness, particular school they teach in, and their specific subject.  Another component is to develop standards and assessments for the needs of tomorrow as well as implement universal preschool programs to even the playing field for young children before entering kindergarten.  Finally, they propose to give the additional support to the students who need it the most as well as provide adults with the literacy skills that they need for the workforce.  Finally, government funded job training programs are proposed to help unskilled individuals gain the skills that they will need to obtain a job (Tough Choices or Tough Times, 2007).

===Conclusion===
While both of these reform proposals contain both pros and cons, the question arises as to whether a reform proposal such as these could ever be implemented in the United States.  Critics of the American Schools express that it is much too complex to ever “catch fire politically” (e-publishing reviews, 2000).  The political issues are precisely the problem.  Olson (2006) comments that the reform proposal is positive because it draws attention to the issues and creates a national conversation about them; however, unless an education reform proposal is snatched up by a major political contender such as the future president of the United States, there is no hope for either.  Education is in the political ball field getting tossed back and forth from party to party.  Is there hope for education when a new reform is implemented every four to eight years?

==Essay Questions==
===Question #1===
====If you could effectively reform one component of the American schools, what would it be and why?====
===Response #1===
I would implement universal preschools to all three and four year olds in the United States.  These programs would be run by the school districts and be taught by certified teachers who were trained in early childhood education.  They would also include a parental education component to try and teach parents the importance of not only education but of staying involved in their children’s education.  I would choose preschool as my one reform initiative because research has shown the importance of preschool not only for the academic development of young children but also for the social and emotional component.  A huge problem in the United States is the achievement gap in students of different socioeconomic groups.  Sadly, this achievement gap can be seen from the first day of kindergarten and it continues throughout high school.  This is due to numerous reasons.  Research shows that parents in low socioeconomic groups are not as involved in their children’s academics, and they do not understand what their children should already know by the time they enter kindergarten.  Sadly, a child who enters kindergarten significantly behind his or her peers has little chance of ever catching up.  This is why it is so important that all children, regardless of income, be given the opportunity to attend preschool.  Studies such as the High/Scope Perry Preschool project, the Chicago Child-Parent Center program, and the Abecedarian project all show the importance of preschool throughout the lifetime.  They report that for every one dollar invested in the program, the public saved more than seven dollars (considering the cost of special education, retention in grade, and incarceration).  These two studies followed the children that attended the preschools through adulthood and found that those that attended preschool had higher graduation rates, reduced crime rates, fewer special education placements, and were retained less in school (Bracey, 2003).  While preschool is not the complete answer to an educational reform, it is a start and it is well worth the investment.

===Response #2===
I would implement a redesigned education delivery system based on the suggestions in ''Tough Choices or Tough Times'' (2007) because it is an excellent way to tap into student interests and to prepare students for fields of study and careers that are best suited for them.  The revamped delivery system includes a series of “gateway tests” that must be passed before enrolling in secondary or postsecondary programs that are of interest to the students (''Tough Choices or Tough Times'', 2007).  Also included are a variety of programs that can meet the academic needs of students regardless of their postsecondary aspirations.  In most public school systems, there is great emphasis on preparing students to enroll in traditional four-year colleges. Some students have no interest in completing a four-year degree and would much rather enter the workforce upon graduation. The delivery system discussed in ''Tough Choices or Tough Times'' would prepare students for the traditional four-year college, as well as for trade school or a technical college.  By gearing K-12 education toward student interests, the curriculum can become more focused allowing students to pursue studies that interest them and that they feel will best prepare them for their careers of choice. It is suggested that by implementing such a delivery system, the dropout rate will decrease and enrollment in postsecondary programs will increase (''Tough Choices or Tough Times'', 2007).

===Question #2===
====What do you consider to be one of the greatest obstacles to national school reform?====

===Response #1===
The absence of teacher involvement in the development of reform proposals is one of the greatest obstacles to national school reform. As part of my preparation to contribute to this chapter of our class textbook, I read several books, reports, and articles about reform proposals and the crisis of public education in America. In none of my reading did I come across any reference to teacher input in the design of reform proposals. Although many school reform proposals included giving teachers increased responsibility in the decision making process at the school level, I could find no evidence that any of the suggested reforms came at the urgings of teachers.  I think of all the information I reviewed, the one thing that bothered me more than any other is the fact that when President George H.W. Bush held the First National Summit on Education in 1989, none of the participants were teachers. All present were governors.  In his address to the governors assembled, President Bush said, “I hope that you will join me to define national goals in education for the first time. From this day forward let us be an America of tougher standards, of higher goals, and a land of bigger dreams. And our goals--(applause)--our goals must be national, not federal. And that's why I welcome the initiatives of the National Governors Association.” After reading that statement, I wondered why teachers weren’t included since that was the first time national goals for education were being established. To “welcome the initiatives of the National Governors Association” without regard to the input of teachers or any group representative of teachers, such as the National Education Association, was a slap in the face to educators everywhere. The president, governors, school administrators, or anyone with an opinion can say whatever they want about what needs to happen in education, but without teachers having a voice in the discussion, I am afraid that whatever evolves from the discussion, good or bad, will not stand a chance for effective implementation within the classroom. Without teacher input into these sweeping reform programs, teacher buy in would be a challenge making implementation very difficult. Teachers are repeatedly treated as anything but professionals and lack of teacher involvement in the development of a national school reform program is just another example of that. As a teacher, how can you expect me to readily embrace a reform program that might drastically change how I perform my duties without my input? Especially if the reform program is the brainchild of a roomful of politicians.  I doubt that the president of the United States would ever hold a summit on the national crisis of obesity without a single doctor present. Teachers are long overdue the opportunity for a serious discussion on a national level about what is wrong with the American school system and what can be done to fix it.

===Response #2===
I believe that a lack of sufficient monetary funds in education is a huge obstacle to national school reform.  To thoroughly reform the education system in the United States, I believe that we do need to invest more money into education.  Our education system is not working; this can be seen in our flat test scores and our huge achievement gaps.  In order to fix our education system, we need to completely change the way our schools operate.  This requires money, and lots of it.  I completely agree with American Schools:  The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge (2000).  We do need to treat education as a matter of national security and fund it accordingly.  Teachers need to be compensated like other professionals, they need to have further training in the field before they are left in their own classroom, and they need to have more time to plan.  All students need to have the opportunity to attend preschool, they all need access to computers and the internet, and they need to be able to stay at school later in the day to accommodate their needs and the needs of their families.  Finally, we need to start implementing research based practices into our classrooms on a daily basis.  To do this, teachers need to be trained in the new practices and given the resources to effectively implement them.  All of this requires money:  money that the current school system does not have.  We cannot implement a national school reform, or a local school reform for that matter, without the appropriate funds.  The way the system works now, not all schools receive the same amount of money.  It is often the case that the schools that need to most funds receive the least.  How can we expect our lowest students to close the achievement gap if they do not even have appropriate school supplies, let alone access to technology or high quality teachers.  Unless the government takes a long look at the realities of our education system and realizes that money is a huge issue, there is no way that a national school reform could be implemented.

This is a wonderful dish that is easy to make. It is a good accompaniment for [[Cookbook:Roast Lamb|roast lamb]] or [[Cookbook:Roast Chicken|roast chicken]], but is as delicious served on its own with a green salad.

==Ingredients==

* 5 medium sized waxy [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled or not peeled
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:chop|chop]]ped ([[Cookbook:Smoking|smoked]] garlic is good for this dish if you can get it)
* ½ pint of reduced fat [[Cookbook:Crème Fraiche|crème fraîche]], [[Cookbook:Cream|single cream]], or a mixture of semi-skimmed milk and crème fraîche
* 3 oz of good quality [[Cookbook:Gruyère Cheese|Gruyère]], Challerhocker, or [[Cookbook:Emmental Cheese|Emmentaler cheese]], freshly [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]]. Swiss Appenzeller cheese is also a good choice. Please don't use cheddar!
* A [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (such as sea salt) and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* (optional) Fried pancetta, bacon cubes, or other cooked pork

==Procedure==

# Preheat the oven to {{#invoke:Temperature|f|400}}
# Slice the potatoes very thinly (about ⅛&quot; thick), if possible using a [[Cookbook:Mandoline|mandoline]] to achieve evenness, and place them in some fresh water.
# Swish around the potatoes in the water to get rid of the starch, because that excess starch can make the dish a little unpleasant.
# Pour away the water and place the potatoes on a wooden surface. Then pat dry with a paper towel or kitchen towel, which is important because otherwise the remaining water will mix with the cream, causing curdling problems.
# Return the sliced potatoes to a bowl and add the cream and chopped garlic. Add a generous pinch of salt and some pepper.
# You can also add a few fresh herbs ([[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] is particularly good) but this is up to you. But I suggest don't go over the top.
# Peel the zest of the lemon and add it to the mixture.
# Mix well, so the cream gives a good coating to all the potatoes.  
#:''Some people tend to layer the potatoes in the heat proof bowl first and then pour the cream over. This, to my mind is a little unreliable as the cream does not diffuse through all the layers - and in any event the potatoes in a higgledy-piggledy pile in the bowl is much more attractive!''
# Pile the potatoes into a buttered, oven-proof dish. The size is if course difficult to gauge but the potatoes should not be layered more than about 4 thick.
# Grate a generous amount of cheese, and spread over the mixture.
# Pop it all into the oven and leave until the top layer of cheese and potatoes are brown and the cream is bubbling and running down the side of the dish. This will take about 40 minutes.
# For a final flourish before serving, grate a goodly amount of fresh [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] over the cheese.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Introduction:  Education and the Culture of Isolation===
For well over a century, a culture of isolation has prevailed within the American education system.  Teachers have jealously guarded the turf of their specialties, subjects have been insulated from one another by compartmentalization, and students have been encouraged to compete as individuals in the high-stakes game called school.  The same forces that have created isolation within the system have created a monolithic barrier between it and the nonacademic, or &quot;real,&quot; world and have even resulted in a disjunction within the psyches of both teachers and students—an alienation from self.  As early as 1983, noted educator and speaker Parker Palmer wrote, of the deep pain he detected in many teachers, &quot;I call the pain that permeates education 'the pain of disconnection.' Everywhere I go, I meet faculty who feel disconnected from their colleagues, from their students, and from their own hearts&quot; (p. x).  This situation has prevailed both within the public school and the higher education system.  Thus Jane Tompkins, professor of English at Duke University, wrote in 1996, &quot;Higher education, in order to produce the knowledge and skills students need to enter certain lucrative professions, cuts students off from both their inner selves and the world around them&quot; (p. 223).

Of course, this culture has reflected the values of the larger society—those of monetary profit, individualism, and competition.  However, the larger world is changing, and if it is to thrive, the education system must change as well.  &quot;In today's increasingly individualized and specialized world it is unlikely that any one person possesses enough knowledge and ability for every circumstance&quot; (Dettmer, Thurston, &amp; Dyck, 2002). The forces of globalism, multiculturalism, and multimodalism demand a spirit of cooperation and collaboration that must inevitably demolish the traditional barriers of this culture of isolation—both within and without. Even in the early twentieth century, some thinkers recognized that effective education depends on the freedom of learners to interact with each other and with the world around them (Dewey, 1916).  As Palmer says, real learning does not occur until &quot;teacher and learners and subjects&quot; are brought into &quot;vital community with one another&quot; (p. xix).

===How Isolation Impacts Learners===
The American Dream is founded on the belief that if someone works hard enough he or she can become anything, essentially a self-made success. Each generation believed that their children would be better off than them. As Friedman shares, “We are growing concerned that we are not going to retire as well-off as our parents did, and our kids probably are not going to be as well-off as we were” (Friedman, 301). He theorizes that the world is flattening. With the advances of technology, the world has become a global economy. Americans are not isolated from the rest of the world. If we are to remain competitive, we have to educate our children to be participants in this shrinking world. They must know how collaborate and look at situations from multiple perspectives. These skills can only be developed through cooperative learning and collaborative experiences with other students and teachers. To expect a student to sit at a desk all day and not talk is actually doing them a disservice. We need to help students learn and refine the social skills required to be a contributing member of the global economy.
Constructivists contend that it is through social discourse that true learning occurs (Jonassen, 12). No longer should we teach students to “do it by themselves”. In fact, we should encourage them to work with others. Collaboration is emerging as a preferred method to competition in many educational settings. As Jonassen purports, “groups collaboratively build more meaningful knowledge than individuals alone” (Jonassen, 34) It is essential that education no longer isolate learners from other students, teachers, the community or the world.

Another issue of isolation that affects learners is that of teaching content in isolation. Father Guido Sarducci’s Five Minute University video on YouTube ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO8x8eoU3L4]) demonstrates quite well how little is retained when the information is “given to students” so that they can “give it back” on a test. As this video demonstrates, learning that occurs in isolation results in short term memory gains. Father Guido Sarducci’s belief is that five years after college graduation graduates remember very little of the material they “learned”. It is very easy to laugh at this video because we can all identify with its truths. Research on authentic learning confirms that when students learn in context, such as real-world problem-based learning, long term memory gains are made. Despite the research to support this type of instruction, evidence of its use is not always evident.

High stakes testing adds to the isolation problems encountered by learners today. Subjects are taught according to pacing guides that specify what content is to be covered when. This isolation of discrete units in time robs students of opportunities to thread content and connect big ideas. In a moment of discovery the student might question a topic covered previously (or not yet covered) and the teacher may find he or she is unable to seize the teachable moments because of the isolating effects of the scope and sequence he or she is mandated to follow.
High stakes testing also has teachers and students focused on isolating the correct answer. It could be argued that the idea that there is only one right answer to any given problem is an educational step backwards. Duffy and Cunnigham’s text refers to Rorty’s pragmatism (1991) which states “knowledge is not a matter of getting it right but rather of acquiring habits of action for coping with reality” (Duffy &amp; Cunningham, 1). If students are to be educated with a global view of the world then they need to have the flexibility of thinking to look for multiple solutions to a problem.

===Isolation of teachers vs collaboration===
Teaching is very much a social profession, yet teacher isolation remains a common characteristic in school districts across the nation and is a major cause of teacher attrition (Heider 2005). Twenty-five percent of teachers leave the profession by the end of their first year (Norton, 1999), and as many as forty-six percent of new teachers nationwide leave within the first five years of service (Ingersoll, 2002).  New teachers enter a work environment where staff members have been working together for long periods of time and friendships and social groups are already formed. In addition they are often given the most difficult students, the fewest and worst resources and supplies, and left, for the most part, on their own. In response to this problem, many state education associations have developed formal mentoring programs. The most traditional mentoring programs involve the pairing of new teachers with veteran teachers. These mentoring programs, however, tend to have many flaws. New teachers and mentor teachers alike are often so overburdened with demands on their time and their individual work loads that they have little time to meet.  In addition, many of the mentors lack training on how to mentor new teachers.  Oftentimes the mentors are chosen simply because they have been in the building for the longest period of time.  In many cases the general school organization exacerbates the problem. Mentor teachers are sometimes working on a different hall, or wing of the building, in a different grade level, or different subject. The new teacher and his/her mentor may not be given any common planning time. Compounding the problem, new teachers are often uncomfortable or embarrassed to ask for help. They end up feeling frustrated and unsupported.  The insolated environment of the classroom prevails. 

A focus on using technology solely as an information downloading resource reflects the &quot;isolated teacher&quot; phenomenon. In contrast, focusing on technology's use for collaboration and communication opens the door to creating a new model in which teachers are able to work in a community of educators. Traditionally, Internet technology provided e-mail and list serves, where participants can voice concerns, complaints, and questions and possibly get responses. With Web 2.0 technology, teachers have a world of support at their fingertips. Teachers can network with others around the globe extending the traditional boundaries of teacher collaboration. Web 2.0 technology provides more immediate feedback and greater feelings of support as teachers actively share knowledge and experiences. Web 2.0 technology tends to reduce teacher isolation and increases teacher communication, collaboration, and interdependency (Johnson, ''et al.'' 1999). New on-line communities, in the form of Blogs and Wikis exist solely for the voices of teachers. “What is true of Web 2.0 will be true of Teacher 2.0 – dynamic, outward facing, community building, radically democratic, initiatory, active and interventionist; how the Web is changing is how teaching will change (Doyle, 2007).&quot;

===Subject Isolation: The Fragmented Curriculum===

Though the topic of departmentalization vs. self contained classrooms has been debated since the start of the twentieth century little research exists on the issue. How content should be structured remains a hot topic. Education reform spanning 60 years, however has shown that “students achieve more and are better able to apply their knowledge when they experience collaboratively planned and taught interdisciplinary curricula (Hensen 2006).” Yet, over the years, departmentalization has increased and has filtered down even to the lower grades of elementary schools.

In self contained classrooms the teacher is responsible for all subject areas of the curriculum throughout the school day. In a departmentalized setting, however, teachers specialize in one, or possibly two, subject areas and students move from one teacher to another throughout the school day.  Proponents of self contained classrooms state that departmentalization isolates subject areas, guaranteeing less integration, and denies students the opportunity to make connections. Unfortunately, even in self contained classrooms, boundaries often exist around the subject areas. Traditional schooling treats the subjects as separate entities taught in isolation from each other. “Consider, for example, the inability of the present curriculum to deal with even very ordinary cause-effect sequences: automobiles generate exhaust emissions, which contribute to the greenhouse effect, which alters climates, which determine rainfall and growing seasons, affecting water tables and sea levels, and thus the economy and political stability, which essentially determines who lives and who dies. To study that sequence in formal schooling, it is necessary to combine, at the very least, math, geology, chemistry, physics, meteorology, agriculture, economics, and political science (Brady 1996).” State academic standards generally lack cross disciplinary design coherence. Academic standards, however, are not a curriculum, but rather should serve as a framework around which the curriculum is designed. Additionally, teachers tend to teach the standards with a focus on objectives, checking them off one by one as they are taught. Students learn a little bit of everything, but rarely have opportunities to see how it all connects or to understand the interrelatedness of things as they exist in the real world (Brady 1996).  Problem-solving strategies with real-world connections would help to bring meaning to subject matter and greatly enhance student learning.  Many schools are adopting the UBD design of curriculum writing which involves making connections between broad concepts that overlap all disciplines.  UBD uses instructional strategies based on current brain research, the teacher focuses on the learner's understanding of content and the ability to use the information rather than on the memorization of isolated bits of information (Understanding by Design, 2007). 

In order to reduce isolation of subject matter and truly integrate curriculum, teachers must make a mental shift from a topical, fact-based curriculum to a concept based curriculum. Topics and facts are related to specific things, people, places, and/or situations. Concepts transfer. For example; ‘the life cycle stages of the butterfly’ and ‘key historical figures in the development of a state’ are topical, factual knowledge. The conceptual, transferable understandings are ‘life cycles ensure the continuation of a species’ and ‘leaders and events can shape the social, economic, and political directions of a nation.’ What are often referred to as the “Big Ideas of Science” are concepts that cut across disciplines, such as change, order, and systems. We as educators are often unaware of the discipline based concepts and therefore cannot structure learning around conceptual relationships that are truly interdisciplinary. To bring coherence to our fragmented curriculum teachers must understand the difference between a topic and a concept, a fact and a generalization. Teachers must then work collaboratively to create relevant curricula that connect students to their world. We must treat our students as “thinkers, seekers of understanding, and creators of knowledge (Erickson, 2007).”This can easily be accomplished with problem-based learning.  Problem-based learning is a total approach to education; a learner-centered educational method.  It is based on real-world problems. Students use real-life situations to bring meaning to the curriculum and no longer feel that the course work is &quot;isolated&quot; to the classroom.  Students come up with problems that interest them and through research become the experts about the topic.  By studying the curriculum through project based learning, students become aware of not only the importance of all of the subjects that they study, but they are able to see the relationships between all of the subjects in a meaningful way.  Examples of [http://www.edutopia.org/more-fun-barrel-worms project based learning] can be seen all over the United States everywhere from kindergarten through college.  Research has shown that project based learning increases student engagement, decreases absenteeism, improves test scores, and increases cooperative learning.

===Isolation of information vs Web 2.0 (information sharing)===
Before the emergence of the internet, students researching a topic relied mainly on encyclopedias and other texts to locate information. The encyclopedia entries presented a general overview of the topic. If no information was found in the encyclopedia, the learner had to search through card catalogs in hopes of finding a book with information on the topic. After finding a match in the card catalog, it was possible to learn that the book was not available at that time. This process was very time consuming and not always productive. 
The technologies of today allow individuals to access information from around the world in a matter of seconds. The collaborative nature of Web 2.0 enables learners to easily connect not only to the needed information but to other students, teachers and experts in a given field. This “mediated immersion allows students to actively construct knowledge” and is being used to enrich the educational opportunities provided to students in even the most rural regions (Dede, 7). Students in remote areas are able to engage in Socratic discussions with others through the use of tools such as Wikipedia. With internet access a learner has almost limitless educational possibilities.
Traditional education (by the book learning) often centered on instruction that presented one point of view, generally that of the authors or historians. Students rarely had the opportunity to experience different vantage points on a topic such as the Civil War. Technology now enables a topic to be approached from multiple perspectives. Students can search the Library of Congress ([http://www.loc.gov/index.html]) and examine primary documents from different members of society during the time of the Civil War. They can also listen to speeches and musicians from that period. The use of these tools and the ensuing discussions greatly enhance the development of critical thinking skills in students. The LEAP (Liberal Education and America’s Promise) program’s report names seven principles necessary for education reform. These principals were derived from a national poll of business leaders. Five of the principles relevant to this topic are:[[http://www.aacu.org/advocacy/leap/principles_in_practice.cfm]]

1. Immerse all students in analysis, discovery, problem solving and communication.&lt;br&gt;
2. Engage the big issues.&lt;br&gt;
3. Connect knowledge with choices and action to prepare students for citizenship.&lt;br&gt;
4. Emphasize personal and social responsibility in every field of study.&lt;br&gt;
5. Establish a culture of shared purpose and continuous improvement.&lt;br&gt; 

As Friedman states in The World Is Flat, “In the future, how we educate our children may prove to be more important than how much we educate them” (Friedman, 302). Many educators and parents suggest that it is not important to teach today’s youth discreet pieces of information (facts) that could easily be retrieved on the internet. They further caution that information given to students today may be obsolete in the not too distant future. Instead, it is argued that our schools need to teach students to use technology as “Mindtools” to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate the tremendous amount of information available and to construct new knowledge and make informed decisions (Jonassen, 10). The author of A Whole New Mind: Moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age summarizes this fundamental shift and what it means to future workers by stating:
“If you want to be sure that you are what I call an untouchable (i.e., someone 
who remains marketable) you need to constantly focus on developing your 
right-brain skills---such as forging relationships rather than executing trans-
actions, tackling novel challenges instead of solving routine problems, and
synthesizing the big picture rather than analyzing a single component.”
(Pink, 2005) Web 2.0 has great potential to support educators as they work to address the LEAP program's findings and prepare students for an interdependent, global economy.

*Essay Question(s): What steps can teachers take to counter issues of isolation in their schools and classrooms? What are the benefits of minimizing isolating factors in education today?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semantics==
==Definition 3 (Semantics of propositional logic)==

For the semantics of our formal language of propositions we do not refer to a
specific intended interpretation. Moreover we only are interested in truth
values. We assume an initial assignment of truth values to atomic formulae and
based on this, we define the truth value of more complex formulae.
The set of truth values is the set &lt;math&gt;\{true,
false\}&lt;/math&gt;.
An assignment for a set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of atomic formulae is a function 

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} | D &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \to \{true, false\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the set of formulae containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, i.e &lt;math&gt;E \supseteq D&lt;/math&gt; and
exactly those  formulae which can be  constructed from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; according
to the definition of the syntax. Then
the extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_E | E \to \{true, false\}&lt;/math&gt;, is given as:

  
*&lt;math&gt;A \in D&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}_E(A) = \mathcal{A}(A)&lt;/math&gt; 

*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}_E((F\land G)) = 
\begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text {if } \mathcal{A}_E(F) = true  \text { and }  \mathcal{A}_E(G) = true \\
\;\;\,false &amp; otherwise  
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;  
                         
*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}_E((F\lor G)) = 
\begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text {if } \mathcal{A}_E(F) = true \text{ or }  \mathcal{A}_E(G) = true \\
\;\;\,false &amp; otherwise
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_E(\lnot F) = 
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,true &amp; \text {if } \mathcal{A}_E(F) = false \\
\;\;\,false &amp; otherwise
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

In the following we will omit the index &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to indicate the
extension of an assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Note that this is the right place to name formulae of type &lt;math&gt;(F \land
G)&lt;/math&gt; as conjunctions, formulae of type &lt;math&gt;(F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt; as disjunctions and formulae of
type &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt; as negations.

The following is an example evaluation by means of the definition of
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;:
Assume as given &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(A) = true,\text { }   \mathcal{A}(B) = true&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(C) =
false&lt;/math&gt;, then 

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}( \lnot((A\land B) \lor C))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:::::::&lt;math&gt;\text{  } =
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,true &amp;  \text { if }   \mathcal{A}((((A \land B)) \lor C)) = false \\
\;\;\,false &amp; \; otherwise
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:::::::&lt;math&gt;\text{ }=  
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,false  &amp; \text { if }   \mathcal{A}((((A \land B)) \lor C)) = true \\
\;\;\,true &amp; \; otherwise 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:::::::&lt;math&gt;
\text{ }= 
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,false  &amp; \text { if }   \mathcal{A}((((A \land B))))= true \text{ or } A(C) = true \\
\;\;\,true &amp; \; otherwise 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:::::::&lt;math&gt; 
\text{ }=  
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,false  &amp; \text{ if }   \mathcal{A}((((A \land B)))) = true \\ 
\;\;\,true &amp; \; otherwise 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
:::::::&lt;math&gt;
\text{ }=  
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,false  &amp; \text{ if }   \mathcal{A}(A) = true  \text { and }  \mathcal{A}(B)= true\\
\;\;\,true &amp; \; otherwise 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:::::::&lt;math&gt;\text{ }= false&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 4 ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an assignment and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a formula. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called
assignment for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for every subformula of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an assignment for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(F) = true&lt;/math&gt; we call &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;
a model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and we write &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} \models F&lt;/math&gt; 
If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an assignment for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(F) = false&lt;/math&gt;,  we write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}
\nvDash F&lt;/math&gt;.

A formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called satisfiable, iff there is 
a model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called unsatisfiable. &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; is called valid (or a
tautology) iff every assignment for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a
model. We write &lt;math&gt;\models F&lt;/math&gt;  rsp. &lt;math&gt;\nvDash F&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem 1==
A formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is valid, iff &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

'''Proof:'''
&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology 

iff every assignment for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;

iff every assignment for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (which is of course, also an
assignment for &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt;) is not a model for &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt;

iff &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt; has no model

iff &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

==Definition 5 (Consequence)==

A formula &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a consequence of the formulae  &lt;math&gt;F_1,\cdots, F_k&lt;/math&gt;, if for every assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;F_1,\cdots, F_k&lt;/math&gt; holds: if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;  is a model for &lt;math&gt;F_1, \cdots, F_k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. We write &lt;math&gt;\{F_1, \cdots, F_k\} \models G&lt;/math&gt;.

The following theorem is a simple consequence from definitions:

==Theorem 2==

&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a  consequence of the formulae &lt;math&gt;F_1,\cdots, F_k&lt;/math&gt;, 

iff  &lt;math&gt; ((\bigwedge^k_{i=1} ~F_i) \to G)&lt;/math&gt; is a tautologie

iff  &lt;math&gt; ((\bigwedge^k_{i=1} ~F_i) \land ~\lnot G)&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

Obviously the validity of a formula depends only of the assignments
for its atomic subformulae: If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}'&lt;/math&gt;  are assignments for
&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and if they yield the same value for every occurring atomic
subformulae,  then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(F) = \mathcal{A}'(F)&lt;/math&gt; holds. As a consequence we can
state, that it suffices for a test of the validity of a formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;
to check the infinitely many assignments of its atomic subformulae.
Such a check can be depicted easily in a tableau of the following
form, where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an arbritrary formula, containing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; distinct
atomic formulae &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_i&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;}
!
! &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_1&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_n&lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_1&lt;/math&gt;
| false
| &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
|false
|false
| &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_1 (F)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_2&lt;/math&gt;
|false
|&lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
|false
|true
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_2 (F)&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_2n&lt;/math&gt;
|true
|&lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
|true
|true
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_n (F)&lt;/math&gt;
|}


&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When applying this procedure it might me helpful to introduce
intermediate results for subformulae, as done in the following
example.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
!&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt; 
!&lt;math&gt;A \text{ }\to \text { } B&lt;/math&gt;
!(&lt;math&gt;\lnot \text{ } A \text{ }\to \text{ } ( A \text{ }\to \text{ } B&lt;/math&gt; ))
|-
|false
|false
|true
|true
|true
|-
|false
|true
|true
|true
|true
|-
|true
|false
|false
|false
|true
|-
|true
|true
|false
|true
|true
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that we just have depicted an algorithm to check the validity of
a formula. Assume the Formula contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; atomic subformulae, then
our just constructed tableaux contain &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; lines. To estimate the
costs for such an exponential algorithm, assume that the computation
of one line takes 1 micro-second. Is &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; contains only 100 atomic
subformulae the computation of the tableau would take &lt;math&gt;2^{100}&lt;/math&gt;
micro-seconds.

==Truth Tables==

The problem whether a propositional formula is satisfiable is called
SAT and the corresponding tautology problem  is called TAUT.

SAT is an NP-complete problem, and hence it is not known whether SAT
is tractable or not. Whether TAUT is in NP is still an open problem.
For TAUT we know, that it is in NP iff NP is closed under
complementation. SAT and TAUT, both, play a prominent role in the
study of complexity theory, in particular with respect to the question
whether &lt;math&gt;P = NP&lt;/math&gt;.

==Problem==
====Problem 1 (Propositional)====

Compute  truth tables for the following formulae. Decide for each  formula
whether it is valid (a tautology), satisfiable or unsatisfiable.
  
#&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \land (B \to C)&lt;/math&gt;         
#&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \leftrightarrow (\lnot A \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot A \lor \lnot(\lnot B \lor A)) \lor A&lt;/math&gt;         
#&lt;math&gt;(A \to (B \land C)) \leftrightarrow ((A \to B) \land (A\to C))&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;(A \lor (B \land A)) \land ((C \lor \lnot C) \to \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt;         
#&lt;math&gt;((C \lor B) \land (C \lor \lnot B))\land\lnot C &lt;/math&gt;    
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot(\lnot A \lor \lnot(\lnot B \lor \lnot A)) &lt;/math&gt;         
#&lt;math&gt;(A \to (B \to A))&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;(A \lor (B \land A)) \land ((C \lor \lnot C) \to \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt;         
#&lt;math&gt;((A \lor \lnot B) \lor ((\lnot A \land \lnot C) \land B))\leftrightarrow ((A \lor \lnot C) \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot(A \land \lnot(B \land \lnot C))&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 2 (Propositional)====
&quot;What is the secret of your long life?&quot; a 100-year old man was asked. He answered: &quot;I apply the following diet rules very strictly:
If I drink no wine at dinner then I have always fish. Whenever I take fish and wine for dinner, it is without garlic. If I have garlic or wine I avoid fish&quot;
  
#Formalize these rules with the help of propositional logic. 
#Try to simplify the advice of the 100-year old man.

====Problem 3 (Propositional)====
Define the following functions recursively by induction over the construction of
propositional formulae:
  
#&lt;math&gt;\alpha(F)&lt;/math&gt;: Set of atomic formula in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;             
#&lt;math&gt;\beta(F)&lt;/math&gt;: Number of the binary junctors &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; 
Note: For &lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;(\lnot(A \lor B) \lor C)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;((\lnot A \lor B) \land C) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha(F) = \{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta(F) = 5&lt;/math&gt; holds.&lt;/center&gt;

====Problem 4 (Propositional)====
Given the formulae &lt;math&gt;F_n &lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{\cdot} \vee \cdots \stackrel{\cdot} \vee A_n&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;A_1,\dots,A_n&lt;/math&gt; are
atomic formulae (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{\cdot} \vee&lt;/math&gt; denotes exclusive or.  Prove for all
&lt;math&gt;n \in \N&lt;/math&gt;: A suitable assignment  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models F_n&lt;/math&gt;) iff &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}(A_i)=1&lt;/math&gt; halds for an odd number of
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_i&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;).

====Problem 5 (Propositional)====

In the following we investigate formulae, in which only atoms &lt;math&gt;A_1,\dots,A_n&lt;/math&gt; occur.
                      
#How many of such formulae with different truth tables exist at most?             
#Is there for every truth table a formula? If yes, please indicate a construction!

====Problem 6 (Propositional)====
If the colonel was not in the room during the murder then
he cannot know the weapon of the murderer. The butler
lies or he knows the murderer. If Lady Barntree is the
murderer then the colonel was in the room during the murder
or the butler lies. The butler knows the murderer or the
colonel was not in the room during the murder.
The policeman concludes that Lady Barntree is the murderer.
Give propositional variables for every statement
of the argumentation. Write the argumentation as a set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;
of propositional formulae of the prerequisites and the
conclusion as a propositional formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

====Problem 7 (Propositional)====
Formalize the following expressions and then simplify the corresponding formulae and the verbal propositions.
  
#It is not true that his mother is English and his father French. 
#It is not true that he is studying physics but not mathematics. 
#It is not true that the wages are going down and the prices are going up. 
#It is not true that it is not cold or rainy.

====Problem 8 (Propositional)====
The professor proposes to make a new conception for the lunch in the University restaurant:
  
#There must be bread with every lunch if there is no dessert. 
#If bread and dessert are served then is be no soup. 
#If soup is served then there is no bread. 
Help the management to fulfill the wishes of the professor. For this
  
#formalize the three propositions (as implications, disjunctions/conjunctions) and combine them into one logical formula. 
#Give a truth table for this logical formula. Is there a model for the formula? 
#Give a colloquial verbalization for the assignment.

{{NOTE|note=
}}

In [[computer science]], '''object composition''' (not to be confused with [[Function composition (computer science)|function composition]]) is a way and practice to combine simple [[object (computer science)|object]]s or [[data type]]s into more complex ones. Compositions are a critical building block of many basic data structures, including the [[tagged union]], the [[linked list]], and the [[binary tree]], as well as the [[object (computer science)|object]] used in object-oriented programming.

Composition is contrasted with [[subtyping]], which is the process of adding detail to a general data type to create a more specific data type. In composition, the composite type &quot;[[has-a|has an]]&quot; object of a simpler type, while in subtyping, the subtype &quot;[[is-a|is an]]&quot; instance of its parent type. Composition does not form a subtype but a new type.

A real-world example of composition may be seen in an automobile: the objects ''[[wheel]]'', ''[[steering wheel]]'', ''seat'', ''[[gearbox]]'' and ''[[engine]]'' may have no functionality by themselves, but if you ''compose'' them, they may form an ''[[automobile]]'' object, which has a higher function, greater than the sum of its parts in a trite sense.

Composited (composed) objects are called  '''fields''', '''items''', '''members''' or '''attributes''', and the resulting composition a '''structure''', '''[[storage record]]''', '''tuple''', '''user-defined type (UDT)''', or '''[[composite type]]'''. The terms usually vary across languages. Fields are given a unique name so that each one can be distinguished from the others. Sometimes an issue of ownership arises: when a composition is destroyed, should objects belonging to it be destroyed as well? If not, the case is sometimes called '''aggregation'''. For more, see the aggregation section below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computing in Turkish isn't as hard as you think. However, be aware that there are some major differences.

==Keyboard layout==
Unfortunately, for you, Turkish has two different keyboard layouts: Turkish-F and Turkish-Q, both of which are quite commonly used.
===Turkish-F===
[[Image:KB_Turkey_f.svg|center|600px]]
This keyboard layout was designed in 1955 by İhsan Yener. During its design, the Turkish Language Academy (TDK) investigated letter frequencies in Turkish and used this statistical basis to design the Turkish-F keyboard. It provides a balanced distribution of typing effort between the hands - 49% for the left hand and 51% for the right.

===Turkish-Q===
[[Image:KB_Turkey.svg|center|600px]]

==Using these keyboard layouts on your computer==
You don't have to buy a new keyboard to be able to use these layouts. Below you can find instructions on how to implement these layouts on Windows or MacOSX. Unfortunately information on how to do this on various Linux distros is currently unavailable.

=== On Windows ===
# Click on ''Start''
# When the ''Start'' menu opens up, click on ''Control Panel''
#* If you are on ''Category View'', click on ''Date, Time, Language and Regional Options'', then ''Regional and Language Options''.
#* If you are on ''Classic View'', click on ''Regional and Language Options''.
# Click on the ''Languages'' tab.
# Under ''Text services and input languages'', click on the ''Details'' button.
# Click on the ''Add'' button.
# Here you will find a large list of languages. Choose ''Turkish'', then tick the ''Keyboard layout/IME'' tick box. This will enable you to choose from a wide range of different keyboard layouts. Choose either ''Turkish-F'' or ''Turkish-Q'' (preferably the latter). Then click ''OK''.
# The Turkish language (and your chosen keyboard layout) has just been added to your list of ''Installed services''. To easily switch between English and Turkish, click on the ''Language bar...'' button under ''Preferences''.
# When that window pops up, tick the following tick boxes:
#* ''Show the Language bar on the desktop.''
#* ''Show text labels on the Language bar.''
# Then click ''OK''.
# Now that you've done that, click on the ''OK'' or ''Apply'' buttons to have your changes saved.

=== On MacOSX ===
# Open &quot;System Preferences&quot; (The picture of the gears)
# On the first line (&quot;Personal&quot;) click on &quot;International&quot;
# In the first tab: &quot;Languages&quot; click &quot;Edit List,&quot; and add Turkish to your list.
# In the third tab, &quot;Input Menu&quot; there are three options for Turkish.  &quot;Turkish&quot; is the F-keyboard, &quot;Turkish QWERTY&quot; and &quot;Turkish QWERTY (PC)&quot; are variants on the Q keyboard.
# Close the Window.
# That's all.  Once you've done this, a little flag ([[Image:Flag_of_the_United States.svg|20px]] for English, [[Image:Flag_of_Turkey.svg|20px]] for Turkish) will appear in the top bar of your screen.  You can use this to change languages, and as a shortcut to your International settings.

      <comment>/* Thought I was going to correct a couple typos. . . */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I've added a large block about axioms. It should be revised to fit format of the book (I am speaking about math and physics instead of whole science). This block was compiled from [[m:en:History_of_geometry|History_of_geometry]] and my own knowledge. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 19:32, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

The part about axioms is absolute rubbish and needs to be revised.

Calling something which is in itself logical absolutes &quot;based on faith&quot; pretty much speaks for itself. That whoever did the edit is evidently unable to grasp basic logic and hence refers to it as &quot;faith&quot; shows that this person is either 1. trolling, 2. uneducated on the matter, or 3. deliberately trying to dilute the repute of scientific method.

Simpy as that.

Unless someone beats me to it, these portions will be edited.

== Thought I was going to correct a couple typos. . . ==

But it's really more of a mess than I wanted to deal with.  Needs a rewrite.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''History of probability and information'''

One of the ancient expressions of information dealing with '''entropy''' also deals with information and the number of possible outcomes in an event. 

The sound eye, ''udjat'', shows it clearly. 

Here, for example, is where we find the history of African ways of combining a system of two to a system of three compartments applied by the artists in the graphic form. 

Mathematical language shows these expressions, the destroyed parts of Horus' eye,  to result into six compartments that exhibit exponential equations of the form: &lt;math&gt;y = ac^{bx}&lt;/math&gt; often expressed in the West with the Greek symbol : &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = ac^{bx}&lt;/math&gt;. Where c is the base and in this case equals two. This same c in other useful mathematical expressions can be 10 or more often e as an approximated value of '''natural logarithm'''. Why logarithm? 

The ancient forms of ''udjat'' parts are &lt;math&gt;2^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;, ... Because the base number 2 is raised to powers, -1, -2, -3... that we call exponents, the exponents are the logarithms and they are here with their bases resulting into fractions of unitary numerators equal to respective probabilities for equally likely outcomes of events exemplified by ''udjat'' parts.

The hieroglyph P for this particular event was initially represented in the arts by 64 squares in a grid reference where each small square had a unit area. Of all the 64 squares, the debate was centered on one. The information therefore varied inversely with probability as it does in the modern communications theory. Words such as magic and beauty were employed to mean infinity and outcome. The area study was called ''seked'' S from which the integral symbol S in calculus would be derived. 

Weighted information of each class since the ancient time has always involved multiplying log (1/P) by probability P''i'' of the class.

==Introduction==

Under some operating systems, Celestia can create a snapshot, recording its current on-screen display to a file. It also may be able to create a video recording of a sequence of frames while it is running. Other operating systems may require an external screengrab or video recording program.

==Linux==
{{sectstub}}

==MacOS X==
{{sectstub}}
Screenshots and movie recording have not yet been implemented in the osX version of Celestia.
For the moment you can use system commands to take some screenshots.

Some people have reported that CaptureMe does a reasonable job of recording movies.

==Windows==
{{sectstub}}

When running the Windows version of Celestia, both snapshots and movies can be created:

*Select the menu option &quot;File/Capture Image...&quot; or type the &lt;F10&gt; key to record a snapshot of the current view.

*Select the menu option &quot;File/Capture Movie...&quot; or type &lt;Shift-F10&gt; to start recording a movie of what Celestia is showing.

*Type &lt;F11&gt; to actually start (or pause) the recording.

*Type &lt;F12&gt; to finish recording.

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Recognize and use the different conditionals in English and revise means of transport.

== Speaking Questions ==

''Talk about these questions with a partner.  Try to expand your answers and give reasons rather than short answers.''

* Where did you go on your last holiday?  How did you travel?  Whom did you go with?
* What is your perfect holiday destination?
* Do you prefer beach holidays, city breaks, resorts or adventure holidays?
* Do you pack a lot of things or just the basics like clothes and money?
* What are the 5 most important tourist places in your country?

== Grammar Focus - 1st, 2nd and 3rd conditionals ==

Conditional sentences are used to talk about possible situations and the result of those situations.

[[Image:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt]]

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Future Forms||4}}
! Conditional
! Form
! Usage
! Example
|-
| 1st conditional
| if + present simple, will + infinitive
| used to talk about possible situations
| If it's sunny tomorrow, I'll go to the seaside.
|-
| 2nd conditional
| if + past simple, would + infinitive
| used to talk about hypothetical situations
| If I became rich, I would buy an expensive villa in France.
|-
| 3rd conditional
| if + past perfect, would + have + past participle
| used to talk about hypothetical situations in the past
| If I hadn't gone to Egypt, I wouldn't have seen the pyramids
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* Conditionals are usually expressed with the ''if clause'' first and the ''future clause'' second but the order isn't important.  Both of these sentences are equally correct: ''If it rains, I will stay home'' and ''I will stay home if it rains''.  Note that we don't use a comma if the ''if clause'' is used second.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* Never use a future tense twice in a conditional sentence (like is often done in other languages).  This is not correct: &lt;strike&gt;''If it will rain, I will stay home''&lt;/strike&gt;
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* Conditionals are frequently contracted and this can make understanding difficult for non-native speakers.  We often contract ''will'' as ''I'll, you'll, etc.''.  We often contract ''would'' as ''I'd, you'd, etc.''.
|}

== Vocabulary - Travel &amp; Transport ==

Look at the table below.  Do you know the correct definitions for these types of transport?  Click on the 'show' button on the right for the correct answers.

{{English/B2/Travel}}

== Speaking with conditional sentences ==

''Work with a partner, if you can, and ask/answer these questions. If you're on your own you should think about these questions and write your answers instead.''

* ''How long would it have taken you to get here if you had walked?''
* ''How will you get to work if it rains tomorrow?''
* ''If you were going to take a vacation, where would you go?''
* ''If you could drive any car you wanted, what would it be?''
* ''If you had gone to London on holiday last year, what would you have done?''

== Exercises ==
Try these questions to see if you can use 1st, 2nd and 3rd conditionals correctly.  The answers can be found [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|here]].

''Complete the following sentences using the correct conditional form:''

# If I were very rich, I _______________ in 5 star hotels (stay).
# If I _______________ (go out) on Saturday, I will drink red wine.
# If I hadn't woken up this morning, I _______________ about conditionals (not learn).
# If I could choose any wife, I _______________ Shakira (choose).
# I _______________ (buy) a new DVD if I get paid this week.

8/4/08 - The video remix of Wikibooks Animal Alphabet book now has over 10,000 views on [http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=54de3ca4b0985b718fb9 TeacherTube]!

8/3/08 - We have launched the first [http://dictionary.k12opened.com Kids Open Dictionary]. It is licensed as a public domain resource, and we see it as fundamental building block for many OER projects and hope that it will be used by teachers, students, publishers, hardware manufacturers, VARs, and others. 

We just added support for MediaWiki wikitext, and I am eager to create glossaries for a few Wikibooks to see how it works. Stay tuned!

10/20/07 - I love Wikijunior and am constantly amazed by how few people in the educational community know about. I am being bold by taking on some advocacy for this project. To do this, I am sharing information about Wikijunior and Wikibooks as a part of [http://www.k12opened.com/wiki/index.php/Presentations presentations I am making at educational conferences about Open Ed]. I would appreciate anyone's feedback on this.

I am also working on creating metadata on some of Wikibooks more mature books for [http://www.oercommons.org OER Commons]. This will then also feed into [http://learn.creativecommons.org/ ccLearn] and other repositories. I am hoping that this will help bring more people to Wikijunior to use the resources here and to contribute.

10/19/07 - I'm working on a prototype for a [http://www.k12opened.com/wiki/index.php/Dictionary Simple kids dictionary]. I'm having a lot of ambivalence about whether to try to put it in Wikijunior or just host it myself. Stay tuned for more on this.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INTRODUCTION==
The new World Wide Web, best known as Web 2.0, offers up connections, collaborations, and “cool” for today’s students. Where the web used to be for finding and reading information from somewhere and someone else, it’s now all about creating, collaborating, and becoming a meaningful contributor to a limitless body of knowledge. Web 2.0 allows us to interact with knowledge not just as consumers, but also as producers. There are many different ways that educators can get their students connected, but one that works especially well for educators is a wiki.

==WHAT’S A WIKI?==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki Wiki] comes from the Hawaiian word “wiki-wiki” which means quick. In simplest terms, a wiki is a website where anyone can edit anything anytime.  The first wiki was created by Ward Cunningham in 1995.  He used the word wiki-wiki as a substitute for &quot;quick&quot;, remembering a shuttle bus service he used in Honolulu with that name.  His website, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb Wikiwikiweb] was started as a place for programmers to share their knowledge about software development.  Perhaps the most widely known wiki network is [http://www.Wikipedia.org Wikipedia], an encyclopedia begun by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001 as a project attempting to build a free encyclopedia on the Web to which anyone can contribute, change or add to (Wilson Company, 2005). Wiki “engines” (the software used as the basis for a wiki) are a type of social software, which makes it easy for groups of people to work together in a virtual environment (Chawner &amp; Lewis, 2004). The Wikimedia Foundation developed and launched the Wikimedia software package in its Wikipedia.  Since then, the free software has been adapted for use by many other wiki networks.  Its real power lies in the fact that groups can collaboratively work on the content of a site by using a standard web browser. Beyond this ease of editing, the second powerful element of a wiki is its ability to keep track of the history of a document as it is revised. Wikis can be large and open to the public where any and everyone can add, delete or change content. They can also be small and closed for selected participants only. Another important component of the wiki is its interconnected hyperlinks that typically are seen throughout a wiki page.  These links enable users to quickly learn about and pinpoint topics that are of importance to them.  Though the first wikis appeared eleven years ago, they have captured incredibly large numbers of Internet users in recent years. For example, in 2005, a study found Wikipedia to be the 37th most visited website (Nature, 2005). According to [http://www.alexa.com Alexa], as of May 22, 2007, Wikipedia is the eighth most visited site in the United States.  Wikis currently are used in different contexts, including education, business, library science, and information management. Regardless of their size, wikis are open, collaborative, community websites. The collaborative nature of wikis makes them perfect tools for teachers. Imagine your students working on a project with other students from anywhere in the world!

==WHY A WIKI?==
Creating a wiki is easy and if you don’t mind it being visible to all, it’s free. You can set up your wiki to allow for only your class to have posting and editing rights, or keep it public not only for viewing, but for posting and editing as well. If you choose to have it totally private to be viewed only by select participants, there usually is a fee. To help with monitoring, a wiki keeps document histories, enabling users to see who has posted or edited and what changes were made. Each time the content is changed, a new version is saved. However, anyone can go back and see previous versions allowing students and teachers to see the writing process in action. You can also revert back to a previous version in case of pranksters or vandals.  Likewise, most wiki networks have a good number of volunteer system administrators working behind the scenes to protect against vandalism.

Wikis are a great tool for developing the writing, editing, and communication skills of students. Computers enhance education by providing students with more active learning, more varied sensory and conceptual modes, less mental drudgery, learning better tailored to individuals, and better aid to abstraction (Dede, 1995). Computer learning blends perfectly to the differentiated classroom.  Regardless of their learning style, social maturity, or comfort level with technology, all students can gain new understanding through the use of technology.
Creating content for real audiences is a powerful motivator for students to put forth their best effort. Wikis also promote collaboration among students. Not only do students hone their writing and editing skills, but they also learn to negotiate, compromise, and assist others. Students must negotiate to determine what is important, what information stays and what doesn’t.
It’s a very democratic process of knowledge creation (Richardson, 2006). Through collaborative effort students develop a sense of community, responsibility, and ownership of the work

The wiki process accords with the principle that, as John Dewey (1916) maintained, knowledge is socially constructed. Until recently, writing has largely been viewed as a solitary activity; wikis, on the other hand, tap into the potential for writing as the locus of social interaction.  Moreover, they shift the emphasis from product to process.  Rather than a static object, the written work becomes a dynamic, living, evolving entity (Loudermilk &amp; Hern, 2006).  Wikis transform the configuration of the classic rhetorical situation that delineates audience as distinct from writer.  Rather writer and audience become one and the same, and the work becomes the product of the interaction of writers with one another—a truly social construct.

Wikis can be used as sources of information. But how can we be sure of the accuracy of the information? Alex Halavais, a University of Buffalo professor purposely posted thirteen errors on various Wikipedia pages. Within a couple of hours, all were fixed (Richardson 2006). An investigation completed by Nature magazine compared 42 entries in Wikipedia to the same entries in [http://www.britannica.com Encyclopedia Britannica] and found Wikipedia to be only slightly less accurate (Giles, 2005). Therefore, Wikipedia has value for education and for knowledge-seekers. Just as with all information resources, when students use public wikis as an information source, they must evaluate the reliability and credibility of information. It’s an opportunity for teachers to guide students in becoming critical consumers of information.

==TEACHING AND LEARNING WITH WIKIS==
As Prensky (2001) pointed out, “Our students have changed radically. Today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach,” because today’s students are digital natives while the most of today’s teachers remain digital immigrants. The digital natives absorb knowledge and skill from digital media, while digital immigrants (teachers) are acculturated to a print paradigm. How to create an effective learning environment and integrate effective technology in the curriculum for our students are concerns by more and more educators and teachers. Today, the difficulties for educators and teachers are to identify learning strategies that are appropriate for Digital Natives, recognize the different ways they process information and develop learning tools that maximize the potential of their unique cognitive approach (Culligan, 2006).  Little in life moves as fast as the stimuli that confront &quot;Generation Nintendo&quot; learners on a daily basis.  Learning offerings are challenged to not only meet the pace of &quot;twitch speed&quot;, but to exploit this capacity to its fullest extent (Culligan, 2003). Teachers must take advantage of the technology available to them for use in educating these digital natives.  Wikis are one of the powerful teaching and learning tools that are currently used in some schools and universities, which allows teacher and learners to maximize the potential of print by utilizing print in its electronic or digital form (Ferris and Wider, 2006).  

Raman, Ryan, and Olfman (2005) defined wiki as a group collaboration software tool based on Web server technology that can be used to facilitate collaborative knowledge creation and sharing in an academic environment. Leuf and Cunningham (2001) defined wiki technology as having three major attributes: the participation of wiki community members in the editing of wiki pages (wikis), the opportunity for wiki members to build and develop “meaningful topic association” (p.16) through numerous links between wiki pages, and the supportiveness for wiki community members to collaborate in updating wiki content. As of the 18th of March, 2007, Wikibooks features nearly 25,000 modules.  By May 22, 2007, this number has grown to 25,372 modules.

Because of the characteristics and functions of Wikis, they can be used for student group projects, collaborative textbooks, collective writing, research projects, data collection, organization of projects and assignments. They can also be used for collaborations between teachers. Engstrom and Jewett (2005) studied a curriculum that used wikis to promote middle school students’ investigation of the construction of six dams on the Missouri River. Their research found that the content-centered nature of wikis can promote collaborative content creation and editing. According to Richardson (2006), the entire national high school curriculum for South Africa is now in a wiki with the goal of “[making] it easy for teachers to share information on how to deliver certain lessons or to achieve certain goals with their students” (p.67). Raman, Ryan and Olfman (2005) conducted a case study of wiki technology applied in knowledge management class at the graduate-level. Their findings showed that familiarity with wiki technology, careful planning for implementation and use, appropriate class size, and motivation of students contributed to the success of wiki’s support of collaborative knowledge creation and sharing in the academic environment. According to Evans (2006), students learned course materials more thoroughly and more enthusiastically than they did with the traditional business textbooks used prior to his wiki project’s inception. Recently, two studies showed that college students’ participation in writing, editing and using a Wikibook as primary course textbook can not only promote students’ active learning process, but also improve students’ critical thinking skills and high level learning skills development. In addition, by using Wikibook method, students have greatly increased interaction with the textbook (Wikibook) in the learning process and improved students’ technology skills after the course (Allen, O’Shea, Daniel, and Baker, 2007; Xiao, Baker, O’Shea, and Allen, 2007).

The application of Wikis in the classroom has great potential although few research studies have, as yet, been conducted. The four research studies conducted by Raman, Ryan and Olfman (2005), Evans (2006), Allen ''et al.'' (2007), and Xiao ''et al.'' (2007) have shown that the potential benefits of Wiki usage have not yet been widely recognized by universities and K12 schools. As with any new technology or new teaching method introduced into an educational system, their application in the classroom requires teachers’ thoughtful and deliberate planning.  Likewise, this application also requires creativity and enthusiasm in order for educators to achieve the most effective instructional results. How to effectively integrate the specific wiki in the course design and successfully practice require teachers and educators to do more experiments. How can students be benefited from Wikis and what benefit can students acquire from Wikis - long term or short term benefit as well as students’ achievements or critical thinking skills?  These still need more research in the future.

==THE CHALLENGES==

As with any new technology, before a teacher uses wikis in the classroom it is essential that he/she become familiar with the school district's policy on wiki usage. More than likely, the teacher will find that the technology usage policy has not been updated to reflect the rapid advances in technological tools available for classroom use. In the case of this writer, wikis were not even on the school district's radar. This led to a dialogue with the school system's technology administrator to prompt such a revision. Without a formal document to guide the use of wikis in the classroom, teachers would be well advised to not use any type of identifiers such as students' names or even the name of the school district.

One of the biggest risks of using wikis with kids is the possibility of vandalism. Obviously, on a public wiki, if someone were so inclined they could post material that is inappropriate for young children. If this is a significant worry, the wiki can be set up to require password access for posting and editing. There are sites available that allow this with no charge. Wikispaces offers free wikis for K-12 educators (http://www.wikispaces.com/site/for/teachers100K).
  
According to Child Trends Databank (2006), as of 2003, 76% of children ages three to seventeen had home computers and only 42% of children in the same age group had Internet access. Inequities in access to computers and internet for students need to be considered as a wiki project is designed. Will it require work outside of the school setting? Will all students be able to participate on an equal basis? Questions such as these must be considered. However, as technology advances and becomes available to school districts as well as the general public, lack of Internet access may no longer be an issue. In December 2006, Socialtext launched Socialtext Unplugged, which is an offline wiki (Socialtext, 2006). 

Wikis present some pedagogical problems as well. Teachers need to be willing to give up some control of the content and offer more student autonomy. According to Richardson (2006), better results are achieved when students have greater autonomy in terms of negotiating the scope and quality of the content they are creating. On the other hand, students also need guidance if they are to achieve maximum benefit from the wiki process.  It is still the teacher's responsibility to structure the physical and the electronic environment so that students can take advantage of the learning opportunities that wikis afford.  Teachers need to be especially careful and deliberate in planning for wiki use by younger students (see, for example, the wiki for second graders mentioned later in this article[https://stonierpage.wikispaces.com
]).

==SAFETY ISSUES==
When publishing student work, educators must strike a balance between the safety of the students and the pride and motivation that comes from ownership of the work being published. Many schools have clearly defined policies concerning publishing student work and/or pictures on the web and it’s important to know and follow school policy. It is also wise, particularly at the elementary school level, to receive parental permission before students post their work. Rarely are teachers comfortable with publishing students’ first and last names, although first name only is often a good option. The safest way is to have students use a pseudonym or avatar, and students can have a lot of fun coming up with their web persona. In addition, student online safety is increased if, before embarking on your first wiki adventure with, students are taught some internet safety rules. 

==WHAT A WIKI IDEA!==
There are countless ways to use wikis as classroom tools. The following list provides just a sampling to get teachers started.
*Create an on-line text for the subject or content area (Collaborative Textbooks)
*Student group projects
*Writing
*On-line pen pals (from pen pals to e-pals, to wiki pals)
*Student created study guides
*Research projects
*Data collection
*Student Portfolios
*Collaboration between teachers 
*Organization of projects and assignments
*School or class newspapers
*Storytelling

==SEE A WIKI IN ACTION==
Over the next few weeks you can observe a second grade class try their hand at working with a Wiki.

https://stonierpage.wikispaces.com

*The teacher began by asking each student to select an animal of interest.
*The class then created a list of what they thought would be good information to look for on their animal.
*The teacher then laid out a page for each student and added a photo for each animal.  (photo only no text)
*The student is now responsible for locating information about their chosen animal and adding it to the Wiki site.

Paper presented at the meeting of the American Education Research Association, Chicago, IL.

==ESSAY QUESTION #1==

Effective use of wikis requires a shift in thinking for both teachers and students. What are some of the attitude barriers to effective use of wikis in the classroom?

RESPONSE #1 (Rose)

The dynamics of traditional teaching and learning are completely altered with the use of wikis in the classroom. Notions of authorship and ownership are challenged as students work collaboratively on assignments. Many students resist the idea of open collaboration as they do not want anyone “messing with” their work. It is difficult for students to let go of ownership of a piece of writing. At the same time students may feel uncomfortable with making changes in their classmates’ work even when they clearly see the need for them. Today’s students are programmed to “keep their eyes on their own paper” and at first this type of collaboration might feel a bit like cheating, making students reluctant to fully participate. 

Students’ lack of confidence can also inhibit active participation in a wiki. Most students are unaccustomed to having such a wide audience for their work and will be reluctant to post to the wiki. Easing students in with small groups, small assignments, and time for experimentation may help to adjust student attitudes and prepare them for effective wiki authoring and editing. 

Wikis represent a paradigm shift for many teachers as well. Teachers accustomed to being in control of the learning environment will have to learn to relinquish some of that control to allow their wiki to be truly effective. Changing the tool without changing the practice will not lead to a collaborative, interactive, learning adventure. When students are provided a reasonable amount of autonomy, they develop responsibility for their own learning.
== ESSAY QUESTION #2 ==
How can professional educators and scholars ensure the Wikibook’s quality (Credibility), when students engage to create a collaborative textbook by using Wiki technology?  Is credibility the only element of quality one should explore?

==Essay Response (Question 2)==

Since credibility is, in practice, based independently on the professional reputations of those persons who deem something credible, drawing conclusions about a Wikibook's credibility (or lack thereof) can only happen after a social shift renders Wiki material acceptable as academic materials in the eyes of academics.  A better method of judging a Wikibook's overall &quot;quality&quot; may be to determine the extent to which it meets its desired outcomes -- in the case of educational wikibooks, the extent to which it helps the students learn the desired material in an effective and efficient manner.  Yet another important consideration is whether or not wikibooks yield unexpected learning outcomes.  For instance, even the most poorly written wikibook may serve as a profitable learning tool for students of technology or English composition.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] first romantic experience is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who is enthralled with him, although he does not yet reciprocate her feelings. Harry soon notices [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], the pretty Ravenclaw [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] Seeker. Harry is too shy to express his interest in her, although she seems to notice him. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Harry finally works up the courage to invite her to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. Unfortunately, she has already been asked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], a student in Hufflepuff. 

Harry competes with Cedric for Cho's attention, at least in his own mind, until Cedric's tragic death during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Cho renews her interest in Harry, but as she is still grieving, and unable to move past Cedric's death, she and Harry abruptly end their brief relationship. Harry is again unattached and remains so until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when he begins noticing Ginny Weasley who is then dating someone else. Near the end of the year, they finally get together. Unfortunately for Ginny, Harry ends their relationship to try and protect her from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. In the final book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], it becomes apparent that they still have the kernel of a relationship going on, and although they are separated for the duration of the book, it is made clear the feelings remain. They re-unite near the end of the book, and in the epilogue it is revealed that they have married and three children.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosophers' Stone]] ===

Ginny Weasley first sees Harry in King's Cross train station as Harry and the Weasley boys ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins]]) are preparing to leave for Hogwarts. Excited about being close to the famous Harry Potter, she demands to go over and see him. Harry is most relieved when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] forbids it, saying that Ginny has already seen him and he isn't something to be goggled at like in a zoo.

Ginny is thrilled again when he returns from Hogwarts, excitedly jumping up and down at seeing him, though he does not seem to be paying much attention to her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Ginny's enthrallment with Harry seems to have grown, as she is uncharacteristically nervous and quiet while he is staying at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] insults Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|Flourish and Blotts]], Ginny leaps to his defence. She later sends him a musical Valentine, which results in embarrassment for both of them. At Hogwarts, she seems particularly emotionally fragile when Harry is nearby, although that may partially be from her manipulation by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s diary. When she tries unburdening herself to Harry about what has been happening with the diary, Percy barges in, interrupting her. Finally, as Ginny lies near death in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], Harry destroys Riddle's diary, restoring her life force, and, with assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], rescues her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The rescue from the Chamber of Secrets changes the dynamic between Harry and Ginny. On meeting Harry again in the Leaky Cauldron, Ginny blushes and avoids looking at him; however, over the coming days and school year, she gradually loses her shyness and becomes her normal self. Having seen Harry faint in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor's]] presence on the Hogwarts Express may have reassured her as to Harry's fallibility; there was a definite concern that, as Harry had heroically rescued her from the Chamber of Secrets, she might start seeing him as a hero rather than a person. She later makes him a singing Get Well Soon card indicating her feelings for him are still very much active.

At the House Quidditch match, Harry is introduced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], the Ravenclaw Seeker. &quot;She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight jolt in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves.&quot; Whatever feelings he has for Cho may have been enhanced when she is able to outfly him, at least once, although she is mounted on a lesser broom.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Possibly hoping to connect, or reconnect, with Cho Chang, Harry remains unattached. He invites her to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], but she is already going with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], although she seems to genuinely regret declining his invitation. At Ron's suggestion, Harry asked Ginny, but she had already accepted an invitation from Neville. Out of desperation he then asked Parvati Patil, who accepted, but it is clear to the reader that neither Harry nor Parvati was pleased with the &quot;date.&quot;

Meanwhile, it appears to some, most notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]], that Harry spends too much time with Hermione for it to be strictly friendship. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] publishes a scurrilous story in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|Witch Weekly]] suggesting that Hermione is keeping not only Harry, but also [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] as lovers, although she hints Hermione must be using illegal love potions. Harry and Hermione are both greatly amused, although Harry has to explain to Viktor Krum, and later to Mrs. Weasley, that Hermione is not, and has never been, his girlfriend.

Some readers were as mistaken, some quite obtusely, as Colin Creevey and Rita Skeeter. One group, referred to as &quot;shippers&quot; (apparently derived from &quot;relationship&quot;) believed, prior to the publication of the final book, that Harry and Hermione would ultimately be together. However, J.K. Rowling stated in interviews, given between the publication of the fifth and seventh books, that she has dropped &quot;anvil-sized hints&quot; from at least the fourth book on that Hermione and Ron would link up; see the entries for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] for details on those hints.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Harry and Cho begin a tentative romance. Harry is ecstatic, but before long realizes things are not as he imagined. Cho is still emotionally fragile following Cedric Diggory's death. Although she initially seemed ready to move on, it is soon apparent she is not, and Harry is unable to understand or cope with her grief. Nearly any casual comment or unintentional action on his part results in Cho overreacting and breaking down into tears. 

Cho also misunderstands Harry' platonic relationship with Hermione, and their fragile bond suffers further when Harry excuses himself during a Valentine's Day date in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] to meet Hermione. Harry, already made uneasy by the atmosphere in Madam Puddifoot's Tearoom, is unable to convince Cho that the meeting is innocent, partly because he is unaware what it is; he only knows that Hermione insisted he be there. Unfortunately, he is unable to articulate this in a way that prevents Cho from becoming upset, though Hermione coaches him in this later. The meeting is actually to arrange for Rita Skeeter to interview Harry. Hermione has &quot;persuaded&quot; Skeeter to write a truthful story about Cedric's death that will be published in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']].

After the article appears, Cho approaches Harry and tells him he is brave to have given that interview, and it appears the rift may be patched up between them. But their relationship falls apart again when Cho's friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]], betrays [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]. Cho says she feels badly about what Marietta did, but she justifies her actions, saying that Marietta's parents work for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. She is also angry at Hermione for jinxing her friend. For Harry, there is no excuse for betraying the group, and he points out that Ron's dad also works for the Ministry but he had not betrayed the DA. When Harry warns Cho against crying again, she angrily stomps off, and their relationship has ended.

At the Quidditch Final, which Gryffindor is playing against Ravenclaw, Harry sees Cho on the field, but is unsure what he feels for her, except that he doesn't want any more fights. The sight of her talking animatedly with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]], who Cho had mentioned previously as being one who had asked her out, does not affect Harry's feelings.

On the Hogwarts Express at the end of the year, Cho walks past the compartment in which Harry, Ron, and Ginny are sitting. Ron asks what was happening with him and Cho, and Harry finds that, in fact, he no longer has any real feeling for her. A comment made at this point suggests that Ron is anticipating a match-up between Harry and Ginny.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

While Harry apparently remains unattached, many girls are interested in him. Rather to his surprise, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]] asks him to join her group on the Hogwarts Express as they head to school. When he mentions this to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] later, she points out that since the re-appearance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] has effectively made him once again the darling of the Wizarding World by naming him the Chosen One. It doesn't hurt, she adds, that Harry has grown about a foot over the summer. At this time he is finding himself wanting to be more in Ginny's company though has not yet realized why that is.

In his first Potions class, Harry detects a familiar floral scent coming off the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Amortentia|Amortentia]] potion, a potion which smells, according to Hermione, like the favorite scents of the subject when it is made correctly. Although very shortly after this, the floral scent is identified as one Ginny uses, Harry doesn't immediately connect the two facts.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] is restarting his &quot;Slug club&quot;, a periodic party that Slughorn, an inveterate glory-seeker, holds to gather together all of the more famous students. Harry, of course, would be the true jewel in the crown, but despite his having been invited to all the Slug Club parties, Harry has carefully avoided attending any of them, up until Christmas. There is considerable angling in the student body for an invitation to the Slug Club Christmas party; Hermione reveals that some girls are plotting ways to get Harry to take a love potion, and she warns Harry to watch what he eats and drinks. Shortly after this, Harry carefully turns down an offer from Romilda Vane to share a Gillywater, and accepts (because he doesn't see a way out of it), a box of Chocolate Cauldrons with Firewhisky centers, which he takes up to his dorm and carefully sets aside. He does eventually invite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] to the Christmas Slug Club party, because he has to invite someone.

Harry realizes his feelings for Ginny when he sees her kissing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] and becomes jealous. He keeps his emotions hidden, however, largely because he witnessed Ron's anger at Dean for taking liberties with Ginny. Harry feels his friendship with Ron is too valuable to imperil by making a play for Ginny. He spends much of the year battling his feelings on this matter, secretly wishing for Ginny and Dean to break up.

Harry has been instructed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] to retrieve a memory from Professor Slughorn; finding no other way to do this, he takes some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]] potion. Hidden under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], he knocks into Ginny in such a way that she thinks Dean deliberately shoved her; luckily (as is always the case with Felix Felicis), this prompts Ginny to break up with Dean. 

During the victory party after the Quidditch final, Harry, caught up in the excitement, seizes the opportunity to kiss Ginny in front of the entire Gryffindor Common room. Fortunately for Harry, Ron gives his approval, although he warns Harry to avoid openly kissing his sister. They soon become a couple, laughing at how everyone is now talking about them. Hermione is also pleased they have gotten together. Ginny later tells him that she had never truly given up on him and explains how Hermione helped her overcome her shyness around Harry and to just be herself. The couple's happiness is short-lived, however. After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s funeral, Harry regretfully and sadly ends their relationship, telling Ginny that if Voldemort learns about their romance, he will use her to get to him, just as he did with his godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Ginny is devastated, but she accepts Harry's reasoning.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Saying that a relationship is over does not make it end, as Harry finds out. Staying at The Burrow between his escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] and setting out on his mission, he is of course in the same house with Ginny, and occasionally is set to perform some task alongside her in preparation for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding. It is during one of these shared tasks that Harry lets slip that his mission may involve killing Voldemort, a revelation that leaves Ginny looking rather shaken, despite Harry's trying to make it into a joke.

Knowing that he will shortly have to leave on this mission, and that she will not be able to travel with him, on his birthday Ginny invites Harry into her room and, saying that she has to give him something to remember in case he happens upon any [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] on the way, kisses him passionately. They are interrupted by Ron, who later accuses Harry of leading his sister on after he had broken up with her. Harry, deciding that it is useless to protest that it had been Ginny's idea, and feeling guilty about the episode, promises that it has ended. He is somewhat hard-pressed to keep his promise, as he keeps looking at her over that day and the next, sharing a glance and a private amusement, before he realizes that he isn't supposed to. He also finds it hard to control his jealousy during the wedding reception when Viktor Krum asks about Ginny's availability; Harry claims she has a big boyfriend already, to warn him off.

When the Ministry falls and Harry, Ron, and Hermione run, Harry is extremely worried about Ginny; with the defences fallen, the Weasley house is no longer safe, and Harry is afraid that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] may have injured her as they interrogate the Weasley family about Harry's whereabouts. Harry is as relieved as Ron when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] brings them word that the family is all right.

After possibly revealing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] to a Death Eater, the Trio take to the countryside, camping in various places around England. At one point, a second party passes by the tent that Harry is sharing with Ron and Hermione. This second party mentions that Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] had been caught sneaking into the Headmaster's office to steal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], and had been punished severely. Harry is very worried about what punishment Ginny might have received, until he speaks with the portrait of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], and learns that her punishment had been to work in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|&quot;that half-breed oaf,&quot; Hagrid]].

After Ron leaves the party, Harry periodically brings out the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], initially looking for the little dot that represents Ron to reappear on the map. This would have shown that, protected by his Pure Blood status, Ron had safely resumed his normal life. As time passes and Ron does not reappear, Harry starts studying the map by wandlight at night, watching the dot that represents Ginny at Hogwarts. He wonders what she is doing, and whether she knows he is thinking about her.

Ginny is present at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]]; much to Harry's dismay, she demands to join in the fighting. In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], before the battle, Harry mentions that he may be looking for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw]]'s lost diadem. Cho Chang, who has returned with the rest of Dumbledore's Army, mentions that there is a statue of Ravenclaw, with the Diadem, in the Ravenclaw house common room and offers to take Harry there. Ginny vetoes that and volunteers Luna Lovegood in Cho's place.

After the first battle, Harry heads off to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] to meet Voldemort and his doom; as he does so, he passes Ginny on the grounds, aiding a fallen student. He wants to stop and speak with her, but knows that if he does, he won't be able to continue; but he believes that she looks up as he walks past, despite his being under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]].

Ginny's kiss is the last thing Harry thinks about before Voldemort casts the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]].

After the final battle is finished, Harry looks over at Ginny, who is leaning her head on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|her mother]] in exhaustion. Harry thinks to himself that he will want to talk with Ginny, but that it can wait; he will have all the time in the world to speak with her, he will leave her this time to recover.

In the Epilogue, Harry and Ginny are married and have three children, James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.

== Notable Consequences ==

While Harry is convinced by Ron and Hermione to start teaching proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, he is more than slightly taken aback to discover that there are at least two dozen students at the organizational meeting. One of the things that convinces him to take on this large group is the presence of Cho Chang. The relationship with Cho, to a certain extent, sustains him in his efforts to keep the DA meetings occurring.

By the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Harry knows that anyone he is close to, his friends, his loves, or his relatives, will become Voldemort's targets. To protect Ginny, he reluctantly tries to end their relationship. Unless Voldemort can be killed, Harry knows he faces a lonely life with few friends or loved ones to support him. When the relationship continues, Harry finds some strength in studying the Marauder's Map to find out what Ginny is doing at the school.

As mentioned, in the epilogue we discover that Harry has married Ginny, and so has created the family he has always wanted.

== Analysis ==

By the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' it is apparent Harry is unprepared for a mature relationship, as is only to be expected for a fifteen-year old. His attachment to Cho Chang, in retrospect, seems ill-advised; he was unable to provide what she needed emotionally, and she was unprepared for his inability to give it. Also, Cho is a year older than Harry, and girls generally mature more rapidly than boys at this age.

One could wonder just what Cho saw in Harry. After the events in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', her interest in Harry mainly seems to be that he was present at Cedric's death and can provide her information about it; however, Cho was interested in Harry a year earlier, at least after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet]] selected him as a Champion. She does seem genuinely sorry that Harry's attempt to ask her to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] was pre-empted by Cedric. It is uncertain why, though it may have more to do with an attraction to Harry's fame as 'the Boy who Lived,' rather than an interest in Harry himself.

Harry's slowly-building interest in Ginny Weasley, starting in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', is not entirely unheralded. Harry always treats Ginny with great consideration. In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', he tactfully pretends not to notice when she overturns her porridge at breakfast. Harry also fears she will be held responsible and punished for everything that happened during that year. We feel his relief as keenly as hers when Dumbledore says, &quot;''There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.''&quot; And it is revealed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] that she and Harry share an understanding of how Voldemort mentally affects his victims, an experience that cannot be understood by either Ron or Hermione.

Harry's inner turmoil during ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' is an excellent depiction of his current state of mind. He and Ron, returning from the Quidditch pitch, run into Ginny and Dean Thomas &quot;snogging&quot; (kissing) in a hidden corner. Ron flares angrily at Dean, continuing the quarrel with Ginny once Dean has departed. By now, Harry recognizes his own feelings for Ginny and is jealous of Dean. However, he believes that if Ron is this upset at Dean, it is likely he would be equally upset with Harry, should he seek to replace Dean in Ginny's affections. It is this latter fear over losing Ron's friendship that prevents him from taking action after Ginny and Dean break up. It is noteworthy that Ron's anger at Dean decreased once he (Ron) hooked up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]]. Harry might have considered pursuing Ginny if Ron had continued in that relationship. However, Ron and Lavender break up at very nearly the same time that Ginny dumps Dean, which probably leaves Harry worried that Ginny has been placed under Ron's brotherly microscope once again. We can only guess that this accounts for Harry's delay in courting Ginny. We note that when Harry takes a chance and kisses Ginny in full view of the common room, he does check immediately to see if Ron approves.

At the end of book 6, Harry shows his concern for Ginny's well-being by, apparently paradoxically, ending their relationship. He knows Voldemort often fells his victims by targeting their friends and loved ones, just as he did with Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. Ginny sees Harry's decision to end their relationship to protect her as being noble, but she also believes it is the incorrect way to handle the situation. Even at that point, it seems unlikely their relationship has truly ended, despite Harry's saying it has. And of course, we see in the next book that the relationship is still in force, no matter what Harry and Ron believe. A more mature reader may realize that Harry's nominally ending the relationship will not significantly change anything, and will also realize that the reason Voldemort was able to use Sirius against Harry was the lack of communication between Sirius and Harry. If Harry had remembered the mirror, and had contacted Sirius directly instead of relying on the broken reed that was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], he would have known that Sirius was in no danger. In light of this fact, if Harry truly wants to keep Ginny safe, the best place for her is, if not at his side, certainly within a moment's contact. As it is, Ginny would make an admirable weapon to use against Harry, if Voldemort knew about her. As proof of this, we need look no further than Harry's reaction when he learns Ginny, at Hogwarts, was &quot;punished cruelly&quot; for attempting to steal the Sword of Gryffindor from the Headmaster's office.

One of the main strengths of this work is the realism of the actions and expressed feelings of the characters. Harry's romantic career, with its false starts, anticipation, disappointments, and eventual completion, feels realistic to the reader, despite its being, in retrospect, almost amazingly easy for Harry. Unlike many of us, Harry never can say that his relationships are &quot;complicated.&quot; Despite this, we feel that what Harry is experiencing is realistic. Part of this is that it is an integral part of Harry's life, as is his quest to conquer Voldemort; it is neither dismissed as unimportant to the story line, nor tacked on in a misguided attempt to make us feel that the character is well-rounded. Further, the exposition of Harry's inner monologue concerning possible repercussions in his relationship with Ron are critical, in that they allow us to see that Harry is profoundly affected by his feelings for Ginny, and by his friendship with Ron, and we see the essential conflict that Harry experiences. As unlikely as it is that relationships could work out so neatly in the real world, with the lack of remorse on either side after the break-up with Cho, and Ginny's break-up with Dean being so neatly timed, we still feel that Harry's romantic life is realistic, and this greatly enhances our belief in his character and our involvement in the story.

      <comment>/* Past Tense */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The past tense signifies actions that were done in the past.  Conjugating verbs to show the past tense is very easy in English, almost as easy as conjugating the present tense.

==Past Tense==

'''Regular verbs''' take the ending '-d' or 'ed' in the affirmative. The negative and interrogative are formed using ''did'' (past of the auxiliary verb ''do'') together with the infinitive of the verb. The verb ''work'' is conjugated as follows:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;th colspan = 3&gt;Affirmative&lt;/th&gt; 

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;I worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;he worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;she worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;it worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;we worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;they worked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th colspan = 3&gt;Negative&lt;/th&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;I did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;you didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;he did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;he didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;she did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;she didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;it did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;it didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;we did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;we didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;you didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;they did not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;they didn't work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th colspan = 3&gt;Interrogative&lt;/th&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did I work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did you work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did he work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did she work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did it work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did we work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did you work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did they work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th colspan = 3&gt;Negative Interrogative&lt;/th&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did I not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't I work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did you not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't you work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did he not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't he work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did she not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't she work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did it not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't it work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did we not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't we work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did you not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't you work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;did they not work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;didn't they work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 

'''Irregular verbs''' change their form in the past tense affirmative in a variety of ways. The past of ''go'', for example, is ''went'', of ''buy'', ''bought'', of ''keep'', ''kept''. As with the regular verbs, the negative and interrogative are formed using ''did'' together with the infinitive of the verb. The verb ''go'' is conjugated in the past tense as follows:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;th colspan = 3&gt;Affirmative&lt;/th&gt; 

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;I went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;he went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;she went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;it went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;we went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;they went&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;th colspan = 3&gt;Negative&lt;/th&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;I did not go&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I didn't go&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;you did not go&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;you didn't go&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Probability

If one understands the basics of probability theory, then in roulette especially it is very easy to test betting systems mathematically.  Here is the step by step logic of applying probability in roulette to the possible outcomes.

First, all the mathematics used here is based on a European single 0 wheel since the house edge is half the American version.

We know that the probability of an event happening is the chances of that event compared to all the possible events.  For instance, when you flip a coin there are 2 possible outcomes: heads, tails.  If you want to know what is the probability that the coin will come up heads, then that would be: heads / (heads + tails) = 1/2 = .5.  Likewise when playing an even money bet at roulette, that option covers 18 of the 37 possible outcomes: 18/37=.48648649.

To find out the effect the odds have on a measurable outcome, we can apply that outcome to all possible results.  So if we’re playing $1 on black, then we know that for 18 of 37 outcomes we will net $1 profit, and for 19 of the 37 possible outcomes we will net a $1 loss.  ((18/37)*1)+((19/37)*-1)=-.02702703.  This shows the house advantage on any single spin applied to your bankroll.  We know that if you place $1 on any even number bet on average you will loose almost three cents per spin or $27 over 100 spins.

This is valuable when looking at more complicated betting within the layout of the table.  For instance, if you consider on the thirds position that the return is 2:1.  Let’s look at the extremes.  If you place a bet on one of the three options, then you are obviously playing against probability: 12/37=.32432432 probability to win.  If you place $1 on all three of the possible options, then for 36 of 37 numbers you will loose $2, make $2, and have the bet on the winning third returned to you for a net profit of $0.  This of course makes no sense at all, but you’ll win almost every time if you’re in it to feel like a winner however if your considering a system you’re trying to make money.  If we hedge the single bet with the second possible bet and place $1 on the first two of the thirds, then we cover 24 of 37 numbers 24/37=.64864865.  We’re guaranteed to lose one bet, but if the other hits then we make $2, minus the one lost, plus the winning bet returned makes a net profit of $1 – and here’s the kicker – our chance of winning on any single bet is greater than 50% (64.86% to be precise).

We know that roulette is an independently random game where the results of one action does not affect the odds of a second action, so presented like this one might see this a winning system of finding a way to shift the odds in your favor.  However if we analyze all the possible outcomes we see that the proposition is a losing one.  24 of 37 possible outcomes net us $1.  On 13 of 37 possible outcomes we loose $2.  So we plug in our formula: ((24/37)*1)+((13/37)*-2)=-.05405405.  This is even worse than playing even money odds.

Now we come full circle.  Almost all systems are based on the premise that the likelihood of an event happening repeatedly gets exponentially smaller the more times in a row one seeks that option.  Probability will never rule out a roulette table showing the number 36 100 times in a row, but it will tell us exactly how unlikely it is.  The premise is that the probability of an event happening once is multiplied by the likelihood of the second event multiplied by the third event and so on.  For instance, for a single number to come up 100 times we multiply (1/37)*(1/37)*(1/37)… for one hundred times.  This is a tiny number but we can see how fast it adds up:

(1/37)=.02702703

(1/37)*(1/37)=.00073046

(1/37)*(1/37)*(1/37)=.00001974

(1/37)*(1/37)*(1/37)*(1/37)=.00000053

The likelihood of a number coming up four times in a row is only 0.000053%, but it happens.  Just go to Global Player Casino and check out the roulette results for the year.  But I digress, the strategies say if you chase a loss long enough it won’t lose any more, and systems like the Martingale set it up so that you realize a profit when that condition fails.  However, it’s still a losing system because we can plug in our formula to this just as easily as we can plug it into a single event.

But first let’s examine what it is we’re looking at.  If we’re analyzing a system there are only two options we’re interested in: win or loss.  Let’s not get too complicated and assume that one loss will exit the system and return the player to the starting state such as the Martingale.

If the first spin loses then we go to a second spin, and if the second spin loses then we go to the third and so on.  So we know that for however many levels we examine all the preceding spins will be losses.  In other words, if 51.4% of spins will lose, then we are looking at 51.4% of 51.4% will lose twice in a row and 48.6% of 51.4% will win on the second round.  Therefore, 51.4% of 51.4% of 51.4% will lose thrice, and 48.6% of 51.4% of 51.4% will win.

For a single level we know that the formula is the probability of a win times the net result and the probability of a loss times the net result.

(((18/37)*1)+((19/37)*-1))= -.02702703

To check the second level, the probability of a loss followed by the probability of a win times the net result is compared to two losses and the net result.

(((19/37)*(18/37))*1)+(((19/37)^2)*-2)= -.27757487

To extrapolate the third, fourth, and fifth level:

((((19/37)^2)*(18/37))*1)+(((19/37)^3)*-4)= -.4133615

We can see no matter how far we go on the Martingale system it’s always more likely a losing proposition than a wining proposition, and the deeper one goes the more likely one is to lose a greater sum of money.  Of course this isn’t a surprise since the odds are already against us.


More on other systems and hedge betting later.


Any system can be analyzed like this for any game.  If the result is positive, the odds are in the player’s favor.  If the result is negative you’re trusting Lady Luck.  I haven’t found a formula that results in a positive number.  Of course, if I had I'd be in a casino right now.

This is a well presented maths explanation of the odds against the player when betting at roulette.But it confuses probability with certainty.Probability Theory deals with uncertainty not certainty.
Roulette, like all gambling, is a game of chance so , obviously, chance is involved. This does not mean that only chance is involved.
If the roulette wheel is random then no one can predict with certainty that we will win or lose. That certainty belongs to astrology not maths. There is no reason why the wheel should not give the same number continuously for a hundred, a thousand or even a million spins if it is truly random; incidentally, unless we are going to live till eternity then &quot;The Long Run&quot; is irrelevant in real time betting.
The  writer errs when dealing with betting the First and Second dozens together. Using the 1-18 bet we can lower the odds against us. Placing three chips on 1-18 and one chip on the six-line 19-24 benefits us should zero occur whereas betting the two dozens does not.
To my mind, there is an all too casual attitude to discussing roulette and this is exemplified in this article.Also- but not here -there is usually a knee-jerk reaction to anyone who rejects the notion that you are certain to lose. Claims of certainty -to  win or lose -are unjustifiable where uncertainty clearly reigns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

== About video game guides ==

Unfortunately the Wikibooks community have decided that strategy game guides are not suitable for Wikibooks and should instead be developed on [http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Main_Page Strategy Wiki].  I would suggest that you copy what you have started to Strategy Wiki before [[Counter-Strike: Source]] and other such pages are deleted.  If you have any questions please ask myself or any other active Wikibookians.

I suggest merging [[Transwiki:Java syntax]] into [[Java Programming/Syntax]].
After that, I suggest breaking [[Java Programming/Syntax]] up into smaller pages.
For example, I expect the [[Transwiki:Java_syntax#Objects]] section to eventually move to [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types]].

This book is an introduction to programming in [http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/index.htm Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Java&amp;trade; programming language], a widely used programming language and software platform. This book serves as a comprehensive guide, complete with a [[Java_Programming/Tutorials|series of tutorials]] to help users better understand the many ways one can program in Java. In its entirety, this book is meant to be both an introductory guide and a useful reference on Java and related technologies. As is the nature of this book, the content within the book is continuously being updated and revised. With every chapter within this book, the complexity of the context increases, building up on lessons learnt in the previous chapters. Beginners should therefore start from the beginning and proceed in a sequence throughout the material of the book.

If you are not familiar with Object Oriented Programming, you should first read the book [[Object Oriented Programming]]. Other special purpose books on Java, such as [[J2EE Programming|Java Enterprise Edition programming]], [[Java Persistence]], or [[Java Swings|Java Swing programming]], with more details, would complement this book nicely.

'''Lamiaceae''', or the Mint family, is a family of plants in about 210 genera and some 3,500 species. It has been considered closely related to Verbenaceae but several recent phylogenetic studies have shown that numererous genera classified in Verbenaceae belong instead in Lamiaceae, whereas the core genera of Verbenaceae are not closely related to Lamiaceae and are more closely related to other members of the Lamiales.

The plants are frequently aromatic in all parts and include many widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some are shrubs, but rarely trees or vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, owing not only to their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation: these plants are among the easiest plants to propagate by stem cuttings.

==Description==
The original family name is ''Labiatae'', so given because the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (labia). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternate name, most botanists now use the name &quot;Lamiaceae&quot; in referring to this family.

The leaves contain aromatic essential oils and emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (called ''decussate'') or whorled.

The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.

The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with 5 united petals, 5 united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers but actually consists of two crowded clusters).

==Varieties==
*''[[../Agastache/]]''
*''Glechoma''
**''[[../Glechoma hederacea/]]''
*''[[../Lavandula/]]''
*''[[../Melissa/]]''
**''[[../Melissa officinalis/]]''
*''[[../Pycnanthemum/]]''
*''[[../Stachys/]]''
**''[[../Rosmarinus officinalis/]]''
*''[[../Salvia/]]''
*''[[../Thymus/]]''

==Uses==
Most members of this family are high-quality nectar sources, attracting both insects and hummingbirds.

[[Image:Dermaptera_fg1.jpg|right|thumb|Earwig from Australia compared to a CF card - 63&amp;nbsp;mm]]
[[Image:Earwig_on_tin.jpg|right|thumbnail|Female (cerci not hooked)]]
[[Image:Earwig iruppu.jpg|thumb|right|An earwig from the Western Ghats]]
'''Earwig''' is the common name given to the insect order '''Dermaptera'''. With about 1,800 recorded species in 10 families, the order is relatively small among Insecta. Earwigs are, however, quite common globally. There is no evidence that they transmit disease or otherwise harm humans or other animals, despite their nickname ''pincher bug''.

Most earwigs found in Europe and North America are ''Forficula auricularia'', the European earwig, which is distributed throughout the cooler parts of the northern hemisphere.

==Description==
Earwigs are characterized by membranous wings folded underneath short leathery forewings (hence the literal name of the order - &quot;skin wings&quot;). The abdomen extends well beyond the wings, and frequently, though not always, ends in a pair of forceps-like cerci.

The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing of the forceps. The forceps are used for a variety of purposes. In some species, the forceps have also been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females. 

Most earwigs are elongate, flattened, and are dark brown. Some tropical species are brightly colored. Occasionally earwigs are confused with cockroaches because of their cerci and their long antennae. Lengths are mostly in the 10-14&amp;nbsp;mm range, with the St. Helena earwig reaching 80&amp;nbsp;mm. Cerci range from nonexistent to long arcs up to one-third as long as the rest of the body. As in other orthopteroid insects, mouthparts are adapted for chewing. When earwigs have wings (are not agnathous), the hindwings are folded in a complex fashion, so that they fit under the forewings. Earwigs rarely fly.

Earwigs are drawn to damp conditions. During the summer they can be found around sinks and in bathrooms. Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere they can remain concealed in daylight hours. Picnic tables, compost and waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames or anything with minute spaces can potentially harbour these unwanted residents. Upon gaining entry to the basement and living areas of the home, earwigs can easily find cover in undisturbed magazine and newspaper piles, furniture/wickerwork, base boards, carpeted stairways, pet food dishes, and even inside DVD cases. Earwigs are inclined to take risks and are exploratory creatures but are overly unaware of the consequences and will often find themselves trapped in poison baited cups or buckets of soapy water.

==Symptoms and Signs==
&lt;!--damage done by the pest--&gt;

==Ecology==
&lt;!--distribution, invasiveness, reproduction, etc.--&gt;

==Host plants==
Erwigs feed on other insects, plants, ripe fruit, and garbage. Plants they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, strawberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn. Typically they are a nuisance because of their diet, but normally do not present serious hazards to crops.

==Control==
While earwigs can be considered in some ways a beneficial part of the garden, they can become a nuisance because of their diet. 
{{pestcontrol|
| Cultural controls =
| Resistant varieties = 
| Trapping = Since they prefer cool, moist places, a rolled up damp newspaper placed where earwig activity is suspected can be effective in collecting them. The newspaper can then either be discarded or shaken out. Another method of removing earwigs is by utilizing their attraction to vegetable oil. Putting vegetable oil in a pie tin and burying it up to the rim of the tin is an effective way of capturing them.
| Physical removal =

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Percentage yield''' is a useful way of saying how much of a reactant has been successfully converted to product in a chemical reaction.

[[File:83-percent-yield-2D-skeletal.png|500px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;from [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja809610h ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' (2009) '''131''' (''26''), 9134–9135]&lt;/small&gt;

If all the reactants become products, the percentage yield is 100%. If half the reactants become products and the rest become by-products or don't react at all, the percentage yield is 50%. If none of the reactants end up as products, the percentage yield is 0%.

== In a nutshell ==
For a reaction where, ideally, one mole of starting material A is converted to one mole of products B, i.e. A→ B:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ \mbox{moles of product B} }{ \mbox{moles of starting material A} } \times 100 = \frac{\frac{\mbox{mass of product B}}{\mbox{molar mass of product B}}}{\frac{\mbox{mass of starting material A}}{\mbox{molar mass of starting material A}}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

== Importance ==

Percentage yield is important because:
* chemical reactions very often form '''by-products''' as well as the intended product
* in most reactions, not all of the reactants actually react

What is left at the end of a reaction is thus typically a mixture of '''product''' and '''impurities''' (impurities being by-products and unreacted starting materials).

Achieving high percentage yields is particularly important in industries that rely on organic synthesis, such as the pharmaceutical industry. It may require tens of steps to synthesise a drug molecule — if there are ten steps, each of which has a percentage yield of 90%, the overall yield is only 35%:

90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% =  (90%)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 35%

&lt;math&gt; 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.9^{10} = 0.35 &lt;/math&gt;

In certain reactions (such as the [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Haber process|Haber process]]) reactants can be recycled, in which case high yields are less of an issue.

== Percentage yield formula ==
There is a simple formula you can use to calculate the percentage yield of a reaction A → B:

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ \mbox{moles of product B} }{ \mbox{moles of reactant A} } \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;

Percentage yield effectively states the percentage of moles of reactant that become product — although this definition only applies if one mole of reactant ideally forms one mole of product, i.e. 1:1 stoichiometry.


In practice, the number of moles of A and B involved have to be calculated using the masses, ''m'' and molar masses, ''M'', of A and B.

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ m_B \times M_A }{ m_A \times M_B } \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;m_A \,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands for the mass of substance A in g
*&lt;math&gt;M_A \,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands for the molar mass of substance A in g mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;m_B \,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands for the mass of substance B in g
*&lt;math&gt;M_B \,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands for the molar mass of substance B in g mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;


In words, this is:

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ \mbox{mass of product} \times \mbox{molar mass of starting material} }{ \mbox{mass of starting material} \times \mbox{molar mass of product} } \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;


This can also be written as:


&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ \mbox{mass of product} \div \mbox{molar mass of product} }{ \mbox{mass of starting material} \div \mbox{molar mass of starting material} } \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;


Another way of writing the same this is given below, but this form is a little untidy:


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{\frac{\mbox{mass of product}}{\mbox{molar mass of product}}}{\frac{\mbox{mass of starting material}}{\mbox{molar mass of starting material}}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

== Derivation of formula ==
=== Notation ===
&lt;math&gt;n_X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means number of moles of substance X

&lt;math&gt;m_X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means mass of substance X

&lt;math&gt;M_X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means molar mass of substance X

=== Definition of yield ===
&lt;math&gt; \mbox{yield} = \frac{ n_B }{ n_A } &lt;/math&gt;

=== Definition of percentage yield ===
&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ n_B }{ n_A } \times 100% &lt;/math&gt;

=== Expressing moles in terms of mass and RFM ===
&lt;math&gt; n_X = \frac{m_X}{M_X} &lt;/math&gt;, which you may know as  &lt;math&gt; \mbox{moles} = \frac{\mbox{mass}}{\mbox{RFM}} &lt;/math&gt;


therefore, wherever &lt;math&gt; n_X \,\!&lt;/math&gt; appears, it can be replaced with &lt;math&gt; \frac{m_X}{M_X} &lt;/math&gt;

thus &lt;math&gt; n_B = m_B / M_B \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; n_A = m_A / M_A \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rewriting the yield formula in terms of mass and RFM ===
substituting the above equations into the formula for percentage yield

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ n_B }{ n_A } \times 100% &lt;/math&gt;

gives

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ m_B / M_B }{ m_A / M_A } \times 100% &lt;/math&gt;


which can be rearranged to give

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{percentage yield} = \frac{ m_B M_A }{ m_A M_B } \times 100% &lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: occaisionally → occasionally using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The best way to get a start on most chapters is to &quot;transwiki&quot; the Wikipedia article on the subject, and then modify it to suit the [[../Manual of Style/]] used in this book. Basing the modules of this book on Wikipedia articles has two important advantages:
# By basing the module on a Wikipedia article, the topic doesn't have to be developed &quot;from scratch&quot;. Many Wikipedia articles have been well-edited and copyedited over time, have images to illustrate features of the topic. and so on.
# Because Wikipedia (like Wikibooks) is licensed under the GFDL, there are rarely problems with copyrights. 

The main &quot;problem&quot; with Wikipedia articles is simple: they're encyclopedia articles, not book chapters, and so need to be modified, rearranged, and relinked to fit into this book. In order to facilitate this, a number of templates have been developed to fit various topics, which both help suggest a framework into which the sections (or even sentences) of the Wikipedia articles can be put into, as well as helping to create a consistent structure for all chapters, which in turn makes the book a lot more useful for the home reader or classroom environment. 

==Step One: Start the module==
The best way to start a transwiki-based module is to first '''Import''' the Wikipedia article, and then apply the relevant template and develop the chapter. The only problem with this is that only an [[WB:ADMIN|Administrator]] can use the import tool. To get the article imported, simply list it on [[WB:RFI]], or for faster action make the request on our main IRC channel, #wikibooks (on freenode). There are almost always administrators listening on the channel, so just type !admin for attention. 

Alternatively, contributors can simply copy-and-paste the Wikipedia article and work on it while awaiting Import. When doing this, please be sure to list both the wikipedia article and the chapter as an Import/Merge request [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_Import#Import_and_Merge|here]]. Note that this is a bit more difficult for administrators (several steps are involved), but it accomplishes the purpose just as well. Very active contributors who wish to import large numbers of articles should consider simple [[WB:RFA|becoming an administrator]] (the RFA process on wikibooks is far less stressful than it is on Wikipedia).

If there is no article on Wikipedia, or the article is a fairly useless stub, just start the chapter from scratch using the templates. 

==Step Two: Templatize==
There are a number of templates available for creating page structures in ''A Wikimanual of Gardening''. They must be used with &quot;subst:&quot; to work correctly, but the templates they include (primarily infoboxes) should not be substituted:
*For modules about individual plants, type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:plantprof}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page (usually just above the taxobox), and save. 
*For modules about weed plants, type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:weedprof}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page (usually just above the taxobox), and save. 
*For modules about garden pests, type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:pestprof}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page (usually just above the taxobox), and save. 
*For modules about plant diseases, type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:phytopathprof}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page (usually just above the taxobox), and save. 

==Step Three: &quot;Bookify&quot;==
&quot;Bookify&quot; is a word occasionally used to mean &quot;change an encyclopedia article into part of a book&quot;. The templates for ''A Wikimanual of Gardening''  are used to facilitate this process by providing a consistent &quot;narrative structure&quot;. Wikipedia articles need to be &quot;dewikified&quot; (wikilinks either removed or replaces with subpage-style links), and for this book they need t be snipped up and re-organized to fit into the fields provided by the templates. 

===Dewikifying the easy way===
The easiest way to dewikify is to simply open both the module page and the edit page side-by side, and just copy from the module and paste over the wikified version on the edit page. There are a few things to look out for however:
#References need to be pasted around, i.e. they will not render as references from a copy of the text as it appears on the reading view.
#Italics and boldface are also lost in this process
#Images also need to be worked around, for the same reason the references need it. If an image appears as a redlink, see [[#Fixing Image Redlinks|the section on this]], below. 
#Sometimes it's better to modify the wikilinks to the subpage protocols, rather than simply removing them. See [[#Making Chapter Links|this section]] for how to do that.

===Moving from taxobox to WMOG infoboxes===
#Move the image from the taxobox to the hortibox
#Add information about family
#After &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hortibox|&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Pestbox|&lt;/nowiki&gt;, etc.  (the first line of the template), add the common name of the plant, pest, pathogen, etc.
#Use the &quot;| Genus =&quot; field only when the page is about the genus (if the binomial field is used, don't also use the genus field)
#Fill in as many fields as you are able, leaving the other ones blank (don't delete fields, as they might be filled in later).

===Reordering the text===
After dewikifying, move the text into the fields provided by the template. 
*If there is a lot of information that's just not at all of interest for horticulture (like long discussions of the uses of chemicals found in a plant, &quot;trivia&quot; sections mentioning every song or movie that mentions a particular flower, etc.), just remove them, though keep in mind that ''some'' trivial information (particularly historical and folklore references) might be useful to the student of horticulture as mneumonic devices, as well as being educational about the uses of plants.
*For chapters about plant genera, the long species lists often contained in Wikipedia articles are generally not useful, and serve little purpose outside of cluttering up a page. They can be pasted onto the talk page for further reference, but be sure to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; protocol in onder to prevent creating bad redlinks. 

===Adding material===
After the adaptations are completed, there will almost certainly be gaps to be filled. The more information the better, remember that Wikibooks is not paper. If using external sources (books, journals, other websites, etc.) please be sure to add a link or citation under the &quot;References&quot; section. 

===Making Chapter Links===
Unlike Wikipedia, Wikibooks uses subpages. Links to other chapters of this book can easily be made using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../link/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Redlinks are fine.

===Fixing Image Redlinks===
If an image appears on the Wikipedia article, but does not appear on the Wikibooks page, this means that the image in in the Wikipedia Image namespace, rather than being on commons. If the image is important to the chapter, images can easily be moved to commons using [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php commonshelper] on the toolserver. 

===Categorizing===
''A Wikimanual of Gardening'' uses a deep category structure. General categories are automatically added when using the templates, but sometimes they need minor modification. There are also more specific categories that will eventually be employed using DynamicPageList (DPL) to provide lists for gardeners who are looking for plants for a particular purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Query==
'''Notion'''

Think of a customer-database-software-product that is used by different companies to manage their customers, i.e. they all use their own installations of the same database-product and of course have the data of their own customers in it.  Now one can query such a database e.g. &quot;Customers in Africa&quot; that results in a list of all customers in Africa.  Although the content of the databases is different the query is defined for all of them - supposed they have customers, countries and the 'in' relation defined.  Of course it may deliver different results.

Similarly one can define queries on structures that deliver a set of elements of the universe. Here a set of symbols S corresponds to the database-product, i.e. the naked database-structure, concrete S-structures to database-instances and an interpretation to a database-entry. E.g. 
&lt;math&gt;\forall_x xRy&lt;/math&gt; retrieves all possible values for y.  In general for formular with n free variables we get a set of n-tuples (that may also be empty).  In case the query is a sentence (no free variables) we just get 'yes' or 'no' as result, in case the query has a model in the structure or not.  In the database above this can correspond to &quot;Kay Ubuntu is Customer in Africa&quot;.

'''Definition'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; be a S-structure with universe A, m a nonegative integer and Q a mapping from S-structures to sets of subsets of A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, s.t. each &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; maps to a subset of A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.

Q is said to be a m-ary Query on S-structures iff Q is closed under isomorphism,

where closed (or preserved) under isomorphism is: if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \cong \mathfrak B&lt;/math&gt; by a isomorphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(Q(\mathfrak A)) = Q(\mathfrak B)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remarks'''

* A 0-ary Q is also called a boolean query. In this case Q maps to  A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, that is a 0-tuple, or the empty set.  The former result is also called TRUE the latter FALSE.
* For a boolean query Q a subset C of S-structures can be defined by: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \in C&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;Q(\mathfrak A) = true&lt;/math&gt;
* the closedness condition ensures that only the 'shape' of structures is queries, i.e. it is inimportant what the universe consists of as long as its related in the same way.

'''Examples'''

'''''Simple'''''

Take S = {&lt;}.  We query 'all elements that have no smaller element'.  This gives for a universe of {10, 11, 12} the result {(10)} (A set of 1-ary tuples).  The query for 'all elements that have a smaller element' gives {(11), (12)}.  A query for 'all directly succeeding
elements' gives {(10, 11), (11, 12)} (A set of 2-ary tuples).  The query 'there is a biggest element' results in {()} (The 0-ary element), whereas 'there is no biggest element' gives {} (false).

counter example?

==Definability==
On one hand we have queries that can be more or less 'complicated'.  Just think of a database-query simply for all customers with name = 'Ubuntu' compared to a query covering many properties and relationships.  On the other hand we have languages of different expressive power like FO and MFO (monadic first oder logic).  So one can ask if the expressive power of a language is strong enough to express (define) a certain query.

====of classes of structures====
Let C be a class of finite structures and L be a logic.  C is said to be definable in the logic L iff there is a sentence φ in L s.t. C is the set of all finite models of φ.

====of queries====
Let Q be a query, L a logic

Q is said to be definable in L iff it exists a formular φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of L in S s.t. for all &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; all elements of &lt;math&gt;Q(\mathfrak A)&lt;/math&gt; are an assignment on φ s.t. &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

====Remarks====
* Thus boolean queries are correspond to sentences

====Examples====
'''Simple'''

On a finite graph the query 'there is an element that is adjacent with all others' can be written in FO as &lt;math&gt;\exists_x \forall_y x R y&lt;/math&gt;.  The language can even be restricted further, e.g. by allowing only 2 variable per formula (this is approximately what the logic FO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; does).

'''Application'''

The database query language SQL contains many extensions to increase it's power.

==Partial Isomorphy==

====Definition====
'''Partial Isomorphism among structures'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; be relational S-Structures and p be a mapping.  Then p is said to be a ''Partial Isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;'' iff all of the following hold
* dom(p) &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; A and codom(p) &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; B
* p is injective
* for every constant symbol c from S and every a: a = c&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; iff p(a) = c&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
* for every  n-ary relation symbol R from S and &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;  iff &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p(a_1)&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;p(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; A, &lt;math&gt;b_*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; B.

====Remarks====

* I.e. a partial Isomorphism on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a (plain) Isomprphism on the substructures obtained by choosing dom(p) and codom(p) and 'prune' constants and relations respectively.
* Partial Homomorphim ...

====Examples====

* Let S ={&lt;} be defined over A ={1, 2, 3} and B ={3, 4, 5, 6} the natural way. Then &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; with 1-&gt;3 and 2-&gt;4 is a partial isomorphism (since 1 &lt; 2 and p(1) &lt; p(2)) as well as &lt;math&gt;p_3&lt;/math&gt; with 2-&gt;3 and 3-&gt;6 as well as &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; with 1-&gt;6. Whereas neither &lt;math&gt;p_4&lt;/math&gt; with 1-&gt;6 and 2-&gt;3 (since 1 &lt; 2 but not p(1) &lt; p(2)) nor &lt;math&gt;p_5&lt;/math&gt; with 2-&gt;5 and 3-&gt;5 is a partial isomorphism.

* Let S ={R} with &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{A} =\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)\}&lt;/math&gt; (a 'square') and &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{B} =\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)\}&lt;/math&gt; (a 'binary tree').  A ={1, ..., 4} and B ={1, ..., 5}. Then p: {1, 2, 3} -&gt; {1, 3, 4} with 1-&gt;1, 2-&gt;3, 3-&gt;4 is a partial isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;, since {(1, 2), (2, 3)} becomes {(1, 3), (3, 4)}.  Notice that in case &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; contained e.g. (4, 1) additionally, p would not be a partial isomorphism.

* Let S ={&lt;} be defined over A ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and B ={1, 3, 5} the natural way. Then p with 2-&gt;3 and 4-&gt;5 defines a partial isomorphism.  Notice that e.g. &lt;math&gt;\exists_x( x&lt;4 \and 2&lt;x )&lt;/math&gt; holds on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\exists_x( x&lt;p(4) \and p(2)&lt;x )&lt;/math&gt; does not hold on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;. I.e. in general the validity of sentences with quantifiers is not preserved.  So in order to preserve this validity we need sth stronger than partial isomorphism.  That is mainly what the Ehrenfeucht-games will provide us with.

====Definition====
'''Partially isomorphic structures'''

Two structures can said to be partially isomorphic for a certain domain size of p, called n.  This can be done in a weak sense, i.e. there exists a n-ary partial isomorphism or in a strict sense, i.e. for every n-elementary subset of A it exists a partial isomprphism.  Latter will become important later.

==Quantifier Rank==

'''Definition''' : '''Quantifier Rank of a FO-Formula'''

Let φ be a FO formula. The quantifier rank of φ, written qr(φ), is defined as
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\varphi) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, if φ is atomic.
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\varphi_1 \land \varphi_2) = qr(\varphi_1 \lor \varphi_2) = max(qr(\varphi_1), qr(\varphi_2))&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\lnot \varphi) = qr(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\exists_x \varphi) = qr(\varphi) + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remarks'''
* We write FO[n] for the set of all first-order formulas φ with &lt;math&gt;qr(\varphi) \le n&lt;/math&gt;.
* Notice that in prenex normal form the Quantifier Rank of φ is exactly the number of quantifiers appearing in φ.

'''Examples'''

* The sentence &lt;math&gt;\forall_x ( \exists_y ((\lnot x = y) \land x R y ) ) \land ( \exists_y ((\lnot x = z) \land z R x ) ) &lt;/math&gt; has the Quantifier Rank 2.
* The sentence in prenex normal form &lt;math&gt;\forall_x\exists_y\exists_y ((\lnot x = y) \land x R y )  \land ( (\lnot x = z) \land z R x ) &lt;/math&gt; has the Quantifier Rank 3.  Notice that it is equivalent to the above.

==Types==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How To Grow A Volume With A New Disk==

Once you have installed your new disk then login to the media vault's web server and click the 'Disk Settings' tab.

Click 'Create New Volume'

[[Image:Hpmvp1.jpg | 1000px ]]

Fill out as per the following screen shot and then click 'Accept'

[[Image:Hpmvp2.jpg | 1000px ]]


The following dialog will be presented (you may have to wait 30 seconds). Click 'OK'.

[[Image:Hpmvp3.jpg | 1000px ]]

Wait until the following page is displayed. Make sure that 'Volume1' is selected and click 'Modify Volume'.

[[Image:Hpmvp4.jpg | 1000px ]]

You will be presented with the following screen. 
[[Image:Hpmvp5.jpg | 1000px ]]

Drag the diamond icon on the Disk1 measure and drag it all the way to the right and click 'Accept'.
[[Image:Hpmvp6.jpg | 1000px ]]

You will be presented with the following dialog box (below). Click 'OK'. After clicking 'OK' you will then see a lot of disk activity on the box. '''Under no circumstances should you click anywhere on the HP Media Vault web page during this time.''' (Disk activity can go quiet at this time for up to a minute but will resume again). Although the dialog box says 4 mins it seems to depend on what volume you are expanding. In this example the expansion was of a volume that already had 315 GB of data on it and the process took 40 minutes.

[[Image:Hpmvp7.jpg | 1000px ]]

When the resizing of the volume has taken place you will see this message (which only displays for about 5 seconds).

[[Image:Hpmvp8.jpg | 1000px ]]

Followed by this screen. Notice that the size of volume1 has increased with the newly allocated disk.

[[Image:Hpmvp9.jpg | 1000px ]]

Your resized volume is now ready to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome Editors! ==

This book is a Wikibook therefore you are free to edit as you wish but please respect the outline and style that is in use. The book currently features 15 units each with a specific aim with regards to the grammar and vocabulary that they should teach. Before you edit a particular unit please see the [[English/English for B2 Students/Aims|Aims]] page for details of the aim of each lesson. It is hoped that this Wikibook can include as much multimedia (songs, listening exercises, reading texts and games) as possible so any help with creating such resources would be much appreciated.

== Other pages to consult: ==

Also refer to the [[English/English_for_B2_Students/Introduction|Introduction]] page so you have an idea about what is expected and who this Wikibook is intended for.

Remember that this Wikibook is designed for B2 students.  These students usually have a firm foundation of English and are able to have conversations about most topics but they may still make many mistakes including basic mistakes.  Don't make the grammar too easy but at the same time don't assume that the student will already know everything.

== Format of Units in this book ==

# All ''units'' should begin with the '''title''' repeated (e.g. &quot;The World of English&quot;).
# The '''aim''' of the lesson in terms of grammar and vocabulary should be stated next.
# Most units then follow with a '''dialogue''' exposing some of the language, a '''reading text''' or some '''speaking questions''' about the unit topic.  Try to include multimedia resources like '''audio files''' where possible.
# The '''grammar''' of the lesson should be presented next.  Use a nice table like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{English/B2/Table|Speaking|Common Questions||2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and explain any exceptions or difficulties you think students might have.  An alternative is to let the students work out the grammar for themselves but remember to provide a link to the answers somewhere so they can check.
# I usually like to add some '''speaking questions''' next as it provides a nice break from the grammar which can erode the mind!  
# Don't forget to focus on the '''vocabulary''' of the lesson.  You can present it in a table or allow the students to identify the correct definitions for themselves.  See units already designed for some ideas.
# Every unit should end with at least 5 '''exercises''' testing the grammar or vocabulary of this lesson.  Don't forget to add the answers to the [[English/English for B2 Students/Answers|Answers]] page.
# Add a link to some kind of '''Grammar Reference''' also.  This could refer the students to the [[English/English in use]] Wikibook or another online grammar resource.  Students often like to find out more.
# The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{English/B2/Lessons}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template should go at the bottom of every unit so that students can easily navigate the Wikibook.  Also try to add some '''images''' to make the unit look a little more interesting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The electrons in an atom do not follow a fixed orbit like planets orbiting the sun.  Electrons are subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, which means their motion is very different to normal, life-sized objects. We describe their location within atoms in terms of three-dimensional &quot;clouds&quot; called orbitals. An orbital can contain a maximum of two electrons, spins paired.

It is important to note that electrons are not entirely confined within the atom. The orbitals shown below give the shapes of the regions that contain the electron 95% of the time.  However, the other 5% of the time, the electron is somewhere outside this region. An electron from an atom in your hand may temporarily be on the other side of the moon, but it is only very rarely there, so rarely in fact that we can ignore it for the purposes of understanding the behaviour of atoms.

== s orbitals ==
[[Image:Atomic-orbital-2s-3D-phaseless.png|150px]]

== p orbitals ==
There are three p orbitals in a p subshell.  They are labelled p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. The p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; orbital points along the x-axis, the p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; points along the y-axis and the p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; points along the z-axis. This means that the three p orbitals are all at 90° to each other (''perpendicular'' and ''orthogonal'' are two words you may see used to mean the same thing).

[[Image:Atomic-orbital-2px-3D-phaseless.png|150px]] [[Image:Atomic-orbital-2py-3D-phaseless.png|90px]] [[Image:Atomic-orbital-2pz-3D-phaseless.png|150px]]

== d orbitals ==
The d orbitals have slightly confusing names.  From left to right, they are: d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;.

Sometimes, particularly when discussing [[A-level_Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Complexes#Ligands split d orbitals|d orbital splitting in complexes]], d orbitals are arranged into two groups based on their symmetry. The  d&lt;sub&gt;z²&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals form a group called e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, while the d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals form a group called t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''First Task''''' of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] is to retrieve a golden egg from the nest of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]].

== Event Details ==

The initial briefing for the First Task is done immediately after the selection of the Champions, on 31 October. This briefing is very sketchy, as the intent of the Task is in part 'designed to test your daring.' To that end, the judge who is doing the briefing of the candidates, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]], states that they will not know what they will be facing until the date of the Task.

Shortly before the Task, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to come visit him, with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. With an invisible Harry in tow, Hagrid collects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]], the headmistress of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], and they walk around the edge of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] to a spot where they can see a large corral. In the corral are four [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]]. Harry watches as Hagrid talks with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] about what the dragons are for; apparently the Champions are expected to get past them or something. Charlie questions the wisdom of bringing Madame Maxime to see them; Hagrid brushes this off, saying that they are lovely, dragons.

Harry, having heard all he can stand, retreats; still invisible, he bumps into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Professor Karkaroff]], the headmaster of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], who is also prowling around for a look at the dragons.

Harry returns to the Gryffindor common room, for a scheduled meeting with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]; Sirius has more important news to impart, and doesn't get around to telling Harry what to do about the dragons until the very end of the conversation. Before he can complete his sentence, however, they are interrupted by the arrival of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Sirius vanishes.

As Harry and Ron are currently at odds, it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] who tries to help Harry find counter-dragon spells; but she will not allow him to skip classes while looking. 

Harry believes that all the champions now know about the dragons except [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], and this does not seem fair to him. He engineers an opportunity to get Cedric on his own, and tells him about the dragons. However, he is overheard by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], who sends Cedric off and steers Harry into his office. Harry expects to be told off or disqualified for cheating, but Moody tells him that cheating is almost a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament; then asks if Harry knows how he's going to get past the dragons. When Harry admits that he does not, Moody provides him with a pair of clues that tells Harry how to pass the dragon. Harry quickly enlists Hermione to teach him how to perform a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning spell]].

The Task takes place on November 24 and is held in a specially prepared clearing in the Forbidden Forest. Before it begins, the champions enter a tent to prepare and be briefed. This task is extremely difficult and dangerous: each champion is to retrieve a golden egg from a dragon. Each has their own dragon, chosen by pulling out a miniature dragon model from a purple bag held by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]. Each miniature dragon is marked with a number, indicating the order in which the champions are to be summoned to the task.

Before the Task actually starts, Ludo takes Harry aside and asks if he had a plan. Ludo seems to be offering assistance to Harry; Harry doesn't quite know what to make of this, Ludo is, after all, one of the five judges. Ludo is called away by the whistle sounding for the first contestant before Harry has much time to wonder about his behaviour.

The task unfolds as follows:

*Dragon # 1, Swedish Short-Snout (blue-gray) - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] (he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|transfigured]] a boulder into a Labrador dog, which diverted the attention of the dragon long enough to let him steal the egg)
*Dragon # 2, Common Welsh Green - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] (attempted to charm her dragon into a trance. This worked, but the dragon snored, and the resulting flame set her robes alight)
*Dragon # 3, Chinese Fireball (small) - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] (used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Conjunctivitus|Conjunctivitus Curse]] but the dragon thrashed about in a rage and damaged other eggs)
*Dragon # 4, Hungarian Horntail (the most dangerous) - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] (used Summoning Charm to call his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt]] and ride on it, tempting the dragon to rise away from the golden egg. When the dragon had reared, leaving the eggs unguarded, he quickly scooped up the egg and finished the task with the highest points)

Points were based on speed, skill, and avoiding damage to other dragon eggs&amp;mdash;Viktor lost points for this. At the end of this task, the points awarded were as follows:
*Harry Potter, 40 points;
*Viktor Krum, 40 points; 
*Cedric Diggory, 38 points;
*Fleur Delacour, unknown.

== Notable Consequences ==

The objective of the Task was to retrieve a golden egg from the dragons. After the Task has ended, Ludo Bagman informs the champions that the eggs can be opened, and each contains a clue that will be necessary for the Second Task. The Champions will be required to solve the riddle of the Egg before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], which will be taking place on 24 February. 

As is usual in the Triwizard Tournament, the Champions did risk injury or death in the course of this challenge. Apparently at least three of the four Champions received some injury: Cedric was burned on one side when the dragon decided it wanted him rather than the Transfigured dog, Fleur was burned when the dragon she had Charmed to sleep belched a little fire as it snored, and Harry was slashed by one of the spikes on his dragon's tail as it tried to attack him.

Harry's coming out of this task tied for first place with Krum somewhat changed the dynamic within the Champions as well. Before, they had tended to dismiss him – as Fleur had said initially, &quot;'E cannot compete. 'E is too young!&quot; After his showing in the first Task, they see him as a true contender and worthy of notice.

Before this Task, Harry and Ron had been estranged; Ron was convinced, despite Harry saying otherwise, that Harry had put his own name into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet]], and was upset that he hadn't told Ron how he had done it. Believing that Harry had put his own name in, Ron was also convinced that Harry was lying to him. In this Task, Harry is in so much evident and immediate danger that Ron suddenly changes his mind, accepting that someone who wanted Harry dead had actually put Harry's name in for the Tournament; by the time Harry's scores are posted, they are fast friends again.

Much of the school shared Ron's opinion, in fact, believing that Harry had managed to make himself the fourth Triwizard champion because he wanted the associated fame or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]]. Members of Slytherin house had, in fact, made a bit of an industry of taunting Harry about this. After this first Task, it was apparent that the life of a Champion would not be an easy one, and the animosity towards Harry from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses abated somewhat. Harry suspects that Cedric had instructed the other members of Hufflepuff house to lay off him because Harry had taken the time to tell Cedric about the dragons, but this is never confirmed.

== Analysis ==

The First Task clearly is meant as an indication of the caliber of magic that will be required to complete the entire Tournament, and similarly an indication of the danger that the Champions will face. As such, it clearly must be dangerous but, we believe, controllable. Hermione had earlier mentioned that an earlier Tournament had resulted in injuries to three of the judges from a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Cockatrice|cockatrice]] that had gotten free. Earlier, when the Trio were researching the possibility of an appeal for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], they had discovered that one of the few creatures that had avoided execution was a cockatrice, though they also found it was because nobody could execute it. This would indicate that the earlier iteration of the Tournament had become uncontrollably dangerous, possibly as the three schools, taking turns hosting the Tournament, vied with each other for ever more grandiose displays of magic. Dragons, though extremely dangerous, can be controlled, and although we don't see them, we have to assume that Charlie Weasley and his fellow dragon wranglers are just out of Harry's sight, prepared to rescue Harry should the need arise.

The reader does rather wonder why Harry bothers to face the dragon. He has been brought into this competition against his will, and he is not as prepared as any of the other Champions, all of whom are more advanced in their studies. It would have been simple enough for Harry to simply turn on his heel and walk out of the arena, saying that he had done the best he could do. However, against this we must mention that Harry has no small measure of pride, which was inflamed by Fleur's derisive comments on the night of the selection of the Champions, and feels that he must prove himself. It was mentioned elsewhere that Harry does not feel he merits the fame he received as The Boy Who Lived. His feeling of unworthiness has left him with a desire to prove himself, to show that, even though it was through no design of his that he defeated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], he is still wizard enough to deserve the spotlight that he unwillingly finds himself under. We are also privy to one of Harry's fantasies, of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang's]] admiration; though he clearly dismisses this himself, it is still bound to be a factor in his choosing to continue to challenge the Tasks.

Cedric discovers the clue in the Golden Egg that leads to the solution to the Second Task before Harry does. Having deciphered the clue, Cedric makes a point of passing a lead to the clue on to Harry just after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. Cedric does this because it is only fair – Harry told him about the dragons, it is only fair that he should return the favour.

In this task, we also see the beginnings of the attempts to have Harry win the Tournament. We see Mad-Eye Moody skillfully planting the idea of flying to capture the egg, and Ludo Bagman clumsily trying to assist Harry, and then blatantly giving him higher marks than any of the other judges. We will learn later that they each have their reasons to want Harry to win the Tournament, and of the two, Moody's motives are the more sinister. This is actually a nice piece of indirection on the part of the author. Bagman's attempts to influence the outcome of the tournament are so poorly executed that they take our attention away from Moody's more successful attempts. Moody has already made one attempt that will prove unsuccessful; in the first week of classes, Moody had given a book on magical Mediterranean water plants to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], in the expectation that Neville would provide information to Harry about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gillyweed|Gillyweed]], which is one way of completing the Second Task. When this fails, Moody will provide the same information via a different conduit.

It is, in fact, Moody's assistance in this first Task that provides Harry the impetus he needs to actually successfully enter the Tournament. The encouragement Moody provides, by suggesting a way Harry can use things he is good at to complete this Task, is sufficient to actually get Harry into the corral with the dragons, as it gives him some hope of getting out alive and with his adolescent pride intact.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As a part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], there is traditionally a dance at the hosting school. This dance, the '''''Yule Ball''''', is normally led off by the three Champions and their partners; in Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|fourth year]], of course, there are four champions, and thus four couples leading off the Ball. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has a dreadful time finding a date for the Ball. Once at the Ball, he overhears a significant conversation between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]], followed shortly by an important admission by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. At the end of the ball, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] gives Harry a clue to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]].

== Event Details ==

Shortly after his success in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is stunned by hearing about the Yule Ball from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. He is quite alarmed when told that, as one of the Champions, he is expected to find a dance partner, learn to dance, and lead off the whole ball. This looming dread is not at all lightened by the realization that nearly the entire school is planning to stay over Christmas, in order to attend the Ball – or, at least, all who are allowed to attend. The ball is restricted to those in fourth year and above, although younger students can attend as the guest of a fourth-year (or presumably later).

Harry immediately thinks of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] as a possible dance partner for the ball, but every time he finds her, she is traveling in a convoy of giggling girls; horribly embarrassed, he thinks that giggling should be outlawed. In hopes of actually being able to ask Cho, Harry turns down several invitations from other girls, possibly in part because he doesn't believe they can be serious. Finally, on the last day of classes, Harry takes Cho aside and asks her, only to find that she has already accepted an invitation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]]. Cho seems almost as disappointed as Harry at this turn of events, but that is cold comfort; handsome, capable, likable Cedric is in so many ways what Harry would like to be, and here he has even gotten the girl that Harry wanted.

Returning to the common room, Harry finds that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is in the same situation – in what he attributes to a fit of madness, Ron has asked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], and she has not even done him the dignity of turning him down, simply ignoring him. Harry takes the opportunity to mention that Fleur is part [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]], and had likely been using her inherited glamour to ensnare [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]]; Ron does not seem cheered by the possibility that he was simply caught by spillover magic. Harry and Ron ask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], only to find that they, too, have already agreed to go with someone else. In desperation, Harry asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]]. She accepts; Harry asks if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] would be willing to go with Ron, but Lavender already has a date. Parvati suggests that her sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Padma Patil|Padma]], would probably be willing to go with Ron.

The Yule Ball takes place on Christmas Day, between the First and Second Tasks of the Triwizard Tournament. It is a festive event featuring dancing, in this case to music provided by the Weird Sisters. Students dress in their best formal clothes. Males wear dress robes, which is probably why dress robes were on the supplies list this year; females wear gowns or other formal attire. While students should have partners for the ball, apparently not all do; Harry is pleased to see that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] do not seem to have partners. The four Champions enter the hall last: Cedric Diggory with Cho Chang, Fleur Delacour with Roger Davies, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] with Hermione, so prettily done up that Harry does not initially recognize her, and Harry with Parvati.

At dinner, Harry is surprised to find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]] is not present; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] is, and explains that he is filling in for Mr. Crouch, who is feeling ill. Once dinner is over, a dance floor is cleared, and Parvati guides Harry out onto the floor as the music starts up; the four Champions and their partners are quickly joined by classmates and teachers. At the end of the first dance, Harry chooses to leave the floor, much to Parvati's disgust; they go and join Ron and Padma, who apparently alone have sat out the first dance, and Padma and Parvati, deciding that they are unlikely to get much more dancing out of Ron and Harry, find other partners. Ron and Harry wander out into a rose garden that has been magically created outside the Entrance Hall, where they overhear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Professor Karkaroff]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] discussing something that is getting more and more distinct, and whether Karkaroff should run away. They then stumble upon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] deep in a private conversation; in the course of that conversation, Hagrid reveals that he is half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|giant]], and suggests that he believes Madame Maxime is also. Madame Maxime is affronted and departs in a huff. Hagrid then goes off to his hut, and Harry and Ron return inside to discuss this development.

== Notable Consequences ==

Up until this point, Harry and Cho's relationship has been unstated; there are indications that there is a very early romance between them, but for all we know it could be entirely in Harry's head. By choosing to ask Cho to the Ball, Harry is effectively declaring their relationship, and Cho's response is nicely crafted to indicate that she would be pleased at the prospect. Harry's being deterred by the gaggle of giggling girls in which Cho seems to move is all too realistic; one wonders, though, if his inability to separate her from them might indicate that he is not quite ready to progress to that firm a relationship.

At dinner, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] mentions finding a room that was full of chamber pots, and then never being able to find it again. This is the first mention of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], which Harry will find very useful in later books; it is because Dumbledore has mentioned it to him that Harry feels justified in using it for his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes, once he has been told how to find it.

The discussion we overhear between Karkaroff and Snape is, we find out later, an indication of the increasing power of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]; by now we know that Karkaroff was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], and we suspect that Snape was also. We have heard from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] that Karkaroff is in bad odour with the other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] for having named names in order to keep his own freedom. Ron and Harry do not know how Snape and Karkaroff got to be on a first-name basis. Harry has reason to believe that Voldemort is gaining power, and so may believe that Snape and Karkaroff were both Death Eaters, and are discussing Death Eater business. This is largely driven out of Harry and Ron's mind, however, by the scene between Hagrid and Madame Maxime that they inadvertently witness.

The scene between Hagrid and Madame Maxime is witnessed by another party as well. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], in her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form as a large beetle, is in earshot, and promptly writes a story about Hagrid, his tendency to keep truly dangerous and often proscribed creatures, and his half-Giant ancestry. It seems that this last item was something she needed to tie the story together, because she had the other components of the story long before this. As a result of this story, Hagrid goes into seclusion in his hut and tenders his resignation as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher. Professor Dumbledore refuses to accept his resignation, and after a week Hagrid returns to his teaching duties.

It is possible that Cho has mentioned to Cedric that Harry had invited her to the Yule Ball; it is certain that Cedric feels kindly disposed to Harry by the end of the evening, because he takes Harry aside, and gives him a very large hint towards deciphering the Golden Egg, which is the necessary clue to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]]. Cedric does this, he says, out of a sense of fairness; Harry after all had clued him in to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]].

Ron spends the first part of the Ball watching Hermione jealously as she dances with Viktor Krum. When she stops by Ron's table after the second dance, he accuses her angrily of &quot;consorting with the enemy&quot;; hot words are exchanged, and Hermione vanishes in the crowd. Ron is then very short with Krum, who until then had been a hero of his. After the ball, Harry steps into the Gryffindor common room, only to catch the end of a flaming row between Hermione and Ron. Hermione ends the argument by saying &quot;''Next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!''&quot;, and stalks off to the girl's dormitory. Ron has no idea what's going on; he quite obviously has not detected that his own feelings are, in fact, jealousy, though Hermione, and apparently Harry, can see Ron's true feelings quite plainly.

== Analysis ==

One of the strengths of the Potter series of books lies in its realistic portrayal of the characters. It would, perhaps, have been simpler for the author to have Harry be entirely focused on his quest, but that would significantly weaken the writing, as we would be less likely to care about a hero who cared about little outside his one main objective. The entire episode of the Yule Ball could have been seen as an attempt to inject romance arbitrarily into a piece of heroic fantasy, except that it is done in such a way as to tally with our expectations of the maturing Trio. Harry and Ron are fourteen, and Hermione is fifteen, as this episode unfolds, and it is the appropriate time for them to begin noticing the difference between boys and girls. It is all the more realistic that Ron, portrayed as the least sensitive of the three, does not recognize what his feelings mean.

The Yule Ball shares the characteristics of Muggle school formals, balls and proms.  While students are excited about these events, there is also a great deal of anxiety and stress to overcome.  Pressures include securing a partner and acquiring appropriate formal attire.  At Hogwarts like other secondary schools, teenage insecurities about peer approval, social skills and self-image are amplified with the Yule Ball. While readers may be as dismayed as Parvati and Padma that Harry dances only once and Ron not at all, this is entirely normal behaviour for boys of their age. We must remember that, despite all the adventures he has been having, Harry and Ron are only fourteen years of age, and their fear of looking foolish still overwhelms their desire to form relationships with the opposite sex.

It is never mentioned, but it is quite likely that, had Harry not been a Champion, the lower limit on age for attendees of the Ball would be fifth, or even sixth, year. The original plan had Champions being of age, 17 or older, so all the Champions would be sixth or seventh year, and it is likely that everyone younger would have been excluded. It is possible that Harry would have greatly preferred to have been excluded from the Ball; it certainly would have saved him the embarrassment he subjected himself to while trying to find a date.

It is worth drawing attention to events in the rose garden. Two events happen which are of interest to us and the students; there is the conversation between Snape and Karkaroff, and the conversation between Hagrid and Madame Maxime. The ordering of these two is important, in that this contributes to a deliberate misdirection on the part of the author. Clearly, to the story arc, Snape's discussion is the more important, bearing as it apparently does on Dark matters; however, Hagrid's revelation of his Giant background happens shortly after that. It is the latter that remains strongest in Harry's mind, and that is the one that Harry and Ron discuss, to the exclusion of the former, for the rest of the evening. If Harry and Ron had spent time considering the ramifications of Snape's conversation, it is possible that Harry could have linked that to Karkaroff's having been a Death Eater, and so determined something about Voldemort's progress.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We will revisit the Yule Ball in a later part of the story, albeit briefly. Shortly, in Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], we will see Snape commenting about how something is becoming more distinct. While we can suppose that this ties in to the discussion between Snape and Karkaroff in the Rose Garden, and their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 27|later discussion]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] classroom while Harry is cleaning up his armadillo bile, we can't be certain. In Snape's memories revealed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]], we learn that Snape made this comment as he and Dumbledore watched the students returning to the dormitories following the Yule Ball, and that it was regarding the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] on his and Karkaroff's forearms. At that time, Snape apparently told Dumbledore of Karkaroff's intent to run when Voldemort reappeared, and re-affirmed his own intent to stay with Dumbledore.

We will also learn later that Karkaroff does run when the Mark burns black with Voldemort's summons, and that Snape remains with Dumbledore even past Dumbledore's death. Karkaroff later turns up dead, in a shack with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] floating overhead.

Roger Davies will resurface also. Harry and Ron are quite insecure when it comes to girls, like most boys their age, and to a certain extent hero-worship those older and more confident boys who seem to have better luck with girls. The two boys who are mentioned as being &quot;all Harry would like to be&quot; are Roger Davies and Cedric Diggory. Later, possibly in an attempt to get some response from Harry regarding their future together, Cho will mention that Roger Davies had asked her out but that she had refused. It is because Harry sees Roger as being so far beyond him in terms of desirability, most likely, that this does not have the anticipated effect; Cho may have wanted to inspire mild jealousy, but instead only fueled Harry's insecurity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==First Order Logic (FO)==
{{wikipedia|First-order logic}}

We only give a very rough summary of FO here.  An inroduction can be found at FO.
====Syntax====
Syntax is 'just' about sequences of signs.
The '''alphabet''' of FO consists of:
* Variables &lt;math&gt;x_0, x_1, x_2, ...&lt;/math&gt;
* Logical Connectives: &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;
* Quantifiers: &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;
* Equality: &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;
* Parenthesis: ), (
* n-ary Relation symbols, for no or many n&gt;0, e.g. R(., .)
* Constant symbols (none or many)
The handling of parenthesis is done the 'usual' way and is not formally described further.

For a given set of symbols S, variables and constant symbols are said to be S-'''Terms'''.

S-'''Expressions''' are obtained by the multiple application of the following rules:
* &lt;math&gt;t_1 \equiv t_2&lt;/math&gt; is an expression
* &lt;math&gt;R t_1 ... t_n&lt;/math&gt; is an expression, for an n-ary relation symbol R
* &lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi, \varphi_1 \land \varphi_2&lt;/math&gt; are expressions
* &lt;math&gt;\exists_x \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is an expression
where &lt;math&gt;t_.&lt;/math&gt; is a term and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_.&lt;/math&gt; an expression.

So additional connectives for OR, IMPLICATION, EQUIVALENCE etc.  can be defined as well as the FOR ALL quantifier.

====Semantics====
Semantics adds the meaning to the language in three steps: 
*1st it defines what the logical symbols (connectives and quantifiers) mean (this always holds in FO), 
*2nd it maps relation symbols and constant symbols to actual relations and constants over a given set of entities (this is usually defined per subject, like Analysis or Statistics) and 
*3rd it maps free variables (not bound to a quantifier) to entities (usually done per Problem, like solving an equation).  

1st we assume the '''Logical Symbols''' &lt;math&gt;\neg, \land, ..., \exists&lt;/math&gt; to have the usual meaning.

2nd a S-'''Structure''' is a pair (''A'', ''a'') of
* a nonempty set ''A'', the Universe, and
* a mapping ''a'' from S, such that 
** each n-ary relation symbol is mapped to a n-ary relation on ''A'' and 
** each constant symbol is mapped to an element of ''A''

3rd an Interpretation is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak A, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; = (''A'', ''a'') is a S-Structure and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping from all free variables to an element of ''A''.

An Interpretation is said to be a '''Model''' of a set &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; of S-expressions (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \Phi&lt;/math&gt;) iff all of the following hold
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I(t_1) = \mathfrak I(t_1)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash t_1 \equiv t_2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R^n \mathfrak I(t_1), ..., \mathfrak I(t_n)&lt;/math&gt; , for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash R t_1 ... t_n&lt;/math&gt;
* Not &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt; , for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \neg \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \varphi_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \varphi_1)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \varphi_0 \land \varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;
* It exists an &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \varphi(a)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak I \vDash \exists_x \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Game==
{{wikipedia|game theory}}

A game is described by 
* its players (&gt;1), 
* its rules i.e. ''who'' plays ''when'' and ''what'' is allowed to do and
* its possible ends and payoffs.

More formal, it's a tuple (P, T, m, u) where 
* P (the Players) is a set, with |P| = n &gt; 1
* is a graph on a set of nodes that forms a taxonomy, i.e. a T is a tree with a dedicated root node.  The leafs called terminal nodes T all others decision nodes D.  This describes the possible move sequences. 
* m is a mapping from D to P, that says who is to move at what point.
* u is a set of mappings u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (one for each player i) from T to an ordered set U, that give the payoff for a player at each terminal node.

We assume here and in the following that every player has perfect information (so the above definition is incomplete), i.e. all moves of all players made so far, and we don't consider move by chance.  Common knowledge about the rules and players is assumed anyway.  The above is called the extensive form representation of a game.  Others like the normal form reptresentation make simplifying assumptions on this (e.g. about the information) and use the concept of strategy instead of single moves.

Notice that different moves can lead to the same 'position', i.e. a position can be represented more than once in a game-tree.  And, the same payoffs can have different meanings to different players.

==Isomorphism on Structures==
====Homomorphism====
====Isomorphism====

==Back and Forth Method==
Counting a set can get messy due to
* counting things in an other than the natural order
* counting elements multipe times
...
====Method====
Fix enumerations (without repetition) of the underlying sets:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
A &amp; = &amp; \{\, a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots \,\},  \\  \\
B &amp; = &amp; \{\, b_1, b_2, b_3, \dots \,\}.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we construct a one-to-one correspondence between ''A'' and ''B'' that is strictly increasing.  Initially no member of ''A'' is paired with any member of ''B''.

: '''(1)''' Let ''i'' be the smallest index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B''.  Let ''j'' be the smallest index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A'' '''and''' ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing.  Pair ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(2)''' Let ''j'' be the smallest index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A''.  Let ''i'' be the smallest index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B'' '''and''' ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing.  Pair ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(3)''' Go back to step '''(1)'''.

It still has to be checked that the choice required in step '''(1)''' and '''(2)''' can actually be made in accordance to the requirements. Using step '''(1)''' as an example:

If there are already ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' corresponding to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''B'' respectively such that  &lt;math&gt;a_p &lt; a_i &lt; a_q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_p &lt; b_q&lt;/math&gt;, we choose ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in between ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; using '''density'''.  Otherwise, we choose a suitable large or small element of ''B'' using the fact that ''B'' has '''neither a maximum nor a minimum'''.  Choices made in step '''(2)''' are dually possible.  Finally, the construction ends after countably many steps because ''A'' and ''B'' '''are countably infinite'''. Note that we had to use all the prerequisites.

If we iterated only step '''(1)''', rather than going back and forth, then the resulting pairing would fail to be bijective.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''Second Task''''' of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] is to rescue something dear  or important to the Champion which is being held by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] deep in Hogwarts' lake.

== Event Details ==

The golden egg, which the Champions had each retrieved from the dragons in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]], holds a clue for the '''Second Task'''. Opened, Harry's egg is empty, but emits a screeching sound that seems to remind [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] of someone being tortured. The champion must decipher the sound's meaning, then find a way to complete the task described in it. 

The correct way to decipher the egg is to open and listen to it underwater; the screechy sound is actually a song sung by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]], who have high, thin, and screechy voices, making the egg's song incomprehensible when listened to in air. Submerging the egg deepens the sound to where it can be understood. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] had tried all sorts of things to understand this clue, including, in a fit of pique, throwing it across the room; it was only the hint that he received from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], who told him to take a bath with the Egg, that allowed him to discover the secret. Though dismayed by the way Cedric's suggestion is couched, Harry eventually visits the Prefect's Bathroom, where he deciphers the clue in the Egg with some small assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]], who appears, to Harry's dismay, while Harry is in the bath.

According to the song in the Egg, Harry would have only one hour to rescue something dear to him that would be held deep beneath the lake at Hogwarts by the merpeople. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] spend pretty much all of their spare time, from the time Harry deciphered the egg, until the night before the Task, in the library looking for ways Harry could breathe underwater for an hour. When Hermione and Ron are called away, Harry continues his search, eventually falling asleep in the library. He is awakened by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], with only ten minutes to go before the Task. Dobby has overheard some teachers talking about the Task, and has brought Harry some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gillyweed|Gillyweed]], that will allow him to breathe underwater. Harry hopes that Dobby is correct, and runs off down to the lake shore. There, he is somewhat startled to find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] is once again filling in for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]].

On the signal, all four Champions enter the lake. The Gillyweed gives Harry gills and grows his hands and feet into flippers. Swimming under water, Harry is somewhat lost but aims downward, assuming that the Merpeople will be in the depths of the lake. In his journeys, he encounters Myrtle, who points him in the correct direction, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grindylow|grindylows]], who unsuccessfully attempt to hold him.

It turns out that the &quot;something dear&quot; for each of the champions was another person. This was why Hermione and Ron had left Harry alone in the library; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had brought them to her office so that they could be placed in an enchanted sleep and handed over to the Merpeople.

*'''People Rescued by the Champions''', and how the Champions planned to rescue them
**Gabrielle Delacour for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] (used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bubble-Head Charm|Bubble-Head Charm]])
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] (also used Bubble-Head Charm)
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] (used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gillyweed|gillyweed]], which transformed him by developing gills, and flippers in his feet and hands)
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] (used incomplete form of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]])

Fleur Delacour failed to finish the second task because she was attacked by the grindylows. Because Delacour failed to finish, she never retrieved her younger sister, Gabrielle. Harry, who reached the hostages first, possibly due to some assistance from Moaning Myrtle, was afraid that the song was literal truth, and that the hostages would not be returned if they were not rescued within the allotted hour. He attempted to save all of the hostages, and was prevented from doing so by the Merpeople. Cedric, and then Krum, arrive and retrieve their hostages, but when Fleur failed to show, Harry threatened the Merpeople with his wand, and retrieved Gabrielle in addition to Ron. Harry's choosing to try and save the other hostages earned him extra points from the judges for &quot;moral fiber.&quot; 

Final scores, out of 50, for this Task were assigned as follows:
*Fleur Delacour - 25 points
*Cedric Diggory - 47 points (he had started this Task with 38 points, ending it tied with Harry for first, with 85)
*Harry Potter - 45 points (he had started with 40 points, ending tied with Diggory for first with 85 points)
*Viktor Krum - 40 points (he had started with 40 points, ending in second place with 80)

== Notable Consequences ==

The Champion with the highest standing after the second task will be allowed to enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] maze first. Harry and Cedric, having the highest standings, enter the maze together before the other Champions.

Harry's decent showing and ethical behaviour in this Task lead the other Champions to believe that Harry is, in fact, a worthy contender. His remaining tied for first place would indicate that his showing in the First Task was not a fluke, and should result in his receiving more respect from the other Champions.

Fleur kissing Harry and Ron somewhat reinforces Ron's infatuation, and upsets Hermione. It is possible that this contributes to Krum's belief that Harry and Hermione are a couple; it is entirely possible that he believes it is Fleur kissing Harry that Hermione is scowling at, rather than her kissing Ron.

The fact that Hermione is the hostage that Krum is to rescue does rather point up that Krum has romantic intentions towards Hermione, and not just friendship. We can also see, by her reaction after the Challenge, that she does not share those feelings.

We see again how Harry's friendships act to save him from the situations he gets himself into. In the next book, he will protest that every time he has gotten into a sticky situation, it is only by means of help from his friends that he has been able to survive. This is true in this Task as well, where it is only the last-minute effort by Dobby that gives Harry any chance at this Task at all.

== Analysis ==

As we almost expect, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] once again clumsily tries to assist Harry in this task, asking if he has solved the riddle of the Egg when they meet at the Three Broomsticks before Christmas. Any help he could give is forestalled by the arrival of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]], and Ludo's immediate departure, followed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblins]]. Harry has no qualms about telling Ludo that he needs no help, although later when he says the same thing to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], he somehow feels that he is betraying Hagrid's faith.

While each task is designed to measure a champion's physical capabilities, it is also meant to test their magical ingenuity, problem-solving skills, and strategic abilities. Harry actually did little to prepare for the second challenge, eventually relying on others for help, although most likely so did the other champions. With some assistance from Professor Moody, Harry was resourceful in retrieving the dragon's egg in the first task, but he made few attempts to decipher its hidden meaning; a necessity for completing the second challenge. Cedric Diggory finally provides Harry a hint to solve it, but this only reveals that there is yet another step Harry must overcome. He again procrastinates to find a solution, and it is only because Dobby helps him minutes before the event begins that he is able to compete.

#Viktor's and Cedric's hostages are their respective love interests; Harry's is Ron; Fleur's is her younger sister. What does this tell us about the Champions?

Although we have no understanding of this as yet, once again Professor Moody has interfered to improve Harry's chances. In fact, Moody attempted interference twice, once without success. When Neville suffered a partial breakdown following the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class earlier in the year, Moody had given him a book about the properties of magical Mediterranean water plants. While Moody had assumed that Harry would ask Neville for help, and Neville would have been able to tell Harry about Gillyweed, that did not happen; Harry never asked Neville, instead relying on Ron and Hermione. When it appeared that Harry was not going to find that answer, Moody arranged to summon Dobby to the staff room, and then mentioned Gillyweed in conversation with Professor McGonagall. Dobby then, as expected, stole some Gillyweed from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s stores and presented it to Harry.

Ludo, of course, is still trying to improve Harry's chances of winning the Tournament because of his own bet with the Goblins. It is likely that the Goblins are keeping an eye on Ludo in order to protect their bet; they likely worry that he may try to make a run for things, or possibly try to throw the match, which in fact he is trying to do but is running up against Harry's sense of fair play. We have seen that Ludo earlier gave Harry 10 out of 10 on the First Task, and we can safely say that he will have done the same in the Second, although the scores are not broken out by judge. Given Harry's score of 45, and Karkaroff's opposition to Harry getting points for &quot;moral fiber&quot;, we must assume that at least one, and possibly three or four, of the judges gave Harry full marks. It's safe to assume that Ludo has again given Harry top marks to protect his investment.

We will learn that Neville's breakdown, and his reaction to the Merpeople song in the Egg, are actually related. Neville's parents, we will learn later in this book, were tortured to madness by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], possibly in Neville's presence, using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]. It is Moody's use of this curse in the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts class]] which triggers Neville's episode. We will learn also at the end of this book why Moody has particular reason to remember this.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''Third Task''''' of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] is to negotiate a maze that has been grown in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] pitch at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. At the center of the maze is the Triwizard Cup, and whoever touches the Cup first is the outright winner of the Tournament

== Event Details ==

Exactly one month before the Third Task, the four Champions are brought to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] pitch, where they receive a briefing on what the task is to be. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] are dismayed to discover that the pitch has been planted with hedges, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], a one-time professional Quidditch player, is quick to reassure them that it would be restored to pristine condition once the Task is finished. The Champions are informed that the object of the Task is to navigate the labyrinth, which would be seeded with various spells and creatures, and reach the Triwizard Cup, located in the center of the maze. The first Champion to touch the Cup would be the outright winner.

Immediately following this meeting, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] asks Harry for a private conversation, to Ludo's apparent dismay; we gather that Ludo had been about to offer Harry help once again. While Harry and Krum are speaking, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]], apparently having some mental issues, appears out of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. While Harry runs to the school to get [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] to help him, Crouch disappears, leaving Krum [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]], summoned to the scene, accuses Dumbledore of interfering with his Champion, but retreats after a forceful response from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. Presumably, at this point the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] checks Mr. Crouch's house and finds it empty. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]], who had been filling in for Mr. Crouch, is chastised for not being aware that his boss was in such dire shape, and is replaced as a judge for the Third Task by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], the Minister for Magic. 

The Third Task takes place &quot;at dusk on the 24th of June.&quot; The hedges have grown to more than twice head height, and the maze is now stocked with dangerous creatures by Hagrid and the Ministry. The order in which the Champions are sent into the maze depends on their previous standings in the tournament, with the highest-scoring Champion entering first. Harry and Cedric, tied for first after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], enter the maze at the same time. Viktor Krum, with the next-highest score, enters five minutes after them, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] enters last.

Creatures that Harry encountered included [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Blast-Ended Skrewts]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|giant spiders]]. Harry also encountered a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]], which turned out to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]], and an anti-gravity mist. Harry's path to the maze's center was protected by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sphinx|Sphinx]] with a riddle to answer. The Champion, encountering the Sphinx, could choose to try and solve the riddle; if they chose not to attempt it, they could continue to proceed towards the center via an alternate route, if there was one. If they attempted the riddle, and answered wrong, they would be killed&amp;mdash;or at least eliminated from the competition. Harry chose to answer the riddle, and answered it correctly.

While within the maze, Harry hears Fleur scream, but did not encounter her, so we do not know if she was incapacitated at that point. He also heard someone performing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|the Cruciatus curse]]; burning a hole through the hedge, he was able to get into the next pathway, where he discovered Krum jinxing Cedric. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] Krum, and sent up red sparks to indicate that he was out of the contest, before he and Cedric went their separate ways. In the end, Harry and Cedric were both within sight of the Cup, with Cedric in the lead; Harry called his attention to a giant spider coming up behind him, and the two of them joined forces to disable it, though Harry's leg was injured in the process. Cedric then decided that the only thing to do was to let Harry take the Cup; Harry counter-offered that they should both take it at the same time, and Cedric accepted.

== Notable Consequences ==

As the Triwizard Cup has been made into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]], it carries Cedric and Harry to the graveyard in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]], where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] was waiting with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]]. The major consequences, then, are the death of Cedric and the return of Voldemort.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], despite being a Judge in the Tournament, has been taking bets on Harry's winning, in order to recover from a series of bad bets he had made with a group of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblins]]. His finances would have been completely resolved if Harry had won the Tournament outright. The goblins, however, held that as Harry and Cedric had both touched the Cup at the same instant, it was not an outright win for Harry but a draw. Bagman, being unable to pay his gambling debts, flees. Later negotiations with the Goblins are likely to be hindered by this; they no doubt feel that, as Bagman is a Ministry representative, the Ministry of Magic should repay Bagman's debts, and may be less willing to deal with Ministry wizards, having been so badly short-changed by a senior Ministry official.

As joint winner of the Tournament, Harry is entitled to half of the Tournament prize of a thousand [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]]; as Cedric has died, however, the entire prize has been deemed his. He doesn't feel he has any right to this, because it was his efforts to win the Tournament that resulted in Cedric's death. He tries to give the entire prize to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Cedric's father]], but is rebuffed. In the end, he gives it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], for use in setting up their joke shop, with the sole condition that they use some of the money to buy Ron some proper dress robes. The products of the joke shop are likely to be of use in later books, as Fred and George are quite able and innovative wizards.

== Analysis ==

The attentive reader will wonder about two points in this Task. First, when we first see the Maze, the hedges are only knee-high. We are told that cheating is quite often a significant part of the Tournament, and it would be a very simple matter indeed for one of the Champions to visit the Quidditch stands and, with a full view of the maze, determine the correct path to the center before the hedges reach their full, and confusing, height. Yet we do not hear that any of the Champions have done this. Harry's use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Point Me|Four Point Spell]] would, of course, assist him, in that he would be able to retain his orientation no matter how many times he got turned around in the maze, but is quite insufficient for finding the center, as Harry would have little idea where he was relative to the center of the maze, only the direction that was North.

Secondly, one gathers that to the audience, this Task would be very dull to watch, as the four Champions would vanish into the Maze over the course of a few minutes, and then apart from screams, or occasional showers of wand sparks or flashes, nothing would happen until the victor appeared outside the Maze. One wonders also what the four Marshals are expected to be able to do, particularly as one of them, Hagrid, is believed to not have any significant magical ability. It is possible that the Maze is charmed to be somehow transparent to the watchers, so that they can see what the Champions are doing within it, but that seems unlikely, as there is no notice when the Trophy, acting as a Portkey, removes Harry and Cedric from the maze and deposits them four hundred miles away. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], of course, is able to watch by means of his magical eye, but he has ulterior motives; we suspect he arranged to be made a Marshal, if he was not automatically put in that position because of his eye.

Looking at this Task, we feel, as Harry does at the time, that things are far too easy for him. With his use of the Four-Point-Spell, he is able to navigate the maze easily enough; the only obstacles he encounters are the anti-gravity spell, one of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts, a Boggart, the Sphinx, a giant spider, and Viktor Krum who he surprises in the act of using the Cruciatus curse on Cedric. Additionally, the Boggart, in disguise as a Dementor, is uncharacteristically clumsy; Harry realizes it is a Boggart when it trips over the hem of its own robe. This is actually a jarring moment for the attentive reader: a Boggart would never do anything to inspire laughter, which could destroy it, unless forced by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus charm]]. It turns out later that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] has been clearing obstacles away for him from outside the maze. It is possible that the Boggart's behaviour is because of Barty's intervention, but this is never confirmed. Barty does know about the Triwizard Cup being a Portkey, as it was he who created it, and is attempting to ensure that Harry reaches it first.

We should also note that Barty is also intervening to hamper or remove the other contestants. Harry seems to believe that Krum is under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] when he is cursing Cedric, a point which is later partially confirmed by Barty's comments. We never do find out what happened to Fleur, but it is likely that Krum, under the same compulsion, disabled her as well. Barty, in the best Death Eater tradition, is trying to assure Harry's victory in the Task by eliminating his competition. Harry's disabling of Krum somewhat cripples Barty's efforts, as Cedric remains active, and this leaves Barty with no active participation inside the Maze.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The appearance and subsequent disappearance of Bartemius Crouch are mentioned in passing, but have little to do with the Third Task directly. The one effect on the Tournament of Mr. Crouch's appearance is the removal of Percy as judge. This means that the Minister of Magic is on the scene at the conclusion of the Third Task, and so is able to be present to dismiss Harry's &quot;story&quot; about the return of Voldemort without being summoned. As we mention in the article on the Cemetery Duel, Fudge's immediate denial of the duel and Voldemort's return, with the associated &quot;spinning&quot; of Cedric's death as nothing more than a tragic accident, is the set-up for ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', with its whole-sale year-long denigration of both Harry and Dumbledore in an attempt to de-emphasize their story. The understanding we gain of Fudge through the resulting attempt to save his power would be diluted if we had to wait for him to be summoned to the school before we saw that response.

We should also mention what we eventually understand about Crouch's disappearance. Crouch has escaped Peter Pettigrew's use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] and is seeking Dumbledore. In his travels through the Forbidden Forest, Crouch is tracked by his son Barty Jr., making use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] which Professor Moody has borrowed from Harry. Barty Stuns Krum and kills Bartemius, then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfigures]] the body into a bone, which he buries. We believe that he may have buried the bone in the patch of earth which Hagrid had earlier disturbed for his lesson on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Niffler|Nifflers]], but this is not confirmed. The nature of those who would follow Voldemort here is highlighted by Barty's murder of his own father, though we will accept that Barty is an unusual case; he is portrayed as being mentally unbalanced, as is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], another member of the group who were trying to bring Voldemort back in the days immediately after his first defeat.

Following this task, Harry is thrown into the rapid-fire completion of the story, with the return of Voldemort, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|duel in the Cemetery]], Barty Crouch's unmasking, and the interrogation by Dumbledore of both Barty and Harry. We will note in passing that the disclosure, by Barty, that he had been helping Harry win the Tournament was probably meant to affect Harry's self-esteem; learning that it was not through his own efforts that the Tournament had fallen to him was likely a stratagem by Barty to further weaken Harry's ability to fight back. Harry, though, already knows that the effort was not all his, but was shared with many of his friends, so this revelation has little immediate effect.

It is interesting to note how Harry refuses the Triwizard prize. He feels that this money was won through the machinations of Barty and with the loss of Cedric's life, and he does not want any part of it. The Twins, however, seem quite willing to accept it. Perhaps, not having had Harry's direct involvement in the Tournament, they do not feel there is any stigma on the money.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This sounds similar to my recipe (I lived in Schwaebisch Gmuend for two years), as noted, without the tomato paste or honey. Also, I don't recall ever having had sausages in this, but why not? I use salt pork, as this is what seems to be the closest thing (to Bauchfleisch--smoked pork belly) readily available in the U.S., and I don't use a carrot or garlic; instead I chop up some celery. Sometimes I use a potato (for thickening), and sometimes not, but usually not as many as suggested here. The vinegar is, indeed, essential!

The really important thing is the roux-based sauce. Most recipes (including this one) don't tell you that you have to cook the flour in the fat (for a brown roux) very carefully so as not to burn it, and that this may take a half-hour to forty-five minutes. If you don't do this, your sauce will be bitter. This is especially tricky if you use the butter, as suggested; you might have better luck with oil or pork fat (I use the latter). These aren't as easily burned. If done properly, your roux-based sauce should be a nice, thick gravy, and you may not need the potatoes.

Greetings from Virginia!
:Wanted to point out that I personally have only heard of it with Bauchfleisch(as mentioned similar to salt pork) AND Saitenwurst(a type of sausage; can't get it in the US as far as I have seen; closest thing is hotdogs with natural casing, but they are a lot different), but I think it is a regional thing, what you put in it.</text>

The task of learning a language is one which we all have to tackle sooner or later. It might be at school, where foreign languages are usually compulsory subjects. It might be in our adult lives, where bilingual workers have an advantage in the job market and where people frequently take holidays abroad. It might even be for none of those reasons —rumour has it that there are some people out there learning a language voluntarily!

In the opinion of most people, learning a new language is problematic. The received wisdom is that all languages are difficult to learn —even the relatively simple ones— and that serious progress can only be made after tedious hours of classes, homework, record cards, vocab trainers and boring monolingual dictionaries. Some people might suspect that even hard work is not enough, and that only those of us with the right DNA will have success.

So much for the 'irrefutable facts'. Now we will attempt the impossible; not only by arguing the converse, but by proving that black is white. I’m speaking in the plural because everyone should feel welcome to help the worlds language learners out of their present dilemma.

Making child’s play out of learning isn’t such a far-fetched idea. In fact, it has been attempted a hundred times before. This approach has its origins in the observation that children learn their mother tongue through no fault of their own. Some people even learn multiple mother tongues; children whose parents speak different languages often become fluent in both. Furthermore we note that a feeling for a language develops automatically during a stay among native speakers.

We want to synthesize the causes of trouble-free learning so that a language can be spoken fluently and without an accent like in the conditions mentioned above. The end-product will be language courses for people who are suspicious of language courses.
 
The method will be formulated collectively. This assures a feedback channel from the learner to the textbook, allowing practical experience to help improve it. In addition, disagreements need not lead to partition, but in fact an enhancement of our project.
 
The following chapter—entitled “The Method”—is devoted to a simple way of becoming a linguistic mastermind. Its content is open to discussion. On no account could it be the last word on the subject.

    <title>English as an Additional Language/Articles and Adjectives</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Next up we will learn two very important things: articles and adjectives.  Both articles and adjectives typically occur before the noun they modify, with articles occurring before adjectives.

==Articles==

Like other languages, English has a definite and an indefinite article.  Unlike most Romance languages, English has no gender of nouns and so the articles don't change at all. 

* Definite article (used when the noun or nouns are already known):
** '''The'''
* Indefinite article (used when the noun or nouns is not already known):
** For singular nouns: '''a'''
** For singular nouns beginning in a vowel or a silent &quot;h:&quot; '''an'''  Note that often &quot;a&quot; is used in front of vowels for some words; you will have to learn the exceptions individually.
** For plural nouns, the closest thing to an article would be '''some.'''

==Adjectives==

Remember that an adjective describes a noun.  In English, adjectives are always placed before the noun, for example:

* The '''red''' apple.
* A '''soft''' sheep.
* An '''angry''' dragon.
* The '''silly''' boys.
* Some '''hard''' rocks.

Also, English adjectives do NOT agree with number or gender:

* The '''red''' apples, NOT The '''reds''' apples
* Some '''tall''' women, NOT Some '''talles''' women

The exception, however is the adjective &quot;blond&quot;, which agrees with gender in writing:  
* The '''blond''' boy, but;
* The blond''e'' girl.

This is not strictly observed, however.  Either &quot;blond&quot; or &quot;blonde&quot; is acceptable, and you are unlikely to be noticed using the feminine form for a male noun or vice versa.

===[[Programming:TI-Basic]]===
Hello K428.  I have seen you working on [[Programming:TI-Basic]] and was wondering whether you have interest in helping out with the book, or if you were merely fixing grammatical errors ''and'' whether or not you are still active. --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 16:47, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

Well then I'll try to have some details on what I'm exactly doing on the [[TI-Basic 84 Programming]] page or talk page.  I'm trying to convert the current Programming TI-Basic to an orginized book - currently it uses different styles to do the same things on different pages and there needs to be more information on certain things.  Hope to see you on!</text>
