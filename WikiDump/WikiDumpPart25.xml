      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating Block images ==

I see that you are going through the effort of having to create a whole bunch of images for this little project you are working on.

I have a suggestion:  Why don't you try to use the HTML tables instead to create this content.

For example:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|}

was created using the following table instructions

&lt;pre&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can obviously be extended, and you can also change the colors.  I hope this would be useful to you.  More information about creating tables can be found at [[meta:Help:Table]].  I think this would save you a bunch of time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)



Good idea.

== Overview ==

'''''Obliviate''''' is the verbal component of the Memory Charm, a spell which allows the erasure or modification of memory.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

First seen when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] attempted to use it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], this spell, when done correctly, apparently allows a substantial amount of control over the subject's memories. We see it used a number of times through the series. The most prominent times are:

* as mentioned above, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], when Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to cast it on Ron and Harry so as to allow him to claim to have defeated the Monster in the Chamber. In this case, he is using a broken wand, which backfires; as a result, afterwards he is barely able to remember his own name.
* in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], when the Muggle keeper of the campground has his memory changed so that he forgets the odd magical things that he has seen the occupants of his campground doing.
* in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] casts it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]] so that she forgets that there were previous meetings of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]].
* in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] casts this spell on a pair of Death Eaters and an innocent waitress so that they will not recall having seen Harry.  She [[Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Deathly_Hallows/Chapter_21|later]] uses it against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] to make him forget the presence of Ron Weasley.

Like so many spells, a large part of the effect of this spell very likely depends on what the caster is thinking at the time the spell is cast. Presumably the caster must hold in their mind a representation of the memories needed to be changed, along with what the memories should be changed to.

== Analysis ==

Apparently, this spell is most often used to clean up any 'spillage' in front of Muggles. The International Statute of Wizardry is specifically designed to try and keep the Muggles unaware of the Wizarding world, so this spell is apparently reasonably often used on Muggles to keep them unaware of what the wizards have been doing.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# Is there a way to reverse the effect of this spell?

== Naming policy==
You might want to read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. Using slash convention has cerain benefits to your book:
* table of contents is simplier: if you write &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Introduction/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[German Tax Law]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; page, you will get link to &lt;tt&gt;German Tax Law/Introduction&lt;/tt&gt;
* on &lt;tt&gt;German Tax Law/Introduction&lt;/tt&gt; page our software will automatically generate link to main book page, &lt;tt&gt;German Tax Law&lt;/tt&gt;
* see [[Chess]], our [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]] for an example of use of slash convention

The English word ''algol'' comes from Arabic al ghûl. The Arabian ghoul is a desert-dwelling, shape-shifting demon that robs graves and feeds on the dead. Ghouls lure travelers into the desert wastes to devour them.  The star Beta Persei, commonly known as Algol, is named after this creature.  All things considered, an appropriate name for a progamming language.

== Overview ==

'''Professor Quirinus Quirrell''' taught [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|first year]]. His class was held on the third floor of the castle, right in the Great Foyer near the Gryffindor tower. 

Quirrell's wand is alder and unicorn hair. He is a Half-blood, and his birthday is 26 September. As a Hogwarts student, he was sorted into Ravenclaw. Quirrell never married or had children.

=== Notes on his Name ===

Professor Quirrell is never given a first name in the books, in the film, or in the video game. He does appear in two other places:

* A Wizards of the Coast trading card game based on the series included a card of Quirrell with the first name Quirinus. The Harry Potter Lexicon site states, however, that [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/help/tcg.html &quot;these cards are not canon&quot;]

* Master Foods produced a line of Chocolate Frog treats with collectable Famous Wizards cards; Quirrel being given the first name Slatero. J. K. Rowling states [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=96 that she wrote the information on those cards].

J. K. Rowling has confirmed, in ''Pottermore'', that Quirrell's first name is, indeed, Quirinus.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

A very timid person, Professor Quirrell first appears in the Leaky Cauldron, where he is pleased to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] comments at the time that he always seems nervous, ever since he took a year's holiday and met up with something he had been teaching about.

At the Arrival Feast, Harry notes that Quirrell looks rather odd, wearing a large purple turban on his head. It is while Professor Quirrell is speaking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] that Harry first feels the searing pain in his scar that becomes his companion, on and off, for the nearly all the seven years in this series.

Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] get into trouble with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] on the very first day of classes, when they are found trying to get through a locked door, which turns out to be the door to the forbidden third floor corridor. They are saved from being locked in the dungeons by Professor Quirrell, who happens to be passing by.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], Professor Quirrell says that his strange purple turban was a gift from an African prince for dealing with a troublesome zombie. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]] asked excitedly how he had fought the zombie, Quirrell turned all pink and started talking about the weather. (Note: this is the only mention of &quot;zombies&quot; in the series, and thus is highly suspect. The magical construct most closely allied to the Muggle concept of zombies is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferius]].) There is also a strange smell of garlic that hangs about the classroom; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Weasley twins]] insist that it is because Quirrell has stuffed his turban full of garlic to ward off [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Vampire|vampires]].

We don't hear much about his teaching, except that it is not as interesting as Harry and the rest of his class had expected; we do find out that he is concealing something, and that he and Professor Snape may both be looking for something, possibly the mysterious little package that Hagrid removed from Gringotts. 

He bursts into the Hallowe'en feast warning that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|troll]] is in the dungeons; Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] defeat it and save [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], thus bonding the three.

At the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] match of the year, against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]], Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] is jinxed and tries to buck him off. Hermione and Ron believe Snape is casting the jinx. In her haste to reach Snape and set his robes on fire to break his concentration, Hermione knocks over Quirrell.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|The Weasley twins]] charmed several snowballs to bounce off the back of Profesor Quirrell's turban, in the snowfall during Christmas break.

Harry overhears Quirrell arguing with Snape about where his loyalties lie, and later hears him arguing with someone else about something he does not want to do.

At the conclusion, Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass through a series of chambers to find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. One chamber contains a Troll, who fortunately has been knocked out. Harry alone reaches the final chamber, where he finds Quirrell. Quirrell boasts about his skill with trolls, admitting that he let the one troll into the school at Hallowe'en, and that it was his troll that Harry passed. He also says that Snape had been useful as misdirection, &quot;flapping about like a great bat.&quot; Quirrell has been trying to kill Harry all year; Quirrell also jinxed Harry's broom during the Quidditch match against Slytherin, and Snape was attempting to counter the jinx. Quirrell's turban actually conceals [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] face that is attached to Quirrell's head, and Voldemort has been controlling Quirrell all year. Ordered to kill Harry, Quirrell is unable to touch him without getting burned; when Quirrell is preparing a killing curse, Harry grabs his face, causing him so much pain that he is disabled. Harry is also in much pain from his scar, triggered by Voldemort's nearness, and it causes him to pass out.

It is uncertain whether Quirrell actually dies here; it is suggested that he does, but while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] does explain much of what happened, he never actually states that Quirrell is dead.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Expounding to the Death Eaters as to what had occurred while he was disembodied, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] describes his stay on the back of Quirrell's head. He mentions that &quot;The servant died when I left his body&quot;. Though Voldemort never names Quirrell, referring to him always as his &quot;servant&quot;, context makes it certain that this refers to Quirrell.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Before the school year starts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discuss the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. While running down the list of Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers Ron and Harry have known, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]] mention &quot;one died,&quot; which could only be Quirrell.

In her first Defence Against the Dark Arts class of the year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] states that Quirrell was the only Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher that was up to standards for the Ministry. Harry gets into trouble for pointing out that he had Voldemort stuck to the back of his head.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

To convince [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] that Hogwarts is safe from Death Eaters, Harry tells him that Professor Quirrell is the only teacher who has died at Hogwarts. (This is not strictly true, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] clearly died at the school, though as it was of natural causes it likely would not concern Slughorn either way. It is true that Quirrell's death is the only one Harry knows of that could be attributed to Voldemort or his organization.)

== Strengths ==

Rather than magical ability, Quirrell's greatest strength was probably his intelligence, evidenced by his having been sorted into Ravenclaw House at Hogwarts, home to more intellectual students. Although timid in nature, he apparently had an adventurous spirit, traveling to many foreign countries whenever he could. 

Quirrell, during the course of the first book, had been carrying what remained of Lord Voldemort on the back of his head. As such, he could partially utilize Voldemort's powers: for instance, Voldemort being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimens]], could inspect other wizards' minds and communicate what he found to Quirrell.

== Weaknesses ==

Quirrell possessed an extremely timid and nervous disposition. And though intelligent, his magical powers may have been rather ordinary. This may all have have contributed to his becoming susceptible to Lord Voldemort's powers, resulting in the disembodied Dark Lord riding on the back of Quirrell's head while he attempted to resurrect his own physical body. As a result, Quirrell had to bow to Voldemort's commands, whatever they were, and was subject to any punishment Voldemort chose to mete out. As he was a relatively weak-willed wizard, Quirrell attempted to attain distinction by attaching himself to a powerful being, though that power instead latched itself onto him.

Quirrell was never seen performing magic, so it is uncertain how powerful a wizard he actually was. However, he was apparently able to control [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|Trolls]], and most likely had been able to before his encounter with Voldemort, as he seems proud of that ability.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

The closest relationship Quirrell appears to have had was the one with Lord Voldemort after being controlled by him. Quirrell was basically Voldemort's slave, doing his bidding without question. To help deflect suspicion from himself, Quirrell adopted a stammering, rather bumbling pose. He admits that Snape's fluttering about like a huge black bat and acting suspiciously was actually useful to him, allowing Quirrell to carry out Voldemort's commands while others were focused on Snape. Quirrell and Snape seem competitive with one another, and as Snape grew more suspicious about Quirrell's behavior, they seem to have been arguing frequently.

Though he was likely always shy and rather aloof, Quirrell's increasingly quirky manner and sudden stammering seems to have distanced others from him, while it also aroused Snape's distrust. It appears Quirrell never had any close relationships with the other teachers or students at Hogwarts.

== Analysis ==

Having been a Ravenclaw, Quirrell was obviously quite intelligent, but he appears to have been a rather ordinary wizard whose knowledge about magic and defensive arts may have been more academic than applied. Although Quirrell was commandeered by Voldemort, his lackluster distinction in life may have made him a somewhat cooperative accomplice, seeing this as an opportunity to obtain some significance and power. Unfortunately, he misjudged Voldemort's true intentions, failing to see that the Dark Lord considered him as little more than a disposable lackey. This ultimately cost Quirrell his life. 

According to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], speaking in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching post is apparently jinxed. Ever since Voldemort had been declined the job many years before, no teacher has lasted more than one year in that post. One question that has been raised is, given that jinx, how could Quirrell have remained in that post for more than a year? According to the author, he had not. In an interview,&lt;!-- reference needed --&gt; Rowling stated that Quirrell had requested a transfer to that post, and had been studying the source material so he could teach it, when he encountered Voldemort in Albania.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Likely you've never met another stutterer. You've never seen a book about stuttering in a bookstore. You may be the first stutterer that your speech-language pathologist has met. You might feel that you're the only person in the world with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your speech-language pathologist printed a webpage for you with the time and place of stuttering support group. You put it off the first month, but this month you drive there. You drive by the house. You see a group of people in the living room. You sit in your car, not sure if you have the courage to walk into the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's back up to how you find a stuttering support group. The [http://www.nsastutter.org/ National Stuttering Association](http://www.nsastutter.org/) (800 364-1677) has more than 70 local support groups across the United States. Many stutterers say that the annual NSA convention is the best experience of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speak Easy International has stuttering support groups in the New York-New Jersey area. Call Bob Gathman, at (201) 262-0895.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [http://www.friendswhostutter.org/ National Association of Young People Who Stutter](http://www.friendswhostutter.org/) (866 866-8335) has support groups for children and teenagers who stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many speech clinics have their own stuttering support groups. These are often for practicing therapy. Practicing in a group is better than practicing alone because we learn best by seeing other people make mistakes and then improving. In contrast, seeing a speech-language pathologist (who likely doesn't stutter) perfectly executing a speech motor skill can make you feel like she has a gift you'll never have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're outside the United States, find a stuttering support organization in your country by visiting the [http://www.stutterisa.org International Stuttering Association] (http://www.stutterisa.org) website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the online support groups. [http://groups.yahoo.com/ Yahoo Groups] lists more than seventy stuttering e-mail lists, the most prominent and largest of these is [http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/stutteringchat Stuttering Chat], which has over 3000 members. The Usenet discussion group is [news:alt.support.stuttering alt.support.stuttering].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online support groups tend to be a few individuals who do 90% of the chatting, and hundreds of people who don't write anything. I remember when one individual used several e-mail addresses and fake names to have long arguments with himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Benefits of Support Groups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A support group will help you learn what works for other people. You'll get feedback on what you're doing. A group of people will generate new ideas that no individual would have thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a support group, you'll find that you've solved problems that other people face. Other people may have solved problems you face. Stuttering will no longer seem like one big problem, but rather will become a set of small problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A support group improves your emotional state. Hearing other people's experiences improves your perspective. Your setbacks don't seem so bad. Sharing positive experiences makes everyone in the group feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you feel frustrated or depressed, you have no idea what to do. Talking to individuals who've been in the same situation will help you see that you have choices (see the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Personal Construct Therapy|Personal Construct Therapy]]).&lt;/p&gt;

===Support Group Activities===

&lt;h4&gt;Talking About Your Stuttering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mild stutterers may be able to successfully hide stuttering, but listeners figure out that they're hiding something. Listeners may not know what the stutterer is hiding, but he'll come across as &amp;quot;phony&amp;quot; or dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listeners have a different message for severe stutterers. Severe stuttering disturbs listeners. They don't understand stuttering. They want to know if there's anything they can do to help you. But they're too polite to ask you about your disability. They want you to educate them. They don't want the proverbial &amp;quot;elephant in the living room&amp;quot; that no one will talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Disability Hierarchy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The least respected disabilities are non-physical and non-visible. Stutterers look normal, until we talk. Listeners feel shock seeing you go from normal behavior one moment to head jerks, facial spasms, stuck in repeating dysfluencies the next moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can move up the disability hierarchy. You can change your stuttering into a visible, non-physical disability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tell people that you stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, hiding your stuttering throws away the respect and support that people would otherwise give you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just about everything these days has a computer of some sorts in it. Your VCR, your car and even your washing machine or toaster may have a microcontroller or microcomputer in it to control it. These computer based systems are often referred to as Embedded Systems, because they have a computer embedded within something.
Programming embedded systems requires a different set of skills from standard PC programming, because you need to know a bit about the hardware (electronics and mechanical systems) that your program is running on or controlling. You often have to be very aware of what resources (such as memory, speed etc.) your program can use.
A large percentage of this work is done in C, using an operating system, but some requires assembly language. The subset named &quot;firmware&quot; will also include programming FPGA devices (Field Programmamble Gate Array).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The earliest versions of the Forth Programming Language (around 1970) ran on primitive minicomputers with no other OS or executive.  Systems at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's 11-meter radio telescope near Tucson, AZ, controlled precise movements of the telescope and dome as well as performing concurrent data acquisition and supporting analysis on a graphics terminal.

Mass storage (used for both program source and data) resided on 7- or 9-track magnetic tape, soon replaced by a drum and later by disks.  Mass storage was addressed in &quot;blocks&quot; (typically 1024 bytes), and a block number was a function of its physical location on the media.  This was an extremely simple and reliable approach.  The entire system, including drivers for disk and terminal, command line interpreter, resident compiler and assembler, multitasker, and applications such as control of the telescope, was so small it could run without overlays in under 32K bytes of memory.

Because of Forth's unique ability to run efficiently in such a resource-constrained environment, it has always been most popular in embedded systems, particularly hand-held or battery-powered devices such as the package-tracking devices used by FedEx Corporation.  It has also been used in numerous [http://forth.gsfc.nasa.gov/ space applications] by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasa NASA] and others.

Some companies, such as [http://www.newmicros.com/ New Micros, Inc.] sell inexpensive microprocessor boards with Forth already installed.  Others, such as [http://www.forth.com FORTH, Inc.] and [http://www.mpeforth.com/index.htm Microprocessor Engineering Ltd.], provide cross-compilers for embedded systems in which the Forth OS runs on the target but the compiler and other development tools run on a conventional PC.

== Chipset ==

The original IBM computer was based around the 8088 microprocessor, although the 8088 alone was not enough to handle all the complex tasks required by the system. A number of other chips were developed to support the microprocessor unit (MPU), and many of these other chips survive, in one way or another, to this day. The chapters in this section will talk about some of the additional chips in the standard x86 chipset, including the DMA chip, the interrupt controller, and the Timer.

This section currently only contains pages about the programmable peripheral chips, although eventually it could also contain pages about the non-programmable components of the x86 architecture, such as the RAM, the Northbridge, etc. 

Many of the components discussed in these chapters have been integrated onto larger die through the years. The DMA and PIC controllers, for instance, are both usually integrated into the Southbridge ASIC. If the PCI Express standard becomes widespread, many of these same functions could be integrated into the PCI Express controller, instead of into the traditional Northbridge/Southbridge chips.

The chips covered in this section are:

== Direct Memory Access ==
{{Wikipedia|Direct memory access}}

The '''Direct Memory Access''' chip (DMA) was an important part of the original IBM PC and has become an essential component of modern computer systems. DMA allows other computer components to access the main memory directly, without the processor having to manage the data flow. This is important because in many systems, the processor is a data-flow bottleneck, and it would slow down the system considerably to have the MPU have to handle every memory transaction.

The original DMA chip was known as the 8237-A chip, although modern variants may be one of many different models.

== DMA Operation ==

The DMA chip can be used to move large blocks of data between two memory locations, or it can be used to move blocks of data from a peripheral device to memory. For instance, DMA is used frequently to move data between the PCI bus to the expansion cards, and it is also used to manage data transmissions between primary memory (RAM) and the secondary memory (HDD). While the DMA is operational, it has control over the memory bus, and the MPU may not access the bus for any reason. The MPU may continue operating on the instructions that are stored in its caches, but once the caches are empty, or once a memory access instruction is encountered, the MPU must wait for the DMA operation to complete. The DMA can manage memory operations much more quickly than the MPU can, so the wait times are usually not a large speed problem.

== DMA Channels ==

The DMA chip has up to 8 DMA channels, and one of these channels can be used to cascade a second DMA chip for a total of 14 channels available. Each channel can be programmed to read from a specific source, to write to a specific source, etc. Because of this, the DMA has a number of dedicated I/O addresses available, for writing to the necessary control registers. The DMA uses addresses 0x0000-0x000F for standard control registers, and 0x0080-0x0083 for page registers.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Programmable Interrupt Controller}}

The original IBM PC contained a chip known as the '''Programmable Interrupt Controller''' to handle the incoming interrupt requests from the system, and to send them in an orderly fashion to the MPU for processing. The original interrupt controller was the 8259A chip, although modern computers will have a more recent variant. The most common replacement is the [[w:Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller|APIC]] (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) which is essentially an extended version of the old PIC chip to maintain backwards compatibility. This page will cover the 8259A.

==Function==

[[File:PIC Hardware interrupt path.svg|thumb|300px|Path of an interrupt, from hardware to CPU]]

The function of the 8259A is actually relatively simple. Each PIC has 8 input lines, called Interrupt Requests (IRQ), numbered from 0 to 7. When one of these lines goes high, the PIC alerts the CPU and sends the appropriate interrupt number. This number is calculated by adding the IRQ number (0 to 7) to an internal &quot;vector offset&quot; value. The CPU uses this value to execute an appropriate Interrupt Service Routine. (For furthur information, see [[X86 Assembly/Advanced Interrupts|Advanced Interrupts]]).

Of course, it's not quite as simple as that, because each system has two PICS, a &quot;master&quot; and a &quot;slave&quot;. So when the slave raises an interrupt, it's actually sent to the master, which sends that to the CPU. In this way, interrupts cascade and a processor can have 16 IRQ lines. Of these 16, one is needed for the two PIC chips to interface with each other, so the number of available IRQs is decreased to 15.

While [[x86 Assembly/Advanced_Interrupts#Disabling_Interrupts|cli and sti]] can be used to disable and enable ''all'' hardware interrupts, it's sometimes desirable to selectively disable interrupts from certain devices. For this purpose, PICs have an internal 8-bit register called the Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). The bits in this register determine which IRQs are passed on to the CPU. If an IRQ is raised but the corresponding bit in the IMR is set, it is ignored and nothing is sent to the CPU.

==IRQs==
Of the 15 usable IRQs, some are universally associated with one type of device:
* IRQ 0 ‒ system timer
* IRQ 1 — keyboard controller
* IRQ 3 — serial port COM2
* IRQ 4 — serial port COM1
* IRQ 5 — line print terminal 2
* IRQ 6 — floppy controller
* IRQ 7 — line print terminal 1
* IRQ 8 — RTC timer
* IRQ 12 — mouse controller
* IRQ 13 — math co-processor
* IRQ 14 — ATA channel 1
* IRQ 15 — ATA channel 2

==Programming==
Each of the system's two PICs are assigned a command port and a data port:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! PIC1 !! PIC2
|-
| Command || 0x20 || 0xA0
|-
| Data || 0x21 || 0xA1
|}

===Masking===

Normally, reading from the data port returns the IMR register (see above), and writing to it sets the register. We can use this to set which IRQs should be ignored. For example, to disable IRQ 6 (floppy controller) from firing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
in 0x21, ax
or ax, (1 &lt;&lt; 6)
out 0x21, ax
&lt;/source&gt;

In the same way, to disable IRQ 12 (mouse controller):

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
in 0xA1, ax
or ax, (1 &lt;&lt; 4)   ;IRQ 12 is actually IRQ 4 of PIC2
out 0xA1, ax
&lt;/source&gt;

===Remapping===

Another common task, often performed during the initialization of an operating system, is remapping the PICs. That is, changing their internal vector offsets, thereby altering the interrupt numbers they send. The initial vector offset of PIC1 is 8, so it raises interrupt numbers 8 to 15. Unfortunately, some of the low 32 interrupts are used by the CPU for exceptions (divide-by-zero, page fault, etc.), causing a conflict between hardware and software interrupts. The usual solution to this is remapping the PIC1 to start at 32, and often the PIC2 right after it at 40. This requires a complete restart of the PICs, but is not actually too difficult, requiring just eight &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt;s.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov al, 0x11
out 0x20, al     ;restart PIC1
out 0xA0, al     ;restart PIC2

mov al, 0x20
out 0x21, al     ;PIC1 now starts at 32
mov al, 0x28
out 0xA1, al     ;PIC2 now starts at 40

mov al, 0x04
out 0x21, al     ;setup cascading
mov al, 0x02
out 0xA1, al

mov al, 0x01
out 0x21, al
out 0xA1, al     ;done!
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

{{Wikipedia|Programmable Interval Timer}}

The '''Programmable Interval Timer''' (PIT) is an essential component of modern computers, especially in a multi-tasking environment. The PIT chip can be made ‒ by setting various register values ‒ to count up or down, at certain rates, and to trigger interrupts at certain times. The timer can be set into a cyclic mode, so that when it triggers it automatically starts counting again, or it can be set into a one-time-only countdown mode.

On newer hardware, a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Precision_Event_Timer HPET] (High Precision Event Timer), which is an evolution of the PIT concept, is likely to be available.

== Function ==
The PIT contains a crystal oscillator which emits a signal 1193182 hz. This output frequency is divided by three different values to provide three output channels to the CPU. Channel 0 is used as a system timer by most operating systems. Channel 1 was used to refresh the DRAM, but is no longer used and may not even be accessable. Channel 2 is used to control the PC speaker. Of these, channel 0 is the most frequently encountered.

To make the PIT fire at a certain frequency ''f'', you need to figure out an integer '''''x''''', such that 11931820 / '''''x''''' = '''''f'''''. This is a trivially solved problem which results in the formula:
:'''''x''''' = 1193182 / '''''f'''''

How this division actually works is that each divisor is saved in an internal register. On every clock pulse, the register is decremented. Only when it reaches 0 is the clock pulse allowed to continue on to the CPU. Higher divisors result in lower frequencies, and vice versa.

Note that because the divisor is 16 bits, and a value of 0 is interpreted as 65536, there are limits on the producible frequencies:
:max = 1193182 / 1 = 1193182 hz
:min = 1193182 / 65536 ≈ 18.2065 hz
This final value is also the resolution of the frequency, that is, each consecutive possible frequency differs by 18.2065 hz.

== Programming ==
The PIT is accessed via four ports, three for the three channels and one for commands:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Channel 0 || 0x40
|-
| Channel 1 || 0x41
|-
| Channel 2 || 0x42
|-
| Command || 0x43
|}

One commonly performed task is setting the frequency of the channel 0, the system timer. If a frequency of 100 hz is desired, we see that the necessary divisor is 1193182 / 100 = 11931. This value must be sent to the PIT split into a high and low byte.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov al, 0x36
out 0x43, al    ;tell the PIT which channel we're setting

mov ax, 11931
out 0x40, al    ;send low byte
out 0x40, ah    ;send high byte
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

Baseball is a kind of a ball game played with two teams of 9 persons.  It is the &quot;National Pastime&quot; of the United States.

== Basics ==

You need a glove (the catcher and first baseman use mitts) and a bat. The person with the baseball bat hits the ball and the person with the glove or mitt tries to catch the ball and do it 5 times (or your choice). The pitches that the pitcher throws are either balls or strikes.  A strike is a pitch that is thrown within the strike zone. Traditionally the strike zone is a pitch thrown across the plate and between the knees and uniform letters of the player and not outside of the sides of the home plate. A ball is a pitch thrown outside this area.  It is important to remember that final call on whether a pitch is a strike or ball is decided by the home plate umpire. 

The game baseball is played on a field called a diamond.  The infield is made up of a home plate, first base, second base and third base, set up in a diamond shape.  The total number of players that can play on the diamond at one time is 9 (defensive).  There is a pitcher (who throws the ball to the batter), the catcher, catches the ball thrown by the pitcher.  There is a first baseman who catches the balls hit to the infielders and mans first base.  The second baseman plays in between first and second base. Next to the second baseman on the other side of second base, between second base and third base is the shortstop.  This position was originally called the shortfielder because it was play in the outfield in front of the outfielders and behind the infielders. The outfield consists of three players: left, middle, and right field. All are located in the grass far beyond the diamond.

The bat is made of wood or aluminum.  At younger levels aluminum is used, while in professional leagues they use wooden bats.

The Major League Baseball (MLB) is recognized as the premier league to play baseball with the top talent in the world.  In the MLB, there are 30 teams in two separate leagues, the American League (AL) and the National League (NL).  Each of the 30 teams plays 162 games, not including the playoffs.  There are 6 divisions, 3 per league, with teams ranging from 3 to 6 in each league.  In the playoffs, there are 3 rounds prior to the World Series, which determines the champion for that year.  

In 2011 the St Louis Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers 4 games to 3 to win the World Series. In 2012 The Florida Marlins had their name changed to the Miami Marlins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Networks/Page}}

In a digital communications system, there are 2 methods for data transfer: '''parallel''' and '''serial'''. Parallel connections have multiple wires running parallel to each other (hence the name), and can transmit data on all the wires simultaneously. Serial, on the other hand, uses a single wire to transfer the data bits one at a time. 

== Parallel Data ==

The parallel port on modern computer systems is an example of a parallel communications connection. The parallel port has 8 data wires, and a large series of ground wires and control wires. IDE harddisk connectors and PCI expansion ports are another good example of parallel connections in a computer system.

== Serial Data ==

The serial port on modern computers is a good example of serial communications. Serial ports have either a single data wire, or a single differential pair, and the remainder of the wires are either ground or control signals. USB, FireWire, SATA and PCI Express are good examples of other serial communications standards in modern computers.

== Which is Better? ==

It is a natural question to ask which one of the two transmission methods is better. At first glance, it would seem that parallel ports should be able to send data much faster than serial ports. Let's say we have a parallel connection with 8 data wires, and a serial connection with a single data wire. Simple arithmetic seems to show that the parallel system can transmit 8 times as fast as the serial system.

However, parallel ports suffer extremely from '''inter-symbol interference''' (ISI) and noise, and therefore the data can be corrupted over long distances. Also, because the wires in a parallel system have small amounts of capacitance and mutual inductance, the bandwidth of parallel wires is much lower than the bandwidth of serial wires. We all know by now that an increased bandwidth leads to a better bit rate. We also know that less noise in the channel means we can successfully transmit data reliably with a lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio, SNR.

If, however, we bump up the power in a serial connection by using a differential signal with 2 wires (one with a positive voltage, and one with a negative voltage), we can use the same amount of power, have twice the SNR, and reach an even higher bitrate without suffering the effects of noise. USB cables, for instance, use shielded, differential serial communications, and the USB 2.0 standard is capable of data transmission rates of 480Mbits/sec!

In addition, because of the increased potential for noise and interference, parallel wires need to be far shorter than serial wires. Consider the standard parallel port wire to connect the PC to a printer: those wires are between 3 and 4 feet long, and the longest commercially available is typically 25 feet. Now consider ethernet wires (which are serial, and typically unshielded twisted pair): they can be bought in lengths of 100 feet, and a 300 foot run is not uncommon!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The code in the second section is a horrible mix of pseudocode, VB and Java. Either it should be in pure pseudocode or in a real language; mixing the two does more harm than good.

== &quot;Cubic Compiling&quot;? ==

This section (1.5 as the time of writing) looks like the output of a translator bot at best or a paper generator at worst. The text in this section is utterly uncomprehensible and I was not even able to find out what &quot;cubic compiling&quot; is supposed to be. There is an IDE by the name of CubicIDE, though, so this might be related spam. I suggest to delete this section altogether, but I am not sufficiently certain that this is not merely a heavily mistranslated, legit content.

: The only connection I saw to cubic compiling was that something was at O(n^3) - in particular an ad-hoc algorithm.  Unless the author of that article knows something I don't, a cubic O-notation would be a disaster for a recursive-compiler, especially when an interpreter would normally use O(n^2) at worst when doing variable lookups.  It's almost as if the section wants to say the parse tree is bad, but I see absolutely no indication why that would be the case.   Finally, &quot;eradicating&quot; 290000 articles?  Really, word salad doesn't do that.  Since it was always like that, nuke it from orbit just to be sure. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sigma 7|contribs]]) 15:07, 28 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

I do not know what [[User:Dmonego]] meant/intends in the Uses section: ''In Java and J2EE programming, the structured definition of bean properties is a very useful technique for comparing a single common property across several objects that do not and should not be related with inheritance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Circular Saws'''

Most people are familiar with the basic circular saw, sometimes called a &quot;skillsaw,&quot; though that is a brand, as when one refers to tissue as &quot;Kleenex.&quot; These saws are constructed with a pistol-type grip to the rear, and a trigger-button which activates the saw.

Another popular type of saw is the &quot;worm drive&quot; or &quot;framing&quot; saw. This saw is a variation on the circular saw, which is designed to fit in smaller spaces; the motor is at the back. Because there is no motor beside the blade, the saw's width when viewed from the front (the direction of the cut) is much smaller.

These saws, as other tools, are manufactured to varying levels of quality and durability. The plastic ones such as DeWalt are lighter, and for framers cutting in a bent over position that is good! However they do not take well to drops or imacts. A sturdier tool would definitely be one with a metal body such as Ridgid or Makita, though these models are noticeably heavier.

and what to do when you ARE the smart guy and the tech support knows nothing ?

:If thats the case why are you calling tech?

:Keep trying to fix it or find a friend/forum that knows. [[User:68.39.174.238|68.39.174.238]] 10:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
::Doesn't always work unfortunately... A lot of times, i'll change PC hardware, and my internet will die...I know exactly the fix (have Comcast reauthorize the new hardware), but tech support always makes me jump through hoops anyway. Sucks, since I could fix it in a few moments, if they'd smarten up. --[[User:69.247.164.232|69.247.164.232]] 07:03, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

== Thats ok for some... ==

Firstly we all know how we are supposed to speak on the phone, we all know tech support don't care our cat is ill, they just want to know the problem, only the problem and then try to fix it, apparently. Given certain circumstances i think its ok to lose it on the phone with one, maybe even dream of microwaving them... on defrost... slowly... - See below.

Iv'e encountered many tech support centres covering various pieces of software/hardware/services, in my experiance the software/hardware tech support seem ok and im more than happy to jump through their hoops as long as i feel my problem is going somewhere and is being sorted out. However services, especialy some internet service providers are a nightmare.

Here is my story sad but true...

AOL Technical support stages one AND two need slapped with extream prejudice, after you get through which in my case was normally around 40mins stage one &quot;techs&quot; have no technical knowledge at all they are simply reading text from a screen which contains solutions to common problems, you say &quot;can't connect, iv'e had this problem for a total of 2 months, its not my line spoke to BT its fine, its not my modem i have 3 modems and 4 computers none work, its not the drivers iv'e re-installed them on all machines and tried each machine with each modem&quot; they say &quot;ahh yes i see we went through the tests with you yesterday and it didn't help, then we passed you on to a stage 2 tech. Hmm.. are your modem lights all on?&quot; im going to kill somone, more often than not they are in asia and weirdly enough have common names like &quot;Jim&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; which are two i can remember, doesn't change the fact that i can't understand a word they say. Then they have an event/problem logging system which only stores your &quot;problem&quot; and the &quot;questions/hoops&quot; you jumped through for 2 days, if you're problem isn't resolved within that time frame they once again have NO idea of your situation, that said even though they have it in front of them, they lead you down the garden path it MUST be to just get on you're nerves because if you're answers are on screen there is no reason for them to ask you the same questions for the 20th time. After my connection working only 10% of the time for 2 months i had a note put on my account saying i was to be transfered to a stage 2 tech/rep without any messing around, same situation only they are more friendly and use more technical speach, and are normally western. They couldn't help either.

Hilarious thing about the entire saga was when it got fixed, i called up one day and i'd been waiting on hold so long i'd fallen asleep on the floor, when i get through the engineer has to wake me up because he can hear me snoring on the other end of the phone. i explain (this must be the 30th time now, and i can reel it all off with ease which makes tech angry because you're answering their questions before they ask them) after which he tells me there is ONE person in the entire AOL Company that can speak to me about my problem and he won't be available for 2 hours (who is that guy?!), i don't want to hang up because iv'e done that before, no one calls back so im back on hold for 1 hour 20 mins and im back asleep, no idea who this bloke was but within 10 mins i had 100% internet connectivity that... after months of calling BT to check my line, and ADSL status, by this time i had installed Windows 98, Me, NT, XP on all 4 of my machines just so it wasn't version dependant, had 3 different versions of the modem drivers, 3 modems, 10 cables, one of my machines had been online for the entire month because Stage 2 techs ask you to &quot;Leave it on so we can do ADSL testing&quot; and ONE bloke manages to sort it in 10 mins.

Now tech support being &quot;right most of the time&quot; is ok in some cases, but spread your company over many continents, throw in bad communication or no communication, horrible problem logging and your rules go out the window and people are trying their hardest to reach down the phone line grab your tounge and throttle you with it.

If the systems set up to help people are not &quot;Made by idiots for idiots&quot; great, iv'e no love for Mr.Technical Support if ITS NOT MY PROBLEM, ITS YOURS (we know its not you're fault as a person, but its your company, your in technical support, you're paid to fix things) NOW FIX IT!

Maybe there should be a set time limit on problems, say for example the problem eventually gets sorted in a few days after waiting months by some guy who is actually switched on today. then you should be allowed by law to remove all of the tech support guys you have spoken to in that time's teeth with a chisel.

P.S: at the time AOL UK was the only ISP that did broadband without capping and at a reasonable rate, i didn't argue i just wanted to download gigs of stuff.

:First level tech do NOT have no technical knowledge, I work there and my 1st call resolution rate is 93%. The other 7 is passing along to level 2 for line checks, and the occasional reinstall. We do NOT read from the screen, the screen offers guidelines, we have to know exactly how to solve the problems, and if we get agitated it is because we've had one two many people asking us what a modem is that day. These rules are spot on, I wish the IVR read them out before transfering people to an agent.</text>

      <comment>Put into [[Category:Ada programming language]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ada ==

Ada is a [[w:Strongly-typed programming language|strongly typed]] [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language suitable for [[w:embedded system|embedded system]]s, [[w:device driver|device driver]]s and other forms of [[w:system programming|system programming]].

===Type===

Ada is a full [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language implementing the following paradigmen: [[w:concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]], [[w:Distributed programming|distributed]], [[w:Generic programming|generic]] ([[w:template|template]] [[w:metaprogramming|metaprogramming]]), [[w:Imperative programming|imperative]] and [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] ([[w:Class (computer science)|class-based]]) programming.

===Execution Entry Point===

The procedure name of the entry point can be freely choosen.

===General Syntax===

The typical statement is completed by a semi-colon.  For the assignment of b to a use:

 a {{Ada/delimiter|1 = :=}} b {{Ada/delimiter|;}}

===Comments===

 {{Ada/comment|this is an inline comment.  Everything after the -- is a comment.}}

===Variable Declarations===

Declarations can appear at the beginning of an block.

Declare i as an integer: 

 {{Ada/kw|declare}} 
   I {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer {{Ada/delimiter|;}} 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|program}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/delimiter|;}} 

Here are two ways to declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}} 
   I {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer {{Ada/delimiter|1 = :=}} 0 {{Ada/delimiter|;}} 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|program}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/delimiter|;}}

=== Method Declaration/Implementation ===

procedures and functions are declared by the keyword {{Ada/kw|procedure}} or {{Ada/kw|function}} respectively. See [[Ada Programming/Subprograms]] for details.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} A_Test (A, B: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer; C: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer) {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    C := A + B;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} A_Test;

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B : Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} B;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} A;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Minimum;

Class methods are primitive operations (procedures and functions) declared in the same scope as the class record. See [[Ada_Programming/Object_Orientation]] for details.

=== Scope ===

Scops is decared by the use of packages which may consist of three parts: public specification ({{Ada/kw|package}}), private specification ({{Ada/kw|private}}) and body ({{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Symbian book at wikibooks. Originally started by the righteous folks from [irc://irc.freenode.net/#symbian #symbian] on [http://freenode.net freenode], this book hopes to contain some information about programming in Symbian C++. Mostly about features that aren't documented or are hard to find via digging forums.

== Getting Started ==
If you're just getting started, you're best off reading the Wikipedia article about [[w:Symbian|Symbian]]. There are lots of very useful links at the bottom of the page containing a great collection of tutorials and examples.

== Useful links ==
Some links you'll need:
*[http://developer.symbian.org The Symbian Foundation developer website]
*[http://www.newlc.com/article.php3?id_article=117 Symbian OS error codes] on NewLC.com.
*[http://discussion.forum.nokia.com Forum Nokia] The biggest Symbian-related discussion forum on the web.
*[http://symbianexample.com Symbian Example] The collection of stand-alone code examples.
*[http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Wiki_Home Forum Nokia Wiki]
*[http://blogs.forum.nokia.com/ Forum Nokia Wiki]
*[http://groups.google.com/group/symbian-cpp Symbian C++ Google Group]

== Platforms based on Symbian OS ==
There are several mobile platforms based on Symbian OS. The most popular ones are Nokia's S60 and UIQ Technology's UIQ. Nokia also has Series 40, which is not a Symbian platform, but is based on Nokia's proprietry closed OS. Series 40 supports J2ME. For more information about J2ME, read the [[J2ME Programming|J2ME wikibook]].

=== [[/S60|S60]] ===
Nokia's [[/S60|S60]], formerly known as Series 60, includes a wide range of phones with varying capabilities. SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-4,00.html Forum Nokia]. Especially if you plan to use the newer SDKs you'll need [http://www.forum.nokia.com/Tools_Docs_and_Code/Tools/IDEs/Carbide.vs/ Carbide.vs] or Carbide.C++.

=== UIQ ===
SonyEricsson owned UIQ, used e.g. by Sony-Ericsson, Motorola and BenQ. SDKs can be found at [http://www.uiq.com/uiqsdk UIQ.com].

=== [[/S80|Series 80]] ===
Nokia's [[/S80|Series 80]] is the communicator series which includes 9300, 9300i and 9500. SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-369,00.html Forum Nokia]. The 9200 -series has a separate [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-68,00.html SDK].

=== Series 90 ===
Nokia had Series 90 a while back which consisted of only two products, 7700 and 7710. Only 7710 was actually commercially sold. The SDK for Series 90 couldn't be found on Forum Nokia any more, and Series 90's development has been ceased.

== Symbian C++ and OS fundamentals ==

=== [[/Conventions|Conventions, types and classes]] ===
Symbian OS has a lot of coding and naming conventions. The OS also has its own equivalents for primitive types (mostly [[w:Typedef|typedefs]]), like &lt;code&gt;TInt&lt;/code&gt; (signed int) and &lt;code&gt;TText16&lt;/code&gt; (unsigned short int), and follows a convention for naming classes, for example &lt;code&gt;CMyComplexClass&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TMySimpleClass&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MMyInterface&lt;/code&gt;.

=== [[/Memory_management|Memory management]] ===
Symbian OS has certain memory management peculiarities. These include the cleanup stack and the usage of two-phase construction.

=== [[/Exception_handling|Exception handling]] ===
Symbian OS doesn't use standard C++ exceptions, but employs its own system known as the leave mechanism. Simply put, this consists of code that can possibly ''leave'' (roughly throw) and code that can ''trap'' leaves (roughly catch).

=== [[/Descriptors|Descriptors]] ===
Symbian OS' conception of strings are descriptors. These are data structures that can hold any binary data, but are used mostly for storing and manipulating text.

=== [[/Active_objects|Active Objects]] ===
Active Objects provide means for [[w:Cooperative multitasking|cooperative multitasking]]. Symbian OS itself supports [[w:Preemptive multitasking#Preemptive_multitasking|preemptive multitasking]], but Active Objects are usually the suggested method for executing various asynchronous tasks.

=== Client-server framework ===

=== [[Symbian/Resources|Resources]] ===
Like some other operating systems, Symbian OS uses resources for given, mostly UI-related, definitions. This section tries to explain how to define resources and use them.

== Symbian SDKs ==
Although each platform provides (or should provide) its own SDK, there are few things in common between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book arose from a discussion point in the Ecology Wikibook, which pointed to the need for 'conservation management' to be included.  I have close contact with university students and land managers, where the need seems to be for a text book on applied ecology that centres on the long-term sustainable management of the outcomes of things like, reclamation of industrial sites, and reintroductions of rare species.  This would obviously grow into a big project, with distinctive subject matter, so I decided to start it as a separate book.  It is at a very early stage, and I must say I miss the availability of integral Wiki software for making mind maps.  Its not so easy to reorganise what are essentially provisional basic topics, but 'there you go'--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 07:54, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

The contents page looks a bit strange, but I have followed the current Wiki naming policy for new books.  For each new page this means giving it a name that includes its parent pages, all the way back to the book name.  If this is done for a new page (module), a blank page will automatically appear, and it will also be automatically linked back to previous pages.--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 11:24, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

==Orphaned Modules==
I'm going through the list of [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned pages]] and there are four pages there apparently belonging to this book, but not linked from anywhere. Not being familiar with the subject, placing these modules correctly in the context of this project is probably not a task I should perform, but I will list the pages here so that the contributors to this book can find a suitable place for them.

*[[Applied Ecology/Conervation Management]]
*[[Applied Ecology/Disease Transmission Through Ecosystems]]
*[[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment/]]
*[[Applied Ecology/Rehabilitation of Rare Species]]

==Ref Orphaned Modules==
I created these at the time when I was not familiar with formatting wikis.  I thought I had deleted them but clearly I do not know how to do this.

== [[User:Panic2k4]] sockpuppet block/Comment regarding Sockpuppets on Wikibooks English ==
I do not know the nature of the dispute and decided to provide my outside opinion. It is intended to be my opinions/advice in the matter. Nothing more.

From what I understand, [[User:Panic2k4]] was blocked and his/her sockpuppets continue to edit during the duration of his/her block. There has been checkuser evidence and confessions to back this sockpuppet allegation. However because of the absence of a policy on wikibooks some people feel the block of sockpuppets is unwaranted.

I am a commons admin, and we too do not have a policy on sockpuppets on commons. However aggressive sockpuppets are blocked on commons left right regardless of the absence of a policy to do so. There is no point in having a checkuser on wikibooks if such sockpuppets are not to be blocked.

--[[User:Cool Cat|Cool Cat]] 16:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
:Hi, You left me a comment on my talk page (user: Xania) over on Wikibooks about sockpuppets created by the, currently, banned user Panic.  Thanks for your comments.  The issue with Panic isn't really about his sockpuppets and he has made it very clear that they were created by him.  I think he was trying to prove a point (not sure what the point is) and also trying to be helpful (he did a lot of tidy up tasks with these puppets). [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:22, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
::Still sockpuppets should not be used to evade blocks regardless of the intent. No? --[[User:Cool Cat|Cool Cat]] 21:46, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I would say no to most occasions but this was civil disobedience without any wrong intentions and it is not covered on the policies so I don't see any harm, if it was used to continue the situation that resulted on the block or engage on any other actions that policies sees as block worthy then yes it should be regarded as bad but little could be done to stop it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== Where's this all going? ==

Now the &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; page has gone, and redirects to Panic's talk page?  That seems odd to me.  Also, large fractions of the text that were there are no longer present (they are, of course, in the histories for those who go and look).  Seems that we're going backwards again.  We need this discussion to happen in one place, that won't move around, with some clearly defined goals and a visible, updated current status being prominent.  I do appreciate your willingness to help -- just trying to avoid repeating history (as recent history in this case has not been good for the community). -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 04:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
:I was asked to 'perhaps' move the discussion to Panic2k4's talk page so he can edit even when blocked. Since he removed the page I have restored it on the original location. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

== Sorry about all that... ==
Sorry to have made you lose any of your time on that subject but at least it served to make some people address the issues, please consider participating into our (Wikibooks) policy building.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
:I am a person who prefers to avoid &quot;policies&quot; since when you set boundaries disruptive individuals dance around those very boundaries. If someone is being disruptive, common sense can easily deal with it. '''Common'''s deals with disruptive individuals very effectively for this very reason. My recommendation is to avoid writing out &quot;policies&quot; and deal with disruption on a case by case basis. --&lt;small&gt; [[User:Cool Cat|Cat]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cool Cat|chi?]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I would avoid an essay all together - that also establishes a more generalized set of boundaries. I am too new on wikibooks to vote - and even then I tend to avoid voting on issues.

::I'm monitoring your talk pages and I'm no longer blocked, or dependent on continuation of the imposed mediation, I will reply here or on my talk pages as you prefer, don't copy all the thread there please txs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Copying a discussion thread to both talk pages is quite a standard way to do it. I have been doing so in the past 2+ years. Fine, I'll reply only here.

::::Sorry if you are confused (I never used duplication of complete threads on a discussion prior to the moderation) and posting for +-4 years now :), I have replied to your last post (aren't you still monitoring my page?), well it is [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=787847&amp;oldid=787827 there]], you can reply there or here if you reply here I will delete the thread there and continue to reply here. Sorry if it is confusing (it is best than to have 2 duplicated threads running at least to me, you can move all posts of the thread from there to here if it makes you more comfortable if you chose to use your talk page that is, gezz even I am getting dizzy).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:24, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::I monitor no individual talk page. I Work on 4+ wikis and do not have that kind of time. The idea for duplication is better communication so that other people can also better follow it.

:Humm ?!? What do you want to mediate ? All issues are partially resolved, and the mediation was imposed to me at the time and is no longer needed or required at least on my side, I don't see you will be able to solve the huge cliff that exists between me and some users, I will be glad of any insight you may have on the events or issues but can't see the purpose of any mediation now.
:I thought that SB Jhonny told you that &quot;most&quot; things were resolved (I remember reading something on those lines). 
:Anyway if you still want to be of any help mending the bridges and be involved into dealing with the deeper problems or lets say divergent views, see for example this discussion [[Wikibooks_talk:Arbitration_Committee]] about freedom of participation vs status and for further and deeper insight on some of the view points I don't share with WK take a look at [[User_talk:Whiteknight#WB:RFA_posts]] it deals mostly on the level of trust and the segmentation of the community in special casts or power groups, the essay is also a good insight on what I believe and in general it deals in the core of all else. 
:Btw I remember reading somewhere, I think it was SB Jhonny, saying that you were more able to discuss legal matters and GFDL subjects is that right? If so I would like you to consider this 2 points.
:What constitutes a cover page (on wikibooks)?
:(I hope I'm not misrepresenting WK view but I think I got his point correct on that), WK defines that all wikibooks (the web site) is covered by a single GFDL license any content is therefor a module of that single work (much like wikipedia), I on the other hand say that there are 2 license one for all pages (lets call them modules) on site, but each book is excluded from that general license and falls into a specific license for each, as a stand alone work. WK validates his point on that all content committed is done under a specific notice (the one you see when you edit any page), I on the other hand disagree and defend that a specific notice has to be placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of the GFDL License.

:::I don't agree with your conclusion that &quot;Weather each page is licensed individually or as a whole under GFDL doesn't really matter&quot;, it can be so for you but you can't generalize and in Wikibooks that is a very important topic and has even implications on what is required to be stated, how the content is ordered and displayed, even on how we provide print versions of the books, or give credits to authors, or even give attributions. Just consider the topic of moving on site pages from books to books.

United States copyright law does not work based on intentions of creators ?!?, of course it does, in several instances even on the selection of the license or for example only copyright holders can prosecute infringers under the GFDL see the FSF page about that same point, when you license anything under GFDL you grant permission to publish and share the content under very specific rules, you don't give away ownership or any other right (as you say &quot;GFDL is not a surrender of copyright&quot;)...
Multiple licenses, yes agree, for instance in wikipedia dual license contributions require the users to express they wishes on their userpages that serves as the notice of intentions required by the GFDL license and the others.
#So in other words you agree that wikibooks is covered by a general license and a specific license to each book ?
#Do you agree that the notice on save page performs that function of the notice of intentions or a express agreement of the user to that general license as required and stated on the GFDL?
#Do you consider them exclusive or inclusive ?
#If exclusive do you agree that it falls under the definition of AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS as stated on the GFDL ?
#What then constitutes a title/cover page of a book ?
#Do you agree also that &quot;Provide a functional link back to the Wikibooks book or Wikibooks module (this satisfies the author credit requirement of our license)&quot; does not cover the independent work that a book constitutes?
#How do you define an author (or more specifically a book author at wikibooks) ?
(WK and I diverge in that he considers any edit grants authorship of a work, I define it as this:
Author - Author is the one that creates or contributes for the creation of a work, after creation and/or publication of the work, the one that assumes legal responsibility for it and rights over it, each subsequent alterations to the same work fall in several categories including revisions, re-editions, translations etc... It is considered that a existing work can only be co-authored with the previous authors if significant changes are made so it could be considered a derivative work.)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:Multiple licenses can only be used if they are GFDL compatible (non-commercial creative commons is obviously not compatible for instance). Once something is released under GFDL it is non-revoke-able and hence the intentions of the creator becomes irrelevant. 
:#The content of any wiki sponsored by the Wikimedia Foundation to my knowledge is licensed under GFDL. I do not see the point of this argument.
:#The &quot;notice&quot; on the save page serves to inform the person editing that what they are typing will be forever licensed under GFDL the second they press the save button. GFDL cannot be revoked.
:#I do not have the slightest idea what this one is asking.
:#Again I do not have the slightest idea what this one is asking.
:#A cover page of the book is the first page that generally contains art work and etc. This is trivial knowledge.
:#I am not sure what you are asking here.
:#Just like wikipedia, wikibooks is a cooperative environment. No book should be written by a single individual. &quot;Author&quot; is everybody involved - vandals (since vandalism will be removed from the final product)
:I do not understand what you are trying to get at. GFDL is non-revoke-able and all derivative works must be licensed under GFDL. Furthermore, GFDL allows derivative works.

::Were did you get the idea of revoking (I didn't ask anything on that direction) and the questions are strait forward, mostly require a yes or no answer.
::Yup I agree on the multiple license point, as for the intentions of the creator being irrelevant it's debatable lets take for example the recent post on the staff lounge of an author that intents to use Wikibooks to create his dual license book (I don't want to discuss that just to point out that it may not be so irrelevant as it has implications)
::So again can you help me on this ones.
::#I know that the content is licensed under the GFDL (I had to be blind not to get that :) ), what I asked is that do you agree that the license that covers the Wikibooks site and its modules is not the same that covers each independent book ?
::#The notice you already answered, and I agree.
::#If Wikibooks is an AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS the licenses are overlapping so are they exclusive or inclusive? from the GFDL text I take it is exclusive. (if not they would be called dependent works :) ) 
::#What constitutes a title/cover page  of a book at Wikibooks ?
::#(I'll reword this one as it is partially answered by some of the above questions) Do you agree also that &quot;Provide a functional link back to the Wikibooks book or Wikibooks module (this satisfies the author credit requirement of our license)&quot; as stated on [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] does not cover the requirements of the license of a book at Wikibooks ? (but only every other  page that is not part of a independent work.)
::#How do you define an author (or more specifically a book author at wikibooks) ? (and no Wikibooks is not like Wikipedia, Wikipedia deals with a collection of articles and Wikibooks deals with Books and each book has it's own authors and is covered by individual licenses and dependencies, like other books. They are indeed independent works) if you continue to share the statement above then this is also answered and I don't agree with you on this one.
::I'm not getting at one specific point. I would like to know your understanding of this situations, some are seen differently by several user (not only me).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
::(PS: can you archive/delete or basically make some of the posts above go away it's becoming harder to edit) txs --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:::I am not saying that you don't know it. Half of the issues involving GFDL involves this non-revokability.
:::1. I do not particularly see a legal difference if one considers it individually or as a whole. Each edit has their own individual copyright. Stitching them together into a single book creates a new copyright (GFDL allows that provided you attribute everybody), so it is perhaps both. Legaly, arguing either way doesn't quite matter.
:::3. All WMF sponsored wikis are writen in a collaborative and cooperative manner. People retain copyright for individual copyright but they release some rights according to GFDL. I do not understand what you mean by &quot;exclusive or inclusive&quot;
:::4. ? When publishing a book, you can change the title. I do not understand the significance of this.
:::5. Every bit of history would need to be linked - or a page that links to every bit of history would need to be linked. Sourcing a wiki-page that links to every page of the book is more than adequate citation.
:::6. What makes wikibooks different from wikipedia? They have the same license? 
:::Repetitively asking the same question will get you the same answer from me. I am not a lawyer, and very little material on GFDL has been challenged in court so dealing with GFDL as simplistically as possible is the smart thing to do.
:::If you have questions about GFDL and its implications, your best bet is to ask the [[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License|GFDL people]].

1. Consider moving a page from a book to the main namespace (the legal requirements) or from book to book (that one is easy one must give credit to the source book) and for example from wikipedia to a book (one must give credit to Wikipedia)...&lt;br&gt;
3. The GFDL creates specific requirements that must be met, considering that a book is a independent work (as defined on 7 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS) I see it as exclusive even if it is overlapped due to the virtualization of the framework we work in (wiki) so this has implication on how one must solve the requirements of the license in 2 specific &quot;spaces&quot; the Wikibooks and the &quot;book&quot; (they are considered 2 separated works), this has implications on point 1.&lt;br&gt;
4. Books on Wikibooks are published as soon they are edited (can be considered a modification or a derived work, depending on the level of contribution, so the question is simple on a book on Wikibooks how do you define the title or cover page as referred on the GFDL ? (this has several implications)&lt;br&gt;
5. Humm I don't agree with you there, (considering we are using a GFDL work as a target) to use any article of Wikipedia (I must only acknowledge Wikipedia as the source), to use something from the Wikibooks namespace (not a book page) I must only acknowledge Wikibooks, to use pages from any GFDL or with a similar license on a book under GFDL (even the one on wikibook) I must acknowledge the source books or authors (depending on how the source is structured and the level of utilization of content from the source), so the problem is simple, we have 2 licenses on for the Wikibooks namespace and one for each books, (on the books references to Wikibooks as source is not required)&lt;br&gt;
6. What makes it different is simple each article on Wikipedia doesn't have its own license, they are all under the namespace, books on wikibooks are stand alone works.&lt;br&gt;
Agree I thought you had a better understanding of the legal implications or the application of the license, but tanks for providing you views on the subject. In particular the point you consider Wikibooks and Wikimedia are equal in the its legal structure is a common mistake people do make. Well you didn't respond yet if you do want me to add my post on the mediation on the top or after the last one ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

I have tried to email the FSF on the US sometime ago but got a server error (the address is not recognized on the server) even if they publish it on the page, I will try FSF Europe next but I'm attempting to establish what the errors/view points/implications are.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:1. Collaborative book writing isn't something new. You are required to credit the source, not the authors. Weather its licensed individually or as a whole or both doesn't matter at all. Arguing either way is pointless since we do not have a basis for it anyways. 
:3 &amp; 4. Try challenging this point in a court. My or your opinions are irrelevant. Wikibooks is not the median for legal discussions.
:5. You are required to cite which page(s) you had been copying. Weather citing the entire book qualifies I do not know. People generally cite pages for verifiability purposes.
:6. I was unaware of blanket licensing on wikipedia. Every edit here or there gets its own copyright. People who contribute to either project care more about the common goal (a free encyclopedia/a free book/free whatever) than their individual copyrights. I do not have the slightest clue why you are so worked out about it
:Please do not waste peoples times with your theories on legal implications of GFDL. You are welcome to publish these theories and get them peer reviewed or alternatively challenge them in court. Questions you ask are unanswerable because we don't have legal cases for basis.

::Ok it seems you don't give the same importance that I give to the use of the GFDL and licensing issues and the need to be clear :and inform the users, it is my view that you are completely mistaken on the part of dual licenses, there can be incompatible licenses that are dual-licensed material. For example, you can have content which is licensed simultaneously under the GFDL and Microsoft EULA. All you are doing is offering multiple alternatives for legal republication of content.

::Your notion that all Wikimedia sponsored Wikis are under the terms of the GFDL is also incorrect. Wikinews is under the CC-by license, and some of the Wikimedia Foundation pages are a strict proprietary copyright... no license for republication at all. The Wikimania pages are &quot;free to use, but not to modify&quot;.

::You would have to agree here that at least making an administrative edit (adding or removing a category/VfD notice, etc.) does not constitute being considered an author. Certainly reverted vandals don't count. Take for instance this proposal [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2007#Authorship_determination  neta:Summer_of_Code_2007#Authorship_determination]] made by Robert (at least I'm not alone on the importance I give the issue), or [[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-June/010564.html or this post from three years ago from Richard Stallman]] that dismisses nearly all aggregation arguments that have been used for fair use and license combining on Wikipedia, or this bugzilla request here ([http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2993 Bugzilla:2993]).

::It seems as though deliberate action on the part of several &quot;upper&quot; Wikimedia Foundation members, that they explicitly are trying to stop any kind of authorship recognition. A proposal was even made here on Wikibooks to explicitly ban author pages entirely. (It was blocked).

::I have no problem with Wikimedia or even the community blocking or working to make attributing copyright harder (this ultimately will benefit us all, as consumers), I do consume more than I produce (and most people do if not closed in a box), what irks me is not stating that openly and let people know it, to me it is working equal to be in bad faith against the users. As an creator my main motivation to participate here was to build stuff and to be able to point to the things I create, by diluting the work one makes how does one state his achievements, or why bother to perform a greater contribution of content if any one can claim to have done it.

::I assure you if I had understood from the beginning the implications I would not have used Wikibooks and would have created the content outside even under the GFDL (I have no problem with the freedom of the license), for instance I contribute from time to time to wikipedia but I do it anonymously, what I don't like is the convenient way people brush aside the pieces they don't particularly like. (Referring mostly title/cover pages stating the authors or credits given, granting authorship based on the weak history logs, or just because of spell correction or even the rewording of the text, without taking into account the size of contributions, this to my view will only reduce contributors if they are properly informed of the facts, and I don't see a logical reason to do so since the license gives freedom to the content).

::This is also a poor way of educating people, I can't understand how can anyone claim to have built a house if all they did was hammer a handful of nails.

::&quot;Signing&quot; an author's page is required to be counted as an author (GFDL - This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.) the license states the authors page as the place to do it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

==Introduction==
Nokias Series 80 is the communicator series which includes 9300, 9300i and 9500. SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-369,00.html Forum Nokia]. The 9200 has a separate [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-68,00.html SDK].

==Collection of tips==

===Connection Preferences===
You should not tinker around with CCommsDbConnectionPrefTableView. The same code that works on S60 may run on S80 but won't accomplish anything worthwhile. Instead you should use TCommDbConnPref with RConnection.

===CEikAppUi===
A class derived from CEikAppUi has some issues with overriding one the ProcessCommandParametersL methods. It was something to do with the return values, at least ETrue didn't work quite as with S60. Will get back to this when i get around to testing again. Could be that ProcessMessageL override didn't go down too well either so if your app isn't starting be sure to check these methods out.

===Keyboard layout===
A quick reference of the keyboard layout in TKeyEvent.iScanCode:

*Esc         : 4
*Numbers 0-9 : 48-57
*Plus        : 131
*Backspace   : 1
*Tab         : 2
*Letters a-z : 65-90
*Enter       : 3
*Caps Lock   : 26
*Left Shift  : 18
*Minus       : 123
*Left        : 14
*Right       : 15
*Up          : 16
*Down        : 17
*Joy Left    : 170
*Joy Right   : 171
*Joy Up      : 172
*Joy Down    : 173
*Joy Fire    : 174
*Right Shift : 19
*Ctrl        : 22
*Chr         : 24
*Comma       : 121
*Dot         : 122
*Space       : 5

==NOTICE==
This e-book is extremely incomplete.


==Introduction==
Nokia's S60, formerly known as Series 60, is a mobile platform based on Symbian OS. S60 includes a wide range of phones with varying capabilities. Most of these phones are made by Nokia, but S60 is also licensed to some other cell phone manufacturers, like Panasonic and Samsung. For general information about S60 see [[w:en:S60|the article in Wikipedia]].

The platform comprises of various libraries and pre-installed applications. Platform is open (but not open source), so 3rd parties can develop applications for it. Nokia offers software development kits for S60, and a list of SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-4,00.html Forum Nokia]. Especially if you plan to use the newer SDKs you'll need [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-902,00.html Carbide.vs].

==Collection of tips==
===Resources===
S60 resource definitions can sometimes be pretty tedious to write, because of the total lack of proper documentation. The best place to look for information about resource definitions is examples, found in the Series60Ex directory of the SDK, but they too are far from perfect.
*'''CAknMessageQueryDialog'''
One control totally missing from the examples in some SDK version is CAknMessageQueryDialog, which is actually quite useful and once you know how, very easy to use. Here's how to define a working resource for this:
&lt;pre&gt;
RESOURCE DIALOG r_messagequery_dlg
  {
  flags = EGeneralQueryFlags | EEikDialogFlagNoBorder | EEikDialogFlagNoShadow;
  buttons = R_AVKON_SOFTKEYS_OK_EMPTY;
  items=
    {
    DLG_LINE
      {
      type = EAknCtPopupHeadingPane;
      id = EAknMessageQueryHeaderId;
      control = AVKON_HEADING
        {
        label = &quot;The Heading&quot;;
        };
      },
    DLG_LINE
      {
      type = EAknCtMessageQuery;
      id = EAknMessageQueryContentId;
      control = AVKON_MESSAGE_QUERY
        {
        message = &quot;The Actual Text&quot;;
        };
      }
    };
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that both the header and the message text can be set dynamically from code. The following code, however, uses the values given in the resource:
&lt;pre&gt;
CAknMessageQueryDialog* dlg = new (ELeave) CAknMessageQueryDialog;
dlg-&gt;ExecuteLD( R_MESSAGEQUERY_DLG );
&lt;/pre&gt;
===Camera===
On at least, two phones the support for the old RCameraServ has been dropped. If you link your app against cameraserver.lib it will not start on a 3230 or a 6260. Instead you should use the new CCamera class.

===CFbsBitmap===
*'''Transparency'''
When using newer than 6.1 SDKs (note: not sure if 9.1 still has this), loading the alpha channel (mask) of a PNG into a CFbsBitmap of color depth EGray16 doesn't work. You must use a colordepth of EGray256 for the mask, otherwise MiuoConvertComplete will always return with an error. After the conversion is complete you can convert back to EGray16.

*'''DataAddress()'''
On the new 9.1 SDK a call to CFbsBitmap::DataAddress() causes a crash if it's not preceded by a call to LockHeap() (remember to call UnlockHeap() when you're done with the address).

== [[:Image:Yellow.png]] ==

&lt;s&gt;I noticed that you tagged [[:Image:Yellow.png]] as public domain. However, I did not believe your argument that it was an &quot;uncreative work&quot;. Thus I removed the tag.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;But I am now aware that [[:Image:Yellow.png]] is a duplicate of [[:Image:50%.png]], which is copyrighted but licensed through the GNU Free Documentation License. Thus I tagged it {{tl|GFDL}} and redundant. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

:I zoomed in with an image viewer, and apparently these images are simple 9-pixel-by-9-pixel drawings of squares. You might be correct about {{tl|PD}}; there appears to be nothing significantly creative except possibly the choice of color. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== Non-commercial use ==

While I appreciate your efforts to try and get copyright clearance for several images, I want to let you know that non-commercial use only limitations are not permitted on Wikibooks.  There are several reasons for that, not the least of which is that it violates the terms of use for the GNU Free Document License.  

You can get some more information about why non-commercial use is harmful elsewhere, but this is an issue that has been discussed openly and widely on many forums throughout Wikimedia projects.  There are commercial ventures that do use this content, including ordinary Wikimedia users who simply want to charge for copying a bunch of CD's or DVDs full of Wikibook or Wikipedia content.  Not an arm or a leg for doing that, just to take care of the costs of running the burner and taking their time to make the physical media.  Or people who are trying to publish these books at even a nominal markup price.

If somebody is offering permission to copy images or other content, but is only willing to give a non-commercial license, we have to politely decline and apoligize for even taking their time.  If you have any other questions about this, feel free to drop a line on my talk page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:24, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

== Eating human flesh ==


Eating human flesh is called cannibalism. This entry is not scholarly, it is a cannibal cookbook.

What does this mean? Needs rewriting...
 Uncooked or preparation of human placenta can transmit...

== Don't delete this valuable resource! ==

I'm shocked to see that there's a movement to delete this page. I realize placentas are probably not commonly eaten, but as far as I can see the only argument people have against it is that the idea offends their own sensibilities, and therefore they want all references to it removed. I'm standing up and saying i'm ''not'' offended; on the contrary I'm intruigued. I'm a vegetarian, but I have no objections to the consumption of human placenta with the consent of the mother (it would be unfair to eat animal placentas, as they are usually eaten by the mothers). In fact I, after reading this page, am now very much interested in partaking in a meal of human placenta at some point in my life. Thankyou wikicookbook, for opening my mind to these new possibilities :) please don't deprive others of that same experience! --[[User:86.135.178.19|86.135.178.19]] 21:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Color temperature.svg]]

Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency range. All objects emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. As the atoms are shaken by random thermal motion, the moving charge of the electrons causes them to emit a changing electromagnetic field. In general, the cooler the body, the slower the motion of its atoms and molecules, and the longer the wavelength of emitted radiation. Thus a human body emits mostly in the infrared part of the spectrum, making ''night vision'' cameras so valuable to the military and police. But the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb is at a much higher temperature (roughly 3000 K or about 5000 degrees F), causing it to emit mostly visible light.

Thus the spectrum and intensity of the emitted radiation can be used to determine the object's temperature from a distance. If a material is heated above 700 Kelvin, it begins to glow visibly - starting out as a dark red color and moving towards the blue end of the spectrum with increasing temperature. However, most objects radiate a wide range of temperatures, and the effective color perceived by the human eye may not be fully indicative of the true temperature. For example, the Sun appears white to most observers, but the wavelength at which it radiates most of its energy is about 5800 K or roughly 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which spectroscopically is equivalent to a green color. However, when the human eye detects the various wavelengths we receive from the Sun, in particular ratios of radiation emitted by the Sun, our eye-brain connection perceives it as white.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No one needs to be completely hemmed in by circumstances; no one needs to be the victim of his biography.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&amp;#151; George Kelly, The Psychology of Personal Constructs (1955)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every situation, you always have a choice of how to react. This insight is the basis of &lt;i&gt;personal construct therapy&lt;/i&gt; (PCT). The goal of PCT is to develop awareness of your choices in every situation. The antithesis is to always react the same way to stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make the same speech choices in high-stress situations, no amount of practice in a low-stress speech clinic will change your speech. E.g., if you always substitute words &amp;quot;when the going gets tough,&amp;quot; you're not going to use gentle onsets in a difficult situations, even after practicing 5,000 gentle onsets in the speech clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop awareness of your choices, describe a situation in which you stuttered. Imagine different ways you could have responded to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Role-play the scene with your speech-languge pathologist or in your support group. When someone sees a choice that hasn't been played, switch roles, for that person to play the new choice. E.g., the situation is answering the telephone at work. One person pretends to be a caller, and the other pretends to be the employee answering at Pasquale's Pizza. The employee uses slow speech. But another choice might be to switch to [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Three Stages of Motor Learning#Voice and Voiceless Consonants|voiced consonants]], i.e., answering the phone &lt;i&gt;Basdahllee's Bizza&lt;/i&gt;. You should be able to think of a half-dozen other possibilities. Role play every choice and see what feels best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Slow Down by Not Interrupting&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Conscious choice requires slow reactions. In a fast reaction to environmental stimuli, your brain will select the most myelinated (habitual) [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Open- and Closed-Loop Speech Motor Control#Open-Loop Motor Control|open-loop motor program]]. Interrupting people, or responding quickly in a conversation, is a fast reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let people finish their sentences. Wait two seconds. Then start talking. Your fluency will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verbal Aikido&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;[w:Aikido|Aikido] is a Japanese martial art. Combatants focus not on punching or kicking opponents, but rather on using their own energy to gain control of them or to throw them away from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbal aikido is the art of not arguing, but instead agreeing with someone who is verbally attacking you. Then you help the assailant attack you, until&amp;#151;surprise&amp;#151;he realizes that he's just been made to look like a fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a middle-aged, overweight woman owned a chain of women-only health clubs. Middle-aged, overweight women could work out in these health clubs without feeling intimidated by young male bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;shock jock&amp;quot; radio host invited the health club owner onto his show. He described her physical appearance, then asked why anyone would want to work out at a health club owned by a fat, ugly old lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She responded, &amp;quot;So we don't have to work out with boorish meatheads like you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This silenced the radio host long enough for her to say that overweight, middle-aged ladies have to exercise too, and the radio host was a perfect example of the men she didn't want to have to be around when she exercised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My example of the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Modeling|parents responding to their teenagers' four-letter words]] is another example of verbal aikido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use verbal aikido to turn around the stress. E.g., a highway patrol officer pulls you over for speeding. Instead of trying to hide your stuttering, you make a joke: &amp;quot;I stutter, so I'm not going to try to talk you out of giving me a ticket.&amp;quot; Maybe this will put the officer in a good mood and let you go with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Changing Self-Descriptions&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Many stutterers improve their speech, yet continue to believe that their speech is worse than non-stutterers. Graduates of fluency shaping therapy programs sometimes have beautiful, clear speech that is easier and more pleasant to listen to than non-stutterers' speech. Yet they continue to believe that they can't do certain things, such as public speaking.{{ref|Andrews1974}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, stutterers who improve their speech attitudes have better speech a year after completing therapy, as compared to stutterers who maintain poor attitudes.{{ref|Guitar1978}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a description of yourself, and then describe who you expects to be in five years. Look for items that are opposite in the two descriptions. E.g., now you're now single, but in five years you hope to be married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then write a description of yourself as a stutterer, and then describe who you'd be if you didn't stutter. E.g., assertive vs. shy, or popular vs. lonely. These descriptions are your &lt;i&gt;personal constructs&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on changing your personal constructs. Again, imagine specific situations for each personal construct. E.g., if you wrote that you'd be assertive instead of shy, describe a recent situation in which you weren't assertive. Now role-play the scene with your speech-language pathologist or your support group. Imagine different ways to react in the situation and switch roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;Who Would I Be If I Didn't Stutter?&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;This is a favorite conversation topic at stuttering support groups. People initially say, &amp;quot;I'd be more successful at work,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I'd be more assertive with my husband and family,&amp;quot; and other &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt; aspects of stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fifteen minutes, people start saying, &amp;quot;If I didn't stutter, I'd be less compassionate,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I would never have developed my musical talent.&amp;quot; People realize that they chose a career in a &amp;quot;helping profession&amp;quot; (e.g., nursing or teaching), or they developed non-verbal skills, such as athletics or painting, because they stutter. They realize &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; aspects of stuttering. They see that stuttering can be a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a stutterer completed a speech therapy program, but refused to speak fluently. He said that his co-workers had listened to his stuttering for 20 years. He asked, &amp;quot;What would they think if I came to work speaking fluently?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stutterer was earning $25,000/year as a computer programmer. His supervisor left, and the company wanted to promote the stutterer. He would receive a salary of $55,000/year. The management position required talking to clients on the telephone&lt;!--&gt; XE &amp;quot;telephones&amp;quot; &lt;!--&gt;. The company offered to pay for speech therapy and an anti-stuttering device. The stutterer refused the promotion, saying that he didn't want to talk to anyone. The company instead hired a less-qualified manager from outside the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these stutterers, the psychological issues surrounding stuttering are more disabling than their disfluencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Change Your Lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As your improve your fluency, ask your supervisor for tasks that require talking. Do social activities that involve talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training a new motor skill requires about [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Automatic, Effortless Fluency#How Long Does Autonomous Learning Take?|three million repetitions]]. To say three million words, you must talk at least four hours a day for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take an acting class. Take singing lessons. You'll have fun, and meet new people. You'll get over your speech-related fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll find some things other people can easily do that you can't, but you'll also find things you can easily do that other people can't. E.g., I took a public speaking course. I was able to project your voice, when other students are afraid to raise their voices. I was able to switch emotions (anger, sadness) easily and convincingly, when other students couldn't. And there were simple presentations that you couldn't understand a word I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteer to read to blind or elderly individuals. Volunteer at a hospital directing visitors where to go. Volunteer with your public radio station answering pledge week calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or moonlight at a job that requires talking. Find a job that requires being charming and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join social clubs that requires talking. Put Toastmasters at the top of your list. Members give a series of ten speeches, usually one speech per month. The speeches are four to ten minutes long. Each of the ten speeches teaches you a new skill, such as using gestures and body language, or being persuasive on a controversial topic. Judges always point out things you did well&amp;#151;and award lots of ribbons&amp;#151;as well as ways you can improve. You'll find that even if you stutter severely, you're better than non-stutterers at some aspects of public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [http://www.nsastutter.org/ National Stuttering Association] has its own public speaking training program, which is quite different from Toastmasters. Ask for the &amp;quot;Speaking Circles&amp;quot; video.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why help others?  Ever thought of how well a professor knows the information; think he or she knew it that well the first time they taught it?  I'll bet they didn't.  When you take the time to help or teach someone else you're repeating the concept or facts in your own mind, verbalizing it, and thinking through it critically.  The only caution I would give on helping others is if your professor grades on  curve.  You may help out the other too much and cut yourself out of the grade you deserve.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language; these include {{java:boolean}}, {{java:byte}}, {{java:char}}, {{java:short}}, {{java:int}}, {{java:long}}, {{java:float}} and {{java:double}}. These types serve as the building blocks of data manipulation in Java. Such types serve only one purpose &amp;mdash; containing pure, simple values of a kind. Because these data types are defined into the Java type system by default, they come with a number of operations predefined. You can not define a new operation for such primitive types. In the Java type system, there are three further categories of primitives:
* Numeric primitives: {{java:short}}, {{java:int}}, {{java:long}}, {{java:float}} and {{java:double}}. These primitive data types hold only numeric data. Operations associated with such data types are those of [[Java Programming/Basic arithmetic|simple arithmetic]] (addition, subtraction, etc.) or of [[Java Programming/Boolean expressions|comparisons]] (is greater than, is equal to, etc.)
* Textual primitives: {{java:byte}} and {{java:char}}. These primitive data types hold characters (which can be [[Unicode]] alphabets or even numbers). Operations associated with such types are those of textual manipulation (comparing two words, joining characters to make words, etc.). However, {{java:byte}} and {{java:char}} can also support arithmetic operations.
* Boolean and null primitives: {{java:boolean}} and {{java:null}}.

All the primitive types have a fixed size. Thus, the primitive types are limited to a range of values. A smaller primitive type ({{java:byte}}) can contain less values than a bigger one ({{java:long}}).

Integer primitive types silently overflow:

|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-52&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.52: Several operators.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
int i = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
System.out.println(i);
i = i + 1;
System.out.println(i);
System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Console for Code section 3.52'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
2147483647

-2147483648
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

As Java is strongly typed, you can't assign a floating point number (a number with a decimal point) to an integer variable:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-53&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.53: Setting a floating point number as a value to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (integer) type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age;
age = 10.5;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A primitive type should be set by an appropriate value. The primitive types can be initialized with a literal. Most of the literals are primitive type values, except [[Java Programming/Literals/String Literals|String Literals]], which are instance of the {{java:String}} class.

== Numbers in computer science ==
Programming may not be as trivial or boring as just crunching huge numbers any more. However, huge chunks of code written in any programming language today, let alone Java, obsessively deal with numbers. Be it churning out huge prime numbers,&lt;ref name=&quot;note-1&quot;&gt;As of edit (11 December 2013), the [[w:Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search|Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] project has so far identified the largest prime number as being 17,425,170 digits long. Prime numbers are valuable to cryptologists as the bigger the number, the securer they can make their data encryption logic using that particular number.&lt;/ref&gt; or just calculating a cost of emission from your scooter. In 1965, [[w:Gemini 5|Gemini V]] space mission escaped a near-fatal accident because of a programming error.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-2&quot;&gt;Gemini 5 landed 130 kilometers short of its planned Pacific Ocean landing point due to a software error. The Earth's rotation rate had been programmed as one revolution per [[w:solar time|solar day]] instead of the correct value, one revolution per [[w:sidereal time|sidereal day]].&lt;/ref&gt; And again in 1979, a computer program calculated the ability of five nuclear reactors to withstand earthquakes as overestimated; this caused the plants had to be shut down temporarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-3&quot;&gt;A program used in their design used an arithmetic sum of variables when it should have used the sum of their absolute values.  (Evars Witt, &quot;''The Little Computer and the Big Problem''&quot;,  AP Newswire, 16 March 1979.  See also Peter Neumann, &quot;''An Editorial on Software Correctness and the Social Process''&quot; Software Engineering Notes, Volume 4(2), April 1979, page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; There is one thing common to both these programming errors: the subject data, being computed at the time the errors occurred, was numeric. Out of past experience, Java came bundled with revised type checking for numeric data and puts lots of emphasis on correctly identifying different types of numeric data. So you must recognise the importance of numeric data when it comes to programming.

Numbers are stored in memory using a binary system. The memory is like a grid of cells:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

Each cell can contain a ''binary digit'' (shortened to ''bit''), that is to say, zero or one:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|}

Actually, each cell '''does''' contain a binary digit, as one bit is roughly equivalent to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and an empty cell in the memory signifies &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. A single binary digit can only hold two possible values: a zero or a one.

Multiple bits held together can hold multiple permutations &amp;mdash; 2 bits can hold 4 possible values, 3 can hold 8, and so on. For instance, the maximum number 8 bits can hold (&lt;code&gt;11111111&lt;/code&gt; in binary) is &lt;code&gt;255&lt;/code&gt; in the decimal system. So, the numbers from 0 to 255 can fit within 8 bits.

It is all good, but this way, we can only host positive numbers (or unsigned integers). They are called ''unsigned integers''. Unsigned integers are whole number values that are all positive and do not attribute to negative values. For this very reason, we would ask one of the 8 bits to hold information about the sign of the number (positive or negative). This leaves us with just 7 bits to actually count out a number. The maximum number that these 7 bits can hold (&lt;code&gt;1111111&lt;/code&gt;) is &lt;code&gt;127&lt;/code&gt; in the decimal system.

Altogether, using this method, 8 bits can hold numbers ranging from &lt;code&gt;-128&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;127&lt;/code&gt; (including zero) &amp;mdash; a total of 256 numbers. Not a bad pay-off one might presume. The opposite to an unsigned integer is a ''signed integer'' that have the capability of holding both positive and negative values.

But, what about larger numbers. You would need significantly more bits to hold larger numbers. That's where Java's numeric types come into play. Java has multiple numeric types &amp;mdash; their size dependant on the number of bits that are at play.

In Java, numbers are dealt with using data types specially formulated to host numeric data. But before we dive into these types, we must first set some concepts in stone. Just like you did in high school (or even primary school), numbers in Java are placed in clearly distinct groups and systems. As you'd already know by now, number systems includes groups like the ''integer'' numbers (0, 1, 2 ... ∞); ''negative integers'' (0, -1, -2 ... -∞) or even ''real'' and ''rational'' numbers ([[w:Pi|value of Pi]], ¾, 0.333~, etcetera). Java simply tends to place these numbers in two distinct groups, '''integers''' (-∞ ... 0 ... ∞) and '''floating point''' numbers (any number with decimal points or fractional representation). For the moment, we would only look into integer values as they are easier to understand and work with.

== Integer types in Java ==
With what we have learned so far, we will identify the different types of signed integer values that can be created and manipulated in Java. Following is a table of the most basic numeric types: integers. As we have discussed earlier, the data types in Java for integers caters to both positive and negative values and hence are '''signed numeric types'''. The size in bits for a numeric type determines what its minimum and maximum value would be. If in doubt, one can always calculate these values.

Lets see how this new found knowledge of the basic integer types in Java fits into the picture. Say, you want to numerically manipulate the days in a year &amp;mdash; all 365 days. What type would you use? Since the data type &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; only goes up to 127, would you risk giving it a value greater than its allowed maximum. Such decisions might save you from dreaded errors that might occur out of the programmed code. A much more sensible choice for such a numeric operation might be a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;. Oh, why couldn't they make just one data type to hold all kinds of numbers? Wouldn't you ask that question? Well, let's explore why.

When you tell a program you need to use an integer, say even a &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, the Java program allocates a space in the memory. It allocates whole 8 bits of memory. Where it wouldn't seem to matter for today's memory modules that have place for almost a dozen trillion such bits, it matters in other cases. Once allocated that part of the memory gets used and can only be claimed back after the operation is finished. Consider a complicated Java program where the only data type you'd be using would be &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; integers. What happens when there's no space for more memory allocation jobs? Ever heard of the [[w:Stack overflow|Stack Overflow error]]s. That's exactly what happens &amp;mdash; your memory gets completely used up and fast. So, choose your data types with extreme caution.

Enough talk, let's see how you can create a numeric type. A numeric type begins with the type's name (&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and then provides with a name for the allocated space in the memory. Following is how it's done. Say, we need to create a variable to hold the number of days in a year.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-54&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.54: Days in a year.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
short daysInYear = 365;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Here, &lt;code&gt;daysInYear&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the variable that holds &lt;code&gt;365&lt;/code&gt; as it's value, while &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; is the data type for that particular value. Other uses of integer data types in Java might see you write code such as this given below:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-55&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.55: Integer data types in Java.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
byte maxByte = 127;
short maxShort = 32767;
int maxInt = 2147483647;
long maxLong = 9223372036854775807;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Integer numbers and floating point numbers ==
The data types that one can use for integer numbers are &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; but when it comes to floating point numbers, we use &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;. Now that we know that, we can modify the code in the [[#code-section-53|code section 3.53]] as:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-56&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.56: Correct floating point declaration and assignment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double age = 10.5;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Why not &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, you say?  If we'd used a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, we would have to append the number with a &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as a suffix, so &lt;code&gt;10.5&lt;/code&gt; should be &lt;code&gt;10.5f&lt;/code&gt; as in:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-57&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.57: The correct way to define floating point numbers of type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
float age = 10.5f;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Floating-point math never throws exceptions. Dividing a non-zero value by &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;infinity&lt;/code&gt;. Dividing a non-infinite value by &lt;code&gt;infinity&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.7''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-7&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.7: Primitive type assignments.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
...

a = false;
b = 3.2;
c = 35;
d = -93485L;
e = 'q';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

These are five variables. There are a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;. Retrieve the type of each one.
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;answer-7&quot;&gt;'''Answer 3.7: Primitive type assignments and declarations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-5&quot;&gt;
boolean a;
double b;
byte c;
long d;
char e;

a = false;
b = 3.2;
c = 35;
d = -93485L;
e = 'q';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can only be the &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; because only a boolean can handle boolean values.
* &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; can only be the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; because only a char can contain a character.
* &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can only be the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; because only a double can contain a decimal number here.
* &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; because a &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; can not contain such a low value.
* &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is the remaining one so it is the &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;.

== Data conversion (casting) ==
Data conversion (casting) can happen between two primitive types.  There are two kinds of casting:
* Implicit: casting operation is not required; the magnitude of the numeric value is always preserved. However, ''precision'' may be lost when converting from integer to floating point types
* Explicit: casting operation required; the magnitude of the numeric value may not be preserved

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-58&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.58: Implicit casting (int is converted to long, '''casting''' is not needed).'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1 highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
int  i = 65;
long l = i;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-59&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.59: Explicit casting (long is converted to int, '''casting''' is needed).'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
long l = 656666L;
int  i = (int) l;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The following table shows the conversions between primitive types, it shows the casting operation for explicit conversions:

Unlike C, C++ and similar languages, Java can't represent &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and can't represent &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; as non-zero. Java can't cast from boolean to a non-boolean primitive data type, or vice versa.

When you go to a play, the opera, the ballet, or even a concert you notice the people on the stage performing. You may also notice the lighting effects, audio effects, costuming, makeup, and the set the performers are on. All of these things are part of the world of Technical theatre.

Technical theatre encompasses all that goes into making a staged production. The areas of technical theatre are scenery,lighting, properties,costuming,and sound. All of these areas work together in a production to establish the place, time period, and mood of the production. If successful the audience will not even notice many of the technical elements of the show. Instead they will come away having enjoyed the show. However, if one of the areas is incomplete or of a lesser quality than the rest the entire production can suffer. Each area relies on the others for support so it is important that everyone works together and communicates as a team; if the lighting designer uses blue light in their design and the costume designer creates a yellow dress, the audience will see an ugly green dress. Technical theatre therefore depends on teamwork and cross-communication for success.

== People in Technical Theatre ==
To put on a play it takes many people, doing many different jobs. Working together as a team the result can be very impressive. Each production organization is laid out differently, but most have people filling these roles. 

The '''Stage Director''' is the person responsible for the artistic vision, the meaning and thusly the purpose of presenting the production. While not a technical position, the Stage Director is still important in technical production in that he/she  coordinates the artistic efforts of the different designers and actors into one unified vision. 
The '''Production Manager''' works with the Stage Director and the various designers, coordinating all the various design elements,making sure the different designs are carried out as best as possible. This person coordinates the efforts of the different departments, and making certain the production maintins its production schedule and remains within the budget.
The '''Technical Director''' (or TD) works with the Scene designer and Properties designer, supervises the master carpenter and oversees the construction of the set. The TD frequently (in smaller organizations) may also take on other functions, such as supervising the set and props crews .

The '''Designers''' are the people that make the artistic decisions in their respective areas. The '''Scene Designer''' designs the sets for the different scenes. The '''Lighting Designer''' designs how the playing area and the actors will be lit. The '''Properties Designer''' obtains and sometime even creates the hand props held by the actors and props used on the stage. The '''Costume Designer''' designs the clothes that the people will wear, often designing or working closely with the designers of the hair and makeup as well. The '''Sound Designer''' chooses or makes the different sound effects that will play during the show, as well as determining who gets microphones, and how much amplification will be necessary. 

The crew heads are responsible for coordinating the efforts of the different crews of stagehands working under them in the implementation of the designers' work. The '''Master Carpenter''' directs the construction of the set. He/she may also coordinate the people that move the set during scene changes. The '''Scenic Charge''' is the person that oversees the painting of the set. The '''Master Electrician''' makes sure that the lighting instruments get placed where the designer needs them. They also oversee the people operating the lighting control board and any follow spots. The '''Audio Engineer''' oversees the layout of the sound system; during the show they will oversee the operator of the sound boards and make sure any microphones and other sound equipment is working. The '''Properties (or props) Master''' will gather the items that the actors will handle during the performance. Under direction of either the scenic designer they may also in charge of &quot;set dressings&quot; such as tables and chairs that the actors will interact with. The '''Costumer''' will coordinate the making of the costumes and the fitting them on the performers. 

The '''stagehands''' are the people that do the labor. These people are divided into several crews. The carpenters build the set, and move set pieces during the show. The painters paint the set the colors the designer specified. The electricians put the lights in the correct place, run the cables to power them, and operate the control board and any followspots. The audio crew will place speakers and microphones as well as run the cables to power them. In addition, they will operate the sound mixers. The wardrobe mistress supervises the stitchers and drapers who sew and mend and clean the costumes, and the dressers who help the actors get into them. The props crew will make sure the items the actors need are where they are supposed to be, and repair them if they get broken. 

== Set design and Construction ==
The design of a set for a production, often times, is one of the first steps taken by director and designer.  This is due to several issues.  First, the set is one of the few parts of the technical theatre which is specifically dictated by the script.  How many people must be on stage?  How many different entrances must be accommodated?  Where do those entrances lead?  Each of these questions (and others) must be addressed with the set design.  Secondly, the directors must have the set design prior to blocking the play so that the performers are blocked intentionally around the set pieces which will exist.

As with all design elements, the first step in creating a set design is to read the script several times.  The minimum number of times a designer should read the script is three before beginning work on a set design.  The first time through, the designer should read it for the story line and enjoyment.  

The second time through, the designer should begin gathering a better feel for the story.  Where does the story take place?  Are there any major set pieces that must be included?  What entrances and exits must exist?  How much space must be allowed for the number of characters on stage at any given time?

The third time through the script, the designer should begin writing down specifics about the space.  In coordination with the director, choices must be made about where off-stage locations exist, where will the more intense beats or moments take place on stage, and general traffic patterns throughout the space.  

Following this third reading, most designers will create a series of sketches...at least one per location...for the director to review.  These sketches should include not only the set but also stage props and furniture and possibly tentative actor locations for major points in the story.  After getting the director's approval of the sketches, scale drawings must be made.  These should include not just an overhead view of each scene but also front elevations of the scenes and, where necessary for construction, specific cut-away designs of complicated set pieces.  From these scale drawings, many designers will then create scale models so that the directors and designers have three-dimensional models to work from both for the sake of blocking and also building the set pieces.

All of these design steps should also include the lighting designer and scenic designer (in charge of providing the coloring scheme for the sets...sometimes the scenic and set designer is the same person) so that the design schemes for all of the elements are complementary.

==Property design, acquisition-construction==
The prop design of each show depends on the artistic style of both sets and costumes, as well as the requests and needs of the director and/or choreographer. At a first reading of the script, the property designer will make a general list of all mentioned items and those that can be inferred from narration. Basic background research will begin for the look of items from a set period and location. Communication with all departments and designers helps to eliminate various items that overlap into costumes or set Lists. An initial &quot;Prop list&quot; is generated and dispersed to each of the other designers as well as the director, and all relevant parties. After receiving notes from the various departments, the &quot;prop list&quot; is updated and a second reading of the script is done to double check information gathered is consistent with script requirement as written. Research continues and narrows in on items that will require special attention. Budget constraints require that many items be used from stock, borrowed or rented before a purchase of a new item is made. Some items that are not in the company stock and cannot be located are fabricated. Props from a period settings are not always widely available and often require some amount of research to determine what the item is, how it was used and where it can be located.

===Prop===
A property is designated depending on the theatre and the structure of design responsibility set by years of trial and error. It is common for a prop to be defined as anything that is not a set-firmly adhered or 'nailed' together. That would include all dressing, furniture and hand held &quot;props&quot;. Some theatres may only designate that which the actor actually picks up as a 'prop'. The range in-between varies. Props may be an item usually associated with another department or require close work with them. Costume pieces may sometimes be the responsibility of the costume department to fabricate and then be tracked in rehearsal and performance by the prop department such as hat and purses, coats that come off or never worn but held as part of the costume. At other times in the script, a dress may be picked up and packed in a suit case on stage and never worn. The prop department would acquire one of the correct period, basic size, etc. and may possibly require the approval of the costume designer. Another example of a possible cross over would be a microphone. If live, it would require input from both the sound and electrics department but may be chosen and tracked by the prop department. The choice of microphone may require the input of the sound designer, set designer and the prop designer. 

In some theatres a prop may be among many different elements layered on top or around each other with backdrops and architectural elements, elaborate costumes, large ensembles as well as lighting. With theatre in the round the elements are distilled down to the most basic elements. The 360 degree &quot;line of site&quot; adds limitations to sets. While costumes may be as elaborate, theatre in the round has a much more limited area then a proscenium and cast size could be limited as well. These are a few reasons that make theatrical properties in this situation stand out more. It also puts a more direct spotlight on the item and in many cases is central to the development of plot or central character. 

Specialized props used as 'sight gags' could be a rubber chicken or a more elaborately conceived notion. Simple looking items, in many cases, require specialized work. Requirements, specific to a production may require an item be 'rigged' in one way or another. A burlap bag may require an inner lining smaller than the outer shell that may be stuffed to emulate content.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Nervous System'''

Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated response to the environment.

Basic unit of the nervous system is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron neuron], a highly specialized cell that uses both electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons &quot;listen&quot; to sensory organs or other neurons, and can simultaneously &quot;hear&quot; from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously. Likewise, a neuron can &quot;talk&quot; to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle cells or glands.

Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by ''glia''. Glia were once thought to only play a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells, and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann cells that provide a myelin sheath.

== Neuron structure ==
[[File:Complete neuron cell diagram en.svg|thumb|Neuron]]
*Dendrite will receive information from other axons
*Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
*Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
*Axon is surrounded by myelin.
**Contains nodes of Ranvier

Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.

Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ influx via channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.  

Synapses

Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neurotransmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.

Example : Neuromuscular synapses

Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia

== Central nervous system ==
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.

Brain
There are four lobes of the brain.
*Frontal lobe - decision making 
*Parietal lobe
*Temporal lobe
*Occipital lobe - vision

The areas of the brain are also dedicated to different functions.
*Precentral gyrus
*Postcentral gyrus

Protection
The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). CSF helps to float the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.

== Peripheral nervous system ==
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.

ANS - Autonomic Nervous System
The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and sympathetic. 

The sympathetic nervous system is the &quot;fight or flight&quot; or fright response and results in an increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the first neuron is short and the second neuron is long. 

The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system. 

Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an effect on the CNS. Drugs act by affecting the neuron and how likely it is to fire an action potential.

Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''If you have an English version of Windows XP and are having problems working with non western fonts this article is for you.'' 

Problem: You want to read and write for example in an Eastern European language but the non-western letters are displaying on the screen incorrectly. 

Why this happens is because Windows picks a default language page code for non-unicode programs. Your default is probably some version of English.

The program you're using is a little dumb, it wasn't written to be used in environments outside of its locale, it's not checking to see if it's using the right font version. So you need to change the default page code for non-unicode applications.

# go to control panel and select regional settings.
# select the advanced tab. 

It has a drop down box which probably says English, this needs to change to your desired language. In my case this was Polish. 

If it's not an option, you might need to change the input method to Polish too; on a Polish keyboard you can change this back to default to an English layout. Once this has been changed, applied and okayed you probably need to restart Windows. 

Try your program and hopefully this time your desired languages letters should be shown instead of the random symbols found in the western version of the font. 

For writing in the desired language use the language bar to swap between keyboard layouts. Substitute your desired language for Polish in this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi I spend a lot of time figuring out how to do things and search all over to find the information to do something. 

when I find out I could just leave it at that I have solved my problem 
however I feel it's better to make the solution open and easy to find for anyone. This seems an Ideal location to transform my many hours of digging into a few minutes light reading for someone else to solve similar problems

I also have a terrible memory and It's likely that a particular problem will crop up again within a couple of years for me and I have to dig again :)</text>

To enable iTunes to play [[w:Ogg|Ogg]] files, install the official [[w:Xiph QuickTime Components|Xiph QuickTime Components]]. This is straightforward, as outlined below.

If you wish to also associate a file type with Ogg, the process is somewhat more involved; see below.

==Install components==
# Make sure iTunes is not running.
# Install the official [[w:Xiph QuickTime Components|Xiph QuickTime Components]] from [http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/download.html Xiph.org]. iTunes is a [[w:QuickTime|QuickTime]] based application, these components and frameworks allow any QuickTime application to play Ogg files for that matter.
#Files may be dragged into the iTunes Library window or added via the '''File &gt; Add to Library…''' command.
#Enjoy your new music!

=== Conflicts ===
If you have installed older QuickTime Ogg components, there may be conflicts, so you will want to remove these. Read the installation/uninstallation instructions that came with the older packages, or check in the following directory for files with &lt;tt&gt;Ogg&lt;/tt&gt; in the name, and remove them: &lt;tt&gt;/Library/Components, /Library/QuickTime,&lt;/tt&gt; and similarly in your home directory.

==File type association – advanced==
iTunes by default does not have a file type association with Ogg files despite the fact that it has an Ogg icon. Enabling the association in [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] requires editing the &lt;tt&gt;Info.plist&lt;/tt&gt; file with a [[w:text editor|text editor]], not [[w:Property List Editor|Property List Editor]] (as it does not support copying and pasting branches of the XML tree).

=Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence=

White is temporarily a pawn down. He may put this immediately to rights with:

:[[/4. Nxe4/]]

following up the inevitable 4...d5 with 5. Bxd5. But then 5...Qxd5, and the knight finds itself pinned against the vulnerable g2 square and must be defended with the weakening 6. f3 - not the kind of contortions White wants to be getting into as he tries to undermine Black's centre. So Nxe4 should not be played with the intention of recovering the pawn. By extension, Whites solid third move was in fact a gambit!

The more active response to the loss of the pawn is

:[[/4. Qh5/]]!

And as White seeks to enact revenge with a series of checkmate threats, all hell breaks loose. This is one of the sharpest of all chess variations, right along side such bloodthirsty openings as the Sicilian Dragon and Evans Gambit.

At low playing levels, a variant commonly seen is [[/4. Bxf7/]]?!, followed by 4...Kxf7 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Qh5+ Kg8. With this method, White recovers the pawn, but his opponent has a powerful pawn centre, and his slightly exposed King does not offer enough compensation to White (7. Ng5 Qe7).&lt;ref&gt;Ludek Pachman, ''Eröffnungspraxis im Schach''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Football''' (also known as soccer or association football) is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score goals by using any part of the body besides the arms and hands to get the football into the opposing goal.

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Other players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Holistic economics==

The economic history of the world is the entire history of the world, but seen from a certain vantage point; that of the economy. The ecological history of the world is the history of the world seen from an environmental viewpoint. Increasingly, this environmental viewpoint takes in the place of Homo sapiens in the entire cosmos.  To choose one or other vantage point, and no other, is of course to favour from the start a one-sided form of explanation.  However, economists and historians have stopped thinking of economics as a self-contained discipline and of economic history as a neatly defined body of knowledge, which one could study in isolation from other subjects. Economists cannot properly grasp economic phenomena unless they go beyond the economy.  With regard to political economy, which in the 19th century appeared to concern only material goods, it has turned out to embrace the social system as a whole, being related to everything in society.  The same can be said of biologists with respect to ecology, with its history of evolution, which is no longer regarded as primarily science, but as a philosophy of inter-relatedness. 

Political culture is an important variable in the analysis of the relationships between culture and ecology as it suggests underlying beliefs, values and opinions, which a group of people holds dear (such as shared ethnic and religious affinities).  For example, Catholicism treats the individual as social and transcendent.

Economics and ecology come together at their common linguistic root, ‘oikos’, which in both cases signifies a space where a complex of activities is undertaken concerned with the consumption of natural resources and their transformation for production and distribution.  

===Management===

Solidarity in human societies resides in the organisations established to manage the utilisation of natural resources.  Management, as a specific pattern of human activities, emerges in the archaic use of the word economy to define the ordering of household affairs; (via Latin from Greek oikonomia; domestic management, from oikos house + -nomia, from nemein to manage). Managerial behaviour, involves the setting of targets and the marshalling of inputs necessary to overcome limiting environmental factors.  It is central to activities that turn environmental resources into food, goods and services. Ecology comes from the same etymological root. As a human scientific endeavour it has prompted new institutions and organisations in society by which ecological thinking can be directed to manage ecosystems as human goods. In this respect, applied ecology is a powerful feedback from science to force cultural changes in the use of habitats and species. 

Tension within society comes, on the one hand, from the managerial applications of science for the commodification and industrialisation of nature, and on the other, to the applications of ecology for the preservation of intrinsic value in the living world. These two rival views of the relationship between humans and nature define the area of cultural ecology.

From all of these viewpoints, applied ecology is influencing the formation of new social organisations and their cultural expressions through managerialism as global and local strategies and site operations.  Some of these changes in society and culture come about because of direct applications of science.  However, other movements, such as 'deep ecology', with their promotion of intrinsic value in ecological order, do not come directly out of the science of ecology, but are suggested, inspired and fortified, by ecological ideas.  In native cultures their ideological aspects comprised beliefs, rituals, magical practices, art, ethics, religion and myths. These defined the permissible and acceptable relationships with nature, and they were part of local systems for conserving resources. In industrialised societies this role has been taken over by the cultural package of 'nature conservation', which includes the philosophies and legal systems of society directed at supporting order in habitats and their species.   This is the web of perception and action that locks individuals together in geographical space as societies.  It is focused on balancing the exploitation of environmental resources for production with the conservation of resources to ensure survival of the community.  This balancing act involves technological, sociological and ideological management systems.

The technological aspect of management is concerned with tools, materials and machines. The sociological aspect involves the relationships into which people enter especially in work and in the family. These two aspects encompass topics that deal respectively with the exploitation of resources through production and demand.  Changes in technology and social organisation will bring forth changes in the ideas and beliefs that connect people with local and planetary resources, and also define humans in the wider cosmos, but such ideas will always feed back on the social organisation, which moves forward.

The ideological aspects of the conservation of resources are expressed

* through ideas about 'nature' and 'place', as these have developed historically to provide philosophical, artistic and spiritual values for present day environmentalism;
* through science, as applied ecology; 
* and through ‘living in nature’ and applying traditional ecological knowledge to realise global and local strategies of resource management. 

All these aspects define the two major routes of Western reasoning about nature. On the one hand, since the 18th century, there has been a ready acceptance of the scientific drive for the domination of nature. On the other hand, the environmental outcomes of this mode of activity has precipitated the ecological search for intrinsic value and its preservation.  These two rival views of the relationship between humans and nature define a fluid mind-map to steer a global society toward sustainability. The rivalry comes from fragmentation of civil society in the pursuit of profit and status. Only as conscious agents of a cultural revolution, which promotes a balanced synthesis of the exploitative and conserving segments of society, can we harness our species' ecological potential for a sustainable future.

The twentieth century opened with a revolution in humankind’s attitude to the environment. It sprang spontaneously from all branches of culture and from all countries across a Europe.  The discoveries of Einstein in outer space corresponded with those of Jung into the inner space of the subconscious. Biology began to shape the modern perspective of our place in nature.  The arts themselves exploded into a new environmental dimension. No longer was the inquiring mind satisfied with appearance.  Scientists and artists began to define the relationship between people and environment that was more comprehensive than the search for natural resources. Thus artists, such as Paul Klee and Jean Miro, set out to combine the invisible with the visible, the abstract with the figurative. They let themselves be invaded by the living world and then processed it in a very subjective manner.

===The cosmic adventure===
 
There are profound connections between stars, atoms and life that place human culture in the grand outline of the development of the universe.  This perspective has been called the 'cosmic adventure'.  

The adventure began in a hot and undifferentiated broth of radiation. Eventually, on our tiny planet in a remote corner of a small galaxy, there developed the incredible complexity of life, consciousness and culture.  We now appreciate that the universe has moved toward increasingly more intense forms of ordered novelty.   In this respect, we can say that it does have a direction, particularly here on Earth, where there is significantly more ordered variety than there was three minutes after the big bang. We have arrived throughout the fifteen billion years of cosmic development as part of a process that has kept a balance between pairs of primeval qualities.  These qualities are:

* harmony and contrast;  
* order and unpredictability; 
* unity and complexity; 
* pattern and nuance; 
* homogeneity and diversity; 
* stability and novelty.  

The existence of the universe and everything in it depends on the internal ordering, or tuning of its components.  As far as we can see, it was six numbers imprinted in the 'big bang' that have maintained the trajectory of cosmic ecology as a balance of qualities. Two of the numbers relate to the basic forces; two fix the size and the overall texture of the universe and determine whether it will continue forever, and two more fix the properties of space itself.  If any one of these numbers was slightly different at the start there would be no stars and no life.  Our universe is a rarity with the right combination of the key numbers to ensure that it survives and has developed as an intricately structured whole. Terrestrial evolution is the story of one such molecular outcome, as are the political and technological endeavours of nations of the earth are the social outcomes.

Physics and chemistry existed before human evolution and in this sense they define the non-human purpose of the cosmos as a physico-chemical process.  Therefore, in thinking about cosmic purpose we must separate ourselves from the modern bias that nature is a value- neutral canvas.  It does not remain blank until we have painted it with our cultural and political inventions.  The core of human distinctiveness is that we are capable of thinking about the internal ordering of the universe and our planetary systems so as to understand how these qualities are expressed.  We are also able to add value to them.

This attitude has an important bearing on the way we view our social and biological heritage in their cosmic, ecological and social dimensions. There are currently two views about the direction of cosmic development and our place in it.  After the universe was energised from the void, the ordering of novelty followed the sequence of energy, particles, stars, planets, materials and life forms.  Process theology takes the view that a programme of development according to divine will governed the direction.  Process humanism takes the view that our universe is just one of an infinity of universes bubbling up at random from the void. Most would be untuned.  

Process theology says that the self-creativity of all constituents of the cosmos willed by God deserve our care because they are especially intense actualisations of divinely inspired creativity and cosmic beauty.  When nature suffers, God suffers.

Process humanism says that to gain an appropriate sense of our human worth we need to become aware of our creative potential to work towards global order.  Therefore, intervention to maintain a balance of qualities that define our biological and social heritage, by ordering novelty and unifying complexity, is actually a small part of the grand cosmic purpose. 

Both points of view provide us with a knowledge framework for applying ecological thinking to culture that is deeply rooted in cosmology. Also, they recapture the ancient spiritual sense that we live in a meaningful and intrinsically valuable world and do so in a manner entirely consonant with contemporary science.  Humanity's origins and practical capabilities require it to participate in sustaining the cosmic process as a balance of qualities that define our place in nature as much as our attitudes to the use of nature expressed in technology, art, architecture and literature.  In particular, this vision involves recognising that conservation of biodiversity is not just for humans or valueless apart from them.

==Social applications of ecology==

Ecology deals with the interactions between species and the necessary conditions of existence in the environment to which they are adapted. These adaptations comprise webs of perception and action evolved to ensure resources are available to maintain growth and reproduction. Behavioural interactions are at the heart of the interactions where they function to unite individuals into more or less stable social structures. In particular, behaviour determines and regulates the relations of individuals to one another. It provides such external adaptations to the physical environment, and such internal adaptations between the component individuals or groups to make possible an ordered social life. Each species has a behaviour structure that is an evolved harmonious whole in order to maintain the sum of its parts in biochemical equilibrium with its environment. This structure survives and flourishes because it successfully maintains external social solidarity among its members, and chemical integrity amongst its internal organs and cells.

'Ecology' is used to define a particular type or branch of the relationship between living organisms and their environment e.g. aquatic ecology; avian ecology.  Where the species is a community of Homo sapiens, sharing a common heritage of ideas, beliefs values and knowledge, the interrelationship is called cultural ecology.  It includes an environmental complex of human activities undertaken for profit. The activities are concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services and the management of natural resources (land, forest, water), finances, income, and expenditure of a community, business enterprise, etc.  This highlights the fact that the subject matter of both ecology and economics, which are themselves interrelated, cannot be isolated from all the other social, ideological and political problems. Evidence for this are the categories of ‘political ecology’ and ‘social ecology’, which have emerged from the social sciences, to highlight the relationships between political and social organisations and environmental issues.

Applied ecology, being an instrumental mode of systems thinking, has a role to play, as behavioural structures in stabilising the humankind-nature relationship.  It is central to an educational system for sustainability, which presents exploitative management and conservation management as two sides of the coin of economic development.  Applied ecology provides the operational tools for environmental organisations and institutions interacting within a society, and constituting it.  It thereby contributes to group solidarity for planetary survival by providing practical solutions to the challenges of the industrialised environment.  A full understanding requires placing applied ecology in the context of systems thinking about the organisation of natural resources and people for production.  It is about providing tools for modifying human production by people who are organising for nature conservation. Ecology drives national, and global strategies by which these groups respond to ethical values in nature.

===Cultural ecology=== 

Culture first emerges within the ecosystems of primates where it is expressed in the learned group behaviours of food- gathering and display, which are local to a species in a certain place. In humans, culture appeared as the integrated system of learned behaviour patterns characteristic of members of a society. The system of behaviour constitutes a way of life of any given social group. It is also a social heritage, transmitted from generation to generation by individuals and organisations.  This heritage is instilled into the minds of the young, not only by initiation and education, but also by the long, unconscious conditioning whereby each individual becomes the person he/she ultimately is. It thus becomes a form of social heredity. As an evolved harmonious whole it ensures that all the institutions interacting within a society, and constituting it, contribute to group solidarity.

New relationships are being forged between culture and ecology in response to social concerns that arise because of the present state of the earth household.  One of these responses is the concept of ‘sustainability’, which is not a scientific term, but more a focus of social problems arising from the large-scale use of natural resources. These issues can only be solved by new social organisations, local and global, established to manage industrial production within the limitations of Earth’s ecological infrastructure.   There also has to be a new holistic cross-disciplinary social model, where knowledge about human social evolution is categorised to connect the social sciences with disciplines such as law, history, geography, education, and biology.  A start in this direction was made by Ramchandra Guha (1994) who argues in favour of creating an ‘environmentally orientated sociology’ for a world in environmental crisis by placing ecological infrastructure at the base of the traditional pyramidal model of society.  

In such a pyramid, consisting of ‘nature’, ‘society’ and ‘culture, the two functional pillars of social organisation are the organisation of people for production (political economy) and the organisation of natural resources for production (natural economy).  Both of these economies draw upon what may be called the planetary economy. This model of cultural ecology is provisionally set out in Fig 11.1.  Geographers and anthropologists mean different (but complementary) things by &quot;cultural ecology.&quot; In general, &quot;cultural ecology&quot; studies the relationship between a given society and its natural environment. But geographers generally mean the study of how socially organized human activities affect the natural environment; anthropologists generally mean the study of how the natural environment affects socially organized behaviours (although, at its extreme, environmental determinism has fallen out of favour among most anthropologists).

===Social organisation===

Wherever we find a community, however primitive, however complex, we find more than an association of individuals, each pursuing a personal own life and possessing personal ideas; we find a social pattern, a coherent body of customs and ideas, an integrated unity or system in which each element has a definite function in relation to the whole environment, physical, biological and social.

But what determines the pattern? The anthropological explanation is 'the necessary conditions of existence of the social organism'. To this the social institutions must correspond. In turn, the necessary conditions of existence, at any stage of social development, depend on the geographical situation and the level of technology. This is true from the Stone Age to the present age of industrialism. Basic to every form of social organization is the method of obtaining those items essential for human survival. In other words, how do the people of a particular society exploit natural resources to produce their food, clothing, tools, and other items that they need in order to live as human beings?

These 'necessary conditions of existence' shape the relationship of people to each other and their command of natural resources. Individuals utilize nature, directly or indirectly, to produce the necessities of life, not in isolation from each other, not as separate individuals, but in common groups and societies with shared, or conflicting, cultural norms.

====Political ecology====

Political ecology is an umbrella term for a variety of projects that involve politics and the natural environment. ese projects generally fall within one of three types:
* attempts to study politics using the language and methods of [[ecology]] (in other words, the claim that, like species of plants and animals, societies and states can only be understood in terms of their place in a larger system including other societies or states)
* the study of political struggles for control over natural resources, or of political struggles whose outcome is determined by differential access to natural resources
* research on biodiversity and natural resource exploitation that is intended to inform public policy.

When geographers and anthropologists refer to &quot;political economy,&quot; they generally mean the study of how different polities (states or societies) in different parts of the world are actually parts of a global structure through which one polity exploits another polity. This approach to political economy comes out of the works of Immanuel Wallerstein and Andre Gundar Frank, who argues that European development was made possible by the underdevelopment or impoverishment of non-European societies.

Geographical and anthropological political ecologists argue that a cultural ecology informed by political economy will:

* look at cultures not only in their natural environment, but in their political environment as well
* look at how unequal relations among societies affect the natural environment
* look at how unequal relations (especially [[Social class|class]] relations) within a culture affect the environment

====Social ecology====

''This section is the first five paragraphs from an open article entitled ‘A Social Ecology’ by John Clark in M. Zimmerman et al., Environmental Philosophy, second edition (Prentice Hall, 1997)''

&quot;Humanity is Nature achieving self-consciousness.&quot; --Elisée Reclus

In its deepest and most authentic sense, a social ecology is the awakening earth community reflecting on itself, uncovering its history, exploring its present predicament, and contemplating its future. One aspect of this awakening is a process of philosophical reflection. As a philosophical approach, a social ecology investigates the ontological, epistemological, ethical and political dimensions of the relationship between the social and the ecological, and seeks the practical wisdom that results from such reflection. It seeks to give us, as beings situated in the course of real human and natural history, guidance in facing specific challenges and opportunities. In doing so, it develops an analysis that is both holistic and dialectical, and a social practice that might best be described as an eco-communitarianism.

===== The Social and the Ecological =====
A social ecology is first of all, an ecology. There are strong communitarian implications in the very term ecology. Literally, it means the logos, the reflection on or study of, the oikos, or household. Ecology thus calls upon us to begin to think of the entire planet as a kind of community of which we are members. It tells us that all of our policies and problems are in a sense &quot;domestic&quot; ones. While a social ecology sometimes loses its bearings as it focuses on specific social concerns, when it is consistent it always situates those concerns within the context of the earth household, whatever else it may study within that community. The dialectical approach of a social ecology requires social ecologists to consider the ecological dimensions of all &quot;social&quot; phenomena. There are no &quot;non-ecological&quot; social phenomena to consider apart from the ecological ones.

In some ways, the term &quot;social&quot; in &quot;social ecology&quot; is the more problematical one. There is a seeming paradox in the use of the term &quot;social&quot; for what is actually a strongly communitarian tradition. Traditionally, the &quot;social&quot; realm has been counterposed to the &quot;communal&quot; one, as in Tönnies' famous distinction between society and community, Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft. Yet this apparent self-contradiction may be a path to a deeper truth. A social ecology is a project of reclaiming the communitarian dimensions of the social, and it is therefore appropriate that it seek to recover the communal linguistic heritage of the very term itself. &quot;Social&quot; is derived from &quot;socius,&quot; or &quot;companion.&quot; A &quot;society&quot; is thus a relationship between companions--in a sense, it is itself a household within the earth household.

===== An Evolving Theory =====
Over the past quarter-century, a broad social and ecological philosophy has emerged under the name &quot;social ecology.&quot; While this philosophy has recently been most closely associated with the thought of social theorist Murray Bookchin, it continues a long tradition of ecological communitarian thought going back well into the nineteenth century. The lineage of social ecology is often thought to originate in the mutualistic, communitarian ideas of the anarchist geographer Kropotkin (1842-1921). One can certainly not deny that despite Kropotkin's positivistic tendencies and his problematical conception of nature, he has an important relationship to social ecology. His ideas concerning mutual aid, political and economic decentralization, human-scaled production, communitarian values, and the history of democracy have all made important contributions to the tradition. However, it is rooted much more deeply in the thought of another great anarchist thinker, the French geographer Elisée Reclus (1830-1905). During the latter half of the last century, and into the beginning of the present one, Reclus developed a far-ranging &quot;social geography&quot; that laid the foundations of a social ecology, as it explored the history of the interaction between human society and the natural world, starting with the emergence of homo sapiens and extending to Reclus' own era of urbanization, technological development, political and economic globalization, and embryonic international cooperation.

Reclus envisioned humanity achieving a free, communitarian society in harmony with the natural world. His extensive historical studies trace the long record of experiments in cooperation, direct democracy and human freedom, from the ancient Greek polis, through Icelandic democracy, medieval free cities and independent Swiss cantons, to modern movements for social transformation and human emancipation. At the same time, he depicts the rise and development of the modern centralized state, concentrated capital and authoritarian ideologies. His sweeping historical account includes an extensive critique of both capitalism and authoritarian socialism from an egalitarian and anti-authoritarian perspective, and an analysis of the destructive ecological effects of modern technology and industry allied with the power of capital and the state. It is notable that a century ago Reclus' social theory attempted to reconcile a concern for justice in human society with compassionate treatment of other species and respect for the whole of life on earth; a philosophical problem that has only recently remerged in ecophilosophy and environmental ethics. 

==Historical models of communitarianism==

Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.  In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with, and supporting, a transport system based on private cars. Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years. Climatic change has started to unfold and the world is not a unified community with powers to produce a global technological fix.  Many are beginning to believe that in this scenario, sustainable development, with its adherence to annual year on year increases in spending power, is pointing in the wrong direction. Rather, what is needed is a sustainable economic retreat. This will require global strategies to adjust the relationship between production systems and natural resources to generate rates of waste emission that the biosphere can assimilate. 

In contrast, a market town in the 1850s was a small balanced community.  It represented the oldest kind of human institution, found absolutely everywhere throughout the world in all kinds of societies. Since the late Palaeolithic more than 100 billion human beings have lived on earth and the majority have spent their entire life as members of very small groups, rarely of more than a few hundred persons.  Their production systems were each composed of few people.  This picture is the staring point for ideas that there is a basic human need for small communities, which is encoded in our genes.  It is in our behavioural makeup that we still orientate towards a group; the small group of the village and the tribe.  Rural communities in the British 2001 Population Census are still small, yet market towns with their surrounding villages now lack any sense of communal focus or scale of production.  Their fragmented residential, commercial and cultural centres emphasise transportation by car so that the inhabitants also lack any sense of pedestrian scale.  Village and town are no longer serving as magnets for both people and ideas. People now seem to like isolation.  New housing infills are socially sterile. Everything is new clean and neat. Neighbours are usually only glimpsed as they walk to the car. Each house is a small fortress equipped with a barking dog or alarm system. The only visible activity is macho man cutting his lawns.  There are obviously great differences between old and new.  Leaving aside the crushing poverty, we can legitimately ask if a pre-industrial community was really a haven of creativity and neighbourly harmony, which could serve as a planning model for today’s social ills.  Have we really lost a unique combination of unity with social, visual and ecological variety?  Is there an historical small-town target that modern planners should use for social and ecological regeneration?  Planners, since their profession emerged in the late 19th century, have thought so. Nineteenth century society was based on ideas of mutual aid, political and economic decentralisation, human-scaled production and communitarian ideas (Fig 11.2). 

Fig 11.2 A small-town model of communitarianism.

[[Image:Fig11.2.jpg]]
 
These ideas of social ecology, as a recipe for human life, were first articulated at the end of the 19th century for an improved cooperative economy by the Russian geographer Peter Kropokin.  The Scottish planner, Patrick Geddes and his pupil Lewis Mumford developed them in Britain.  Americans have followed this path since the 1990s to restore the integrity of their basic institutions and turn back disturbing trends toward crime, social disorder, and family breakdown. The past decade has been an era of important social reforms: in the schools, in the criminal justice system, in family policy. In states and localities across the U.S.A, citizens have fought for greater emphasis on character, individual responsibility, and virtues and values in the public square. Partly as a result, on a host of &quot;leading social indicators”, such as rates of violent crime, rates of youth crime, levels of teenage pregnancy, and even student test scores, the nation is showing incremental but significant improvements. 

Communitarian ideas and policy approaches have been playing a major role in this growing North American movement of cultural and institutional regeneration. Communitarian thinkers are in the forefront of the ‘Character Education Movement’, which is fostering a return to the teaching of good personal conduct and individual responsibility in thousands of schools around the country. Likewise, communitarians have been playing a role in the new community-based approaches to criminal justice, which are showing solid success in restoring neighbourhood order and achieving real reductions in violent crime. In the area of family policy, communitarians have worked for policies to strengthen families and discourage divorce. They have led in devising fresh, incentive-based policies designed to discourage a casual approach to marriage and to promote &quot;children-first&quot; thinking and family stability, while at the same time preserving the rights of women and men.  The need for action has now reached the large politically influential community of the Evangelical Church, where a group of leaders, convinced of the science behind climate change, is trying to persuade its local membership to reduce their domestic carbon emissions.  Communitarianism has become a part of one of the most innovative movements working to renew and revitalize American society.

Yesterday in every town is now a piece of the history of this movement, and everyone who lived through the past twenty-four hours holds some of the public evidence that could be put towards learning about the past to better understand the present and shape the future.  The history of communities is in the making; it is not a dead thing to be pulled out and praised or deplored; it is the inhabitants who are custodians of the past, by the recording of the present. To make history part of the community’s social toolkit there has to be a reorientation of history towards ecology.  Social ecology is nothing more than an environmentally orientated study of a community, which explores a timeline of the relations between ecological infrastructure, politics, community organisations, the economy and culture.  The creation of small town models is therefore an important practical aim for the enrichment of cultural ecology as an educational resource.

==Systems thinking==

A '''system''' is any group of interdependent or interacting ''parts''. '''Parts''' are generally systems themselves and are composed of other parts, just as systems are generally parts or ''components'' of other systems. Systems thinkers consider that:

* a &quot;system&quot; is a dynamic and complex whole, interacting as a structured functional unit
* information flows between the different elements that compose the system 
* a system is a community situated within an environment
* information flows from and to the surrounding environment via semi-permeable membranes or boundaries
* systems are often composed of entities seeking equilibrium, but can exhibit oscillating, chaotic, growth or decay behaviours.

Systems thinking techniques may be used to study any kind of system; natural, scientific, social, or conceptual.  It was the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s concepts of an open system and general systems theory that established systems thinking as a major scientific movement.  He set out to replace the mechanistic foundations of science with the following holistic vision:

“General system theory is a general science of ‘wholeness’ which up till now was considered a vague, hazy, and semi-metaphysical concept.  In elaborate form it would be a mathematical discipline in itself purely formal but applicable to the various empirical sciences.  For sciences concerned with ‘organized wholes’, it would be of similar significance to that which probability theory has for sciences concerned with ‘chance events’ (Berlalanffy, 1968).

The advantages of systems thinking are:

* It helps explain why changing a system frequently leads to counterintuitive system responses.  For example [[feedback loop]]s may operate to either keep the organization in check or unbalance it.
* Traditional decision-making tends to involve linear cause and effect relationships. By taking a systems approach, we can see the whole complex of bidirectional interrelationships. Instead of analysing a problem in terms of an input and an output, for example, we look at the whole system of inputs, processes, outputs, feedback, and controls. This larger picture will typically provide more useful results than traditional methods.
*  Systems thinking also helps integrate the temporal dimension of any decision. Instead of looking at discrete &quot;snapshots&quot; at points in time, a systems methodology will allow us to see change as a continuous process.
*Systems thinking  aims to gain insights into the whole by understanding the linkages and interactions between the elements that comprise the whole &quot;system&quot;.  
* Systems thinking can help avoid the silo effect, where a lack of organisational communication can cause a change in one area of a system to adversely affect another area of the system.

These advantages are particularly valuable in studying the evolution and organisation of ecosystems.  In this respect, some of the basic principles of ecology, such as interdependence, recycling, resilience and diversity are concerned with processes organised as open systems.  In communities, information and ideas flow through networks of systems with feedback loops, which enable individuals and organisations to adapt to changing situations.  In this respect, systems thinking, which is behind theories of biological complexity and Earth’s self-sustaining properties, also provides foundations for conservation policies and action plans.

Black is threatened with Qf7#. He has seven legal moves that prevent this - surely one of them must allow him to avoid ruin?

:4...Qe7 and 4...Qf6 allow Nxe4 winning a piece, as without the queen to defend d5 the fork trick has had its prongs bent. 
:4...g6 allows Qxe5+ picking up the knight.
:4...Ke7 allows Qxe5# picking up the game.
:4...d5 gives the pawn back for nothing as after 5. Bxd5 the threat is renewed.
:4...Ng5 is met by 5. d4 forcing the knight to e6. Even if knight and king both survive the subsequent complications, White can regain the pawn and enjoy a whopping lead in development.

So by a process of elimination, it has to be

:[[/4...Nd6/]]

Which has the enormous attraction of attacking the undefended c4 bishop.

White has had the tables rudely turned on him! White must move the bishop or allow Black to free himself by capturing it. Keeping up the pressure on f7 would be a good idea, and for reasons that will emerge later he wishes to keep d5 free...

:[[/5. Bb3/]]

[[/5. Qxe5/]] is also plausible but is a complete anti-climax; once the queens are exchanged (5. ... Qe7 6. Qxe7 Bxe7) Black's game will be easier by orders of magnitude. If black needs more action, he can try 5. ...Be7 6. Qxg7 Bf6 7. Qg4 Nc6 (threatening Ne5 and Nd4 attacking c2) but after
8. Bc2 Black has about nothing for the pawn (the Knight d6 blocking the d-pawn does not allow a faster development and the king is not safe).

The position is imbalanced; Black is ahead by a pawn but behind in development. In searching for his next move he may choose two radically different developments: with

:[[/5...Nc6/]],

an apparently strength-cementing move, he enters into an extremely tactical opening, the so-called Frankenstein-Dracula variation, leading to a forced exchange sacrifice and a highly sharp position. On the contrary, with 

:[[/5...Be7/]] 

he opts for a quiet continuation.

                &lt;td&gt;Qd5&lt;br&gt;Qe7&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Nxc7+&lt;br&gt;Kd8&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Nxa8&lt;br&gt;b6&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;∞&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;

                &lt;td&gt;Nf3&lt;br&gt;Nc6&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Nxe5&lt;br&gt;0-0&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Could this example be a bit confusing to newbies to the language? --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 12:44, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

==Questions==

How do you use the distance program in eclipse?  It isn't obvious how points can be entered the command prompt seems unresponsive.

- Any ideas? [[User:161.112.83.102|161.112.83.102]] 10:40, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

This didn't compile for me until I changed:

...
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
   private static int intValue(String data)
   {
     return Integer.parseInt(data);
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

To:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
   private static int intValue(String data)
   {
     return java.lang.Integer.parseInt(data);
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

That said I really don't know what I'm doing here, and just got the idea to try that off of some random googling.  Should the page be changed, or maybe there's a better fix.  --[[User:Keithonearth|Keithonearth]] ([[User talk:Keithonearth|talk]]) 19:09, 21 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Java allows to document the classes and the members by using a particular syntax of comment.

== Syntax ==
A documentation comment is framed by slash-star-star and star-slash (i.e. /** ... */). The documentation is in the HTML format.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 8.1: Example.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5&quot;&gt;
/**
    A class to give an &lt;b&gt;example&lt;/b&gt; of HTML documentation.
*/
public class Example {
    /** ...Documentation of a member with the type integer named example... */
    public int example;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A documentation comment is placed just above the commented entity (class, constructor, method, field).

In a documentation comment, the first part is a description text in the HTML format. The second part is a list of special attributes whose name starts with an at sign (@):

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 8.1: Documentation comment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-6&quot;&gt;
/**
    Get the sum of two integers.
    @param a The first integer number.
    @param b The second integer number.
    @return The value of the sum of the two given integers.
*/
public int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
;&lt;code&gt;Get the sum of two integers.&lt;/code&gt;: Description of the sum method.
;&lt;code&gt;@param a The first integer number.&lt;/code&gt;: Description attribute of the a parameter a of the method.
;&lt;code&gt;@param b The second integer number.&lt;/code&gt;: Description attribute of the a parameter a of the method.
;&lt;code&gt;@return The value of the sum of the two given integers.&lt;/code&gt;: Description attribute of the value returned by the method.

Here is a non exhaustive list of special attributes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
! Attribute and syntax
! In a comment of ...
! Description
|-
| @author ''author''
| class
| Name of the author of the class.
|-
| @version ''version''
| class
| Version of the class.
|-
| @deprecated ''description''
| class, constructor, method, field
| Flags the entity as deprecated (old version), describes why and by what replace it.

If the entity flagged as deprecated by this attribute is used, the compiler give a warning.
|-
| @see ''reference''
| class, constructor, method, field
| Add a link in the section &quot;See also&quot;.
|-
| @param ''id description''
| constructor and method
| Describes the method parameter.
|-
| @return ''description''
| method
| Describes the value returned by the method.
|-
| @exception ''type description''
| constructor and method
| Describes the reason of the throw of an exception of the specified type (&lt;code&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause).
|}

See also [[Java Programming/Annotations/Introduction|annotations]] since Java 5.

== Documentation ==
The JDK provides a tool named javadoc which allows to generate the documentation of the well commented classes. The javadoc command without argument give the complete syntax of the command.

Example : for a class named &lt;code&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt; defined in a package named &lt;code&gt;org.wikibooks.en&lt;/code&gt; dans le fichier &lt;code&gt;C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\Example.java&lt;/code&gt; :

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-2&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 8.2: Example.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en;

/**
    An example class.
*/
public class Example {
    /**
    Get the sum of two integers.
    @param a The first integer number.
    @param b The second integer number.
    @return The value of the sum of the two given integers.
    */
    public int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The documentation can be generated in a specific folder (C:\ProgDoc for example) with the following command:
{{XConsole|1=&lt;span id=&quot;command-1&quot;&gt;'''Command 8.1: Documentation generation'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ javadoc -locale en_US -use -classpath C:\ProgJava -sourcepath C:\ProgJava -d C:\ProgDoc org.wikibooks.en
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

The options of this command are described below:
;&lt;code&gt;-locale en_US&lt;/code&gt;: The documentation in US English.
;&lt;code&gt;-use&lt;/code&gt;: Create the pages about the use of the classes and the packages.
;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;-classpath C:\ProgJava&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: The path of the compiled classes (*.class).
;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;-sourcepath C:\ProgJava&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: The path of the source classes (*.java).
;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;-d C:\ProgDoc&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: The path where the documentation must be generated.
;&lt;code&gt;org.wikibooks.en&lt;/code&gt;: The name of the package to document. It is possible to specify several packages, or one or several class names to document only those ones.

The description page of a package copy the description text from the file named &lt;code&gt;package.html&lt;/code&gt; which should be placed in the given folder. In our example, we should document the package in the file &lt;code&gt;C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\package.html&lt;/code&gt;.

Since Java 5&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#packagecomment&lt;/ref&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;package.html&lt;/code&gt; file can be replaced by a special Java file named &lt;code&gt;package-info.java&lt;/code&gt; containing only the package declaration preceding by a documentation comment.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-3&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 8.3: C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\package-info.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-4&quot;&gt;
/**
  This fake package is used to illustrate the Java wikibook.
  at &lt;i&gt;en.wikibooks.org&lt;/i&gt;.
*/
package org.wikibooks.en;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Locating Information on Behalf of Clients''' is a core unit in both the Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes.

== Introduction ==


This unit aims to develop your skills in '''working logically through the steps of a reference enquiry''', typical for a public library, using Internet resources. 


'''Reference and enquiry work''' has always been an integral part of the public library service. Nowadays many queries are answered using '''electronic''' rather than print sources. However, the '''processes''' and '''strategies''' used are the same with both print and electronic searches. So, any '''experience''' you have gained in answering queries through printed reference sources will enhance your competence in electronic searches.


Enquiry work can provide library staff with a great deal of '''job satisfaction'''. No two enquiries, or enquirers, are exactly the same – so searches for information are varied. Sometimes an information search will present a real intellectual challenge and require you to adopt an innovative or ingenious approach to tackling the enquiry. In such cases getting the required result for the enquirer is doubly rewarding. An effective enquiry service enhances the library’s '''reputation''' with its clients and creates a positive image for library staff – as professional, efficient and helpful people.


If you are a member of staff in a public library who deals with information enquiries from clients and answers them using the Internet, you will have developed some or all of the expertise required for this unit. Read through the following information carefully. It summarises the '''knowledge and skills''' which you need in order to produce evidence of your competence.

The unit involves interacting with library clients, establishing their information needs and using the Internet to search for the required information. This must be done in a real library environment and you will need access to the Internet, preferably broadband. Specifically you are asked to:


'''Define the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client'''

The main knowledge and/or skills required are:

*reference interview techniques
*open and closed questions
*determining the nature of information to be provided– quantity, level, format
*constraints – deadlines for completion, currency of information and language


'''Create a search strategy to fully satisfy the enquiry'''

The main knowledge and/or skills required are:

*choice of search terms
*structuring the search
*common search engines
*directories
*meta crawlers
*portals
*bibliographic databases


'''Evaluate the results of the search in terms of validity of information found and its appropriateness in meeting the client’s needs'''

The main knowledge and/or skills required are:

*validity of information - reliability, accuracy and currency
*measuring success of search in terms of client’s requirements – sufficiency, format and language
*structuring and saving of search results for presentation to client, later retrieval, future updating


'''Assessment'''

The unit is assessed through four short searches and one extended search. These will be searches related to typical information needs of public library clients. Some examples are:


'''Short Searches'''

Finding out:

*the current community charge rates in your locality
*the sequel to a novel which the client has recently read
*the post code of a firm for which the client knows name, street and town
*whether UK citizens require a visa to visit Thailand


'''Extended Search'''

A client wishes to explore the topic of asylum seekers in Britain. You would produce information giving Government policy, views of other political parties, statistics on immigration etc.


== Defining the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client ==


=== The Reference Interview ===


Defining the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client is often referred to as the '''reference interview'''. However, you may not carry this out face to face. Instead you may carry out the interview over the telephone or through a series of e-mails. It is undoubtedly easier and quicker though if you can manage to meet the client.


There are three main stages here:

*Finding out what the client wants to know
*Finding out why the client wants the information
*Finishing off the reference interview


==== Finding out what the client wants to know ====


Before you can answer a question posed by a client, you must '''find out exactly what that question''' is. Experienced colleagues will be able to tell you of many situations where there has been a '''misunderstanding''' with a reference client, resulting in wasted time and effort and sometimes embarrassment.  


Whichever means of communication you use, do remember that the reference interview is a '''two-way interaction''' or '''dialogue''' and you must take responsibility for the '''efficiency''' of the communication process. 


The interview is likely to begin with the client asking you a question. Your task is to probe further until you are '''fully satisfied''' that you are clear exactly what the client wishes to find out. Remember to ask for '''clarification''' from the client about the topic, e.g. ask them to spell uncommon words, expand on the topic under investigation etc.


==== Finding out why the client wants the information ====


It is extremely helpful if you can establish early on in the interaction the reason '''why the client wishes the information''' requested. Tact may be required here, however, as some clients may be unwilling to give this information. This is especially likely where the enquiry is of a '''sensitive or confidential nature''', such as a medical or financial problem. If the client appears uncomfortable or evasive when asked why the information is being sought, then it is unwise to probe further.


You should ascertain the '''starting point''' of the enquiry in order to avoid time being wasted on finding information which the client already knows. Ask whether the client has already undertaken any research on the topic and what the results of this were. This can give guidance on successful and unsuccessful information searching approaches. But do not write off a particular approach just because a client assures you that it has yielded no information. Remember the client is not an information specialist – you are! – and so the client may not have searched as thoroughly or as efficiently as you would.


==== Finishing off the reference interview ====


By the end of the reference interview you should be confident that the nature of the enquiry has been fully explored and that the information required by the client has been specifically defined. The reference interview also provides the opportunity to establish any special needs of the client e.g.: visual or auditory impairment.


And finally, do remember to record contact details for the client. In the excitement of exploring the enquiry and establishing the client’s precise needs, it is all too easy to forget this important information. So make sure that every reference interview ends by your recording name, address, telephone, fax, e-mail details, as appropriate. If you will be phoning the client, it is also polite to note when it is convenient for the client to receive your call.

=== Spoken and written communication ===

Good communication skills are key to the reference interview.  This topic provides a good opportunity for practising and refining your communication skills.

----
[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list the key factors you think would lead to good communication in a reference interview. Write these down on a piece of paper.

----



==== Factors leading to good communication ====


We think the important factors are:

*Appropriate spoken language
*Appropriate body language
*Good feedback especially on the telephone
*Good note taking skills 
*Clear and grammatical e-mails 


==== Spoken language ====


You should use language which is appropriate to the client, avoiding talking down to the client or, at the other extreme, baffling the client with specialist jargon. If you do have to use a term which the client may not understand, e.g. “bibliography”, be sure to explain it. 


For example, how would you explain “search engine” to a client who is not familiar with this term?


You might say something like “A search engine allows you to search for websites related to a particular topic. To use a search engine, you have to choose and type in appropriate key words describing the topic


==== Body language ====


In face-to-face situations, use appropriate body language designed to set the client at ease and promote effective communication. Smile and greet the client by name if possible. Lean forward slightly and use eye contact to show your interest in the conversation. Try to carry out the interview in a place where both you and the client are sitting comfortably and at the same level, preferably side by side.


What would you deduce from the body language of a client who fidgeted during the reference interview?


The most likely explanations are that the client:

*is in a hurry, perhaps because of another appointment
*may feel nervous in the library environment or about asking for your assistance with their query.


Test your understanding of body language with this simple quiz - http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/interviews/nvc.htm

==== Feedback ====


With telephone communications you will have to be careful in order to make sure that you fully understand what the client says because you will get no clues from their body language.  You should use appropriate feedback techniques to ensure understanding of the client’s responses. For instance, you might:

*Rephrase what the client has said and repeat this back to them
*Ask if you can read out a summary of the enquiry based on the notes you have made.


See if you can pick up clues from the tone of the client’s voice. Conversely, make sure that your tone is positive and encouraging. Smiling as you speak into the phone generates a pleasant tone of voice which encourages helpful responses.

==== Note taking ====


In both face to face and telephone interactions, it is essential to take '''written notes''' of the main points of the conversation. These notes are your reference for checking that you have fully understood the details of the client’s enquiry.


You may have to put the query on one side for actioning later or you may pass it on to a colleague to deal with. In both cases a written record will be essential.


==== Writing e-mails ====


If you are using e-mail to communicate with the client, it is important to establish a cordial tone while remaining concise and to the point. Writing clearly and grammatically is key to this, as is structuring your e-mail so that the client can follow it easily and respond appropriately.

The correct sequence for actioning an e-mail enquiry is as follows:

#Thank the client for the enquiry
#Summarise what the enquiry consists of
#Give your proposals for how you will action the enquiry 
#State when you will provide the search results 
#Request confirmation from the client that your proposed actions and timescale are acceptable

=== Open and Closed Questions ===


In the reference interview, you will use both '''open and closed questions'''. These have different uses. It is important to be able to distinguish between the two types of question and to use them appropriately.

'''Closed questions''' prompt yes/no or short factual answers, such as:

Q. What time did you come to the library? 
A. 9 o’clock


Q. Is your daughter called Amelia Austin? 
A. Yes


Closed questions are mainly used in the reference interview context to:

*elicit specific pieces of information from the client  
*gain confirmation that the your understanding of what the client has said is correct - an important feedback tool


The following are examples of closed questions:

''Do you use a left-handed mouse?''

This is a closed question which will be answered by yes or no. 


''What is the charge for printing a page of A4 text?''

This is a closed question which will be answered by a specific sum of money such as 10p.


'''Open questions''' encourage longer answers, such as:

Q. Why did you ask for a dictionary? 
A. I wanted to check whether there was a difference in meaning between “main” and “mane”.

The main uses of open questions in the reference interview context are to:

*establish rapport with the client
*set the scene for the enquiry
*gain background information which is relevant to the enquiry 

The following are examples of open questions:


''What will your students be using this information for?''

A typical reply might be: &quot;These are students undertaking an initial course in professional cookery. They will need the data to understand the calorific content of the foods in the recipe.”


''Can you tell me how you went about looking for this information?''

A typical reply might be: &quot;I started off looking up autism in the encyclopedias but the information was too general and not up to date enough. 


You will use both open and closed questions at appropriate times. When framing a question, always think of the type of response you hope to generate and word the question so as to encourage either a brief or an extended answer.


=== Nature of information required ===


Apart from the actual topic of investigation, there are other factors which need to be taken into account before a member of library staff will embark on the information search. 


There are three main factors:

*the quantity of information required
*the level of information required
*the format of information required



==== Quantity ==== 

What appears to be the same request for information could produce results differing in quantity by orders of magnitude. You must clarify the scale of information required by the client in order to fully satisfy their needs.  


It may be that reference to a single book or website is required. Alternatively many in-depth sources of information may be required so that the client can analyse a breadth of opinion on the search subject.  


Providing too much information is just as unhelpful as providing too little.

==== Level ====


It is essential that the information provided is at a level of complexity which enables the client’s full comprehension but does not patronise the client or tell them what they already know.  

The following points are a good guide:

*the client’s age (but remember age does not automatically bring wisdom!)
*the client’s educational attainment
*the client’s display of specialist knowledge
*the client’s linguistic ability
*whether the information is intended for the client themselves or for use by other people.


Tactful questioning can be used to make an estimation of the points listed above.


==== Format ====


The results may include information in various formats.


Difficulties may arise if the client has expressed an initial preference for a format in which the information is not actually available.  If the information is only available in a limited number of formats, you must alert the client to this and ascertain if any of these formats are acceptable.

If the search is not carried out with the client present, you must ascertain if the client can visit the library at a later time to access the search results or if the information must be in a format which can be e-mailed or posted to the client.


There are many formats available, including several as a result of the introduction of ICT.  Your search may direct the client to items of library stock, to be used in the library or borrowed for home use. This could include:

*Printed reference sources or information CD-ROMs
*Books, audio or video material for home borrowing
*Magazines and journals
*Pamphlets or leaflets


The search results may be bibliographies or lists of website references for the client to follow up. The results may be viewed on screen by client, in the form of text, audio or video.






== Create a search strategy to fully satisfy the client’s enquiry ==


=== Choosing search terms ===


Searching for information using the most appropriate key words is important in any reference enquiry. But it is arguably even more important in an Internet search than when you are looking through printed indexes. When carrying out a manual search, the human mind can make links and jump from one search term to another. Computers on the other hand stick strictly to the script and will only find information which matches what you have instructed them to look for.


Let’s look at how you can derive the search terms for an enquiry. You must be able to analyse a topic and break it down into its component parts.  At its simplest you just extract the significant words, usually the nouns and verbs, and use these as search terms.  An example would be a client asking for information about “How would you cook a vegetable like fennel?” Which word(s) would you choose as search term(s) in this enquiry?

The best choice would be &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;fennel&quot;  - these two words are the essence of the enquiry.  &quot;How would you&quot; is too general and &quot;vegetable&quot; would only be needed if there was some ambiguity over the nature of fennel.

The above is not necessarily true depending on the search tool you are using. For example if you use YouTube and type in - how do you... for almost any subject you will find video showing exactly what you want to know.

==== Examples of search terms ====


Here are some further examples of enquiries where you would be able to use one or more words from the client’s initial question as search terms. The search terms are in bold.

I need some advice on keeping a '''greyhound''' as a '''pet'''.

What are the '''symptoms''' of '''diabetes'''?

Who is the '''chief executive''' of '''CILIP''' (the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals)?

What '''colour''' is the flower commonly known as '''ragwort'''?


Of course, the question as posed by the enquirer may not contain words which are the best search terms. You may need to think of alternatives in the form of synonyms (words which mean the same) and words related to the terminology used by the client.


----
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''
	
List some reasons why synonyms and related words might be better search terms.

----

==== Synonyms ====

It is important to consider synonyms of a search term because the word given to you by the client may be one of many which describes the concept to be searched for, e.g. if a client wishes to know about illness, it may be useful to carry out a search with the word disease instead. 

 	
Try this example for yourself. Carry out two searches using the same search engine, the first with sports competitor as your search term and the second using sports opponent and look at the differences in the results. 


The term suggested by the client may be a less commonly used or out of date expression, so it is vital to think of more usual or appropriate synonyms. The client might ask about Ceylon when requiring information about the country now known as Sri Lanka. It would therefore be appropriate to search under both Ceylon and Sri Lanka.


If you have time test your knowledge of the English language here - http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/tests/synonyms.htm

==== Related terms ==== 

Sometimes it is useful to use a related term for the word given by the client. When a client asks for information on malnutrition in Africa, a related term could be used instead of the rather broad one.  An individual country could be substituted, such as Sudan.  Of course, you must take into account that using related terms can change the nature of your search. In this example, using Sudan will give you results which are influenced by the particular problems suffered by this country which differ from other parts of the continent.

Can you come up with one or more potentially useful related terms in searching for each of the following?

*web 2.0 applications in a library context
*genetically modified crops
*popular music in the 1960’s
*saving using insurance policies 
*capital punishment in the USA

Some examples are:

For web 2.0 applications you could use social media

For genetically modified crops: Frankenstein seeds, Monsanto, soya 

For popular music in the 1960’s: the name of any singer or group from this era – the Beatles, Dusty Springfield 

For capital punishment in the USA: death row, electric chair, gas chamber, names of individual states where capital punishment is used e.g. Texas

Another aspect to be considered when choosing search terms is that while the client may give you descriptive terms for the information required, it may be more effective to search on actual names of individuals or organisations or concepts.  Taking the earlier search regarding malnutrition in Africa, the description malnutrition could lead you to search using the key words World Health Organisation.   This will lead to the WHO site where information on diseases in specific African countries is quickly located.

Can you come up with a name of an organisation or individual which could be a useful specific term in searching for each of the following?

horse racing
the royal family
relativity theory
college courses


There are many related terms which apply to each of these. Here are the examples which we thought of:

Shergar, British Horse Racing Board

The name of any member of the royal family, such as the Prince of Wales

Albert Einstein

The name of your local college

Note that the previous three techniques depend both on your ability to interpret the client’s description and on your own general knowledge.  With experience and in discussion with knowledgeable colleagues, your skills will increase.

==== Ambiguity ====

You should also keep in mind that some words are ambiguous. China can mean a country in the Far East or pottery products. The English language is particularly rich in such ambiguities. In the reference interview you will have clarified the meaning of any such ambiguous words. Now at the search stage, you should either use a non-ambiguous synonym (if one exists) or add an additional search term to remove the ambiguity.

Some simple examples are:  

Cycle – is it the bicycle or a rotation?
Yarn –  could mean thread or a tall story.
Kids – could lead to children or young goats.

=== Structuring an Internet search  ===

As an information professional, you need to know all the shortcuts to information that client’s request.  This means more than just typing search terms into Google!  

Structuring the search involves the choice of different search engines, metacrawlers, directories and portals or, where you are already familiar with appropriate websites and their content, direct interrogation of these.

In order to search effectively on the Internet, you need to be familiar with the different types of websites used to search for information.  Three general types are the search engine, the metacrawler and the directory.  Each operates and is used in a different way, although several sites incorporate more than one type.  For example the Google site consists of both a search engine and a directory.


==== Search Engines ====

A '''search engine''' is a website that allows you to input words representing your search terms and uses these to come up with a list of websites which should be relevant to your search. Repeating the same search using different search engines may lead to different results due to the way in which the various search engines search the web and order the 
sites found. You should have experience of a selection of search engines to understand their similarities and differences.   It can be illustrative to make identical searches on a number of search engines and observe the different results.  

There are many different search engine sites.  It is important to have a grasp of a few of the most important sites, i.e.: those that lead quickly to useful information. This can be because they specialise in a particular sector are well funded and thus comprehensive. (Such sites are popular and so command large fees for their advertising services.)



----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Start by familiarising yourself with some of the popular search engines which will be important in your information searching. Go to each search engine listed below and try out the search term '''British planes'''. Do not bother to use capital letters in the search terms as the search engines do not really take them into account.


*'''Google''' at http://www.google.co.uk 

*'''Yahoo''' at http://uk.yahoo.com/ 

*'''Clusty''' at http://clusty.com/ 

*'''Ask Jeeves''' at http://www.ask.co.uk/ 

*'''Bing''' at http://www.bing.com/

Note down what you find in the layout and types of information displayed.

----

You will find four rather different results.  Even if the same results were displayed (which is unlikely given the slightly vague search term), each search engine presents the information in a different manner.

==== Differences between search engines====

Google and Yahoo are somewhat similar with a simple list but Google presents wikipedia pages and news near the top.

Ask Jeeves starts off with a list of commercial sites, all wanting to do business with you and only lower down shows you ‘real’ results.  But in its favour, there is a list of related searches down the right hand side.

Clusty is at first similar with a list of results and a few advertisements but there is a very useful feature in that down the left hand side, it clusters the results in categories which it has discerned.  


----
 
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3'''


Try Clusty out with the search term '''organ''' and you will see the value of the category feature.  Because organ is ambiguous as a search term, Clusty very neatly categorises its results into organ as a musical instrument and parts of the body.  You can see that in this way Clusty can lead you to a set of results more focused that the other three search engines.

----

Of course none of these search engines is perfect and it would unwise to rank one above another.

==== Compound queries ====

Note that our search terms consisted of two words, '''British''' and '''planes'''.  When you look down the results at all four websites, you will see that only sometimes are the two words adjacent and that some of the results only have one of the words present.  Most search engines have the convention that to indicate the compound term the words should be in quotes i.e.: '''“british planes”'''.  


----
 
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4'''

Try this out with '''jersey cows'''. Enter the two words with and without quotes and compare your results.

----


Try to get as much experience as you can in using different search engines. You will learn that although using only Google, say, will give you lots of results, the use of a few different engines may give you a better overview of the range of information available for any chosen search topic.


==== How search engines work ====

It is helpful to know a little about how search engines work.  In simple terms, they search the Internet and look at the websites and their contents.   They index the information they find on the site and in the metadata descriptions placed on each site by its creator. This information is used to lead from your search terms to the results.  Of course each search engine uses its own particular methods.  You can find out more about this either by doing a search or looking for information on the actual search engines.

This matching does have its pitfalls and if using ambiguous search terms you may get at best many useless results and at worst offensive ones.

 

==== Metacrawlers ====

Based on the maxim that more is better, Metacrawlers apply your search terms to several search engines simultaneously.  Metacrawlers come in many forms and are sometimes described as '''meta search engines'''.


----
 	
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4'''

Familiarise yourself with some of the popular metacrawlers which you can use in your information searching:

Go to each metacrawler listed below and try out the search term '''British planes'''.


*'''Dogpile''' at http://www.dogpile.co.uk/  

*'''Surfwax''' at http://www.surfwax.com/ 

*'''Mamma''' at http://www.mamma.com/ 

*'''Ixquick''' at http://www.ixquick.com/eng/


Note down what you find in the layout and types of information displayed.

----


Again there are different results and some very different layouts.  

One major reason for using metacrawlers rather than individual search engines is that you hope to get a good spread of the best information.  We would suggest that this works best early in a search to get and idea of the breadth of the information available. 

Using a metacrawler also saves you having to visit each of the individual search engines.

==== Web directories ====

Unlike search engines, web directories do not search for you but are arranged as an alphabetically ordered index to the web, developing into a '''tree structure''' of levels of sub-categories.  This is somewhat similar to the subject index in a print encyclopedia.

Directories can be very useful in allowing you to home in on the general area of a reference search.  However there are countless directory sites, many of which are poorly maintained.  Poor maintenance manifests itself with broken links or links to inappropriate material. You should make yourself familiar with the good examples of directories and we will examine some 
of these now.

General purpose directory sites are provided by many search engines: Google and Yahoo are examples.  Most confusingly they show both the categories which you can descend and a search facility which looks like the web search but is in fact used to search the categories.

 
----
	
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.5'''


Examine some of the general purpose web directories which you can use in your information searching:

Go to each directory listed below and try to look for information on flower arranging:



*Yahoo at http://dir.yahoo.com/ 

*Open directory at http://dmoz.org/  

----

==== Differences between directories and search engines ====

One key difference between the directory and the search engine is that the entries in the directory should be compiled ‘by hand’ and not through automated searching. This may be seen as an advantage if you consider that a human is better at categorising the sites i.e. spurious sites may be eliminated.

We feel that the really useful directories are the more focused examples, such as http://www.webdirectory.com  relating to environmental information.  You can also appreciate that browsing through the tree structure of the directory can be time-consuming and will not automatically lead to a result.

 
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.6'''


There is a tremendous amount of information available at http://searchenginewatch.com/ covering every conceivable aspect of information providing websites.

Have a look at this website for further tips.

----


An alternative approach is the use of Portals. 

 
==== Using portals ====

A portal is, at its most general, a website which offers grouped links leading to information. General purpose portals, such as www.msn.co.uk or www.yahoo.com, are often used as home pages by users and have links to life style sites. These sorts of general portals are rarely of use in answering information enquiries.

Some more specialised portals are tailored to be used say, to provide a child friendly web experience (e.g.: http://home.disney.co.uk/), as they give relative safety from inappropriate material. 

Other specialised portals focus on particular topic areas and it is these which can save you time in answering reference enquiries.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.7'''


Familiarise yourself with some of the portals which you can use in your information searching. Go to each portal listed below and get a feel for the information you could access through it.


*'''DirectGov''' at http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en  

*'''Wine.Com''' at http://www.wine.com/ 
 
*'''Visit Scotland''' at http://www.visitscotland.com/ 
 
*'''Irish Abroad''' at http://www.irishabroad.com/ 
 
*'''Connects''' at http://www.connects.org.uk/ 
 

----


There are thousands of portals.  With experience you will get to know a number of useful ones for sourcing specific information.

==== Using bibliographic databases ====

Bibliographic databases permit the retrieval of information in a variety of formats and media. Some of these are commercial subscription services, e.g.: www.booksinprint.com. You must be aware which databases your library subscribes to. If you do not know this already, check it out now.

Other bibliographic databases which are free of charge include the catalogues of major libraries – such as the British Library’s catalogues containing over 12 million books, serials, printed music and maps.  University libraries usually have online catalogue access, as do public libraries.  Booksellers’ databases can also be useful sources of online bibliographic information.

 
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.8'''


Familiarise yourself with some of the bibliographic databases which you might use in your information searching: Go to each site listed below and get a feel for the information you could access through it.

*'''British Library''' at http://www.bl.uk/     
*'''Cardiff University Library''' at http://library.cf.ac.uk/   
*'''Amazon''' at http://www.amazon.co.uk/  
*'''Blackwell’s''' at http://www.blackwell.co.uk/  

----


=== Frequently-used websites ===

It is useful to acquaint yourself with sites of major organisations which hold information relating to commonly asked enquiries.  Examples are government departments, your own local authority, major voluntary organisations and organisations of local interest.


---- 
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.9'''


Familiarise yourself with some websites which will be important sources of information for you: 

Locate the Government’s '''Home Office website''' and find the telephone number for General Enquiries
Locate the website for your '''local authority''' and find a list of the local councillors
Locate the website for the '''UK Citizens Advice Bureau''' and find the location of your local bureau.
Locate the website for your '''nearest airport''' and find a list of destinations flown to.

Now expand on this by thinking of other likely sources of specialised information and check out these websites for yourself.

----


==== Internal searches ====

As well as using search terms in search engines, you should notice that you can conduct a search within a website using the internal search facility provided by the site. A good example is the search facility within www.scottish.parliament.uk which permits searching by subject terms within specific areas of the site and for specified types of documents. This site has both simple and advanced search facilities.
	
Use the Advanced Search facility to find '''debates in the chamber''' which relate to '''apprenticeships'''.


=== Website suffixes ===	

When you are looking at websites, it is useful have an understanding of implications of the common suffixes used in the addresses for websites (called URLs).  Some suffixes give a clue about the nature of the organisation which owns the website. Note, however, that for some suffixes there is no absolute fixed rule for their use. Thus you would find that gov.uk always indicates a local or national government site in the UK. By contrast, although .org suggests a non profit-making organisation, there is no guarantee that this applies to every .org website.

Here is a list of common organisational suffixes and their meanings.

*'''.ac'''		'''Academic''' 
*'''.biz''' 		'''Business''' 
*'''.co'''		'''Commercial''' 
*'''.com''' 		'''Commercial''' 
*'''.edu''' 		'''Educational''' 
*'''.gov''' 		'''Local or National Government''' 
*'''.int''' 		'''International''' 
*'''.net''' 		'''Network''' 
*'''.org''' 		'''Non profit making''' 

 


==== Geographical suffixes ====

There are also '''geographical suffixes''' with .uk for the United Kingdom and .ie for the Republic of Ireland. The United States is the only country which does not use a suffix. The .us suffix exists, but is seldom seen.

 
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.10'''
	

Go to http://www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/domreg.html or another similar site and find the suffixes for Internet sites for the following countries:

*'''Australia'''
*'''Canada'''
*'''France'''
*'''Germany'''
*'''India'''
*'''Pakistan'''

----

== 1.3 Evaluate the results of the search ==


=== Validity of information ===


Information found on the Internet can sometimes be problematic. It is always important for the information professional to validate information found during a search, whether this results from printed or electronic sources. However, the information found in reference books and other printed materials in public libraries has usually undergone a rigorous selection process. Thus some of the validation of information has already taken place through the selection process.

This is not the case with Internet sites. Individuals or organisations can, at almost negligible cost, upload information to websites which are then accessible throughout the World. Such sites may present information which is out of date, biased to one point of view or just plainly wrong. So all information found on the Internet must be critically evaluated. This is an important role for the information professional. Non-specialists are less likely to query the information found on the Internet – perhaps they assume that it has been vetted in some way, just like the reference books in our libraries.

There are three main criteria for validating information: '''reliability''', '''accuracy''' and '''currency'''.


==== Reliability ====


There are a number of criteria which can be used to give you confidence in the '''reliability of the information''' on a website.

 	

----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list what you think are the criteria for establishing the reliability of a website.

----

 
==== Reliability criteria ====


We think that the following three points are very important:


*	'''the expertise and reputation of those connected with the website'''
*	'''evidence of lack of bias'''
*	'''evidence of equal emphasis towards all aspects of the search topic'''


 
==== Expertise and reputation ====


If you can see that the website is supported by a reputable organisation or contributed to by a person with known expertise then it is reasonable to accept the website as being reliable.  Examples would be where a website giving medical advice was run by a government department or a well respected charity e.g. '''NHS direct''' at http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ or  '''Cancer Research UK''' at http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/ 

Another more trivial example is that you would expect to find reliable recipes at '''Delia Smith’s''' website http://www.deliaonline.com/ 

 
==== Lack of bias ====


Individuals can be '''biased''' in their opinions.  Even well known experts may '''represent only one aspect''' of a topic.

Many websites by their very nature present information from only one viewpoint and are thus biased.  While such information need not necessarily be excluded from the results presented to the client, you must indicate any identified bias and, if possible, provide information from other sources which present opposing points of view. This is particularly important when the client is seeking information on '''potentially contentious matters''' such as politics, religion, race or issues related to pressure groups.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''


As an exercise in looking for bias in websites, search for a pair of websites giving opposing points of view on the following topics.


*	keeping a monkey as a house pet
*	the need for the UK Monarchy
*	the greenness of nuclear fuel
*	the usefulness of homeopathy


----

 
==== Opposing views ====


The following example sites were available at the time of the latest review of this section.


*	Opposing views on keeping a monkey as a house pet can be found at '''Monkeyzone'''  http://www.monkeyzone.com/  and at http://www.aspca.org/adopt/adoption-tips/exotic-animals-pets the website of '''American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals '''.
*	Opposing views on the need for the '''UK Monarchy''' can be found at the official UK Monarchy site at http://www.royal.gov.uk  and a Marxist perspective at http://www.marxist.org.uk/  
*	Opposing views on the greenness of nuclear fuel can be found at the '''Greenpeace''' website http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/  and that of the '''World Nuclear Association''' http://www.world-nuclear.org/ 
*	Opposing views on the usefulness of homeopathy at the site of the '''British Homeopathic Association''' at http://www.trusthomeopathy.org/   and the '''National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF)''' Position Paper on Homeopathy found at http://www.ncahf.org/pp/homeop.html 


Although the exercise and the results may seem a little trivial, it is useful.  The problem when you are faced with queries about these sort of contentious issues is that you will initially retrieve a site as a result of your information search which gives only one side of the case.  You must then search for the opposite, just as you have done here.

==== Equal emphasis ====


Emphasis differs from bias in that it is '''omission of information''' rather than deliberate over-statement of one point of view.  For example, US sites may devote little space to British developments. Another pertinent example in UK public libraries is that sites for UK government departments may include information only for England on devolved issues.

You should be aware that '''emphasis can be more difficult to detect than bias'''.  A solution is to apply the technique of '''cross checking''' with other sites on the same topic.

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.2'''


Look at the government website for the Department for Education http://www.education.gov.uk . Education is a devolved responsibility and thus varies considerably between the four UK nations. Much of the information on the DfES website applies only to England and sometimes Wales.


Compare the information about literacy strategy in schools with that given on:


*http://www.deni.gov.uk   	'''Department of Education Northern Ireland'''
*http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/education	'''Scottish Government Education and Training'''
*http://www.learning.wales.gov.uk 	'''Welsh Assembly Government Education and Skills '''


----

==== Accuracy ====


When you are looking for factual information you can usually assume that a reliable site based on the points above will attempt to provide correct data.  However, mistakes can be made and you should cross check data using more than one reliable site wherever possible.

 
==== Currency ====


In using the Internet you often come across websites which are seriously out of date.  In fact some of them are actually abandoned and will never be updated again.  When you use websites in your information searching, you must make sure that the information is current.  Of course with a reference book you can look at the publication date.  However for websites it is not just so easy.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list some points you could look for on a website to establish its currency.

----


==== Establishing currency ====

 
We can think of a few possible ways of establishing the currency of a website.  Obviously they depend on finding date information.  This can be explicit:

*	You can check the '''“Last revised”''' date on a website.  This is usually found on the first screen. Note that this may only indicate the last time a change was made to a particular part of the website and that it does not imply that '''all''' the content was updated on that date. 
*	You can look to see how recent are the '''publication dates''' of the documents referred to on the site
*	You can look out for '''dates quoted''' within text and make an estimate of currency
*	You might find a '''“Forthcoming events”''' list where all dates should be in the future, or in the very recent past.


In the absence of any explicit date information you may need to look at Indirect methods of establishing currency

 
==== Indirect methods of establishing currency ====


If there are no actual dates mentioned, you will need to look for more subtle indications that the site is regularly updated.

*	You can look for '''regulations or laws''' mentioned in the site and find their dates of introduction.
*	You can look for the '''names of institutions or Government departments.'''  These do change name and can be used to give a date range.
*	You can look for the '''names of personalities''' involved in the topic which can show currency.
*	Finally you can simply look for reference to '''recent news items''' which will date the site’s information.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.3'''


Look at http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/littlebritain/   This is a reputable site and it clearly states whether the site has been recently updated.

----

=== Measuring the success of a search ===


At the start of the enquiry process, during the reference interview you should have determined clearly the client’s requirements.  At the end of the enquiry process you must review the results of the search against these requirements in order to check that the search has been fully successful. 

In some cases you may not be able to fully satisfy the client’s requirements. If this happens, the reasons for this must be explained to the client e.g.: information does not exist in the format specified. You should propose some '''alternatives''' if these are possible.

There are three main criteria, '''sufficiency''', '''format''' and '''language'''.

 
==== Sufficiency ====


Is there '''enough information''' or '''too much?'''  If it is a straightforward fact being sought then you should have no difficulty here.  However for a more complex search you must make sure that you have not overdone the amount of data retrieved to prevent swamping the client and if necessary trim it a bit.  Conversely you must check that you have supplied enough information. If the client suggests that more would be appreciated, you can indicate tactfully that you have provided what was asked for but offer to search further if required.

 
==== Format ====


Make sure that the client’s requests for '''particular formats''', such as text, print-out, e-mailed results, audio or video have been met with.

 
==== Language ====


You should make sure that the client’s requests for information in a '''particular language''' have been followed.




 
=== Structuring and saving of search results ===


The raw data should be presented in a structured way which facilitates understanding by the client. In particular, it is important for the client to be informed of the '''source(s)''' of the information found.

For '''simple searches''', the result is likely just to be a '''short statement of fact'''. Here all that is required is that the information is presented '''clearly''' and '''unambiguously'''. However simple the information, we do recommended that it is given to the client in writing and that you keep a copy. That way there can be no argument later about the results. And having a written record means that the client does not have to depend on their memory to recall the information.

For searches which result in a considerable amount of information, you should present the results in some sort of '''logical order'''. Different orders suit different types of enquiry. 


==== Ordering results ====


You might adopt one or a combination of:


*	'''Following the progress of the search''' – “First I looked at the Food Standards Agency site and this told me….., then I moved on to the Association of Farmers Markets where I found…. etc.
*	'''Geographical order''' – grouping information from a country together
*	'''Chronological order''' – to show how a topic developed
*	'''Alphabetical order''' – if the result of the search is a list of references
*	'''By point of view''' – information on one side of the argument, then the opposing side.


These are only some possibilities and you should not feel compelled to choose one of these. The important thing is that your structure for presenting the information suits the topic and is helpful to the client.

 
==== Bibliographic references ====


If the results of your search include '''bibliographic references''', these should be quoted in a consistent and accepted style. You can find advice on this on the websites of most universities. A good example is the University of Warwick at  http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/main/help/guidespublications/bib_cit/ 

It is important to realise that your search and its results represent useful work, which does not simply end when the results are handed over to the client.  We can think of two straightforward cases where reference will be made to your work in the future.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding write down two possible reasons for archiving searches for future use.

----

==== Archiving searches ====


Ignoring the possibility that the first client loses the data and wants another copy of it (this can happen!), the most likely scenario is that another client comes into the library and asks the very same query.  Here, if you have stored the enquiry information properly, you can simply go to the search and produce a copy of the results.

In this case, the search results should be archived in such a way that the search can be retrieved by appropriate key terms. These will be subject key words.

Ideally the library should have a formal system for recording the results of '''frequently asked questions'''. You should be aware if your library service does this and, if so, make sure that you know how to add your information search results to this.

 
==== Frequently asked questions ====


One good example of a library database of frequently asked questions is Edinburgh University’s “Previously AnsweRed Questions – PARQs”.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.4'''


Examine Edinburgh University’s “Previously AnsweRed Questions – PARQs” site on http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/faqs/parqs.shtml and find the answer to the question “How much did the Forth Bridge cost?”

----

We think you will agree that this facility is very easy to use. Note how, in addition to answering the questions, the site points the enquirer to further sources of information by means of hyperlinks.

If your library service does not have a formal service-wide system like this, you should consider setting up a simple version for yourself and colleagues at your service point. This is relatively simple to do using a database package available in your library.

==== Updating data ====

 
Another situation where you may wish to revisit your search is where the same client reappears and wants you to '''repeat the enquiry''' at a later point in order to '''update the data''' or '''include new developments''' which have taken place since the original search was undertaken.

In this case it is important to save not just the '''search results''' but also the '''search strategy'''.  You will need to repeat the strategy in order to update the information found the first time.

You may find that certain enquiries have a habit of repeating at the same time each year. An example would be where pupils always undertake a school project on a particular topic at the beginning of each academic year. You know that every September a group of 12 year olds will descend on your library desperately seeking information on young people and drugs in the locality. In this case, you can even prepare yourself in advance by repeating your search '''before''' the question is posed, so that you are prepared to assist the young people with their information needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Revisions suggested by Benjamin Trice ==

* The name of this chapter is Stylesheets from the main chapter list, but it is listed as XSL at the top of the page upon entering the chapter.  Making hese items the same would help avoid confusion over which chapter a user is currently reading.

* When discussing line numbers from lines of code, the line numbers need to be listed to the left of the code.

* Under the XML to XML section, the sentence, &quot;These are copya nd copy-of,&quot; needs to be fixed.

* In the Templates section, the sentence, &quot;This allows you to process a node more once,&quot; nees to be fixed.

* Under the sorting section, the separation of those lines of code is confusing to look at.  It should be represented like the other lines of code and include its sample output after the code.

* Under Parameters and Values, fix the separated code into one solid section.

'''No Answers are given for the Exercises.  Future classes should answer them and add them to the wiki  book'''


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;b&gt;Editorial Board Revisions - Viji&lt;/b&gt;

'''some minor changes:'''

(2) what does XSLFO stand for

(3) &quot;one for a Unix man page&quot; probably should be 'main'
:Actually, it refers to [[w:Manual page (Unix)|Unix &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; pages]]. I changed it to &quot;manual page&quot; to be less ambiguous. --[[User:Jarkko Piiroinen|Jarkko Piiroinen]] 06:37, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

(4) eliminate the references to the code using line numbers - do not put line numbers in the code they dont match up or if incorporated directly they dont allow the user to copy and paste into an editor easily - you can copy and paste the code refered to here or just make it clear what you are refering to, by now people should be accustomed to finding tags

(5) &quot;This means that all elements must have a start-tag&quot; - I think it means to say &quot;an end tag&quot;

(7) the headline &quot;i the numeric value to be formatted&quot;, is the &quot; i &quot; extraneous? and what is going on with * numbers hanging out there by itself and * patterns under this heading (something seems awry here)

(8) change examples to fit with the tourguide model  - especially the CD collection example is straight from W3Schools, even that weird green color

(9) after fixing the parameter section code into one solid code, then describe each part - reference the code in the explanation (can use the code frags to reference)

Remember to move the exercises to another link and link to answers - refer to the single entity chapter for the format.

* you can give your presentation on the date you are scheduled to present, but, you and your interface team will have until April 15th to completely edit the Stylesheet section --- I think there will
be a lot of rearranging, consolidating, organizing, and especially reformatting code.

* We can work on the new stylesheet section at: contents page =&gt; chapter stylesheets =&gt; stylesheet section, so that students have the original material in its unedited form to refer to.

Thank You Ben!  I look forward to working with you on the Editorial Board!

== post revision comments ==

'''viji'''

*  I don't like using line numbers to refer to parts of code examples - it just forces the reader to count lines; I would rather see the code copied and pasted then commented on.  what do you think

*  the XSL material removed from chapters 3 thru 6 were not all incorporated such as: regex, operator (=, 
!=, &amp;lt;, etc.) - could we check to make sure that these are incorporated?</text>

=== What are these qualifications? ===


These qualifications are based on the training already carried out as during the People’s Network programme. They have been developed by the [http://slainte.org.uk Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)] and are accredited by the  [http://www.sqa.org.uk Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)]. The level of the qualifications is roughly equivalent to a UK Higher National Certificate or Diploma (HNC/HND), a US Associate Degree or years 1 and 2 of a UK or US undergraduate degree. Credit for approximately one year of study may be transferable to other academic programmes.


The '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), SLIC, CyMAL''' (the Welsh body) and '''DCAL''' (the Northern Ireland department) supported the development of the qualifications for use throughout the UK. SQA is currently exploring accreditation with the '''QCA (Qualifications &amp; Curriculum Authority)''' and articulation into higher education. The qualifications have been reviewed by content advisers from across the UK in order to balance any variation in the context of library service delivery and the learning materials contain UK-wide examples of best practice.

=== Who are they for? ===


These qualifications are appropriate to library staff in any sector: public libraries, higher education, further education, schools, health libraries, national libraries etc. They are suitable for experienced staff (by showing how ICT can used in traditional library work)and they are also suitable for '''new entrants''' to the profession. They may also be of interest to English-speaking library staff in other countries.


Candidates would normally be expected to have reached a reasonable level of general education, for example A-Level or SCE Higher and possess reasonable ICT skills, such as PC Passport or ECDL.

=== What is the content? ===

Summaries of the '''unit content''' can be found later in this document.

=== What support material is available? ===

A wide range of support material is available, including top-up learning material, assessment tools and electronic log-books to record assignments for authentication in the workplace. The top-up learning material is available in Wikibook format and also in an interactive web-based format at http://www.ictl.org.uk.

The top-up material includes activities, prompts and refresher learning. More than 600 pages of material have already been written and this is being expanded all the time. The top-up learning can be integrated with People's Network, cascade or new training and work-based practice.


=== How are they assessed? ===


Almost all of the assessment is of a practical nature and involves the completion of logbooks relating to workplace activities, essays and reports. Most assessments can be submitted online.


=== How do they relate to professional qualifications? ===


The qualifications support the '''CILIP Framework of Qualifications''' and can be used as evidence towards Certification, Chartership and Revalidation submissions. The Diplomas are based on reflective practice, and electronic logbooks make it easy to build portfolios. 


=== What are the benefits? ===


There are a number of benefits for individual and employers in supporting this development. Staff will have the chance to have their People’s Network learning accredited, improve their qualifications, gain academic credits for transfer into other courses or improve their promotion prospects. From the employer's perspective, the qualifications will contribute towards workforce development and meeting corporate quality agendas such as Investors in People and Charter Mark.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Foreword ==
&quot;When I tell you this story, remember it may change.&quot; - Sherman Alexei, ''Captivity''

When creating a completely original history, many people have a tendency to make either an ideal or a completely un-ideal world or society. One of the first things to realize is that you're working with an entire world. In creating its history, you are permitted to include multiple civilizations, each of which can be classified as ideal, un-ideal, or something in between. Or, you can make a single, unified civilization. Again, this civilization can change with time in whether it was good, bad, or just something else, as could any civilization in the first scenario. The possibilities are endless. 

You can base it in earth's history, and make allusions to earth humans being in the far past, almost forgotten (Rene Barjavel's novel ''The Ice People'' is a great example of this). Or, it can be totally original. When you start, however, it is usually a good idea to have at least some conceptions of what you want to create, so that you can get a rather decent Conhistory going. 

Remember, you may rewrite any part of this at any time, as none of it has to be true: remember also that the way history is told has much to do with who is telling it. Winston Churchill said &quot;History is written by the victors&quot;, but the conquered people also have their story to tell.

Be ready to be challenged if you include controversial subjects, such as an idealized world that uses a certain political structure. Well, let us begin constructing your &quot;ConHistory&quot;.

== Before You Write ==

=== Prepare for Writing ===

It is recommendable to get a notebook if you want to do this by hand. If you will do it on the computer, you may benefit from  using multiple files to write separate parts, but you may want to still have them open to gaze over. If you want to make this very long and drawn out, get ready for a lot of writing.

=== Your Civilization(s) in the Present ===

You don't need to write this for your Conhistory, but it helps to know where your history will lead up (or down) to in the end. If you skip this, you are being brave in not knowing where your conhistory will lead, or you know how it will lead, if only vaguely. If you have made a conlang of any sort, use things from it to help to shape what this world is now like. Consider politics, economics, sciences, art, and geography. Don't be afraid of verisimilitude in your ideal society, or glimmers of hope in your corrupt society. Don't be afraid to have something in the middle. Consider all that you know you want this to be. You can be as creative as you want here, and you can revise it alongside your Conhistory.

== Before your Civilization(s) (Past) ==

The rest of this wikibook covers most of this information. It is common for a Conhistory to reflect Earth's history, since we know that Earth's history is possible because it happened. You may have ideas about alternative progressions of technology and the like, but it is not a bad idea to start with the people in a small-scale state, being nomadic hunters, or maybe what they were before that. Often, you could include some kind of creation story/myth here, if you are going back that far (Tolkien would say that some kind of creation myth is imperative). Anything goes; you can start in the distant past, or later on in your conhistory, progressing through various ideas and events that lead up to your current society.

      <comment>Changed the Fortran to Fortran-programmer's Fortran; fixed questions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

This section is a quick reference on changing from other languages to Fortran.

==Common Mistakes==
Listed below are some common mistakes made when using Fortran by users of C or Java:
* Perhaps the most common mistake when moving from one language to another is to try to make the new language look or act too much like the previous language in use.  When switching to Fortran (for whatever reason) consider doing things the Fortran way, rather than as you would in some other language.
* In Fortran, variables need not be declared.  A new variable beginning with &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; (the &quot;in&quot; group) is an &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;.  A variable beginning with some other letter is a &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.  So, the disadvantage is that a typo could result in a new variable.  The advantage is that coding is fast and easy, in that for most cases, no variables need be declared.  If you want Fortran to act like declaration required languages, use &lt;code&gt;IMPLICIT NONE&lt;/code&gt; at the top of each program, function, and subroutine.
* Arrays are indexed from 1 to ''N'', not 0 to ''N''−1.
* Arguments passed to functions and subroutines are passed by reference and not by value.  Additionally, languages like C typically push each of their arguments onto the stack.  Many (if not most) Fortran implementations build an array of argument addresses, and push the address of that array (only) onto the stack.  This uses slightly more storage, but less executed code if you average more than 1 argument.  The C-user error occurs when you think you know the addresses of argument references.
* Note that arguments may need to be declared, and might not, as per the rules above.
* For fixed form code, the first 6 columns have special meanings, and you can only use the first 72 columns.
* Trying to use allocation too much.  When in Fortran, try to use static allocation of arrays whenever possible.
* Thinking you know how big a variable is -- Here are the rules:  &lt;code&gt;LOGICAL&lt;/code&gt; can be any number of bytes.  &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt; is at least as big as &lt;code&gt;LOGICAL&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; is at least as big as &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;DOUBLE PRECISION&lt;/code&gt; is at least as big as &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.  And finally, &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; is twice as big as &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.  Typically, the sizes are 1, 4, 4, 8, and 8 bytes, respectively, but don't rely on that if you're writing portable code.  A related mistake is thinking that &lt;code&gt;LOGICAL*4&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;REAL*8&lt;/code&gt; gives you data 4 or 8 bytes wide.  The number following the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;u&gt;suggestion&lt;/u&gt;, not a requirement.

==Variables==
C / C++
 int i;
 double x[3];
 double *y = NULL;
 y = new double[3];
 delete[] y;
 { 1, 2, 3}; // &lt;- Do the semantics match exactly?
Fortran (with two examples of allocation and deallocation -- don't use both at once)
 INTEGER i
 DOUBLE PRECISION x(3)
 DOUBLE PRECISION, DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: xx
 DOUBLE PRECISION, POINTER, DIMENSION(:) :: y =&gt; null()
 ALLOCATE(xx(3))
 DEALLOCATE(xx)
 ALLOCATE(y(3))                    ''! memory allocation for pointer - similar syntax to array allocation''
 DEALLOCATE(y)                     ''! again similar syntax as for array allocation / deallocation'' 
 (/ 1, 2, 3 /)

'''Caveat''': Fortran's arrays are more flexible than plain C arrays. By default they are indexed from 1 not 0.

They may be declared to be indexed by different means:

 REAL, DIMENSION(-2:10) :: A

means you can use A(10) as well as A(-2).

Multidimensional arrays should be declared this way:

 REAL A(5,7,10)

You will have 5*7*10 elements from A(1,1,1) to A(5,7,10).  Note memory is laid out in a way unique to Fortran.  The element in memory following A(1,1,1) is A(2,1,1), and not A(1,1,2).

You can use parts of array this way:

 REAL A(10,10)
 REAL B(3,3)

 B(1:3,2:3)=A(4:6,7:8)

will act as

 DO i=1,3
   DO j=2,3
     B(i,j)=A(i+3,j+5)
   END DO
 END DO

Which is the same as the archaic but shorter form

 DO 1 i=1,3
   DO 1 j=2,3
     1 B(i,j)=A(i+3,j+5)

==Functions &amp; Subroutines ==
In Fortran, &lt;code&gt;FUNCTION&lt;/code&gt;s return a value whereas &lt;code&gt;SUBROUTINE&lt;/code&gt;s do not. In C/C++ this is simply the distinction between returning a value or returning &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;. In Fortran, the name of the function is assigned to return a value from a function.
When calling, a subroutine is called with the &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword whereas a function is called as in C/C++. When there are no arguments, an empty parenthesis is not needed.

C/C++:
 int foo(int i, int j) {
   ...
   return 42;
 }
 // then later:
 int x = foo(1, 2);
Fortran:
 INTEGER FUNCTION foo(i, j)
 ...
 foo = 42
 END
 C then later:
 k = foo(1, 2)
C/C++:
 void bar(double j) {
   ...
 }
 void baz() {
   ...
   return; // Can return in the middle.
   ...
   return; // Optional for a function returning void.
 }
 // then later:
 bar(42.0);
 baz();
Fortran:
 SUBROUTINE bar(x)
 ...
 RETURN
 ...
 END
 SUBROUTINE baz
 ...
 END
 C then later:
 CALL bar(42.0)
 CALL baz

== Control structures ==

   ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">When going over the chapter, I noticed it's chock full of info, but a little tough to pay attention to the whole thing.  I plan on keeping the bulk of it but simplifying some of the real technical stuff.  Also, I plan on putting in some simpler definitions for some of the more important terms such as an &quot;element.&quot;  as far as the structure goes, it's fine except for some minor details like misnumbering of bulleted points.  Finally, i will redo the learning objectives and keep them more focused on more tangible subjects

'''Revisions by editorial board - Moussa'''

I think we will all agree on the fact that the chapter is too technical. While trying to write it in a simpler way, also try to had more spacings. 

* Add objectives and banner
* You should be very careful about putting new definitions: Just keep in my mind to name sources if you are using any; it would be much better to come up with your own – the editorial can review them for correctness.
* You should we do something about the contents, the titles look very confusing.
* Get rid of the coloring of xmlns:xsd, targetNamespace, ... just keep it black and bold.

==Professor==

I think the references to NetBeans should be deleted. This will help to simplify the chapter and make it editor-independent. 
I agree that the structure is OK.
The key is to explain these concepts in simple terms. The original author did quite a good job.

==Final comments - Moussa==
The new word shoud be in bold without color. The exercises should be a link and also another one for the answers. You can refer to the &quot;Author Guidelines&quot; for more details. I was expecting a bit more changes in the content, the name given in the bullets are not very consistent with what has been done in previous chapters.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smaller Landform Features ==

=== Mountains and Valleys ===

Mountains form near where tectonic plates collide, this may lead to earthquakes, floods and volcanic eruptions (or even tsunamis if near sea). Older mountain ranges tend to be eroded, and solitary mountains are usually volcanic. They often limit precipitation in the surrounding area, so deserts nearby are not uncommon. Until technology is developed which allows relatively safe passage through mountainous areas, mountains make for excellent natural defences for early civilizations. Any people who live in these areas and who do not rely on lower altitudes to grow food or keep livestock may be able to survive long periods of time without being invaded by others.

=== Rivers and Lakes ===

A few rules to follow concerning rivers is that they always flow downhill and never branch except when near a body of water. Because they nourish the soil around them and provide a method of transportation, settlements will often form around them. Trade can flow easily around rivers and people travel with them leading people further afield.

=== Climate (And Differences) ===

Most civilizations flourished on the enhancement of the elements. Arabs found water in the desert, Dutch Land out of marsh and so on. If a civilization lived in several environments it could enhance one and leave the rest uninhabited or enhance many and prosper. 

=== Natural Resources ===

Civilizations tend to use nearby resources wherever possible: A civilization with access to trees may build wooden houses whereas a civilization near a river uses bricks and writes on clay tablets.
Scarce resources have to be obtained by trade or by military means.

=== Proximity to Others ===

== Greater Landform Features ==

=== The Fertile Crescent ===

If designing an entire world from the earliest days of civilization or an extremely old nation, thought should be given to where on the planet civilization is likely to evolve first.

Civilization is widely believed to have originated in the Middle East, more specifically in a band of land called the Fertile Crescent. This area encompasses four major rivers. Starting with the Nile River in the west, the Crescent contains the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and finishes with the Indus River in the east. All rivers, when they flood, deposit large amounts of mineral-rich silt on the flood plan, which are excellent areas to grow crops. It is believed that having so many of these highly fertile rivers in a concentrated area, allowed the early inhabitants the opportunity to grow more food per hectare with the same amount of labour that would normally be required. Thus, as fewer people were required to toil the land, labour could diversify and individuals could begin to specialise in other roles, such as warfare, science and medicine.

=== East and West vs. North and South ===

It has been said that one of the reasons that Eurasia tended to develop more quickly than the Americas as a whole, was the difference in their shapes. Eurasia mostly had distance going east and west, while the Americas went mostly north and south. When going north and south, there are various climate changes, so people generally don't travel far in those directions within a lifetime of their own accord. When going east and west, people are more prone to traveling great distances because the climate varies less often. Thus, technological and ideological advances are more likely to extend east and west, instead of north and south. Thus, Eurasia was more likely to share its advances. For example, the Maya developed a system of writing that never went south to the Inca, or north to the various areas there. However, writing in Eurasia spread easily after development. Writing, in and of itself, (not unlike computers or the printing press), speeds up technological advances because things can be saved through time verbatim in the written word, as opposed to more questionable oral tradition.

Jared Diamond, in his 1997 book &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;, put forward the theory that while agriculture appeared around the world, it was the amount of animals and crops available for domestication that gave early Eurasians an advantage.  In contrast, early Native Americans struggled to develop maize as a viable food.  It needed to be planted one-by-one by hand (which is labour-intensive) and is low in nutrients.  In Eurasia, however, the inhabitants had wheat and barely which was not only highly nutritious by could be sown by scattering the seeds in a field.  This allowed more food to be grown, thus supporting a higher population.  Furthermore, grains can be kept for a much longer period than tropical foodstuffs such as bananas.  What may also have aided growth in early Europe, Diamond argues, are the similar climates found at different latitudes of the continent.  If temperatures and conditions remain the same for the majority of the year, then the same crops can be grown in much wider areas.  The domesticity of animals also may have played their part in that while sub-Saharan Africa has primarily wild animals (lions, hippos and elephants for example), the animals of Europe were much easier to tame.

=== Ocean vs. Land ===

Obviously, unless you have amphibious creatures and/or vehicles, going over the ocean is not the same as going over the land. Oceans pose interesting military possibilites. If one nation develops an extensive navy, that nation may be able to rule the seas and use it for trade and transportation, whilst limiting the ability of others to do the same without permission. To other nations, the seas now become a limiter. To nations without the ability to construct seafaring vessels, it may become almost impossible to cross the seas. If your race is somehow water-based, the opposite may be true. Either way, it is almost impossible to amass great numbers across a distance in a short time over water without a great ability to transport people. Fishing is also a way of making a living for people. Coastal cities often develop for their ability to transport goods from land to sea quickly. Japan is especially capable of this, for example, because virtually every point in that country is less than two hundred miles from the coast. They also have a very large fishing industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

The following '''Fortran code examples''' or sample programs show different situations depending on the compiler. The first set of examples are for the Fortran II, IV, and 77 compilers. The remaining examples can be compiled and run with any newer standard Fortran compiler (see the [[Fortran#Free (open-source) compilers|end of the main Fortran article]] for lists of compilers).  Most modern Fortran compilers expect a file with a &lt;code&gt;.f&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.for&lt;/code&gt; extension (for FORTRAN 66 or FORTRAN 77 source, although the FORTRAN 66 dialect may have to be selected specifically with a command-line option) or &lt;code&gt;.f90&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;.f95&lt;/code&gt; extension (for Fortran 90/95 source, respectively).

== FORTRAN II, IV, and 77 compilers ==

NOTE: Before FORTRAN 90, most FORTRAN compilers enforced '''fixed-format source code''', a carryover from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_card IBM punch cards]
* comments must begin with a '''*''' or '''C''' or '''!''' in column 1
* statement labels must occur in columns 1-5
* continuation lines must have a non-blank character in column 6
* statements must start in column 7
* the line-length may be limited to 72 characters (derived from the 80-byte width of a punch-card, with last 8 characters reserved for (optional) sequence numbers)

If errors are produced when you compile your FORTRAN code, first check the column alignment.
Some compilers also offer free form source by using a compiler flag
===Area Of a Triangle program===
====Simple Fortran II program====
'''One data card input'''

If one of the input values is zero, then the program will end with an error code of &quot;1&quot; in the job control card listing following the execution of the program. Normal output will be one line printed with A, B, C, and AREA. No specific units are stated.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;

'''Multiple data card input'''

This program has two input checks: one for a blank card to indicate end-of-data, and the other for a zero value within the input data. Either condition causes a message to be printed.

&lt;/source&gt;

====Simple Fortran 77 program====
'''Multiple data card input'''

This program has two input checks in the READ statement with the END and ERR parameters, one for a blank card to indicate end-of-data; and the other for zero value along with valid data. In either condition, a message will be printed.

==&quot;Retro&quot; FORTRAN IV==
A retro example of a FORTRAN IV (later evolved into FORTRAN 66) program deck is available on the [[w:IBM 1130|IBM 1130]] page, including the IBM 1130 DM2 JCL required for compilation and execution.  An IBM 1130 emulator is available at [http://ibm1130.org/ IBM 1130.org] that will allow the FORTRAN IV program to be compiled and run on a [[w:Personal computer|PC]].

===Hello, World program===
In keeping with computing tradition, the first example presented is a  simple program to display the words &quot;Hello, world&quot; on the screen (or printer).

====FORTRAN 66 (also FORTRAN IV)====

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 C     FORTRAN IV WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PROGRAMMING
 C     LANGUAGES TO SUPPORT SOURCE COMMENTS
       WRITE (6,7)
     7 FORMAT(13H HELLO, WORLD)
       STOP
       END
&lt;/source&gt;

This program prints &quot;HELLO, WORLD&quot; to Fortran unit number 6, which on most machines was the [[w:line printer|line printer]] or [[w:Computer terminal|terminal]].  (The [[w:Punch card|card reader]] or [[w:Computer keyboard|keyboard]] was usually connected as unit 5).  The number 7 in the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statement refers to the statement number of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement.  &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements may be placed anywhere in the same program or function/subroutine block as the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statements which reference them.  Typically a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement is placed immediately following the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statement which invokes it; alternatively, &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements are grouped together at the end of the program or subprogram block.  If execution flows into a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement, it is a [[w:NOP|no-op]]; thus, the example above has only two executable statements, &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt;.

The initial &lt;code&gt;13H&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement in the above example defines a [[w:Hollerith constant|Hollerith constant]], here meaning that the 13 characters immediately following are to be taken as a character constant (note that the Hollerith constant is not surrounded by delimiters).  (Some compilers also supported character literals enclosed in [[w:Quotation mark|single quotes]], a practice that came to be standard with FORTRAN 77.)

The space immediately following the 13H is a carriage control character, telling the I/O system to advance to a new line on the output. A zero in this position advances two lines (double space), a 1 advances to the top of a new page and + character will not advance to a new line, allowing overprinting.

====FORTRAN 77====

As of FORTRAN 77, single quotes are used to delimit character literals, and inline character strings may be used instead of references to &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements.  Comment lines may be indicated with either a &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; or an asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) in column 1.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
      PROGRAM HELLO
*     The PRINT statement is like WRITE,
*     but prints to the standard output unit
        PRINT '(A)', 'Hello, world'
        STOP
      END
&lt;/source&gt;

====Fortran 90====

As of Fortran 90, [[w:quotation mark|double quotes]] are allowed in addition to single quotes.  An updated version of the ''Hello, world'' example (which here makes use of ''list-directed I/O'', supported as of FORTRAN 77) could be written in Fortran 90 as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 program HelloWorld
   write (*,*) 'Hello, world!'   ! This is an inline comment
 end program HelloWorld
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fortran 77 examples==
===Greatest common divisor===
The following introductory example in FORTRAN 77 finds the [[w:greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] for two numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; using a verbatim implementation of [[w:Euclidean algorithm#Description of the algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
*     euclid.f (FORTRAN 77)
*     Find greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm

      PROGRAM EUCLID
        PRINT *, 'A?'
        READ *, NA
        IF (NA.LE.0) THEN
          PRINT *, 'A must be a positive integer.'
          STOP
        END IF
        PRINT *, 'B?'
        READ *, NB
        IF (NB.LE.0) THEN
          PRINT *, 'B must be a positive integer.'
          STOP
        END IF
        PRINT *, 'The GCD of', NA, ' and', NB, ' is', NGCD(NA, NB), '.'
        STOP
      END

      FUNCTION NGCD(NA, NB)
        IA = NA
        IB = NB
    1   IF (IB.NE.0) THEN
          ITEMP = IA
          IA = IB
          IB = MOD(ITEMP, IB)
          GOTO 1
        END IF
        NGCD = IA
        RETURN
      END
&lt;/source&gt;
The above example is intended to illustrate the following:
* The &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; statements in the above use '&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;' as a format, specifying ''list-directed formatting''.  List-directed formatting instructs the compiler to make an educated guess about the required input or output format based on the following arguments.
* As the earliest machines running Fortran had restricted character sets, FORTRAN 77 uses abbreviations such as &lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.NE.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LE.&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.GE.&lt;/code&gt; to represent the relational operators =, ≠, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, and ≥, respectively.
* This example relies on the [[w:Fortran_language_features#Implicit_and_explicit_typing|implicit typing mechanism]] to specify the INTEGER types of &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IB&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ITEMP&lt;/code&gt;.
* In the function &lt;code&gt;NGCD(NA, NB)&lt;/code&gt;, the values of the function arguments &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NB&lt;/code&gt; are copied into the local variables &lt;code&gt;IA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IB&lt;/code&gt; respectively.  This is necessary as the values of &lt;code&gt;IA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IB&lt;/code&gt; are altered within the function.  Because argument passing in Fortran functions and subroutines utilize [[w:evaluation strategy#Call by reference|call by reference]] by default (rather than [[w:evaluation strategy#Call by value|call by value]], as is the default in languages such as [[w:C programming language|C]]), modifying &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NB&lt;/code&gt; from within the function would effectively have modified the corresponding ''actual arguments'' in the main &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; unit which called the function.

The following shows the results of compiling and running the program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ g77 -o euclid euclid.f
$ euclid
 A?
24
 B?
36
 The GCD of 24 and 36 is 12.
&lt;/source&gt;

===Complex numbers===
The following FORTRAN 77 example prints out the values of &lt;math&gt;e^{j i \pi / 4}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;j = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) for values of &lt;math&gt;i = 0, 1, \ldots, 7&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
*     cmplxd.f (FORTRAN 77)
*     Demonstration of COMPLEX numbers
*
*     Prints the values of e ** (j * i * pi / 4) for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7
*         where j is the imaginary number sqrt(-1)

      PROGRAM CMPLXD
        IMPLICIT COMPLEX(X)
        PARAMETER (PI = 3.141592653589793, XJ = (0, 1))
        DO 1, I = 0, 7
          X = EXP(XJ * I * PI / 4)
          IF (AIMAG(X).LT.0) THEN
            PRINT 2, 'e**(j*', I, '*pi/4) = ', REAL(X), ' - j',-AIMAG(X)
          ELSE
            PRINT 2, 'e**(j*', I, '*pi/4) = ', REAL(X), ' + j', AIMAG(X)
          END IF
    2     FORMAT (A, I1, A, F10.7, A, F9.7)
    1     CONTINUE
        STOP
      END
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is intended to illustrate the following:
* The &lt;code&gt;IMPLICIT&lt;/code&gt; statement can be used to specify the implicit type of variables based on their initial letter if different from the default implicit typing scheme described [[w:Fortran_language_features#Implicit_and_explicit_typing|above]].  In this example, this statement specifies that the implicit type of variables beginning with the letter &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; shall be &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;.
* The &lt;code&gt;PARAMETER&lt;/code&gt; statement may be used to specify constants.  The second constant in this example (&lt;code&gt;XJ&lt;/code&gt;) is given the complex-valued value &lt;math&gt;0 + j1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:imaginary unit|imaginary unit]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The first number in the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; statement specifies the number of the last statement considered to be within the body of the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; loop.  In this example, as neither the &lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt; nor the &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; is a single executable statement, the &lt;code&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/code&gt; statement (which does nothing) is used simply in order for there to be some statement to denote as the final statement of the loop.
* &lt;code&gt;EXP()&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the exponential function &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;.  In FORTRAN 77, this is a ''generic function'', meaning that it accepts arguments of multiple types (such as &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; and, in this example, &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;).  In FORTRAN 66, a ''specific function'' would have to be called by name depending on the type of the function arguments (for this example, &lt;code&gt;CEXP()&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;-valued argument).
* When applied to a &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;-valued argument, &lt;code&gt;REAL()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AIMAG()&lt;/code&gt; return the values of the argument's real and imaginary components, respectively.

Incidentally, the output of the above program is as follows (see the article on [[w:Euler's formula|Euler's formula]] for the geometric interpretation of these values as eight points spaced evenly about a unit circle in the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]]).

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cmplxd
e**(j*0*pi/4) =  1.0000000 + j0.0000000
e**(j*1*pi/4) =  0.7071068 + j0.7071068
e**(j*2*pi/4) =  0.0000000 + j1.0000000
e**(j*3*pi/4) = -0.7071068 + j0.7071068
e**(j*4*pi/4) = -1.0000000 - j0.0000001
e**(j*5*pi/4) = -0.7071066 - j0.7071069
e**(j*6*pi/4) =  0.0000000 - j1.0000000
e**(j*7*pi/4) =  0.7071070 - j0.7071065
&lt;/source&gt;

Error can be seen occurring in the last decimal place in some of the numbers above, a result of the &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; data type representing its real and imaginary components in single precision.  Incidentally, Fortran 90 also made standard a double-precision complex-number data type (although several compilers provided such a type even earlier).

==Fortran 90/95 examples==
===Summations with a DO loop===
In this example of Fortran 90 code, the programmer has written the bulk of the code inside of a DO loop.  Upon execution, instructions are printed to the screen and a SUM variable is initialized to zero outside the loop.  Once the loop begins, it asks the user to input any number.  This number is added to the variable SUM every time the loop repeats.  If the user inputs 0, the EXIT statement terminates the loop, and the value of SUM is displayed on screen.

Also apparent in this program is a data file.  Before the loop begins, the program creates (or opens, if it has already been run before) a text file called &quot;SumData.DAT&quot;.  During the loop, the WRITE statement stores any user-inputted number in this file, and upon termination of the loop, also saves the answer.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
! sum.f90
! Performs summations using in a loop using EXIT statement
! Saves input information and the summation in a data file

program summation
implicit none
integer :: sum, a

print*, &quot;This program performs summations. Enter 0 to stop.&quot;
open(unit=10, file=&quot;SumData.DAT&quot;)

sum = 0

do
 print*, &quot;Add:&quot;
 read*, a
 if (a == 0) then
  exit
 else
  sum = sum + a
 end if
 write(10,*) a
end do

print*, &quot;Summation =&quot;, sum
write(10,*) &quot;Summation =&quot;, sum
close(10)

end
&lt;/source&gt;

When executed, the console would display the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 This program performs summations.  Enter 0 to stop.
 Add:
1
 Add:
2
 Add: 
3
 Add:
0
 Summation = 6
&lt;/source&gt;

And the file SumData.DAT would contain:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
1
2
3
Summation = 6
&lt;/source&gt;

===Calculating cylinder area===
The following program, which calculates the surface area of a cylinder, illustrates free-form source input and other features introduced by Fortran 90.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program cylinder

! Calculate the surface area of a cylinder.
!
! Declare variables and constants.
! constants=pi
! variables=radius squared and height

  implicit none    ! Require all variables to be explicitly declared

  integer :: ierr
  character(1) :: yn
  real :: radius, height, area
  real, parameter :: pi = 3.141592653589793

  interactive_loop: do

!   Prompt the user for radius and height
!   and read them.

    write (*,*) 'Enter radius and height.'
    read (*,*,iostat=ierr) radius,height

!   If radius and height could not be read from input,
!   then cycle through the loop.

    if (ierr /= 0) then
      write(*,*) 'Error, invalid input.'
      cycle interactive_loop
    end if

!   Compute area.  The ** means &quot;raise to a power.&quot;

    area = 2 * pi * (radius**2 + radius*height)

!   Write the input variables (radius, height)
!   and output (area) to the screen.

    write (*,'(1x,a7,f6.2,5x,a7,f6.2,5x,a5,f6.2)') &amp;
      'radius=',radius,'height=',height,'area=',area

    yn = ' '
    yn_loop: do
      write(*,*) 'Perform another calculation? y[n]'
      read(*,'(a1)') yn
      if (yn=='y' .or. yn=='Y') exit yn_loop
      if (yn=='n' .or. yn=='N' .or. yn==' ') exit interactive_loop
    end do yn_loop

  end do interactive_loop

end program cylinder
&lt;/source&gt;

===Dynamic memory allocation and arrays===
The following program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and array-based operations, two features introduced with Fortran 90.  Particularly noteworthy is the absence of &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;THEN&lt;/code&gt; statements in manipulating the array; mathematical operations are applied to the array as a whole.  Also apparent is the use of descriptive variable names and general code formatting that comport with contemporary programming style.  This example computes an average over data entered interactively.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program average

! Read in some numbers and take the average
! As written, if there are no data points, an average of zero is returned
! While this may not be desired behavior, it keeps this example simple

  implicit none
  integer :: number_of_points
  real, dimension(:), allocatable :: points
  real :: average_points=0., positive_average=0., negative_average=0.

  write (*,*) &quot;Input number of points to average:&quot;
  read (*,*) number_of_points

  allocate (points(number_of_points))

  write (*,*) &quot;Enter the points to average:&quot;
  read (*,*) points

! Take the average by summing points and dividing by number_of_points
  if (number_of_points &gt; 0) average_points = sum(points)/number_of_points

! Now form average over positive and negative points only
  if (count(points &gt; 0.) &gt; 0) positive_average = sum(points, points &gt; 0.) &amp;
        /count(points &gt; 0.)
  if (count(points &lt; 0.) &gt; 0) negative_average = sum(points, points &lt; 0.) &amp;
        /count(points &lt; 0.)

  deallocate (points)

! Print result to terminal
  write (*,'(''Average = '', 1g12.4)') average_points
  write (*,'(''Average of positive points = '', 1g12.4)') positive_average
  write (*,'(''Average of negative points = '', 1g12.4)') negative_average

end program average
&lt;/source&gt;

===Writing functions===
Modern Fortran features available for use with [[w:subroutine|procedures]], including deferred-shape, protected, and optional arguments, are illustrated in the following example, a function to solve a system of linear equations.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
function gauss_sparse(num_iter, tol, b, A, x, actual_iter) result(tol_max)

!  This function solves a system of equations (Ax = b) by using the Gauss-Seidel Method

   implicit none

   real ::  tol_max

!  Input: its value cannot be modified from within the function
   integer, intent(in) :: num_iter
   real, intent(in) :: tol
   real, intent(in), dimension(:) :: b, A(:,:)

!  Input/Output: its input value is used within the function, and can be modified
   real, intent(inout) :: x(:)

!  Output: its value is modified from within the function, only if the argument is required
   integer, optional, intent(out) :: actual_iter

!  Locals
   integer :: i, n, iter
   real :: xk

!  Initialize values
   n = size(b)  ! Size of array, obtained using size intrinsic function
   tol_max = 2. * tol
   iter = 0

!  Compute solution until convergence
   convergence_loop: do while (tol_max &gt;= tol .and. iter &lt; num_iter); iter = iter + 1

      tol_max = -1.  ! Reset the tolerance value

!     Compute solution for the k-th iteration
      iteration_loop: do i = 1, n

!        Compute the current x-value
         xk = (b(i) - dot_product(A(i,:i-1),x(:i-1)) - dot_product(A(i,i+1:n),x(i+1:n))) / A(i, i)

!        Compute the error of the solution
!        dot_product(a,v)=a'b
         tol_max = max((abs(x(i) - xk)/(1. + abs(xk))) ** 2, abs(A(i, i) * (x(i) - xk)), tol_max)
         x(i) = xk
      enddo iteration_loop
   enddo convergence_loop

   if (present(actual_iter)) actual_iter = iter

end function gauss_sparse
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that an ''explicit interface'' to this routine must be available to its caller so that the [[w:type signature|type signature]] is known.  This is preferably done by placing the function in a &lt;code&gt;MODULE&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;USE&lt;/code&gt;ing the module in the calling routine.  An alternative is to use an &lt;code&gt;INTERFACE&lt;/code&gt; block, as shown by the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program test_gauss_sparse
    implicit none

!   explicit interface to the gauss_sparse function
    interface
        function gauss_sparse(num_iter, tol, b, A, x, actual_iter) result(tol_max)
           real ::  tol_max
           integer, intent(in) :: num_iter
           real, intent(in) :: tol
           real, intent(in), dimension(:) :: b, A(:,:)
           real, intent(inout) :: x(:)
           integer, optional, intent(out) :: actual_iter
        end function
    end interface

!   declare variables
    integer :: i, N = 3, actual_iter
    real :: residue
    real, allocatable :: A(:,:), x(:), b(:)

!   allocate arrays
    allocate (A(N, N), b(N), x(N))

!   Initialize matrix
    A = reshape([(real(i), i = 1, size(A))], shape(A))

!   Make matrix diagonally dominant
    do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        A(i,i) = sum(A(i,:)) + 1
    enddo

!   Initialize b
    b = [(i, i = 1, size(b))]

!   Initial (guess) solution
    x = b

!   invoke the gauss_sparse function 
    residue = gauss_sparse(num_iter = 100, &amp;
                           tol = 1E-5, &amp;
                           b = b, &amp;
                           A = a, &amp;
                           x = x, &amp;
                           actual_iter = actual_iter)

!   Output
    print '(/ &quot;A = &quot;)'
    do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        print '(100f6.1)', A(i,:)
    enddo

    print '(/ &quot;b = &quot; / (f6.1))', b

    print '(/ &quot;residue = &quot;, g10.3 / &quot;iterations = &quot;, i0 / &quot;solution = &quot;/ (11x, g10.3))', &amp;
        residue, actual_iter, x

end program test_gauss_sparse
&lt;/source&gt;

===Writing subroutines===
In those cases where it is desired to return values via a procedure's arguments, a subroutine is preferred over a function; this is illustrated by the following subroutine to swap the contents of two arrays:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
subroutine swap_real(a1, a2)

   implicit none

!  Input/Output
   real, intent(inout) :: a1(:), a2(:)

!  Locals
   integer :: i
   real :: a

!  Swap
   do i = 1, min(size(a1), size(a2))
      a = a1(i)
      a1(i) = a2(i)
      a2(i) = a
   enddo

end subroutine swap_real
&lt;/source&gt;

As in the previous example, an ''explicit interface'' to this routine must be available to its caller so that the [[w:type signature|type signature]] is known.  As before, this is preferably done by placing the function in a &lt;code&gt;MODULE&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;USE&lt;/code&gt;ing the module in the calling routine.  An alternative is to use a &lt;code&gt;INTERFACE&lt;/code&gt; block.

===Internal and Elemental Procedures===
An alternative way to write the &lt;code&gt;swap_real&lt;/code&gt; subroutine from the previous example, is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
subroutine swap_real(a1, a2)

   implicit none

!  Input/Output
   real, intent(inout) :: a1(:), a2(:)

!  Locals
   integer :: N

!  Swap, using the internal subroutine
   N = min(size(a1), size(a2))
   call swap_e(a1(:N), a2(:N))

 contains
   elemental subroutine swap_e(a1, a2)
      real, intent(inout) :: a1, a2
      real :: a
      a = a1
      a1 = a2
      a2 = a
   end subroutine swap_e
end subroutine swap_real
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example, the &lt;code&gt;swap_e&lt;/code&gt; subroutine is elemental, i.e., it acts upon its array arguments, on an element-by-element basis.  Elemental procedures must be [[w:Pure function|pure]] (i.e., they must have no side effects and can invoke only pure procedures), and all the arguments must be scalar. Since &lt;code&gt;swap_e&lt;/code&gt; is internal to the &lt;code&gt;swap_real&lt;/code&gt; subroutine, no other program unit can invoke it.

The following program serves as a test for any of the two &lt;code&gt;swap_real&lt;/code&gt; subroutines presented:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program test_swap_real
    implicit none

!   explicit interface to the swap_real subroutine
    interface
        subroutine swap_real(a1, a2)
            real, intent(inout) :: a1(:), a2(:)
        end subroutine swap_real
    end interface

!   Declare variables
    integer :: i
    real :: a(10), b(10)

!   Initialize a, b
    a = [(real(i), i = 1, 20, 2)]
    b = a + 1

!   Output before swap
    print '(/&quot;before swap:&quot;)'
    print '(&quot;a = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', a
    print '(&quot;b = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', b

!   Call the swap_real subroutine
    call swap_real(a, b)

!   Output after swap
    print '(// &quot;after swap:&quot;)'
    print '(&quot;a = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', a
    print '(&quot;b = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', b

end program test_swap_real
&lt;/source&gt;

===Pointers and targets methods===
In Fortran, the concept of [[w:Pointer (computing)|pointers]] differs from that in [[C programming language|C]]-like languages.  A Fortran 90 pointer does not merely store the memory address of a target variable; it also contains additional descriptive information such as the target's rank, the upper and lower bounds of each dimension, and even strides through memory.  This allows a Fortran 90 pointer to point at submatrices.

Fortran 90 pointers are &quot;associated&quot; with well-defined &quot;target&quot; variables, via either the pointer assignment operator (&lt;code&gt;=&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) or an &lt;code&gt;ALLOCATE&lt;/code&gt; statement.  When appearing in expressions, pointers are always dereferenced; no &quot;pointer arithmetic&quot; is possible.

The following example illustrates the concept:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
module SomeModule
   implicit none
 contains
    elemental function A(x) result(res)
        integer :: res
        integer, intent(IN) :: x
        res = x + 1
    end function
end module SomeModule

program Test
   use SomeModule, DoSomething =&gt; A
   implicit none

   !Declare variables
   integer, parameter :: m = 3, n = 3
   integer, pointer :: p(:)=&gt;null(), q(:,:)=&gt;null()
   integer, allocatable, target :: A(:,:)
   integer :: istat = 0, i, j
   character(80) :: fmt

!  Write format string for matrices
!  (/ A / A, &quot; = [&quot;, 3( &quot;[&quot;,3(i2, 1x), &quot;]&quot; / 5x), &quot;]&quot; )
   write (fmt, '(&quot;(/ A / A, &quot;&quot; = [&quot;&quot;, &quot;, i0, &quot;( &quot;&quot;[&quot;&quot;,&quot;, i0, &quot;(i2, 1x), &quot;&quot;]&quot;&quot; / 5x), &quot;&quot;]&quot;&quot; )&quot;)') m, n
 
   allocate(A(m, n), q(m, n), stat = istat)
   if (istat /= 0) stop 'Error during allocation of A and q'
 
!  Matrix A is:
!  A = [[ 1  4  7 ]
!       [ 2  5  8 ]
!       [ 3  6  9 ]
!       ]
   A = reshape([(i, i = 1, size(A))], shape(A))
   q = A

   write(*, fmt) &quot;Matrix A is:&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, ((A(i, j), j = 1, size(A, 2)), i = 1, size(A, 1))
 
!  p will be associated with the first column of A
   p =&gt; A(:, 1)
 
!  This operation on p has a direct effect on matrix A
   p = p ** 2
 
!  This will end the association between p and the first column of A
   nullify(p)

!  Matrix A becomes:
!  A = [[ 1  4  7 ]
!       [ 4  5  8 ]
!       [ 9  6  9 ]
!       ]
   write(*, fmt) &quot;Matrix A becomes:&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, ((A(i, j), j = 1, size(A, 2)), i = 1, size(A, 1))
 
!  Perform some array operation
   q = q + A
 
!  Matrix q becomes:
!  q = [[ 2  8 14 ]
!       [ 6 10 16 ]
!       [12 12 18 ]
!       ]
   write(*, fmt) &quot;Matrix q becomes:&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, ((q(i, j), j = 1, size(A, 2)), i = 1, size(A, 1))
 
!  Use p as an ordinary array
   allocate (p(1:m*n), stat = istat)
   if (istat /= 0) stop 'Error during allocation of p'
 
!  Perform some array operation
   p = reshape(DoSomething(A + A ** 2), shape(p))
 
!  Array operation:
!      p(1) = 3
!      p(2) = 21
!      p(3) = 91
!      p(4) = 21
!      p(5) = 31
!      p(6) = 43
!      p(7) = 57
!      p(8) = 73
!      p(9) = 91
   write(*, '(&quot;Array operation:&quot; / (4x,&quot;p(&quot;,i0,&quot;) = &quot;,i0))') (i, p(i), i = 1, size(p))
 
   deallocate(A, p, q, stat = istat)
   if (istat /= 0) stop 'Error during deallocation'

end program Test
&lt;/source&gt;

===Module programming===
A [[w:Modular programming|module]] is a program unit which contains data definitions, global data, and &lt;code&gt;CONTAIN&lt;/code&gt;ed procedures.  Unlike a simple [[w:include file|&lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; file]], a module is an independent program unit that can be compiled separately and linked in its binary form.  Once compiled, a module's ''public'' contents can be made visible to a calling routine via the &lt;code&gt;USE&lt;/code&gt; statement.

The module mechanism makes the [[w:type signature|explicit interface]] of procedures easily available to calling routines.  In fact, modern Fortran encourages every &lt;code&gt;SUBROUTINE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FUNCTION&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;CONTAIN&lt;/code&gt;ed in a &lt;code&gt;MODULE&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows the programmer to use the newer argument passing options and allows the compiler to perform full type checking on the interface.

The following example also illustrates derived types, overloading of operators and generic procedures.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
module GlobalModule

!  Reference to a pair of procedures included in a previously compiled
!  module named PortabilityLibrary
   use PortabilityLibrary, only: GetLastError, &amp;  ! Generic procedure
                                 Date             ! Specific procedure
!  Constants
   integer, parameter :: dp_k = kind (1.0d0)      ! Double precision kind
   real, parameter :: zero = (0.)
   real(dp_k), parameter :: pi = 3.141592653589793_dp_k

!  Variables
   integer :: n, m, retint
   logical :: status, retlog
   character(50) :: AppName

!  Arrays
   real, allocatable, dimension(:,:,:) :: a, b, c, d
   complex(dp_k), allocatable, dimension(:) :: z

!  Derived type definitions
   type ijk
      integer :: i
      integer :: j
      integer :: k
   end type ijk

   type matrix
     integer m, n
     real, allocatable :: a(:,:)  ! Fortran 2003 feature. For Fortran 95, use the pointer attribute instead
   end type matrix

!  All the variables and procedures from this module can be accessed
!  by other program units, except for AppName
   public
   private :: AppName

!  Generic procedure swap
   interface swap
      module procedure swap_integer, swap_real
   end interface swap

   interface GetLastError  ! This adds a new, additional procedure to the
                           ! generic procedure GetLastError
      module procedure GetLastError_GlobalModule
   end interface GetLastError

!  Operator overloading
   interface operator(+)
      module procedure add_ijk
   end interface

!  Prototype for external procedure
   interface
      function gauss_sparse(num_iter, tol, b, A, x, actual_iter) result(tol_max)
         real ::  tol_max
         integer, intent(in) :: num_iter
         real, intent(in) :: tol
         real, intent(in), dimension(:) :: b, A(:,:)
         real, intent(inout) :: x(:)
         integer, optional, intent(out) :: actual_iter
      end function gauss_sparse
   end interface

!  Procedures included in the module
   contains

!  Internal function
   function add_ijk(ijk_1, ijk_2)
     type(ijk) add_ijk, ijk_1, ijk_2
     intent(in) :: ijk_1, ijk_2
     add_ijk = ijk(ijk_1%i + ijk_2%i, ijk_1%j + ijk_2%j, ijk_1%k + ijk_2%k)
   end function add_ijk

!  Include external files
   include 'swap_integer.f90' ! Comments SHOULDN'T be added on include lines
   include 'swap_real.f90'
end module GlobalModule
&lt;/source&gt;

We already discussed some of the general principles of archiving, now we'll make it happen for our drawing documents. Once we have the ability to archive shapes, we will find that implementing things such as cut and paste become straightforward.

You'll recall that when we added code to MyDocument to read and write the document to and from a file, we used a pair of objects called an NSKeyedArchiver and an NSKeyedUnarchiver. At that point, we simply archived our entire 'objects' array as the so-called ''root'' object. We didn't really care what happened behind the scenes - the archiver turned the array into an NSData object which we handed off to Cocoa which wrote the data to a file. When we opened a file, the unarchiver rebuilt our array which we then used as our objects array. So we should be able to save a drawing as a file and open it again, shouldn't we? No, not yet. The problem is that so far we haven't archived the actual properties of our shapes. WKDShape is a class we designed, so Cocoa doesn't yet know how to archive it. Thus if we try and save our drawings, we'll be disappointed that we get a blank document back when we open them again.

We tell Cocoa how to archive our shapes by writing a little code. We need these two methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder;
- (id)			initWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder;
&lt;/pre&gt;

These two are part of a ''formal'' protocol, NSCoding. We already met an informal protocol, which is just some methods that we agreed amongst ourselves to implement. A formal protocol is similar, except that it is strictly enforced - an object that implements a formal protocol MUST do so. In order to tell Cocoa that we want to be part of the formal protocol, we modify our class declaration like so:

 @interface WKDShape : NSObject &lt;NSCoding&gt;

This says we are going to be implementing the formal protocol ''NSCoding''. If we fail to do so, we'll get an error at compile time and will be unable to build our application.

Earlier we used NSKeyedArchiver, and its counterpart NSKeyedUnarchiver. Examination of the header files for these will show that  these are in fact subclasses of a more general class called an NSCoder. This is what is passed to the two methods above, the pair of which are required to implement the NSCoding protocol. All we need to do is to tell the coder which properties to add to its archive, it does the rest. We give each property a name or ''key'', and then use that key to retrieve the same property later. The properties we need to save for each shape are:

* its size
* its position
* its fill and stroke colours
* its stroke width

NSCoder has methods such as encodeObject:ForKey: and encodeFloat:forKey: that will handle the hard work. So here are our archiving methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder
{
	[coder encodeRect:[self bounds] forKey:@&quot;bounds&quot;];
	[coder encodeObject:[self fillColour] forKey:@&quot;fill_colour&quot;];
	[coder encodeObject:[self strokeColour] forKey:@&quot;stroke_colour&quot;];
	[coder encodeFloat:[self strokeWidth] forKey:@&quot;stroke_width&quot;];
}


- (id)			initWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder
{
	[self init];
	[self setBounds:[coder decodeRectForKey:@&quot;bounds&quot;]];
	[self setFillColour:[coder decodeObjectForKey:@&quot;fill_colour&quot;]];
	[self setStrokeColour:[coder decodeObjectForKey:@&quot;stroke_colour&quot;]];
	[self setStrokeWidth:[coder decodeFloatForKey:@&quot;stroke_width&quot;]];
	
	return self;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first, encodeWithCoder, is used when saving. The properties are saved to the coder using the keys given here, which are just strings that identify the property. The decode method is the reverse. Note that it is an init method, which makes sense - the object is created from the data stream by the coder, so it needs to be initialised using the saved properties. Normally, an object will call [super initWithCoder:coder] and [super encodeWithCoder:coder] before doing anything else, so that proprties of all the subclasses are also saved as needed. In this case, because we have inherited from NSObject, which doesn't implement &lt;NSCoding&gt;, we don't need to do this (in fact it would be an error to do so). That's why in this case we call [self init] instead.

Now if you compile and run, you'll find that saving a drawing to a file works - when you open that file again, your drawing reappears exactly as it was when it was saved, including all the properties such as colours, etc.

==Cut and Paste==

Cut and Paste leverages archiving so that we can move objects between documents, etc. Now we are able to archive a WKDShape, we are also able to archive any set of these shapes reliably and easily. Recall that an NSKeyedArchiver converts a &quot;root object&quot; of some kind to a NSData object, which is just a block of data containing an encoded version of that object. NSData is written to a file in the case of saving the document, but if we write it to an object called a ''pasteboard'' instead, we have put that data on the clipboard, thus implementing a cut or copy. Paste is the reverse operation, similar to dearchiving a file; we unarchive the clipboard data and add the objects so created to the document.

Cut and Paste are commands, so we implement them as action methods in MyDocument. Add the following to the class definition in MyDocument.h and SAVE the file:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	cut:(id) sender;
- (IBAction)	copy:(id) sender;
- (IBAction)	paste:(id) sender;
- (IBAction)	delete:(id) sender;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We will be implementing all four. Note however that a cut is equivalent to a copy followed by a delete, and a delete is just a case of deleting the objects in the selection, so the only 'hard' work is in the copy: and paste: methods. Before we implement them, let's hook them up in IB.

double-click 'MainMenu.nib' to open it (if it's not open already in IB), and double-click the 'FirstResponder' icon. Recall that we use FirstResponder whenever commands can be implemented in a variety of places that depend on the context. This is just such a time, since cut and paste etc can be implemented in all sorts of ways by all sorts of objects. As it happens, you'll find that we don't need to do anything - cut, paste etc are all prewired for you when Mainmenu.nib was created. Verify that the menu commands are indeed connected to these methods.

In Xcode, flesh out these four methods in MyDocument.m. For now, don't add any code. Compile and Run the project. You'll now see that the Cut, Paste commands are available in the Edit menu. In fact we'd rather that these only became available when there was something selected to actually cut, but for now we'll accept the default behaviour until we have built and tested the code.

The object responsible for the clipboard behaviour in Cocoa is NSPasteboard. There are in fact a number of pasteboards for different tasks but the one we need is the basic one, called the 'general' pasteboard. When we receive a 'cut' command, we archive the selection into an NSData object, then place this data on the general pasteboard. Because this data is private to our application, we don't need to worry at this stage about converting it to a form that would be readable by other applications, such as TIFF or PDF.

Here is the implementation for our edit methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	cut:(id) sender
{
	[self copy:sender];
	[self delete:sender];
}


- (IBAction)	copy:(id) sender
{
	if ([[self selection] count] &gt; 0 )
	{
		NSData* clipData = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:[self selection]];
		NSPasteboard* cb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
		
		[cb declareTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;, nil] owner:self];
		[cb setData:clipData forType:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;];
	}
}


- (IBAction)	paste:(id) sender
{
	NSPasteboard* cb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
	NSString* type = [cb availableTypeFromArray:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;, nil]];
	
	if ( type )
	{
		NSData* clipData = [cb dataForType:type];
		NSArray* objects = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:clipData];
		NSEnumerator* iter = [objects objectEnumerator];
		id obj;
		
		[self deselectAll];
		
		while( obj = [iter nextObject])
		{
			[self addObject:obj];
			[self selectObject:obj];
			[(WKDShape*)obj repaint];
		}
	}
}


- (IBAction)	delete:(id) sender
{
	NSArray* sel = [[self selection] copy];
	NSEnumerator* iter = [sel objectEnumerator];
	id obj;
	
	while ( obj = [iter nextObject])
		[self removeObject:obj];
		
	[sel release];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

cut: is simply a copy: followed by a delete:

copy: first checks that the selection isn't empty, and if not, it archives the selection to an NSData object using a keyed archiver. Then it obtains the general pasteboard. To put data on the pastebaord, you first declare the types that the data will have. This allows multiple representations to be placed on the clipboard of the same data - the receiver can decide which representation suits it best - for example a graphics program might want a TIFF image of the data, whereas a word processior might want a text representation, etc. Here, we only have one representation, which is a private format we call &quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;. Thus the &quot;list&quot; of types in fact only contains one item. Once we have declared the type, we can put the data on the pasteboard associated with that type.

paste: reverses this procedure. First it obtains the general pastebaord and checks that data of the type &quot;wikidrawprivate&quot; does exist. If not, it does nothing, so it won't attempt to paste data from another application that it cannot understand. Then we download the data fron the pasteboard, and unarchive it. We know it's an array of shape objects - whatever the copied selection contained in fact. We need to ADD these objects to the document, so we just iterate over the array and add and select the objects we come across. We also first deselect all the objects in the document so that the user gets the expected result - the pasted objects are selected after the paste.

The delete: method deletes the selected objects from the document. It does this by iterating over a COPY of the selection array. A copy is needed here because removing an object also deselects it - if we didn't make a copy we'd be modifying the same array that we are iterating over and things wouldn't work correctly. Once we've removed the objects from the document, we are done with the copy so we release it.

Compile and run the project and confirm that you have the ability to cut and paste objects between different documents.

Further exercises:

* Modify the code so that it also exports a PDF representation of the selection. This is moderately involved, but not that difficult. Hint: look at NSView's writePDFInsideRect:toPasteboard: method

* More complex: Add drag and drop behaviour. This is almost the same as Cut and Paste, and uses the 'drag' pasteboard. Override methods from NSView to get notified when to create the drag data and when to receive data dragged to the view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Revisions to One-to-One Relationship
Dustin K. Pitts
January 28, 2006

The following things are suggestions for the revision of my chapter over one-to-one relationships.

# Have a brief overview of what XML is.  Define the XML Schema, XML Style Sheet, and the XML Document.
# Have a better definition of the one-to-one relationship.  Relate it to the data model that is given.
# Reword the introduction so that the goals of the chapter a little more clear.
# In the new elements and attributes part of the Schema the third bullet should be its not it’s. 
# Have a separate category for the restrictions in the XML Schema.  It will set them apart more and allow for more organization.  Maybe a label or something would help this.
# Bold the titles of the restrictions so you can easily find them.
# Have a separate category for the If Statement.  Make it stand out. 
# Have a more in depth summary so that someone skimming the chapter can get a more general idea of what is going on.

==Editorial Board Suggestions==
MIST 5730 Advanced Data Management, University of Georgia, in response to Dustin

# The overview of XML is covered in a previous chapter. You could link to this information at the beginning of the chapter. 
# It may be helpful to include a new section header entitled &quot;Prerequisites&quot; (or something similar) at the beginning of the chapter and link to chapters that the learner should have already read. This resource also could have answered some of Mr. McCreary's questions (below).
# Focus on the one-to-one relationship and how this relationship is represented in the schema.
# Cut advanced topic information and paste within your chapter link on the &quot;Chapter XSL&quot; page that Viji created (accessible from the main table of contents). This would address your suggestions concerning the &quot;if statements&quot; and &quot;restrictions.&quot; The editorial board will need to discuss whether &quot;Chapter XSL&quot; is the correct descriptor for the chapter link Viji created. Not all advanced topics are related to XSL; some are related to Java. 
# To address your suggestions to reword and go more in depth with some of the content, I agree. If you didn't really understand the chapter, add and reword content in the way that you think makes the most sense.
# And, of course, please make the changes specified by the author guidelines.

==Excellent Start==
Hi Dustin,

First of all.  Great Job!  Keep up the good work.

Yes, I agree that we need to start out with some basics of XML Schema.  I got very confused by the title.  Creating one-to-one relationships is not the right topic.

I think that restrictions are an advanced topic.  I don't even teach it in my beginning classes.

Here are the key concepts I introduce in one-day (8 hour class) on XML Schemas:
# History of XML and XML Schema
# XML Schema as compared to a DTD?  Why are Schemas better?
# What is it used for? (Validation of structure and data type checking)
# What is the structure of an XML Schema file?
# How do you add elements and attributes?
# How do you assign simple data types (string, boolean, integer and date)
# Adding enumerations
# Adding a pattern to validate a zip code
# How do you use an XML schema to validate an XML file (need a lab)
# What else are schemas used for (e.g. data mapping)

At the end of the class students feel they can create a simple XML Schema to validate some simple data.

I am looking forward to working with you on this.  Let me know if you want me to make any changes.  Collaborative writing is a challenge.

==Professor's comments==

[[user:Rick|rtw]] 01:20, 2 Feb 2006 (UTC)

We need to make clear to the reader that the schema is mapping only a portion of the model (the 1:1 aspect). Maybe the model should be redrawn with a color box around country and destination. If you want, I can do this, as all the models need to be maintained by one person. 
The prerequisites section should go in the first chapter and include topics such as knowledge of HTML and data modeling. It can be assumed that the preceding chapter is a prerequisite for the current chapter.
Section summaries are useful and there is an [[XML:_Managing_Data_Exchange/Author_guidelines#Section_summary | author guideline]] on how to make these standout in the text.

==Editorial Board Comments - Christina==

Dustin, thanks for making all of the changes that we suggested. I also like Dr. Watson's suggestion to highlight the 1:1 relationship in the data model presented in this chapter. And perhaps the data model could be truncated. For example, I don't know that it's necessary to include the &quot;hotel&quot; entity--if this were removed, the schema and document could also be simplified. 

I removed references in the chapter in regards to style sheets and Java parsing because there is no longer content in the chapter to explain these topics.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Archiving|Previous Page: Archiving]]

So far we have built a fairly crude drawing program, but one that is starting to look like a real application. We have covered many of the core principles of Cocoa that you'll need to write any application. If you look at how much code we've actually written, it's not that much, yet our application is already quite functional. In this section, we'll look at adding finesse - those touches that separate real, well-designed and implemented applications from those lesser amateur efforts we've no doubt all seen.

==Undo==

The first thing to tackle is Undo. A real application should allow almost all actions to be undoable, in the spirit of forgiveness of the user. Without Undo, your application is likely to be discarded in favour of another one that has it, as punishing the user for mistakes, or not allowing them to experiment is a cardinal design sin!

Undo is traditionally one of the &quot;hard&quot; parts of implementing an application. Cocoa helps us massively here, and so Undo is not so hard. Usually, adding Undo as an afterthought is not a good idea - you need to design your application from the ground up to cope with the undo task. So far we have not mentioned Undo, but we have in fact designed our application to allow it to be added easily.

The principle of Undo is straightforward - whenever we do anything to change the state of the data model, the previous state is recorded so it can be put back. We can record this previous state in different ways, either just record the whole state, or parts of it along with tags to tell us what was changed, or we can record actions and perform the opposite action to implement Undo. We'll be using a combination of these things. Cocoa automatically combines several undoable &quot;recordings&quot; into one Undoable action for each event, which really makes life very simple for us - we simply need to make sure the recording happens at each editable point of interest.

We'd like the following to be undoable:

* adding new objects
* deleting objects
* changing the position or size of an object
* changing the stroke and fill colours
* changing the stroke width

Note that we could also make the selections themselves undoable, but in this exercise we won't do this.

In Cocoa, the object responsible for handling Undo is the ''undo manager''. It is embodied in the class NSUndoManager. The way it works is by storing ''invocations''. We already discussed how Objective-C uses runtime binding of class methods. An invocation is just a stored description of a method call. When the invocation is &quot;replayed&quot; the stored method call is actually made. The invocation not only records the target and method to be called, but also all of the method's parameters at the time the invocation was recorded. Thus we can create an invocation which when called, will undo the current action we are performing. Both the action and the invocation to undo the same action are created at the same time.

First let's add the code for undoing adding and deleting objects. Here is the modified code in MyDocument.m for addObject and removeObject:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		addObject:(id) object
{
	if(![_objects containsObject:object])
	{
		[[self undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
							selector:@selector(removeObject:)
							object:object];
		
		[_objects addObject:object];
		[_mainView setNeedsDisplayInRect:[object drawBounds]];
	}
}

- (void)		removeObject:(id) object
{
	if([_objects containsObject:object])
	{
		NSRect br = [object drawBounds];
		
		[[self undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
							selector:@selector(addObject:)
							object:object];

		[self deselectObject:object];
		[_objects removeObject:object];
		[_mainView setNeedsDisplayInRect:br];
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We obtain an undo manager by calling [self undoManager]. Every document has its own undo manager instance already set up, we just need to use it. We then use the registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object: method to build an invocation that the undo manager stores. When we add an object, we build an invocation to removeObject. When we remove an object, be build an invocation to addObject. In other words, we record the OPPOSITE of what we are doing. We have also added code here to refresh the main view when the objects come and go, so that we can see the effect that our actions have.

Compile and run the project. Create some shapes. Now Undo them. You'll find you can Undo and Redo as many actions as you want - everything works as you would expect for the Undo command. Not bad for just two lines of code!

Note that when Undo is performed, it calls, say removeObject, which in turn records another addObject undo action. This is how redo works - NSUndoManager knows the context it is called in, so can add tasks to the appropriate stack. Now let's make editable actions Undoable. For this, we'll need to add code to WKDShape, and at present shapes don't have an undomanager, nor do they know anything about the document they are part of, so they can't obtain one. So the first thing we need to do is to provide a way to allow shapes to obtain an appropriate undo manager.

In WKDShape.h, add a data member to the class called _owner, typed as NSDocument*. Add accessor methods setOwner: and owner. In the .m file, add the implementation:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setOwner:(NSDocument*) doc
{
	_owner = doc;
}


- (NSDocument*)	owner
{
	return _owner;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In MyDocument.m, add a line to addObject that calls setOwner with self - this makes sure that whenever an object is added to a document, the object is updated with which document it belongs to. Note that since everything that ever adds an object to a document calls this method, including paste for example, this information is always up to date. This is a strong design principle - always try to minimise the number of places in your code that change the data model by factoring code into a few key methods. Then you can add code to those methods in the knowledge that they will always be called, and nothing can get in &quot;through the back door&quot;. If we hadn't done this, implementing Undo would be very much harder than it has been so far.

Now we have a way for a WKDShape to obtain its owning document's undoManager, we can implement undo easily.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setFillColour:(NSColor*) colour
{
	[[[self owner] undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
								selector:@selector(setFillColour:)
								object:_fillColour];
	
	[colour retain];
	[_fillColour release];
	_fillColour = colour;
	[self repaint];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, we don't set up the undo using a different method, we use the same method, but with the OLD value of the colour. When the undo command is called, it calls this same method, passing back the original colour. The code for the stroke colour is identical.

The case for the stroke width is slightly more involved, because the undo manager doesn't directly store simple scalar values such as a float. Instead we need to pack the value up into an object. Cocoa provides a simple class for doing just this - NSNumber. As we need to be able to call a method that takes an object parameter, we must now create one. We'll refactor the code so that all the calls to set the stroke width now go through it.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setStrokeWidth:(float) width
{
	[[[self owner] undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
								selector:@selector(setStrokeWidthObject:)
								object:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:_strokeWidth]];
	_strokeWidth = width;
	[self repaint];
}


- (void)		setStrokeWidthObject:(NSNumber*) value
{
	[self setStrokeWidth:[value floatValue]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't forget to add the method setStrokeWidthObject: to your class declaration. Now if anyone calls setStrokeWidth, the old value is turned into an NSNumber object and used to build the undo invocation on setStrokeWidthObject: When Undo is called, setStrokeWidthObject: unpacks the encapsulated value and calls setStrokeWidth:, so everything works correctly.

Compile and go to test that changing properties using the inspector is now fully undoable. They should be!

Notice how Cocoa has separated each editing action into different Undo commands for you. If you drag around in the colour picker for example, the colour of the object will change many, many times until you stop dragging. But only one Undo command is needed to put back the previous colour - it doesn't visibly &quot;replay&quot; all of the individual intermediate colours.

There is one thing that isn't so great now however. If we Undo an editing change, the Inspector doesn't change! If we think about it, it's obvious why - previously we only set up the inspector to respond to selection changes which also set up the state of the controls. After that the inspector changes the object's state so they were always in &quot;synch&quot;. Undo isn't changing the selection state, but it is changing the object's state behind the inspector's back, so we need to tell the inspector to resynch when this occurs. To do this we need to add a new notification that the inspector can respond to.

This is very similar to the &quot;repaint&quot; notification - in fact it would be possible to use that one in this case, but since semantically it does have a different meaning, it is good practice to make it a separate notification. If later you extended the design you might find combining the notifications led to awkward problems. So create a new notification name and a method for sending it. I called it resynch. Call this method from every place that the object state can be changed from - setFillColour:, setStrokeColour:, setStrokeWidth: In the inspector, create a new responder method - I called it resynch: - taking a single NSNotification parameter. Subscribe to the resynch notification in the awakeFromNib method as before. The resynch: method looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		resynch:(NSNotification*) note
{
	WKDShape* shp = (WKDShape*)[note object];
	
	if ( shp == editShape )
		[self setupWithShape:shp];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can se, it's very simple - we find out which object was changed. If it's the one we are in fact currently editing, we simply call our setup method so that the control states match the object's state. Compile and run again to verify that this time, Undoing an edit operation also reflects the change in the Inspector.

Finally, we need to Undo moves and resizes of the object. By factoring all of this information through the setBounds: method, we have just one place to add the undo recording to. As with setStrokeWidth, we'll need to use an NSValue object to store the old rect.

Here's the refactored and modified code in WKDShape:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setBounds:(NSRect) bounds
{
	[self repaint];
	[[[self owner] undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
								selector:@selector(setBoundsObject:)
								object:[NSValue valueWithRect:[self bounds]]];
	
	_bounds = bounds;
	[self repaint];
	[self resynch];
}


- (void)		setBoundsObject:(id) value
{
	[self setBounds:[value rectValue]];
}


- (void)		setLocation:(NSPoint) loc
{
	NSRect br = [self bounds];
	
	br.origin = loc;
	[self setBounds:br];
}


- (void)		offsetLocationByX:(float) x byY:(float) y
{
	NSRect br = [self bounds];
	
	br.origin.x += x;
	br.origin.y += y;
	[self setBounds:br];
}


- (void)		setSize:(NSSize) size
{
	NSRect br = [self bounds];
	br.size = size;
	[self setBounds:br];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Compile and run... create a shape and move it. Now Undo. Is the action undoable in the way you expected? No, it's not. The action is undoable, but unlike the colour case, each individual small amount of motion has been recorded as a separate Undo task. The Undo manager has failed to group the motions into one big single action. Why is that? NSUndoManager groups all undo actions that occur within a single event. However, dragging an object consists of multiple events. We can't change that, but we can change the way that the undo manager groups things by giving it some hints.

In WKDDrawView.m, in the method mouseDown:, add the following line at the top of the method:

 [[[self delegate] undoManager] beginUndoGrouping];

and in the mouseUp: method, add the following line at the bottom of the method:

 [[[self delegate] undoManager] endUndoGrouping];

This will fix the problem - compile and run to verify. What this does it do tell the undo manager to group any undo recording it receives from now until the call to endUndoGrouping. We beging grouping on a mouse down, and end on a mouse up, so all the actions that occur during the drag will end up in the same group, and will be replayed under the single Undo command. Each individual offset of the shape is still recorded, but when played back the entire move is replayed so the effect for the user is the expected behaviour.

Finally, you'll probably have noticed that the menu command only shows a generic &quot;Undo&quot;. It would be nice if we could give our users a more meaningful indication of what the Undo operation will accomplish. To do this, we pass a string to the undo manager which is uses to build the menu command text. Whatever was the most recent string it received in a group will be the one used. The method is NSUndoManager's setActionName: method. For now we will just hard-code the strings for each action - in a real app we'd need to allow this to be localizable.

In WKDShape, this is straightforward. For example, in setFillColour, add:

 	[[[self owner] undoManager] setActionName:@&quot;Change Fill Colour&quot;];

just after the current undo recording operation. For all similar state changes, you can add a line with a string indicating the thing actually changed. Remember that the user will see this; you don't need to include &quot;Undo&quot; or &quot;Redo&quot;. To distinguish between resizing and moving a shape, you can include this line in the appropriate routines - they don't need to go directly in setBounds: also, don't forget the code where a handle is dragged interactively - mouseDragged:

The MyDocument changes are similar with one small kink - because we are using the 'opposite' method approach, we need to tell apart the case of undo/redo and a normal call and make sure we only update the string if we were called normally - i.e. not from an undo invocation. To do this, we use:

&lt;pre&gt;
		if (! [[self undoManager] isUndoing] &amp;&amp; ! [[self undoManager] isRedoing])
			[[self undoManager] setActionName:@&quot;Delete Object&quot;];
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run again to check that everything works as expected.

As a bonus, you'll notice that now, changes to the document automatically result in you being asked if you want to save changes when you quit or close a document. This is because by recording undo tasks, you are also notifying the document that its state is different from the disk file. Previously, it had no way to tell. Cocoa now steps in and adds that small piece of functionality for you &quot;for free&quot;. Neat!

Further exercises:

* Add the ability to undo selection changes. This will often result in a more usable application in practice.

==Printing==

Real applications should print. Again, in a traditional Mac application, adding the ability to print was usually hard work, and very often added as an afterthought, making it harder still! Cocoa is much easier, since there is no major difference between its on-screen graphics model and the printing model. In fact we already have most of the code written.

Printing is handled by an object called an NSPrintOperation, working in conjunction with an NSView. The view draws the content to the paper. For our simple exercise, we need very little code, since the default pagination scheme of tiling across pages is adequate. As you might imagine Cocoa provides numerous alternative approaches, but these are rather beyond the scope of just getting basic printing working.

As we have a document-based application, we use the printDocument: action method to get things going. Here's the code:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	printDocument:(id) sender
{
    NSPrintOperation *op = [NSPrintOperation printOperationWithView:_mainView
												printInfo:[self printInfo]];
    
	[op runOperationModalForWindow:[self windowForSheet]
         delegate:self
         didRunSelector:
         @selector(printOperationDidRun:success:contextInfo:)
		 contextInfo:NULL];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We create an NSPrintOperation, passing it our main view which will render the drawing. Once we have  this, we then just run it using a sheet dialog. That takes care of the rest. The sheet requires a completion routine, but in this case we don't need it to actually do anything, so we simply provide it as an empty method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		printOperationDidRun:(NSPrintOperation*) printOperation
                success:(BOOL)success
                contextInfo:(void *)info
{
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't forget to add this to your class definition.

That's it! Compile and run it and you'll find that you can print out your drawings.

There's one thing that isn't so great here, and this is that it prints the selection handles. Really, we don't need to see these handles when a drawing is printed, so we'll now just modify the main view drawing code so that it doesn't bother to render these when it's printing. This turns out to be very simple:

&lt;pre&gt;
	while( shape = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( rect, [shape drawBounds]))
			[shape drawWithSelection:[selection containsObject:shape] &amp;&amp;
                                                                    [NSGraphicsContext currentContextDrawingToScreen]];
	}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the main loop inside our view's drawRect: method. We just add a check whether the current graphics context is drawing to the screen. If not, it must be drawing to the printer, so the objects are rendered without the handles, regardless of their selection state.

==Menu item maintenance==

We have seen how Cocoa automatically enables menu items that can find a target in the current context. That's pretty neat, but not always enough. For example, when we implemented Cut and Paste, we found these commands always enabled even if there was no selection to cut, or nothing on the clipboard we could paste. We'll now see how we deal with that.

Whenever a menu is displayed, the target is given a chance to overrule the normal enabling behaviour. It does this by implementing a method called validateMenuItem: which is called for each item. You can return YES to enable the item, NO to disable it. So in MyDocument, we add:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (BOOL)		validateMenuItem:(NSMenuItem*) item
{
	SEL act = [item action];
	
	if ( act == @selector(cut:) ||
	     act == @selector(copy:) ||
		 act == @selector(delete:))
		return ([[self selection] count] &gt; 0 );
	else if ( act == @selector(paste:))
	{
		NSPasteboard* cb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
		NSString* type = [cb availableTypeFromArray:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;, nil]];

		return ( type != nil );
	}
	else
		return YES;
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

As here, it's a good idea to compare the action selectors to determine which action the menu item is targetting, instead of looking at the menu item strings or position. An alternative would be to use the item's tag, but that would require that you carefully set these up in IB. By using the selector, you are immune from text and positional changes you might make to the menu - as long as it remains targetted at the same action method, it will behave correctly with respect to what that method actually achieves.

Here, if the item is targetting the cut, copy or delete methods, we see if there are any items in the selection array. If so, we enable the item, otherwise we disable it. For the paste case, we peek at the pasteboard to see if it has data of type 'wikidrawprivate' available - if so we can paste, so we enable that item.

You can implement a similar method in any target of a menu command so finely control the enabling of a menu item. You can also use the opportunity to change the text of a menu item to reflect some information you have in your data model if you like.

==Getting Started==
With Java, it is as easy as pie to get started. However, if you encounter difficulty in getting started with Java, you may find useful help and tips in this chapter. Our authors have tried their best to include as much useful content as possible in this chapter for your reference. But, nevertheless, if problems persist, please consult the authors using the [[Talk:Java Programming/Getting Started|discussion]] page above.

This section is a quick start to using Java:
installing Java software, compiling and running programs,
and some small sample programs to illustrate the basics of getting started with Java.

The previous chapter ''&quot;[[../Getting started|Getting started]]&quot;'' was a primer course in the basics of understanding how Java programming works. Throughout the chapter, we tackled a variety of concepts that included:
* Objects and class definitions;
* Abstract and data types;
* Properties;
* Methods;
* Class-level and method-level scopes;
* Keywords; and,
* Access modifiers, etc.

From this point on, we will be looking into the above mentioned concepts and many more in finer detail with a deeper and richer understanding of how each one of them works. This chapter on '''Language fundamentals''' introduces the fundamental elements of the Java programming language in detail. The discussions in this chapter will use the concepts we have already gathered from our previous discussions and build upon them in a progressive manner.

==The Java programming syntax==
In [[w:Linguistics|linguistics]], the word '''syntax''' (which comes from [[w:Ancient Greek|Ancient Greek]] ''[[wikt:σύνταξις|σύνταξις]]'' where ''σύν'' [syn] means &quot;together&quot;, and ''τάξις'' [táxis] means &quot;an ordering&quot;) refers to &quot;the process of arranging things&quot;. It defines the principles and rules for constructing phrases and [[w:Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in [[w:Natural language|natural languages]].

When learning a new language, the first step one must take is to learn its '''programming syntax'''. ''Programming syntax'' is to programming languages what ''grammar'' is to spoken languages. Therefore, in order to create effective code in the Java programming, we need to learn its syntax — its principles and rules for constructing valid code statements and expressions.

Java uses a syntax similar to the [[C Programming|C programming language]] and therefore if one learns the Java programming syntax, they automatically would be able to read and write programs in similar languages — C, [[C++ Programming|C++]] and [[C Sharp Programming|C#]]

When learning a new language, the first step one must take is to learn its [[Java Programming/Syntax|syntax]] rules and [[Java Programming/Keywords|keywords]]. Combining the two, one creates [[Java Programming/Statements|statements]], Programming Blocks, Classes, Interfaces, et al.

Use [[Java Programming/Packages|packages]] to avoid name collisions. To hide as much information as possible use the [[Java Programming/Access Modifiers|access modifiers]] properly.

Create [[Java Programming/Methods|methods]] that do one and if possible only one thing/task. If possible have separate method that changes the object state.

In an object oriented language, programs are run with objects; however, for ease of use and for historic reasons, Java has [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive types]]. Primitive Data Types only store values and have no methods. Primitive Types may be thought of as Raw Data and are usually embedded attributes inside objects or used as local variables in methods. Because primitive types are not subclasses of the object superclass, each type has a Wrapper Class which is a subclass of Object, and can thus be stored in a collection or returned as an object.

Java is a strong [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types|type]] checking language. There are two concepts regarding types and objects. One is the object type and the other the template/class the object was created from. When an object is created, the template/class is assigned to that object which can not be changed. Types of an object however can be changed by type casting. Types of an object is associated with the object reference that referencing the object and determines what operation can be performed on the object through that object reference. Assigning the value of one object reference to a different type of object reference is called type casting.

The most often used data structure in any language is a character string. For this reason java defines a special object that is [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.String|String]].

To aggregate same type java objects to an array, java has a special [[Java Programming/Arrays|array]] object for that. Both java objects and primitive types can be aggregated to arrays.

== Classes and Objects ==

An object-oriented program is built from objects. A class is a &quot;template&quot; that is used to create objects. The class defines the values the object can contain and the operations that can be performed on the object.

After compilation, a class is stored on the file system in a '(class-name).class' file.

The class is [[Java Programming/Class Loading|loaded]] into memory when we are about to [[Java Programming/Creating Objects|create]] the first object from that class, or when we call one of its static functions.

During class loading all the class static variables are initialized. Also operations defined in a &lt;code&gt;static { ... } &lt;/code&gt; block are executed. Once a class is loaded it stays in memory, and the class static variables won't be initialized again.

After the class is loaded into memory, objects can be created from that class. When an object is created, its member variables are initialized, but the class static variables are not.

When there are no more references to an object, the garbage collector will [[Java Programming/Destroying Objects|destroy]] the object and free its memory, so that the memory can be reused to hold new objects.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In the previous chapters, we have discovered the [[Java_Programming/Arrays|array]]. An array stores a group of primitive types. To group objects, or to reference a group of objects, we can use Java aggregate classes. There are two main interfaces, those are &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/code&gt; . Implementations for those interfaces are not interchangeable.

== Collection ==
The implementations of &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface are used for grouping simple java objects.

; Example: We can group together all patients in a Hospital to a &quot;patient&quot; collection.

== Map ==
The implementations of &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/code&gt; interface are used to represent mapping between &quot;key&quot; and &quot;value&quot; objects. A Map represents a group of &quot;key&quot; objects, where each &quot;key&quot; object is mapped to a &quot;value&quot; object.

; Example: For each patient, there is one and only one main nurse assigned to. That association can be represented by a &quot;patient-nurse&quot; Map.

== Choice ==
A collection is better when you have to access to all the items at once. A map is better when you have to randomly access to an item regularly.

Before selecting a particular collection implementation, ask the following question:
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
''Can my collection contain the same elements, i.e. are duplicates allowed?''

''Can my collection contain the {{java:null}} element?''

''Should the collection maintain the order of the elements? Is the order important in any way?''

''How do you want to access an element? By index, key or just with an iterator?''

''Does the collection need to be synchronized?''

''From a performance perspective, which one needs to be faster, updates or reads?''

''From a usage perspective, which operation will be more frequent, updates or reads?''

&lt;/div&gt;

Once you know your needs, you can select an existing implementation. But first decide if you need a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;, or a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that the above associations are explicit. The objects them-self do not have any knowledge/information about that they are part in an association. But creating explicit associations between simple java objects is the main idea about using the aggregate/collection classes.

{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Comparing Objects|next=Throwing and Catching Exceptions}}
{{Java Programming/ExceptionsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The ideal time to catch an error is at compile time, before you even try to run the program. However, not all errors can be detected at compile time. The rest of the problems must be handled at run time through some formality that allows the originator of the error to pass appropriate information to a recipient who will know how to handle the difficulty properly.

Improved error recovery is one of the most powerful ways that you can increase the robustness of your code. Error recovery is a fundamental concern for every program you write, but it's especially important in Java, where one of the primary goals is to create program components for others to use. ''To create a robust system, each component must be robust''. By providing a consistent error-reporting model using exceptions, Java allows components to reliably communicate problems to client code.

==Flow of code execution==
In Java, there are two main flows of code executions.
* Normal main sequential code execution, the program doing what it meant to accomplish.
* Exception handling code execution, the main program flow was interrupted by an error or some other condition that prevent the continuation of the normal main sequential code execution. 

; Exception : Exceptions are Java's way of error handling.  Whenever an unexpected condition occurs, an exception can be thrown with an exception object as a parameter. It means that the normal program control flow stops and the search for a {{java:catch}} block begins. If that is not found at the current method level the search continues at the caller method level, until a matching {{java:catch}} block is found. If none is found the exception will be handled by the JVM, and usually the java program terminates. 

:When a {{java:catch}} &quot;matching&quot; block is found, that block will be executed, the exception object is passed to the block as a parameter. Then normal program execution continues after the {{java:catch}} block. ''See Java [[Java Programming/Keywords/try|exception handling syntax]].''

; Exception Object : This is the object that is &quot;thrown&quot; as a parameter from the error, and passed to the {{java:catch}} block. Exception object encapsulates the information about the error's location and its nature.  All Exception objects must be inherited from the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Throwable&lt;/code&gt;. See the [[#figure-1|UML diagram]] below.
{{Java/Illustration
|number=&lt;span id=&quot;figure-1&quot;&gt;6.1&lt;/span&gt;
|caption=Java exception classes
|image=[[Image:Java exception classes.svg|center]]
}}

; Matching rule : A thrown exception object can be caught by the {{java:catch}} keyword and specifying the exception object's class or its super-class.

; Naming convention : It is good practice to add Exception to all exception classes. Also the name of the exception should be meaningful, should represent the problem. For example &lt;code&gt;CustomerNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; indicate that customer was not found.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Reflection is a new concept in Java, and did not exist in classical compiled languages like C, and C++. 
The idea is to discover an object's attributes and its methods programmatically.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Reusability comes at the core of any modern computer language's framework. It is often desirable to use components you previously built in recurring environments. In [[w:Rapid_Application_Development|Rapid Application Development]], these prove more helpful as you can drag them off a list of components and use it elsewhere in your project. Such level of reusability is added into the Java Programming language with the help of the JavaBeans architecture.

JavaBeans are the mainstream Java component model, introduced in 1996 by Sun Microsystems. JavaBeans are defined as follows:

''&quot;A JavaBean is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool.&quot;''

Together with the component model, Sun released a simple visual composition tool, the BeanBox. It is mostly intended for experimenting with Beans rather than offering a professional IDE. For real world applications, one should better deploy on one of the Java IDEs like Visual Age or JBuilder that support the visual composition of JavaBeans.

As we will see, JavaBeans do not essentially differ from standard Java classes, which makes the component model quite easy to use. What sets a JavaBean apart from normal Java classes is that a JavaBean follows the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-138795.html Oracle JavaBeans Standard] (the term ''JavaBean'' or simply ''bean'' also refers to the instances of a JavaBean class). There is a set of features and conventions adopted for facilitating reuse:

* Presence of a no argument constructor;
* Support for persistence;
* Properties manipulated by getter and setter methods;
* Support for introspection;
* Events as the mechanism of communication between beans;
* Support for customization via property editors.

The JavaBeans standard provides a framework for creating objects to be used by GUI tools, including Java development environments. But in more common usage, a bean is a serializable class that follows the JavaBeans naming conventions for its properties. These naming standards make it easy to use Java [[Java Programming/Reflection|introspection]].

== Implementation ==

To follow these standards, the bean needs one or more ''properties'' abstractions which represent different state values of an object. A property has a name (a valid Java identifier) and a type (either a [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types|reference type]], a [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]] or an [[Java Programming/Arrays|array type]]). By default, the properties of a JavaBean class are inferred by the presence of either a getter method, a setter method, or both:
* A getter method which is used to obtain the value of the property from a bean. The name is usually of the form &lt;code&gt;get''PropertyName''&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the getter method for the String property &lt;code&gt;whiskey&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;public String getWhiskey()&lt;/code&gt;. For boolean properties (those whose type is [[Java Programming/Keywords/boolean|boolean]], the convention is to use the naming pattern &lt;code&gt;is''PropertyName''&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;isDiscounted()&lt;/code&gt; would be the getter method for a boolean property named &lt;code&gt;discounted&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the method signature of most getters is &lt;code&gt;public ''PropertyType'' get''PropertyName''()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;public boolean is''PropertyName''()&lt;/code&gt;.
* A setter method which is used to assign a value to a bean's property. A setter method is a method of the form &lt;code&gt;public void set''PropertyName''(''PropertyType'' value)&lt;/code&gt;. For the previous example, the setter could be invoked as &lt;code&gt;setWhiskey(&quot;bourbon&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;.

As per the JavaBeans standard, getters and setters defined as described above automatically determine the properties of the class. However, by creating &lt;code&gt;java.beans.PropertyDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; classes, you can specify alternate implementations by explicitly declaring the property names and the getter and/or setter methods for each property.

Properties are often implemented with [[Java Programming/Scope|private]] [[Java Programming/Variables|instance variables]], but this is not required.

== A Simple JavaBean ==

This is an example of a simple JavaBean type with the properties &lt;code&gt;int age&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;String color&lt;/code&gt;.

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.12: Puppy.java'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Puppy implements java.io.Serializable {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 348652158488L;

  private String color;

  private int age;

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

  public void setColor(String color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Persistence ==
The requirements for an object to be a bean is to define a public parameterless constructor, so that beans can be instantiated by builder tools in an uncomplicated way (In the Point bean, the parameterless constructor is given implicitly). Secondly, one of the interfaces &lt;code&gt;java.io.Serializable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;java.io.Externalizable&lt;/code&gt; need to be implemented. The interfaces do not prescribe the implementation of any methods, but are an approval, that the bean may be saved in persistent storage as in a file or database. In doing so, the bean can be restored after an application was shut down or transferred across networks. The ability to store state of a component in persistent storage is called ''persistence''. Java offers a standard serialization mechanism, which makes it very easy to serialize objects. Alternatively, a component can be stored in a customized manner (e.g. in xml format) by implementing the &lt;code&gt;Externalizable&lt;/code&gt; interface.

== Properties ==
The ''properties'' of a bean are all private fields that are accessible and modifiable by public methods. These getter and setter methods should be marked as such by following a simple naming convention: for some property named, say, &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; there should be a &lt;code&gt;getXxx()&lt;/code&gt; which returns the property value and a &lt;code&gt;setXxx()&lt;/code&gt; which sets the property.
 
== Introspection ==

In Java and J2EE programming, you can call a method on an object only if it is casted to a class or an interface that declares it. The structured definition of bean properties is very useful for comparing a single common property across several objects that are not and should not be related by inheritance.

For example, a program may contain both a bean representing a company's employees, and another containing a list of buildings that a company occupies. A programmer writing a function called &lt;code&gt;listAssetNames()&lt;/code&gt; wants to write a simple way of getting the field &quot;name&quot; from several beans that can get the field from both Employee and Building beans, and that can be easily adapted to get the same field from other types of beans that may not be written yet.

While this could be done by rewriting both Employee and Building so that they each inherit from one class named NamedObject, or by creating a NamedObject interface, both methods have their own problems. Using inheritance is limiting, as each child class can only inherit from one parent class, which limits the number of different classes that can share properties, as well as the number of common properties that can be shared. Furthermore, using inheritance to express relationships other than a simple &quot;is-a&quot; relationship can be confusing, as can looking through dozens of class definitions to find where a single &quot;dumb&quot; getter function is implemented. Creating an interface fixes the problems caused by the multiple inheritance rule, as a class can use any number of interfaces, but it still requires every shared property to be explicitly spelled out.

The simplest, most elegant way to deal with this type of relationship is to read the bean properties using introspection. The jakarta [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/ BeanUtils] package is a common way of handling objects that need to be related in this way, as it takes advantage of the regularity of JavaBean naming conventions.

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.13: Get property from a JavaBean'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static Object getProperty(Object o, String propertyName) {
   if (o == null ||
       propertyName == null ||
       propertyName.length() &lt; 1) {
      return null;
   }
   // Based on the property name build the getter method name
   String methodName = &quot;get&quot; +
                      propertyName.substring(0,1).toUpperCase() +
                      propertyName.substring(1);
   Object property = null;
   try {
      java.lang.Class c = o.getClass();
      java.lang.reflect.Method m = c.getMethod(methodName, null);
      property = m.invoke(o, null);
   } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
     // Handle exception
   }  catch (SecurityException e) {
     // No permission; Handle exception
   }
return property;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

or

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.14: Use [http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/ Apache Commons BeanUtils]'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import org.apache.commons.beanutils.PropertyUtils;

try {
  Object myValue = PropertyUtils.getSimpleProperty(o, propertyName);
} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
  // Handle exception
} catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
  // Handle exception
} catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
  // Handle exception
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Events ==
JavaBeans interact with each other by means of ''events''. Events are notifications, a component can give to other components, that something interesting has happened. An example for an event might be a mouse click on a button or the closing of a window. Beans can be source and target of events. To be informed about an event, a bean has to register at another Bean as a ''listener''.

The Java event model realizes the observer design pattern with the effect that the inter-component coupling is reduced. Method calls require tight coupling, as caller and receiver need to know each other at compile time, while with events all communication happens solely via interfaces.

A special kind of event are &lt;code&gt;PropertyChangeEvents&lt;/code&gt;. They are used to restrict some properties to take only specific values, for example for a month integer values between 1 and 12. Every time, such a ''bound property'' is modified, notifications to all registered ''PropertyChangeListeners'' will be send.

== Customization ==
Customization is done via ''Property Editors''. A property editor is a tool for customizing at design time a particular property type. Property editors are activated from so-called ''property sheets'', which display all properties of a bean. If a property is selected for customization, the property sheet finds out the type of the property, displays the appropriate property editor with the property's current value.

== Additional Remarks ==
A big strength of the JavaBean component model is that it is designed for simplicity. Developing JavaBeans is very simple, because a lot of behavior (like the platform independence or packaging mechanism) is supported in the Java Programming Language by default. However, one can optionally equip beans with additional objects like ''BeanInfos'' or custom ''PropertyEditors'' to use the component model in a more flexible way. A second facility is that Sun designed the whole Swing GUI library according to the JavaBeans component model. Thereby Swing components can easily be composed in visual builder tools.
 
However, JavaBeans do not realize all features of a component model. A drawback is that JavaBeans are restricted to the Java programming language, while an important goal of components is the independence of an implementation language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''5-Color Format''' exists in slightly different variations in the online and offline Magic communities. 5-Color was initially a fan-created format, not supported by the DCI. The basic rules could be summarized as follows:

*Decks must contain a minimum of 250 cards
*Decks must have no less than 20 cards of each color
*No more than four of each non basic land card
*The game is played for ante, and ante cards, including Contract from Below, are legal

A full list of rules, including banned and restricted cards, is maintained at: http://www.5-color.com/

Due to the popularity of this non-sanctioned format, WotC created a similar format in the Magic online game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Japanese Law and Government}}

==Historical background==
{{wikipedia|History of Japan}}
Written Japanese history began in the 700s AD, but the history of modern government in Japan has two distinct watersheds: the '''Meiji Restoration''' of 1868 and the occupation following '''World War II''', from 1945 to 1952. To understand Japanese government it is necessary to summarize the history of the country during this long period, focusing upon the two great watershed events.

===Pre-Meiji Japan===

For all of its recorded history, Japan has been headed, in one form or another, by an emperor or ''tenno'' (天皇), in an Imperial line that has allegedly remained unbroken from prehistory (660 BC, by Japanese mythology) to the present day. While the emperor ruled absolutely in early Japanese history, the power of the Imperial household declined around the 8th century AD, with the rise of powerful warrior houses and the dismantling of the Emperor's army.

From that era until 1868, Japan followed a feudal model of government, in which powerful warlords called ''daimyo'' (大名) ruled fiefs called ''kuni'' (国). Although the daimyo had practical power over the country, the Emperor was considered a living god in Japanese religion, and therefore had ''de jure'' status as the ruler of the nation from his palace in Kyoto, despite having little practical power.

Starting around the 1100s, the soldiers called ''samurai'' (侍) began to dominate society, emerging as a noble class at the top of the social hierarchy. In 1185, the Minamoto samurai family fought their way to dominate other clans and established the first military government or ''bakufu'' (幕府) of Japan in present-day Kamakura. The leader of the bakufu was called the ''shogun'' (将軍), and bakufu is often referred to in English as &quot;shogunate.&quot;

After a civil war in the late 1500s, a second bakufu led by the Tokugawa family was established in present-day Tokyo. Under the '''Tokugawa shogunate''', Japan retained its feudal structure but adopted a more centralized form of government than it had previously known. One of the key actions of the Tokugawa government was to banish all foreigners from Japan and close the country to all foreign trade in the early 1600s, save for a tiny Dutch trading post in Nagasaki. This period of isolation ended in 1854, when U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry successfully forced Japan to reopen its doors to trade. Once the technological disparity between the West and Japan became apparent to Japanese leaders, many sought to end the shogunate and modernize the country.

===Meiji and Taisho-era government===

In the Meiji Restoration, a group of samurai forced the shogun to resign, took the boy Emperor Meiji from his palace in Kyoto to the shogun's castle in Tokyo, installed the Emperor as the new head of the Japanese government, and defeated the armies still loyal to the shogun, effecting a total revolution in Japan. 

While Meiji himself was nominally the ruler of Japan, his advisors had practical control over the country. They promised to give Japan representative government, social equality, and industrial and technological advances from the West. The Emperor nationalized the fiefs of Japan between 1868 and 1871, consolidating them into '''prefectures'''; the daimyo were given noble rank and a share of their fief's output in exchange for relinquishing control.

Through several interim governments, one of the Emperor's advisors, '''Hirobumi Ito''', was tasked with examining various governments in the West and adopting a new government model for Japan. He drafted a constitution modeled after the German government, which was adopted in 1889. Although Japan now officially had a bicameral parliament and a court system, de facto control over the government was still firmly in the hands of the Emperor's advisors. This centralization of control continued during Japan's period of rapid industrial and military growth, lasting until the end of World War II.

===World War II and the Occupation===
{{wikipedia|Occupied Japan}}
One of the principal figures in postwar Japanese legal history is U.S. General '''Douglas MacArthur'''. After Japan's total defeat in 1945, MacArthur moved to Tokyo, took charge of the Allied occupation of Japan and began imposing a wide range of legal and political reforms. Overall, these reforms were aimed at pacifying and democratizing Japan.

The current constitution was drafted by MacArthur's staff, adopted by the Japanese leadership, and took effect in 1947. This constitution established Japan's current form of government and enshrined a number of political rights that had not previously been recognized, such as freedom of speech. MacArthur also ordered the nobility disbanded, broke up financial conglomerates called ''zaibatsu'' (財閥) that had previously dominated the economy, and pushed for a number of legal reforms, such as new corporate laws.

Since the end of the occupation in 1952, the overall model of the Japanese government has remained relatively unchanged, although many specific components of the system have been altered over the years to meet economic, political and social demands.

==The Emperor==
[[Image:Imperial_Palace_Tokyo_Panorama.jpg|thumb|250px|Imperial Palace, Chiyoda, Tokyo]]
The Emperor is Japan's head of state, but under the 1947 constitution, has very little practical role in the Japanese government. He is responsible for convening the National Diet, for appointing the Prime Minister and Chief Justice, and for other ceremonial tasks. To reinforce the Emperor's subservience to the people, he is governed by the '''Imperial Household Law''' of 1947 [http://web.archive.org/20010407104404/www.geocities.com/jtaliaferro.geo/1947law.html], a law passed and adopted by the Diet.

The Imperial Household Law is chiefly important in that it establishes rules for succession. Under Articles 1 and 2 of the Law, all Emperors must be male and a female is ineligible to inherit the throne. Historically, there have been several female Emperors, and currently, there are no male heirs capable of inheriting the throne more than two or three decades into the future. This has led to ongoing debate in Japan over whether to revise the law to permit females to inherit the throne.

===Rights of the Emperor===

Because of the Emperor's special constitutional status, his civil rights are limited in comparison to ordinary citizens. He does not have the right to bring suit in court (Supreme Court, Nov 20 1989), nor does he have the right to vote or travel freely.

==The National Diet==
[[Image:Kokkaigijido.jpg|thumb|250px|National Diet Building, Nagata-cho, Tokyo]]
The National Diet or ''Kokkai'' (国会) is the legislature of Japan. It functions similarly to a parliament in the Westminster model, as it is bicameral, and the lower house majority forms the government. However, it also resembles the American congressional model in that the upper house is elected, and both houses must generally consent to pass legislation.

The lower house is the '''House of Representatives''' or Shugiin (衆議院).

The upper house is the '''House of Councillors''' or Sangiin (参議院).

==The Cabinet==

The Cabinet (内閣 ''naikaku'') is the executive arm of the national government. It is comprised of Ministers of State (国務大臣 ''kokumu daijin'') headed by a Prime Minister (formally 内閣総理大臣 ''naikaku sori daijin''; informally 首相 ''shusho''). The Prime Minister is nominated by resolution of the Diet and appointed by command of the Emperor; the Prime Minister then elects the Ministers of State to form the Cabinet. The Prime Minister may remove and appoint Cabinet members at any time. (Constitution, Articles 6, 66, 67 and 68)

The Prime Minister must be a member of the Diet, and at least a majority of the Ministers of State must also be members of the Diet (Articles 67-68). All members of the cabinet must also be civilians (文民 ''bunmin'') (Article 66[2]), which is generally interpreted to exclude former members of the Imperial military and both former and current members of the Self-Defense Forces.

===Legislative process===

The Japanese lawmaking process is generally as follows:

* '''Proposals''' for new laws are sent to the Cabinet by ministries, agencies, Diet members, organizations, etc.
* For complicated matters, the Cabinet will often appoint a '''special committee'''.
* Either the Cabinet or its special committee refers the matter to '''affected ministries''' for input.
* The committee and ministry reports are reviewed by the '''Cabinet Legislation Bureau''', which drafts a bill.
* The bill goes to the government's (i.e. the ruling party/coalition's) '''political committee''', which finalizes it.
* The '''Prime Minister''' places the bill on the Diet floor for debate (Cabinet Law, Article 5).
* Both houses of the '''Diet''' vote to approve the bill.
* The Prime Minister and relevant Minister(s) of State countersign the bill (Constitution, Article 74).
* The '''Emperor''' seals the bill, and it becomes law.

==Elections==

===Article 15===

The most fundamental provisions governing all Japanese elections are found in Article 15 of the Constitution.

:'''Article 15:''' The people have the inalienable right to choose their public officials and to dismiss them.&lt;br /&gt;2) All public officials are servants of the whole community and not of any group thereof.&lt;br /&gt;3) Universal adult suffrage is guaranteed with regard to the election of public officials.&lt;br /&gt;4) In all elections, secrecy of the ballot shall not be violated. A voter shall not be answerable, publicly or privately, for the choice he has made.

Article 15 has been clarified by judicial precedent as follows:

* Labor unions may not penalize members for disregarding political endorsements. (Grand Bench, Dec 4 1968)
* The government has a responsibility to enable all citizens to vote, even if they are physically located outside of Japan. (Grand Bench, Sep 14 2005)
* Proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting are equally permissible to satisfy the right to choose public officials. (Grand Bench, Nov 10 1999)

===The Diet===

The houses of the Diet generally hold elections at separate times.

Members of the House of Councillors (upper house) serve for six years; there is an election every three years in which one-half of the members are subject to re-election.

Members of the House of Representatives have a maximum term of four years, which may be ended at any time by a dissolution of the House. The Cabinet is generally accepted to have the legal authority to dissolve the House at any time, although there are several competing schools of constitutional thought regarding this question.

* '''Article 69 theory''' holds that dissolution of the House may only take place when the House has voted for no confidence in the Cabinet under Article 69 of the Constitution. This is the only express constitutional grant of Cabinet authority to dissolve the House and is the narrowest reading possible of the document.
* '''Article 65 theory''' holds that dissolution of the House is part of the general grant of executive power found in Article 65 of the Constitution. as it does not fall under legislative or judicial power.
* '''Systemic theory''' holds that dissolution of the House is an inherent feature of the parliamentary system as it is generally employed throughout the world.
* '''Article 7 theory''' stems from the enumerated ability of the Emperor to dissolve the House (Article 7[3]). The Emperor must generally act with the advice and consent of the Cabinet in affairs of state (Article 3), and therefore the Cabinet is viewed to have the ability to force the Emperor's hand in dissolving the House.

==The bureaucracy==

===Entities===

From a legal personhood perspective, there are three types of government entity (''gyosei shutai'') in Japan:

* The nation (''kuni'')
* Local autonomous entities (''chiho kokyo dantai'') - prefectures, cities, towns, villages and other territorial entities
* Independent administrative corporations (''dokuritsu gyosei hojin'')

The nation and the various local entities are further subdivided into administrative organs (''gyosei cho''). At the national level, these take the form of ministries, agencies and committees. The upper-level organs of the national bureaucracy are:

* '''National Personnel Authority''' or Jinji in(人事院)
* '''Cabinet Office''' or Naikaku fu(内閣府)
** '''Imperial Household Agency''' or Kunai cho(宮内庁)
** '''Fair Trade Commission''' or Kosei torihiki iinkai(公正取引委員会)
** '''National Public Safety Commission''' or Kokka kouan iinkai(国家公安委員会)
*** '''National Police Agency''' or Keisatsu cho(警察庁)
** '''Financial Services Agency''' or Kinyu cho(金融庁)
* '''Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications''' or Soumu sho(総務省)
** '''Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission''' or Kogaito chosei iinkai(公害等調整委員会)
** '''Fire and Disaster Management Agency''' or Syobo cho(消防庁)
* '''Ministry of Justice''' or Houmu sho(法務省)
**'''Public Prosecutors Office'''s or Kensatsu cho(検察庁)
** '''Public Security Intelligence Agency''' or Kouan chosa cho(公安調査庁)
* '''Ministry of Foreign Affairs''' or Gaimu sho(外務省)
* '''Ministry of Finance''' or Zaimu sho(財務省)

** '''Forestry Agency''' or Suisan cho(水産庁)
** '''Fisheries Agency''' or Rinya cho(林野庁)
* '''Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry''' or Keizai sangyo sho(経済産業省)
** '''Agency for National Resources and Energy''' or Shigen enerugi cho(資源エネルギー庁)
** '''Patent Office''' or Tokkyo cho(特許庁)

* '''Ministry of Defense''' or Bouei sho(防衛省)
** '''Joint Staff Office''' or Togo bakuryo kanbu(統合幕僚監部)
** '''Defense Facilities Administration Agency''' or Bouei shisetsu cho(防衛施設庁)

====National defense====
{{wikipedia|Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution}}
Japan's national defense activities are legally restricted by Article 9 of the Constitution, which reads:

:'''Article 9.''' Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.
:2. To accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.

As a result, the military forces of Japan are officially known as &quot;Self-Defense Forces,&quot; and equipment is generally named in a manner which connotes a purely defensive rather than offensive purpose.

===Regulation===

Bureaucratic regulation (''gyosei rippo'') comes in several types:

* Binding regulations
** Executive orders (''shikko meirei'')
** Mandate orders (''inin meirei'')
* Non-binding regulations
** Directives (''kunrei'')
** Circulars (''tsutatsu'')
** Standards of review (''shinsa kijun'')
** Administrative guidance (''gyosei shido'')

====Administrative guidance====
{{wikipedia|Administrative guidance}}
Administrative guidance is one of the most pervasive forms of government regulation. It generally consists of requests for voluntary cooperation from private actors where no law exists to compel such cooperation. It may take an assistive form (such as guidance concerning more productive farming techniques), or may take a restrictive form (such as guidance concerning pricing or environmental standards).

Article 32 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets forth three general principles governing the practice:

# Administrative guidance must not exceed the administrative scope of the agency or office issuing such guidance.
# Administrative guidance must be premised upon requiring the voluntary cooperation of the counterparty.
# Failure to follow administrative guidance must not be the basis for any detrimental treatment. In particular, if administrative guidance concerns the amendment or withdrawal of a government petition, and the counterparty refuses to follow such guidance, the government is required to halt guidance (Article 33).

The contents and responsible parties for any administrative guidance must also be made clear, and must be provided in writing upon demand.

Administrative guidance is not a binding administrative act and therefore is not invalidated by virtue of being illegal. However, damages incurred because of illegal administrative guidance may be the basis for a claim against the state under the State Compensation Act.

===Enforcement mechanisms===

====Administrative subrogation====
Administrative subrogation (行政代執行 gyōsei daishikkō) is the ability of an administrative agency (or third-party delegate) to perform an administrative duty on behalf of a non-performing obligor. It is the standard procedure for enforcing administrative duties, and is generally governed by the Administrative Subrogation Act.

Administrative subrogation has several prerequisites, listed in Article 2 of the Act.
* The duty in question must be directly ordered by law, or by an administrative agency acting under the law.
* The duty must be one which could be discharged by a party other than the obligor.
* The obligor must fail to perform the duty on their own.
* There must be difficulty in securing performance through other means.
* Waiver of performance must violate the public good.

The procedure of administrative subrogation is as follows:
# The administrative agency must provide a written warning to the obligor in advance, noting an appropriate deadline for performance and that subrogation will be ordered if that deadline is not met (Article 3.1).
# If the deadline is not met, the agency issues a subrogation warrant (代執行令書) which lists the deadline for subrogation, the name of the responsible party for the procedure and the estimated costs for the procedure. The warrant is then sent to the obligor (Article 3.2). This step may be bypassed if there is an urgent need to complete the procedure (Article 3.3).
# The responsible party may then go on-site. They must carry identification of their status and show it upon demand (Article 4).
# Costs of performance are borne by the obligor (Article 2) but must be clearly specified, along with a deadline for payment, in a written notice for the obligor (Article 5). If the obligor fails to pay, the agency may collect through two other means:
#* Collection through the national tax collection system (Article 6.1)
#* Lien against the obligor's property, which will rank junior to any national or regional tax liens (Article 6.2).

====Other methods====

Timely enforcement (即時強制 ''sokuji kyōsei'') is used in situations where administrative law has been breached and immediate action is needed to correct the situation. An example would be a police officer taking a dangerously intoxicated person to the police station for sobering-up, or a fire brigade destroying buildings in order to contain a rapidly-spreading blaze.

Administrative penalties (行政罰 ''gyōsei batsu'') may take the form of criminal penalties or small fines.

===Review mechanisms===

====Information disclosure====

The Act Regarding Disclosure of Information Held By Administrative Organs (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律), commonly known as the Information Disclosure Act (情報公開法 ''Jōhō kōkai hō''), provides a system for demanding the disclosure of public documents.

====Administrative appeals====

The Administrative Appeal Act (行政不服審査法 ''Gyōsei fufuku shinsa-hō'') provides for three types of appeal against administrative decisions:
# Objection (異議申立て ''igi mōshitate''): filed against cabinet ministries and local government heads who have no direct overseeing entity
# Demand for review (審査請求 ''shinsa seikyū''): filed against overseeing entities with regard to the acts (or failures to act) of entities under their supervision
# Demand for second review (再審査請求 ''sai-shinsa seikyū''): appeal of a demand for review

An objection or demand for review must be filed within 60 days of receiving notice of the act in question, and within one year of the act itself (the one-year limit may be extended upon showing of cause). There is no time limit on filing appeal of an inaction. All substantive portions of these procedures are conducted in writing, although parties may be called to give oral testimony as part of the process.

An appeal petition does not ordinarily stop the government from continuing the act in question. In a demand for review, the overseeing entity may voluntarily order the deciding entity to suspend execution of its decision pending resolution of the appeal. This injunction may be issued unilaterally or at the request of the petitioner. An injunction must be granted by an overseeing entity if necessary to avoid grave harm to the petitioner as a result of the decision; however, if the injunction would cause major effects on the public welfare, the injunction may be withheld.

The response to an objection is called a decision (決定 ''kettei''), and the response to a demand for review is called a ruling (裁決, ''saiketsu''). In either case, there may be one of four results:

# Dismissal for procedural reasons (却下 ''kyakka'') is decided when the appeal has procedural flaws, such as when it is provided in an incorrect format or outside the prescribed time frame.
# Dismissal on the merits (棄却 ''kikyaku'') is decided when the appeal is procedurally sound, but when there is no factual reason to support the appeal.
# A circumstantial (事情 ''jijō'') decision or ruling is issued where the appeal has merit, but where overturning the decision would cause major harm to the public. This has the same effect as dismissal on the merits.
# Otherwise, acceptance (認容 ''nin'yō'') of the appeal is issued. Should the appeal be accepted, the act in question may be overturned in whole or in part and any past enforcement may be declared invalid (and the appellant restored to their pre-enforcement position). The act may also be amended to the extent necessary to make it legal. If an appeal of an inaction is accepted, the non-acting entity must act promptly following the acceptance of the appeal.

====Administrative litigation====

The Administrative Litigation Act (行政事件訴訟法 ''Gyōsei jiken soshō hō'') governs lawsuits against the government. Such suits are brought in courts (i.e. the judiciary) rather than within the entity whose act is being appealed. The decision to appeal or litigate is generally voluntary, but certain special cases (such as tax-related claims) require that the administrative appeal process be completed before a court may hear the case. There are four types of administrative litigation:

# Appellate litigation (抗告訴訟　''kōkoku soshō''): Appeal of an unlawful use of government authority. Appellate litigation regarding an administrative act is time-barred if not brought within six months of becoming aware of the act in question, or one year following the act, whichever comes first. There are six sub-types:
#* Action to revoke a disposition
#* Action to revoke a decision
#* Action to confirm invalidity
#* Action to confirm illegality of an inaction
#* Action to establish a duty
#* Action to enjoin
# Ex parte litigation (当事者訴訟 ''tōjisha soshō''): Resolution of a public law issue in the context of a private dispute. There are two sub-types:
#* De jure ex parte litigation: Confirmation of a legal relationship between the parties, e.g. a dispute over title to property as the result of an allegedly illegal expropriation.
#* De facto ex parte litigation: Litigation related to a legal relationship under public law, e.g. a dispute over the legality of the firing of a public servant.
# Popular litigation (民衆訴訟 ''minshū soshō''): Action of affected individuals against the government, e.g. contesting an election result.
# Entity litigation (機関訴訟 ''kikan soshō''): Litigation between administrative entities or organs, e.g. a dispute between a mayor and a city assembly.

====Claims for damages====

Japan also has a State Liability Act (国家賠償法) which allows aggrieved parties to claim damages against the government. Such claims are permitted in two instances:

* Where a public official, acting in the course of exercising public authority, intentionally or negligently harms another person in violation of the law (Article 1). In an Article 1 case, the government may demand indemnification from the public official when the act was intentional or grossly negligent (Article 1.2).
* Strict liability where a person is harmed due to defects in a road, waterway or other public structure (Article 2). The state may demand indemnification from another person responsible for the harm (Article 2.2). If the structure is owned and operated by different entities, each entity may be held liable (Article 3).

Aliens may also claim against the state under the Act, but only if a &quot;reciprocal guarantee&quot; (相互の保証) has been provided to Japanese nationals by the government of the alien plaintiff's home country (Article 6).

==The judiciary==
{{wikipedia|Judicial system of Japan}}
The judiciary is constitutionally responsible for conducting all final civil, criminal and administrative trials. Administrative entities may conduct initial reviews, but all decisions in such reviews are subject to review by the judiciary (Article 76).

===Court system===

* '''Supreme Court''' or Saiko saibansho(最高裁判所)
** '''High Court'''s or Koto saibansho(高等裁判所) (8)
*** '''District Court'''s or Chiho saibansho(地方裁判所) (50)
**** '''Summary Court'''s or Kani saibansho(簡易裁判所) (438)
*** '''Family Court'''s or Katei saibansho(家庭裁判所) (50)

The Constitution only provides for the Supreme Court, and delegates the task of establishing lower courts to the Diet.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the Emperor at the nomination of the Cabinet (Article 6.2). Other judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the Cabinet with the certification of the Emperor (Article 79). Lower court judges are appointed by the Cabinet at the nomination of the Supreme Court (Article 80).

All judges are appointed for ten-year terms and are required to retire upon reaching the mandatory retirement age (Article 80).

===Legal professions===

'''Bengoshi''' (弁護士) are &quot;attorneys at law.&quot; Like barristers in the British Commonwealth, they tend to specialize in appearing before courts, as this is the only field in which they hold a true monopoly. However, many bengoshi now have practices in corporate and commercial law as well, particularly in the major international law firms in Tokyo. Admission to the bar is very strictly regulated; the bar exam pass rate is generally kept between 2 and 3 percent, and the average bengoshi must take the exam six or seven times in order to pass (with only one sitting available per year). After taking the bar exam (generally following their bachelor's degree), bengoshi spend two years as Shiho shushusei (司法修習生); &quot;law trainees&quot; at the Legal Research and Training Institute (司法研修所) of the Supreme Court of Japan, where they are separated into Saiban kan (裁判官); &quot;judge&quot;, Kensatsu kan (検察官); &quot;public prosecutor&quot; and private attorney tracks.

'''Gaikokuho jimu bengoshi''' (外国法事務弁護士), &quot;gaiben&quot; for short, are attorneys qualified to practice foreign law in Japan. While they may consult with clients, draft documents and provide legal advice on foreign law, they may not participate in domestic litigation or advise on domestic law. There is no examination to become a gaiben, but a gaiben must be admitted to a foreign bar and practice there for at least three years (one of which may be spent in Japan). Some are Japanese; others are foreign nationals, mostly from the US. As of October 2009, there are 314 gaiben in Japan[http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/bar_search/index.cgi], up from 139 in June 2000[http://www.toben.or.jp/english/english_welcome.html]. Note that many foreign attorneys working in Japan do not register as gaiben; rather, they work in-house at corporations, as research and document specialists or simply practice without obtaining the qualification (the latter is technically illegal but not strictly enforced).

'''Shiho shoshi''' (司法書士) are &quot;judicial document attorneys&quot; who deal with a variety of legal documents for lawsults or land/enterprise registrations. They are generally considered to be slightly below bengoshi in status, but must pass an examination with a passage rate only slightly higher than the bar.

'''Zeirishi''' (税理士) are &quot;tax accountants&quot; who give advice on various tax matters.

'''Benrishi''' (弁理士) are &quot;patent attorneys.&quot; They differ from most foreign concepts of patent attorneys in that they have no monopoly on patent filing (bengoshi may also file patents), and have limited powers to participate alongside bengoshi in patent hearings or litigations.

'''Gyosei shoshi''' (行政書士) are &quot;administrative document attorneys,&quot; specializing in dealing with documents required by administrative laws (including immigration law) and filing documents for government ministries and agencies. They form one of the largest segments of the legal profession.

'''Koshonin''' (公証人) are &quot;notaries,&quot; a tiny class of legal professionals with a monopoly on certifying various types of documents, such as articles of incorporation. Retired judges, prosecutors, and high-ranking civil servants often become koshonin.

Additionally, many companies have '''legal departments''' predominantly staffed by employees with an educational background in law, but no professional qualifications.

==Types of local government==

Under the Local Autonomy Act, local public entities (''chiho kokyo dantai'') are categorized as follows:

*Ordinary local public entities
**Prefectures
**Municipalities
*Special local public entities
**Special wards
**Local public entity partnerships
**Property districts
**Regional development enterprises

===Prefectures (to/do/fu/ken)===

Japan is divided into 47 prefectures.

Most of the prefectures are called ''ken'' (県) in Japanese; for instance, Kanagawa Prefecture would be called ''Kanagawa-ken''. There are four exceptions: ''Osaka-fu'', ''Kyoto-fu'', ''Hokkaido'', and ''Tokyo-to''. As a result, the prefectures are collectively referred to as ''to-do-fu-ken'' (都道府県).

Before World War II, different laws applied to fu and ken, but this distinction was abolished after the war, and the two types of prefecture are now functionally the same. Hokkaido differs from other prefectures only in that it has regional government offices which carry out functions normally reserved for the prefectural capital; this is due to Hokkaido's great size relative to other prefectures. Tokyo-to, called Tokyo Metropolis in English, is also only slightly different from the other prefectural governments in that it offers some municipal services to the 23 cities, known as ''tokubetsuku'' (特別区) or &quot;special wards,&quot; forming its urban core.

===Municipalities===

====Villages, towns and districts====

Villages or ''mura'' (村) are the smallest type of municipality in Japan, and there are no legal requirements to be designated as a village. Prefectural governments may designate municipalities as towns or ''cho'' (町). Villages and towns are organized into rural districts called ''gun'' (郡) for addressing purposes, but these are not governing entities.

Villages and towns are distinguished from cities in that governance is through meetings called ''sokai'' (総会), comprised of all eligible voters within the town or village. However, villages and towns do elect a single head, known as a ''chocho'' (町長) in towns or ''soncho'' (村長) in villages.

====Cities====

The Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport may designate a villages or town as a city or ''shi'' (市) if its population exceeds 30,000; once designated as a city, a municipality is not generally demoted to village or town unless it is broken up.

Cities with more than 200,000 residents can become &quot;special cities&quot; or ''tokurei shi'' (特例市). Special cities have additional powers in pollution control, urban planning and outdoor advertising regulation, and receive their own insurance offices, 

Cities with more than 300,000 residents, but not large enough to be designated, are given &quot;core city&quot; or ''chukaku shi'' (中核市) status. There are currently 36 core cities.

The largest cities in Japan, with populations of over 500,000, are classified as '''government designated cities''' or ''seirei shitei toshi'' (政令指定都市). As of 2006, fourteen cities have been given this status (Yokohama, Kawasaki, Saitama, Chiba, Shizuoka, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Sendai and Sapporo), and another three cities (Sakai, Niigata and Hamamatsu) are scheduled to be designated as well.

Article 252 of the Local Autonomy Law gives designated cities additional powers in social welfare services for children, the elderly, the disabled, single mothers and others.

Designated cities are further subdivided into wards or ''ku'' (区). Wards are not considered to be local public entities (Article 281.1), and mainly exist to fulfill administrative functions of the largest city governments on a more localized level.

====Relationship with prefectures====

Municipalities and prefectures have separate, independent government structures. Municipalities are designed to provide most local government functions (Article 2.3) while prefectures are designed to provide functions for the larger area encompassing multiple municipalities (Article 2.5).

Municipalities must follow prefectural legislation, and any municipal act in violation of prefectural legislation is considered void (Article 2.16).

===Special wards===

The central core of Tokyo is divided into 23 &quot;special wards&quot; or ''tokubetsu ku'' (特別区). Despite the deceptive name, these &quot;wards&quot; are very similar to regular cities under Japanese law; in fact, all call themselves &quot;cities&quot; in English.

The ''ku'' name comes from the period before World War II when Tokyo was incorporated as a city. After the city was disbanded in 1943, most of its functions were passed down to the ''ku'', while a few others were passed up to the prefectural or &quot;metropolitan&quot; government.

==Legislation==
===Assemblies===
Each ordinary local public entity has an elected assembly (議会 ''gikai''). In towns and villages, citizens may directly govern through a general assembly (総会 ''sokai'') which has similar authority.

===Ordinances===
Local legislation takes the form of ordinances (条例 ''jorei''). Ordinances have the force of law, but are subordinate to all nationwide law, including statutes, Cabinet orders and ministerial orders. Ordinance-based legislation is a right granted to local authorities under Article 94 of the Constitution, and its particular mechanics are set forth in the Local Autonomy Act.

Citizens have the ability to petition their mayor or governor to introduce a new ordinance or repeal an existing ordinance. Such a demand requires the signatures of no fewer than one fiftieth of the total voting population of the entity (Article 74.1).

The maximum penalties which may be imposed for violating an ordinance are two years of imprisonment and/or one million yen of fines (Article 14.3).

==Administration==
===The executive===
The head (governor or mayor) of a local public entity is elected by the residents of their entity for a term of four years (Article 140). They cannot concurrently serve as a national or local legislator (Article 141) or as an officer of an entity which contracts with the local public entity (Article 142).

The key duties of the head are set forth in Article 149:
# Submission of draft ordinances to the assembly
# Preparation and execution of budgets
# Collection of taxes, fines and other payments
# Review of accounting
# Acquisition, management and disposition of assets, including public facilities
# Retention of public documents
# Other administrative duties

The head may also enact regulations (規則 ''kisoku'') related to their enumerated responsibilities. Regulations are subordinated to ordinances (and therefore to all national law), and the maximum penalty which may be imposed for violations is a fine of 50,000 yen (Article 15.2)

The head further retains reserve powers (専決処分 ''senketsu shobun'') to act on the assembly's behalf in certain situations:
# When the assembly fails to be formed
# When the assembly cannot reach its required quorum
# When there is not enough time to convene the assembly in an emergency
# When the assembly fails to pass a resolution on a necessary action

Acts under these reserve powers must be reported to the next session of the assembly, and require the approval of the assembly at that time in order to remain valid (Article 179).

===Commissions===

All local governments also have a certain number of commissions (委員会 ''iinkai'') which have responsibility for certain affairs.

Municipalities and prefectures always have the following four commissions:

* Education Commission
* Election Commission
* Personnel Commission
* Audit Commission

Other commissions are regularly found in prefectures and municipalities. Prefectures generally have a Public Safety Commission responsible for police oversight and a Labor Commission responsible for overseeing labor issues.

==Checks and balances==

===Veto power===

The head of a local government has the ability to veto legislation and return it to the assembly in several circumstances (Article 166 ''et seq.''). The head ''must'' veto legislation in the following circumstances:
# When legislation exceeds the authority of the assembly or otherwise violates national law or assembly rules
# When legislation cannot be executed (e.g. because of insufficient funds)
# When administrative, disaster prevention or disease prevention budgets are lowered or eliminated

The head also has discretionary veto power over the enactment or repeal of an ordinance, and over budgetary resolutions.

Following a veto, the assembly must again deliberate and approve the proposed legislation.

===No confidence resolutions===

The assembly conversely has the ability to vote no confidence in the head of the local government. Such a resolution requires the consent of three-fourths of the assembly, with a quorum of two-thirds present. Following such a resolution, the head of the government has a ten-day window to dissolve the assembly. Should the head fail to do so, the head is automatically removed from office at the end of this period (Article 178).

===Citizen checks and balances===

Citizens have several enumerated rights to petition local governments.

The '''Commercial Code''' or ''Shoho'' (商法) [http://www.ron.gr.jp/law/law/syouhou1.htm] is one of the Six Codes of Japan, and deals with the creation and operation of businesses. This chapter covers the 2005 revisions to the Commercial Code, including the New Company Law (新会社法 ''Shin-Kaisha-ho'') [http://www.ron.gr.jp/law/law/kaisha1.htm], most of which are effective May 1, 2006. All citations are to the Commercial Code unless indicated otherwise.

==Scope==

The Commercial Code principally applies to the operations of '''merchants''' (商人 ''shonin'') and to '''commercial acts''' (商行為 ''shokoi'') (Article 1).

===Merchants===

Merchants are defined in two classes: '''inherent merchants''' (固有の商人 ''koyu no shonin'') and '''quasi-merchants''' (擬制商人 ''gisei shonin'') (Article 4).

An inherent merchant must meet three criteria:
# A person; either a natural person or company.
# Engaging in commercial acts (defined below).
# Operating under their own name. This means that a company is a merchant, but directors and employees are not.

The &quot;quasi-merchant&quot; category is generally applied to farmers who sell their own produce, and to mining companies. Some other companies engaged in activities not strictly considered to be &quot;commercial acts&quot; may also become quasi-merchants by virtue of being organized as for-profit corporations.

Merchants are required to register various information with a local Legal Affairs Bureau (法務局 ''homukyoku'') of the Ministry of Justice. Every business, for instance, must register its trade name, as well as the name and address of its owner and its manager. These registrations form a public record of the business called a ''tokibo'' (登記簿). Both individuals and companies must make registrations, although there are additional requirements for companies, detailed below.

Merchants have fairly broad leeway to choose their trade name (商号 ''shogo''), with two major restrictions: companies must denote their legal classification in their trade name, and the trade name may not be identical to or closely resemble the trade name of another person.

===Commercial acts===

Commercial acts are defined as '''absolute commercial acts''' (絶対的商行為 ''zettaiteki shokoi''), '''business commercial acts''' (営業的商行為 ''eigyoteki shokoi'') or '''ancillary commercial acts''' (付属的商行為 ''fuzokuteki shokoi'').

An absolute commercial act is one that is construed as a commercial act no matter who the actor(s) happen to be. There are four basic types (Article 501):
# Buying and selling
# Entering a contract for sale
# Exchanging at a market
# Acts related to instruments (commercial paper, invoices, etc.)

Business commercial acts are only commercial acts when they are engaged in continuously by a merchant. There are twelve basic types (Article 502):
# Renting of personal and real property
# Manufacturing and production
# Providing of electricity and gas
# Transportation
# Contracting for projects or labor
# Publishing, printing, and photography
# Operation of an inn, restaurant, or amusement facility
# Currency exchange and other banking transactions
# Insurance
# Accepting deposits
# Brokerage
# Acting as an agent in a commercial act

Any act a merchant undertakes in the course of business is construed as an ancillary commercial act (Article 503).

===Special rules for commercial acts===

====Agency====

Agency may be '''contractual agency''' (締約代理商), where the agent enters a contract on the principal's behalf, or '''intermediary agency''' (媒介代理商), where the principal enters a contract with a party introduced by the agent. 

The basic duties of an agent are:

* to notify the principal of each transaction entered into on the principal's behalf (Article 27)
* to refrain from engaging in the same line of business as the principal (Article 28.1)

====Brokerage====

Brokers (仲立人 ''nakadachi-nin'') are defined as persons who engage as intermediaries for multiple merchants (Article 543). Brokers differ from intermediary agents in that they do not have a single principal; rather, they introduce two parties with whom they may have no formal contract at all, and then receive a commission on the final contract entered between the parties. 

The basic duties of a broker are:

* to keep custody of specimen copies used in the intermediating process (Article 545)
* to prepare and provide to the parties a closing document (結約書 ketsuyakusho) containing the name and address of each party (Article 546)
* to keep a record book containing the names and addresses of parties to each brokered transaction (Article 547)

====Transportation====
Transport by land and inland waterway is governed by commercial act provisions of the Commercial Code. The shipper (運送人 ''unsonin'') must provide a bill of lading (貨物引換証 ''kabutsu hikikaesho'') to the consignor (荷送人 ''niokurinin'') at the consignor's request (Article 571). The bill of lading may be transferred to a third party by endorsement; the holder of the bill may accept the shipment or demand that shipment be stopped or that the shipped item be returned to sender (Article 578).

A separate chapter is dedicated to maritime transport (海商 kaisho). The Commercial Code has no special rules governing air transport.

==Partnerships==

Under the Commercial Code, there are four types of companies: '''gomei kaisha''' (合名会社), '''goshi kaisha''' (合資会社), '''godo kaisha''' (合同会社) and '''kabushiki kaisha''' (株式会社). All four are considered to be juridicial persons. [Until 2006, many businesses were set up as '''yugen kaisha''' (有限会社), a form of limited company modeled after the German GmbH; these businesses are now designated as '''special yugen kaisha''' (特例有限会社 ''tokurei yugen kaisha'') and generally treated as kabushiki kaisha.]

The first three, discussed further in this section, are variants on the general concept of a '''partnership''' (組合 ''kumiai''). The partners (社員 ''shain'') form the company by contract and provide its capital.

A gomei kaisha is similar to a '''general partnership''' in English-speaking countries. If the company is unable to fulfill its debts, the partners are each individually responsible for satisfying those debts. 

A goshi kaisha is similar to a '''limited partnership''' in English-speaking countries. In a goshi kaisha, at least one of the partners is a limited partner (有限責任社員 ''yugen sekinin shain''). The limited partner(s) are not individually liable for the company's debts: they are only liable for the amount they invest.

A godo kaisha is similar to an American '''limited liability company'''. Each of the partners is a limited partner, only liable for the amount they invest. This is an important distinction between godo kaisha and other partnerships: creditors can only count on receiving the amount of capital paid into the company.

Small businesses are the most likely to be organized as partnerships; larger businesses are more likely to incorporate themselves as kabushiki kaisha.

==Corporations (kabushiki kaisha)==
{{wikipedia|Kabushiki kaisha}}
The predominant form of company in Japan is the kabushiki kaisha, officially translated in English as &quot;business corporation.&quot; Kabushiki kaisha are governed by the Company Law (会社法 ''Kaisha-ho'') of 2005, which supersedes many Commercial Code provisions that previously applied to kabushiki kaisha. ''All citations in this section are to the Company Law.''

===Formation===

Forming a kabushiki kaisha requires the services of at least one '''promoter''' (発起人 ''hokkinin''). The general steps are as follows:

# The promoter prepares '''articles of incorporation''' (定款 ''teikan'') and has them notarized.
# The company receives '''capital contributions'''. Usually, these are paid in cash to a bank or a trust company (Article 34.2). Property may also be given to the company in exchange for shares, but this generally requires a court-appointed appraiser to determine the fair value of the contribution (Article 33). As a general rule, at least one-fourth of the issuable shares must be issued at this time (Article 37.3) and the promoter must take at least one share. There are two separate procedures for issuing shares:
#* In an establishment by promoter (発起設立 ''hokki setsuritsu''), the promoter receives all shares in exchange for their investment, and then appoints directors of the company directly (often in the text of the articles of incorporation).
#* In an establishment by offering (募集設立 ''boshu setsuritsu''), the promoter receives at least one share, and offers remaining shares to third parties. The initial shareholders then hold an '''organizational meeting''' (創立総会 ''soritsu sokai'' ) to elect directors. If the promoter is to be the only shareholder, the promoter may do this individually (Article 25.1.1).
# The directors hold a '''board meeting''' and elect a representative director.
# The formation of the company is '''registered''' at the Legal Affairs Bureau, at which point the company is deemed to be legally formed (Article 49).

====Articles of incorporation====

Articles of incorporation must contain five elements (Article 27):

# The '''purpose''' of the company
# The '''trade name''' of the company
# The '''address''' of the head office
# The '''amount of capital''' initially paid into the company
# The '''promoter''''s name and address

Under the pre-2006 law, the number of issuable shares, number of shares to be issued, and method of public notice were also required in the articles of incorporation.

===Structure===

The basic actors in a kabushiki kaisha are:

* '''Shareholders''' (株主 ''kabunushi'') - elect directors and statutory auditors, and approve major transactions
* '''Directors''' (取締役 ''torishimariyaku'') - make decisions regarding company operations; elect representative directors
* '''Representative directors''' (代表取締役 ''daihyo torishimariyaku'') - represent the company and make executive decisions; most companies have one to three, but the number is theoretically unlimited
* '''Statutory auditors''' (監査役 ''kansayaku'') - monitor the actions of the directors

The number of directors and statutory auditors depends on the nature of the company.

Japanese companies do not usually have separate officers; the president (社長 ''shacho'') is generally a representative director who supervises a number of department chiefs (部長 ''bucho'').

===Shareholders===

====Shareholder meetings====

A shareholder meeting may be convened by:

# the representative director, with two weeks' prior notice to shareholders
# one or more shareholders who own three percent or more of the total number of shares outstanding, by demanding that the representative director call a meeting; if the director does not comply, a court can order a meeting (Article 297)
# all shareholders (Article 300)

====Derivative lawsuits====

====Sokaiya====

Some individuals, known as '''sokaiya''' (総会屋), purchase minor holdings in companies, and then extort money from the management by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings with accusations of lewd behavior, questioning business judgment, etc.

Sokaiya activities have been criminalized under the Company Law. The maximum penalties are (Article 970):

* 5 years in prison and/or &amp;yen;5,000,000 fine for sokaiya
* 3 years in prison or &amp;yen;3,000,000 fine for executives or employees who pay a sokaiya

Sokaiya must also return any extorted amounts to the company (Article 120).

====Share certificates====

If a company issues share certificates, any transfer of shares prior to the issuance of the corresponding certificate(s) cannot be asserted against the company (Article 128.2).

Hello! I am the main leader of this book. If you have any questions or suggestions on this book, please you are most welcome to ask me. By the way for the leagues, please can anyone get/submit photos for the following:-

* The FA (including Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool) 
* La Liga (LFP Logo)
* French League Logo
* German Bundesliga Logo

Please suggest which leagues and teams to take. I'm mostly confused as to what to choose! 

Have a nice time!

==Citizenship==

Japanese citizenship is generally governed by the '''Nationality Law''' of 1950 [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/CIAB/law01.html].

===Citizenship by birth===

Japan is a ''jus sanguinis'' state, meaning that it recognizes citizenship by blood, not by birth (as is the case in the United States, Ireland and many other countries). Article 2 provides three situations in which a person can become a Japanese citizen at birth:

# When either parent is a Japanese citizen at the time of birth
# When the father dies before the birth and is a Japanese citizen at the time of death
# When the person is born on Japanese soil and both parents are unknown or stateless

These rules are very strictly applied, which often creates problems for unmarried non-Japanese mothers. In such cases, unless the Japanese father gives express recognition of paternity before the birth, the child is generally not recognized as a Japanese citizen. [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?fl20050719zg.htm]

Article 14 requires any person who holds dual citizenship to make a '''declaration of choice''' between the ages of twenty and twenty-two, in which they choose to renounce either their Japanese citizenship or their foreign citizenship. If they fail to do so, the Minister of Justice may demand a declaration of choice at any time, and if the citizen fails to make the declaration within one month, their Japanese citizenship is automatically revoked. [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/CIAB/ciab-04.html]

===Naturalization===

The criteria for naturalization are provided in Articles 4 through 10 of the Nationality Law:

# Continuous residence in Japan for five years or more
# At least 20 years old and otherwise legally competent
# History of good behavior generally, and no past history of seditious behavior
# Sufficient capital or skills, either personally or within family, to support oneself
# Stateless or willing to renounce foreign citizenship

The Minister of Justice must approve all applications for naturalization. Review of an application generally takes about one year.

In the past, the &quot;good behavior&quot; requirement has been used to deny or severely delay many naturalization applications, particularly from Chinese and Koreans. [http://www.japantimes.com/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20010421a3.htm] While it was previously an unwritten requirement to adopt a Japanese name upon naturalization, the Ministry of Justice no longer recommends this practice. [http://www.japantimes.com/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20010420a4.htm]

==Entry and exit==

The basic law governing entry to and exit from Japan is the '''Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act''' of 1951 [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/IB/ib-19.html].

===Visa procedures===

Travel to Japan generally requires a visa. However, many countries have visa waiver programs with Japan which allow tourists to obtain short-term &quot;temporary visitor&quot; landing permission upon arrival in Japan. Immigration inspectors are also permitted to grant &quot;special landing permission&quot; in certain cases where a foreigner arrives in Japan without a visa, although such cases are infrequent.

Visas are only issued at diplomatic posts outside Japan. A person seeking a student or work visa is often issued a '''Certificate of Eligibility''', a Ministry of Justice document certifying that the person has met the general requirements to obtain the visa. This Certificate does not constitute landing permission in itself; the holder must provide it to an embassy or consulate in order to obtain the visa, which generally takes two or three business days to process.

Once an alien arrives in Japan with a valid passport (and visa, if required), the immigration inspector at the port of entry will examine those documents and place a landing permission seal inside the passport.

===Types of landing permission===

The various types of landing permission are listed in the Immigration Control Law and further described in the Ministerial Ordinance of May 24, 1990 [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/appendix1.html]. Generally, the type of landing permission is specified in a visa and officially granted upon arrival in Japan. A person can also have their landing permission extended or change to a different status by visiting an Immigration Office.

====Non-working====

The usual entry status for a tourist in Japan is '''temporary visitor'''. Temporary visitor permits are issued for either 15 or 90 days, depending on country of origin and purpose of visit.

Students who intend to enroll at accredited educational institutions are given landing permission for '''pre-college study''' (就学 ''shugaku'', 6 months or 1 year) or '''college study''' (留学 ''ryugaku'', 1 or 2 years). Students attending unaccredited institutions, such as many foreign-run schools in Japan, receive landing permission for '''cultural activities''' () which is valid for 6 months to 1 year. College students are not initially permitted to work, but may receive permission to work up to 28 hours per week by filing with the Ministry of Justice.

====Working permission====

Work permits fall into a number of categories. Most are valid for 1 or 3 years, except for entertainer permits (valid for 3, 6 or 12 months) and diplomatic/NGO permits (valid for duration of post). An employer is generally necessary to serve as the applicant's guarantor; after landing, the applicant may work for any employer within the scope and duration of their landing permission.

====Spouses and children====

Spouses and dependent children of aliens permitted to land in Japan are given landing permission for the same duration as their spouse/parent.

Spouses and dependent children of Japanese nationals may receive landing permission for 1 or 3 years. Generally, initial landing permission is for one year, and is extended to three years upon the first or second renewal.

====Long-term residency====

Long-term residency is a special class of residency generally granted to refugees, Japanese descendants from overseas, and other particular groups.

====Permanent residency====

Permanent residency (永住権 ''eijuken'') is the strongest form of landing permission, granting the bearer the right to live and work in Japan indefinitely. It must be applied for and obtained within Japan, generally after five to ten years of continuous residency there.

One major advantage of permanent residency is that financial institutions often deny loans to foreigners who are not permanent residents. This practice was upheld as legal in ''Herman v. Asahi Bank'' (Tokyo D. Ct. Nov. 12, 2001) [http://www.debito.org/hermancase.html].

==Alien registration==

Once in Japan, aliens must register with the local government office having authority over their place of residence, pursuant to the '''Alien Registration Law''' of 1952 [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/IB/ib-54.html]. Each registrant is issued a Certificate of Alien Registration, colloquially known as a Gaijin Card, which they are legally required to carry at all times and present upon demand (e.g. by a police officer). The certificate is the property of the Japanese government and must be surrendered at the time the alien leaves Japan, unless they have first applied for re-entry.

This WikiBook is intended to be an useful resource for trainee anaesthetists revising for the Primary FRCA (Fellow of Royal College of Anaesthetists), which is a British exam, but would also be useful for exams of other countries.

I first had the idea for a WikiBook when I myself was revising for the Primary FRCA. I had found that writing 'textbook' entries as Word documents from my own notes was an excellent way to revise, and because I pretended that I was writing for other people's consumption, I spent more time checking little details and I found it easier to memorise things.

Later, I used Wikipedia for background information on a multitude of topics including pharmacology and physiology, and thought the concept of free knowledge and editability was great. I read about WikiBooks and though that a WikiBook might be a way of sharing knowledge on Anaesthesia Basic Sciences for free, among all anaesthetists. I put the idea 'on the shelf' for when I had finished the exams, and now (having passed) here it is.

I invite all anaesthetists to add to and edit the following. Particularly welcome are additions and editing by people currently studying for, or recently passed, Royal College of Anaesthetists UK exams, as they are most likely to understand the requirements for the Primary FRCA.

Editing an entry is an excellent way to learn a piece of information forever!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's everything I've written for this module so far, before running out of stamina:

----

'''Continuation passing style''' (CPS) in Haskell is, like monads, rather difficult to understand.

What makes a CPS value a CPS value is the fact that it takes an extra parameter, called a continuation. The continuation represents the function being applied to the value: the CPS value simply has to apply the continuation to the value within it. A very simple example:

 cps3 cont = cont 3

The consequence of this taking a continuation is a biggie: the CPS value has access to the function being applied to it. This allows values to do weird things: for example, it's easy to make a value that ignores the continuation and returns a different value instead. This is similar to the Maybe monad, where Nothing has the effect of ignoring whatever functions are applied to its &quot;contained value&quot;.

The type of a CPS value is simple:

 (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r

Here, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; represents the CPS value's &quot;inner type&quot;. &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; r)&lt;/code&gt; is the function applied to the CPS value, and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; is of course the return type of this function.

Note that there is nothing preventing the CPS value from imposing restrictions on &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; as well as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;; a function like &lt;code&gt;const 'a'&lt;/code&gt; can be used as a CPS value:

 const 'a' :: (a -&gt; Char) -&gt; Char

Since &lt;code&gt;const 'a'&lt;/code&gt; ignores any function passed to it, it doesn't matter what this function takes. However, &lt;code&gt;const 'a'&lt;/code&gt; will always return a &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;, so this must be the function's return type, to &quot;disguise&quot; the fact that the &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt; is ''not'' being pulled from the continuation. This restriction is imposed by the fact that a CPS value has to return the same type as its continuation--even if the continuation is not used.

CPS values aren't often used alone: continuation passing style programming often contains them in great quantities. To make things easier to understand, there's a type with a data constructor that works on CPS values:

 newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r) }

Here &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; represents the restrictions on return type imposed by the CPS value, and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; represents the value contained within the CPS value. The data constructor Cont turns a CPS value into a Cont value, and runCont turns it back again.

Adding &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; allows us to stitch together continuations:
&lt;pre&gt;
instance Monad (Cont r) where
    return a                 =  Cont $ \k -&gt; k a
    (Cont c) &gt;&gt;= f           =  Cont $ \k -&gt; c (\a -&gt; runCont (f a) k)
&lt;/pre&gt;
First of all, notice that &lt;code&gt;(Cont r)&lt;/code&gt;, and not &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt;, is being defined here as an instance of Monad. This is because it is what &lt;code&gt;(Cont r)&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;applied&quot; to that defines what's &quot;contained within&quot; the CPS value.

Now, it's not necessary to understand just what &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; does and how it does it. It just feeds a CPS value into a CPS function and returns a CPS value.

In case you're getting into the &quot;gimme some CODE&quot;: we're getting there.

Now, we can define an &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; function. It is the same as the usage of &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; above, except making a &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; value rather than simply a CPS value.

 exit x = Cont (const x)

Also, we'll make a &lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; function that takes the value &quot;inside&quot; a &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; value and returns it:

 finish x = runCont x id

This turns its &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; argument into a normal continuation, then applies it to &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, ending the computation.

Finally, we'll note that &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt; acts as a &quot;nop&quot; in any do-block. Here's a basic example of division:

 divide x y = finish (do if y == 0
                           then exit (error &quot;Division by zero&quot;)
                           else return ()
                         return (x / y))

This does seem very useless, but many imperative constructs can be simulated in the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad.

This leaves the open question: how do I simulate the inarguably imperative monad that is &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;? Well, &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; is, in fact, the most general of the monads, in that any monadic value can be turned into a &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monadic value and back again.

Looking again at the type of &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;:

 (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

Wait. Did I see a CPS value there? Yep: &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as taking a monadic value and making a CPS value out of it. Simply apply &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; to this value, and we have a fully functional value in the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad!

 monadToCPS :: m a -&gt; Cont (m b) a
 monadToCPS x = Cont (x &gt;&gt;=)

And the inverse:

 cpsToMonad :: Cont (m a) a -&gt; m a
 cpsToMonad x = runCont x return

One nice thing about this is that it will work on ''any'' &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; value with the appropriate type: it doesn't have to be one generated by &lt;code&gt;monadToCPS&lt;/code&gt;. This allows us to mix other monads with &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; quite easily, though it's against the rules to combine other monads with each other. (Note that &lt;code&gt;cpsToMonad&lt;/code&gt; is also the intuitive definition of a &lt;code&gt;finishMonad&lt;/code&gt; function, that returns a monadic value instead of &quot;just any value&quot;.)

== Haskell's self-defeating authors ==

Why the fixation amongst haskellers on mathematics? I mean, you all couldn't think of a better example for CPS than the quadratic formula? There's simply no need to be adding to the complexity of this, it only serves to steepen the learning curve for us non-math-gurus... seriously...

:I can only encourage you to strengthen your math skills, the quadratic formula is like 9th grade... and a good example, mainly because the &quot;classic&quot; example of error continuations is uncommon in Haskell, since we have &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;/code&gt;.

== Error in &quot;a note of typing&quot; ==

As it appears to me, almost all explanation in this chapter is wrong.

Concerning type of k:
  k :: a -&gt; Cont r b
The b type isn't arbitrary because of we don't do anything with result of k. It's arbitrary because we don't do anything with
continuation supplied to Cont r b.

Explanation:
The return type of k is a Cont Monad which has type signature ((a-&gt;r)-&gt;r).

As it stands in definition of callCC:

  class (Monad m) =&gt; MonadCont m where 
    callCC :: ((a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a 

  instance MonadCont (Cont r) where 
    callCC f = Cont $ \h -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; h a)) h

As we can see, our k is 
  (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; h a) 
It ignores it's parameter which is of type (a-&gt;r) where type of expression is Cont r a

As we can see, because input function is ignored, the &quot;a&quot; type is arbitrary, and thats the real reason for k signature.

Also, the reason we must use &quot;return&quot; at the end of callCC instead of k lies elsewhere.

As we know
  x&lt;-m1
  m2
really means 
  m1 &gt;&gt;= (\x-&gt;m2) and type of this is 
  m1 :: m a 
  (\x-&gt;m2) :: (a -&gt; m b)

Substituting this for our example:
  x = Msg :: String
  m1 = callCC
  m2 = return (length Msg)

If we use return at the end of callCC, it returns Cont Monad of type Cont r String and it matches type of Msg.
If we use k instead of return, type of k is already binded to () by use in &quot;when&quot; so it has type Cont r () and this is mismatch with String in definition of 
  callCC &gt;&gt;= (Msg -&gt; return (length Msg)).

: I don't quite understand. Strictly speaking, the explanation in the article is correct, if very unclear. The problem is that while the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;k :: a -&gt; Cont r b&lt;/code&gt; is indeed arbitrary, you cannot have both &lt;code&gt;b=String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b=()&lt;/code&gt; as you point out as well.
: The advice of always ending a do-block in &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is wrong. The proper solution is to give &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; a rank-3 type:
:: &lt;code&gt;callCC :: ((forall b. a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a&lt;/code&gt;

:: After reading explanation from article many more times and giving it Deep Thought, I must admit it is correct. Probably my tendency to be very precise and the fact that I was still learning all of that made me unable to understand the text appropriately.
:: However, I don't understand why advice about &quot;return&quot; is bad. The type You gave is the same as in actual definition, unless explicit &quot;forall&quot; changes something (what? :).
:: -- Spawarotti 13-IX-2008

::: Ah, after some Deep Thought on my part, there are actually two issues here and the advice about &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is partly right and partly wrong.
::: To see why &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is no panacea against type errors with &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, consider the following

   foo :: Cont r Int
   foo = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
      x &lt;- k 41
      let z = (x + 2) :: Int
      when True $ k 42
      return 43

::: What type does &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; have? The first two lines in the do-block force it to be of type &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Cont r Int&lt;/code&gt; while the third line forces it to be of type &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Cont r ()&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; from the type of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; should be both &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; which is clearly not possible. (Well, unless you use the type I gave with the explicit &quot;forall&quot;. Look at its position, it's not just an explicit forall. The chapter [[Haskell/Polymorphism]] ought to explain this. Meanwhile, have a look at [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/other-type-extensions.html#universal-quantification GHC's Users Guide, Arbitrary rank polymorphism] and/or ask a haskell mailing list or #haskell. Basically, you can use several &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; now.) The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; didn't help here.
:::On the other hand, I think the advice was meant to mean that you should not use &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; as the last statement, like in

  bar :: Cont r Int
  bar = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
    let n = 5
    when True $ k n
    k 25

::: In this case, replacing the final &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; helps. But arguably, using the rank-3-type for &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; is the correct solution in this case as well.

== 2013-10-25 changes ==

I have just performed significant changes to this chapter. The structure was largely preserved; the tone, however, is quite different. I felt the original text did not assumed too many things as self-evident when introducing CPS and shrouded &lt;code&gt;Code&lt;/code&gt; in unnecessary mystery; the end result being making the subject look harder than it actually is. My take on rectifying that without slowing down things too much rests on what I, inspired by [http://stackoverflow.com/a/3323122/2751851 this excellent StackOverflow answer by C. A. McCann], called ''suspended computations'', things which take continuations to produce final results, and which are wrapped by the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt;. A few subsidiary changes worth mentioning:

* A note now presents attoparsec as an example of performance-motivated CPS usage.
* An organic genesis is now presented for the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad instance.
* The digression about the result type of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;'s escape function was cut down to a brief body note. However, it is now coupled to a proper explanation of the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; signature.

To do:

* Further clean-up of the introductory paragraph about possible uses of CPS in Haskell;
* Pointing out the analogies between other function-wrapping monads and &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; wraps state transitions and threads state; analogously, &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; wraps suspended computations and threads continuations);
* Improving and/or replacing the examples, especially those in the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; section;
* Making the code blocks look better (waiting for the fix to [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52509 the GeSHi single quote bug] to reach Wikibooks).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Loan words&quot; in Japanese==
In Japan, several &quot;loan words&quot; from English are commonly used. You already know more Japanese than you think just by knowing English. &quot;Loan words&quot; from Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, French, and Italian have also been incorporated into the language, though English remains the most common.

=== About &quot;loan words&quot; ===
The pronunciation of foreign words has to be changed quite a bit in order to flow in Japanese.
* Some words' pronunciations are simply changed. For example, curtain becomes ''kaaten'', hotel becomes ''hoteru'', and elevator becomes ''elebeetaa.''
* Some words are abbreviated slightly. For example, supermarket becomes ''supaa'', kilometer-and kilogram- become ''kilo'', etc.
* Some words do not correspond to their original meaning. For example, the Japanese ''manshon'' translates to condominium, '''not''' ''mansion''.

===C===
&quot;CD&quot; cd changes the directory. 

===L===
&quot;LS&quot; lists the files in the directory.

===R===
&quot;read&quot; reads a selected file in the current directory. Example: cd Documents -&gt; cd Homework -&gt; ls (posts a list of all homework files in 'Homework': example Speech.pdf) -&gt; read Speech.pdf

=== X ===
'''X''' is normally a symbolic link to the X server for your computer, such as '''XFree86''' or '''Xorg'''. The normal way to start X is not directly, but by using [[#xinit|xinit]] , [[#xdm|xdm]] or [[#startx|startx]].

You can invoke the X server with
 $ '''X -quiet -query ''remotemachineaddress'''''

to get a graphical login screen for the remote machine. See [[#xdm|xdm]].

=== xbiff ===
'''xbiff''' displays a small box indicating whether your local Unix inbox has mail. Start with:

 $ '''xbiff'''

=== xcalc ===
'''xcalc''' draws a window with a scientific calculator. The easiest way to operate the calculator is to click the buttons. The calculator understands order of operations (multiply before add) and provides common functions such as sine, square root, and the values of e and pi. The calculator normally displays eight digits and supports scientific notation.

=== xclipboard ===

=== Xconfigurator ===

=== xdm ===

An X display manager used to manage graphical sessions of multiple users. It is usually started automatically as a system service to present the user with a GUI login screen instead of the console login prompt. Modern systems usually use GDM (the GNOME Display Manager) and KDM (the KDE Display Manager) instead.

=== xdvi ===
A normal program not a part of X11 itself, for viewing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format DVI format] typesetting graphics files, *not* related to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface Digital Visual Interface] video port (which *is* important to X11 itself).  :)

== Fonts ==
When your X11 clients draw text, they use ''fonts'', which are drawings of standard characters, such as letters, numerals, and punctuation. At minimum, a font is a ''typeface'' (also called ''family'') such as &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Bitstream Vera Sans;&quot;&gt;Bitstream Vera Sans&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Luxi Mono;&quot;&gt;Luxi Mono&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Nimbus Roman No9 L;&quot;&gt;Nimbus Roman No9 L&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: fixed;&quot;&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;. More specifically, a font includes a size or style, such as &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Bitstream Vera Sans; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Bitstream Vera Sans Bold Italic 10 point&lt;/span&gt;. Fonts also come in three categories called ''serif'' (like Nimbus Roman No9 L), ''sans-serif'' (like Bitstream Vera Sans), and ''monospace'' (like Luxi Mono or &quot;fixed&quot;).

Fonts come in several font formats such as bitmap, TrueType, and PostScript. TrueType fonts are &lt;tt&gt;.ttf&lt;/tt&gt; files. If the X11 server and client are at different computers, then you might have installed different fonts at each computer.

=== Core versus Xft fonts ===
X11 clients can draw texts in several different manners:
# ''Use the original core X11 protocol to draw text.'' With this approach, the X11 server loads and stores each character of a font. Thus, if the X11 server (with the screen and keyboard) and the X11 client (with your web browser or other window) are at different computers, then you must install fonts at the server. The server converts the characters into bitmaps and draws them upright, which means that you cannot rotate them. Further, the server never antialiases the fonts.
# ''Use the Xft library and RENDER extension to draw text.'' With this approach, the X11 client loads and stores each character of a font. You must install fonts at the client machine. The client converts the characters into geometric shapes. It decomposes the shapes into basic shapes such as triangles and trapezoids, then sends these to the server. The server draws the shapes and optionally provides antialiasing, which smooths the appearance of fonts. One can also rotate these shapes.
# ''Use a client-side library such as libart_lgpl or SDL_ttf to draw text.'' While libart_lgpl is a vector-graphics library, SDL_ttf is a library to draw text for programs that use the cross-platform Simple DirectMedia Layer. Typically, these libraries load the geometric shapes, then draw them into bitmaps, possibly antialiased and rotated, before sending them to the X11 server, as if the X11 server knew nothing about text. It is also possible for these libraries to do as Xft does and use RENDER.

The first X11 clients used the core X11 protocol to draw text, as that was the only choice. However, several clients now use Xft. Because GTK+ and Qt, the toolkits behind several applications including all GNOME and KDE applications, switched to Xft, many programs on most desktops, including Konqueror, now use Xft.

=== Configuring Xft with fontconfig ===
The older Xft version 1 had its own configuration scheme. Version 2, described here, uses ''fontconfig'' for its configuration. Because fontconfig is independent of X11, there are programs like '''fc-list''' which list fonts available to X11 programs like Konqueror, but do not themselves use X11. An easy terminal command to list available fonts is:

 $ '''fc-list | sort | less'''

The default &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; allows you to optionally create a custom file &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; for your custom font settings.

Some customizations include:
# You can add additional directories that contain fonts. Fontconfig searches directories recursively. If you have a folder with &lt;tt&gt;.ttf&lt;/tt&gt; files in it, then you can simply add it to &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt;; you do not need to write a &lt;tt&gt;fonts.scale&lt;/tt&gt; or any other such file for fontconfig.
# You can specify additional fonts to search for obscure characters. If you do not see a right-arrow between these quotes &quot;&amp;rarr;&quot; then the right-arrow character was not found during the search for characters to draw this sentence. In fact, the Bitstream and Luxi fonts included with Xorg and the Nimbus fonts from ghostscript do not have that character, but the &quot;Standard Symbols L&quot; font from ghostscript includes a right arrow.

However, &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; uses a strict XML syntax. You must declare &lt;tt&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning of the file, and you must put everything else in the file between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;fontconfig&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;/fontconfig&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags, else it will not work.

Here is an example file, showing how to perform the two customizations:
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;fontconfig&gt;
  &lt;dir&gt;/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
  &lt;alias&gt;
   &lt;family&gt;sans-serif&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;prefer&gt;&lt;family&gt;Standard Symbols L&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/prefer&gt;
  &lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;alias&gt;
   &lt;family&gt;serif&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;prefer&gt;
    &lt;family&gt;Standard Symbols L&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;/prefer&gt;
  &lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;alias&gt;
   &lt;family&gt;monospace&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;prefer&gt;
    &lt;family&gt;Standard Symbols L&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;/prefer&gt;
  &lt;/alias&gt;
 &lt;/fontconfig&gt;

Adding a directory of fonts is simple: use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;dir&gt;''/full/path''&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. The above example adds &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts&lt;/tt&gt;, which at some computers is the location of Ghostscript fonts including Standard Symbols L.

To add Standard Symbols L to the list of preferred fonts, so that we can always draw the right-arrow &quot;&amp;rarr;&quot;, is more difficult. Suppose that you had set the Konqueror web browser to use Luxi Serif to display web pages. You then had loaded some text including some right-arrows. When fontconfig failed to find a right-arrow in the Luxi Serif font, it resorted to the generic font name &quot;serif&quot;, which is actually an alias for a list of preferred serif fonts.

For reference, here are the font aliases from the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; included with Xorg 6.9rc1.

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Installing new fonts ===
{{incomplete}}

Depending on your distribution there may be a foolproof font installation program - or not. In any case, using simple commands always works. 

To install new fonts, just download the font files (for example &quot;.ttf&quot; files) and put them in the correct directory. For Xft with fontconfig, where and which types of fonts you can install is determined by the default configuration file &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/code&gt; or the extra configuration in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/local.conf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Most distributions have in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/code&gt; the following line: 
&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;dir&gt;~/.fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This means you can install new fonts in your home directory with simple user privileges. To update fontconfig you use the command &lt;code&gt;fc-cache&lt;/code&gt;. 

To give an example: suppose you have downloaded the font &lt;code&gt;anicefont.ttf&lt;/code&gt; to 
your Desktop. Open your favorite terminal or a simple &lt;code&gt;xterm&lt;/code&gt;, and type:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd 
mkdir .fonts
cd .fonts
cp ~/Desktop/anicefont.ttf .
fc-cache
&lt;/pre&gt;
Done. You can check whether the font was successfully installed by using the command &lt;code&gt;fc-list&lt;/code&gt; (for example paging it with &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;more&lt;/code&gt;) and check for the name of your font:  &lt;code&gt;fc-list | sort | more&lt;/code&gt;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pre-DNA evolution ==
The unlikeliness of emergence of DNA Protozoa by chance makes this hypothesis unscientific. The theories of origins of life thus rely on a pre-DNA stage of evolution, perhaps even several stages, of which the DNA life is a byproduct that finally incorporated the previous stages. What life needs are evolution-capable replicators. DNA/protein life was very likely predecesed by RNA life, as RNA molecules are capable of self-catalysis.

==========

What is meant by 
How the DNA was created in exact sequence, it is found?

Let us say I have a trillion dices and throw it, they will land up in some sequence. 
Now if I ask how the dices were arranged in the sequence we found them to be.
From probability, we know that this sequence has little probability and to get the same sequence again I will require more time than my life.
Does that mean that dices were arranged by some other intelligent being and not by chance?

The great number of outcomes and very little probability does not negate a event that occurred in past.

It is fact that genetic code was created in some form in past. It is also fact that it could have been created in some other form. However, little probability does not negate that event. Initially it did evolve into what it is today.

== Evolution isn't about the creation of life. ==

Evolution is about the change of species over time, it doesn't posit how life was created in the first place.  AFAIK, scientists aren't yet really sure how the conversion of non-life to life occured.

I should also point out that being a creationist doesn't require believing in the Bible (the most obvious counter-example is probably jews). [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:11, 31 January 2006 (UTC)



== Why not taking a look on what the Holy Qur'an states about creation? ==


I noticed that the Writer kept on mentioning Judaism and Christianity as if they were the only Monotheistic Religions found on Earth. He didn't mention any about Islam as the third global religion which calls people to worship God the One in the most purest Monotheistic form without considering any sons or partners, without  Images of God, while ensuring on God's Unlikliness to anything.

Islam offers too the best description of Creation, considering the Big Bang and the expected shrink of the Universe.

In Muslim faith too, God do not take a physical form to find a 'place' of a throne &lt;inside&gt; the universe we live in. It just states it as what the Holy Qur'an says: {(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is 
the One that hears and sees (all things).} [Holy Qur'an 42:11]

The Holy Qur'an talks about the incomplete spherical shape of planet Earth. It talks too about the Earthly &lt;tiny&gt; atmosphere and the huge &lt;expanding&gt; Universe outside it, besides pointing to the huge universal celestial bodies and its complicated organized patterns.

When putting the foregoing besides the fact which states that Islam accepts and respects the books and the prophets of the two previous Monotheistic religions, i.e: Judaism and Christianity: So it is logical to consider Islam when talking about Creation or about God in Human History, as the last and the most informative form of Monotheism on Earth.

== what about the AP? ==

I think before diving into speculation about aliens planting seeds, the god for the third millenium could really really use a quality treatment of the anthropic principle.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Austria/Austria-Hungary/Österreich-Ungarn (German)/Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia (Hungarian)==

Leader at 1901: Kaiser Franz Joseph von Habsburg (in Hungarian, Ferenc Jozsef)

Color: Red

Neighbors: Germany, Russia, Italy, and Turkey

Home supply centers: Trieste, Vienna, Budapest

It takes a skilled negotiator to prosper with Austria in Diplomacy. Austria has four neutral supply centers within reach in the first year and therefore has the capacity for explosive growth, but realistically one or more centers will have to be offered to other players in exchange for alliances.  Austria lies in the centre of the board, and must placate or destroy Turkey, Russia, and Italy in order to do well. Germany, Austria's last neighbour, is usually more concerned with more western and northern affairs, and can usually be relied on as an ally for most of the game. Austria has the highest rate of early eliminations among all the seven Great Powers, and so the Archduke's strategy must have as its bedrock foundation early survival; fortunately, Austria is rarely a power that stagnates early. Unlike, say, England, Turkey or Italy -- for whom languishing at four centers the whole game is a real possibility -- Austria, should it survive to 1904, usually does so with a secure 6-7 center power base.

==18 Center Goal==

The other problem Austria has aside from the very real threat of an elimination by 1903 is converting a strong (10-12) center position into an outright victory. Austria is situated in what is essentially a central plain that stretches from Greece and Bulgaria in the south up to Germany in the northwest and St. Petersburg in the northeast. St. Petersburg and Germany can ultimately be defended by Western opposition against Austria to perfection, but Germany is close enough to be a feasible area of conquest. Germany, Austria, the Balkans, and southern Russia (that is, not St. Petersburg) account for thirteen centers. After that, the remaining centers will have to come from Turkey or Italy/Tunisia.

What this means is simple to say, but difficult to practice: Austria will have to develop some degree of naval power to claim a solo victory. The problem is twofold. For one, Austria has only one port, Trieste, which is often garrisoned against Italian attack and thus infrequently available for building. Furthermore, Trieste is extremely insulated from the sea; while this does make it easier to defend from western incursions, it also makes Austria's already-crippled naval development even more logistically difficult. Austria's fleet builds are as distant from any centers west of Venice as Turkey's are. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Turkey and Italy are just as dependent on control of the Mediterranean. They have more ports with which to raise a navy, as well. The only way Austria can outclass them in naval development is if they choose to devote most of their resources to a land campaign... but Austria is the most immediate target for either power seeking a land campaign.

All this goes to say that Austria's stagnation often comes later in the game and must be prepared for in advance. The most feasible winning centers are Vienna, Budapest, Trieste, Serbia, Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, Warsaw, Moscow, Sevastopol, Constantinople, Venice, Rome, Naples, Tunisia, Berlin, and Munich, for 17; the eighteenth center will have to come from one of Kiel, St. Petersburg, Ankara, or Smyrna, and sometimes Western intervention will make Germany an impossibility, requiring Austria to look to Marseilles.

==Strategy==

Austria's biggest threat is of course the real possibility of being eliminated as early as 1902-1903. The top priority for Austria should be maintaining sovereignty over its home centers and acquiring two or three other supply centers. Austria is rich in options, with eight centers lying within reach in 1901, but a wise Archduke will not allow himself to be tantalized by explosive growth prospects and ignore his security for expansion's sake.

In essentially all cases, Austria should seek a nonaggression pact with Germany, demilitarizing Bohemia and Tyrolia in the process. Neither has anything to gain from early war between the two. If we think of Germany and Austria as the corridors through which the other powers expand -- as they are -- then one of them killing the other only expands them into the whole of the corridor; in short, the initial problem the victor had (being in the middle of everything) is not only not solved but made '''worse''' by victory. By the same logic, Austria should avoid early war with Italy. Italy is an odd case; to the Austrian player it is a corridor, because the western side of Italy is very vulnerable to a strong French attack (which will be invited, mind, by Italy doing poorly in a war against Austria), and so the logic against fighting Germany early stands for Italy as well. But Italy's position against Austria is much different, as if peace with France can be maintained then Italy is a fortress, difficult to attack from the Austrian side (Pie S Ven cuts off all land attacks from the east) and yet so easy from which to attack Austria if the opening presents itself. Thus, Austria can't make the same mutual appeal to Italy that it can make to Germany, and yet cannot resort to war because that only extends the corridor. Negotiating a mutual peace is in Austria's best interests, but it may be difficult to do.

This still leaves the other two neighbors, Russia and Turkey. Obviously stirring them up to a fight is best, and while neither alliance is particularly great for Austria, either is certainly preferable to none at all! Austria should on balance prefer an alliance with Russia to an alliance with Turkey, but it is highly recommended that Austria delay the decision to help either as long as possible and, in all circumstances, to ensure that Italy will stay with Austria over Turkey or Russia. Italy is the main problem for Austria here as well. Strictly in terms of the RAT triangle, Austria should prefer allying with Russia, as Austria has better opportunities for later growth, is less prone to being stabbed by Russia than by Turkey, and has better leverage with which to stab Russia than Turkey. But if Italy is actively involved in the destruction of Turkey with the RA alliance, Austria is in grave danger of Russia and Italy allying to destroy Austria next. The ideal blueprint for Austrian domination of the east is to play both sides of the Russia-Turkey conflict, getting them into a scrap over Rumania while Austria gets into position for a powerful sweep east. When the time comes, Austria should take Bulgaria first to ensure Turkey is no longer a threat; then Austria should immediately seize Rumania and Warsaw from Russia. If Russia is also in trouble in Scandinavia, the Russian position will totally collapse. Turkey will still live with its three home centers, but Austria can pick up the remnants of Russia and leave Turkey quarantined until rearguard units can take out the trash. If all of this can be accomplished, then Italy will be wanted in the East, running a Lepanto to harass Turkey and perhaps even assist in crushing Russia (after all, Syr -&gt; Arm -&gt; Sev isn't such a bad idea!).

The note on Scandinavia leads to the final chapter in dealing with the other powers: the West. Austria, like the rest of the East, wants the West to be in turmoil and unresolved. Given the earlier notes about a lack of seapower, it quickly becomes evident that a French triumph in the West is to Austria's detriment; this will open up St. Petersburg to Austria, but at the cost of Tunisia and Italy the tradeoff is certainly undesirable. Yet to see a strong Anglo-German alliance develop does not help Austria either, as France dying quickly most likely leads to Germany breaking the nonaggression pact first -- a most inconvenient turn of events. England is Austria's best match in the West, and perhaps the most ideal setup is an Anglo-German alliance to start. This alliance will force France on the defensive in the north, either giving Italy an opportunity to grab Iberia and Marseilles (and thus be distracted from the East long enough for Austria to ready its defenses) or the chance to Lepanto in peace (also very desirable, as noted above). This alliance will also cause the Russian position in Scandinavia to collapse. A well-timed EG incursion into Scandinavia can be the setup for forcing the total collapse of Russia that Austria needs in order to fill the power vacuum. But that '''must''' be the extent of the EG. England must be induced to stab Germany (or, more rarely, vice versa) before England turns to Moscow and Germany to the neutral zone. This event will pull Germany west, away from Austria's land and even away from the vital centers to an Austrian win, Berlin and Munich. By this point we have moved far beyond opening strategy, but a logical continuation from here would be to help England against Germany, grabbing Berlin and Munich and setting up defenses in the process; then, if Turkey has not been finished off, killing Turkey; and, finally, attacking Italy for the win.

Austria's choice of openings can be categorized in three main groups: the Balkan Gambit, which sends the army in Budapest and the fleet in Trieste south to secure Serbia and Greece, respectively, while the army in Vienna remains in the Austrian homeland for defense; the Hedgehog, which usually sends the army in Budapest after a Balkan build while keeping the fleet in Trieste and the army in Vienna within Austrian borders for defense; and miscellaneous openings, which cover attacks on Germany and Italy as well as specific opening systems.

===The Balkan Gambit===

The main feature of the Balkan Gambit is F Tri -&gt; Alb. A Bud -&gt; Ser is a critical part of the plan as well, but is such a common opening move that it betrays nothing. The Gambit is just that: It puts a lot of faith in Italy's goodwill in order to attain a dominant position on the Balkans. If the Archduke feels he can trust Italy, then the Balkan Gambit puts him in a powerful position after 1901, with a supported attack on Bulgaria or a move to Aegean Sea possible in S1902 as well as ensuring him two builds. If he guesses wrong and Italy attacks, however, the result is usually calamitous: at best, Austria can repel Italy using the whole of its military, but this only delays the inevitable partition of Austria by Turkey and Russia; at worst, Italy can conquer the whole of the Austrian mainland unassisted by 1902, and Austria finds itself eliminated by 1903. The different variations are named for the destination of the army in Vienna.

====Pure Balkan Gambit (A Vie H)====

The original Balkan Gambit had Vienna hold. This move was popular in the very beginnings of Diplomacy, as it was meant to be a sign of trust in Italy and Russia (as opposed to the Tyrolean, Trieste, or Galician variations), but it has fallen out of favor because it is far too passive if Italy or Russia are actual threats.

====Trieste Variation (A Vie -&gt; Tri)====

Once the Pure Balkan Gambit fell out of favor, Austrians began to use their Vienna armies actively on defense. The rationale favoring the Trieste Variation made sense on the surface. The most dangerous of the various potential attacks on an Austria running the Gambit in S01 is the Italian move Rome -&gt; Venice, Venice -&gt; Trieste. Support holding Trieste allows Italy either to keep Trieste or retreat to Budapest (if Ser/Alb/Vie dislodge Tri, Bud is open); some Austrias play less defensively, some Italians play more aggressively, and the results can be disastrous, with Austria facing the loss of two home centers in the first year and a 3-build Italy in W01. So, by moving to Trieste, the Austrians shut down this threat. Initially it worked, but Italian players wised up and began ordering what is now known as the Obrieni Attack (Rome -&gt; Venice, Venice -&gt; Tyrolia); this move proves very inconvenient for the Trieste Variation, as now Austria *must* move Tri -&gt; Vie (to cover that potential threat) and Alb -&gt; Tri (Ser S) to cover against any Italian intrusions. Obviously, any interference from Russia or Turkey -- who have a lot to gain from carving up Austria -- proves fatal, and this variant too has fallen out of favor, though many an Austrian, convinced they have a DMZ with Russia in Galicia, order it anyway.

====Tyrolean Variation (A Vie -&gt; Tyl)====

The Tyrolean Variation was the Austrian response to the Obrieni Attack. Most Italian players, after some experimentation with the Obrieni Attack, found it to be the superior choice of opening regardless of Austrian intentions with the army in Vienna. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Austrian Attack (Ven -&gt; Tri, Rom -&gt; Ven) and the fact that, at the time, the most popular move for Vienna was to Trieste, the Austrian Attack had greater prospects for screwing Italy over if Austria sniffed it out. It also has the advantage of not being 100% anti-Austrian: a trend later developed that saw Italy hold the army in Venice, while the army in Tyrolia went to Munich with support from a French army in Burgundy. Some particularly bold Austrians took advantage of this new trend with the Tyrolean Variation. This is the defensive equivalent of the Austrian Attack: a high-risk, high-reward play. If Austria guessed right and Italy moved Rom -&gt; Ven -&gt; Tyl, Vienna stands in place for defense against a possible Russian attack from Galicia and also defeats the Italian attack utterly. But if Austria guesses wrong, allowing Russia into Galicia while Italy, say, attacks France or runs a Lepanto, he is suddenly in the embarrassing position of appearing hostile to Italy AND Germany, while still being forced to return to cover Vienna from Russia. And if Italy orders the Austrian Attack, Austria is cooked. This move never became overly popular, but if Austria is sure that Italy is opening to Tyrolia *and* is anti-Austrian, then it can be quite the stunning move.

====Bohemian Aberration (A Vie -&gt; Boh)====

The Bohemian Aberration is named so because the move to Bohemia is, predictably, unusual. Conventional wisdom suggests that an early Austrian-German war is disastrous for both sides, and this particular bit of conventional wisdom holds up. Thus, to even see aggression against Germany in the form of opening to Bohemia is aberrant. Furthermore, the purpose of the army in Vienna changes completely. Whereas in all other permutations of the Gambit the Viennese army is used on defense, the move to Bohemia would only defend against the inconceivably rare move A Mun -&gt; Boh. It is mainly used as a springboard for a joint attack on Germany, in most cases with Russia. Not advised; acquisition of Munich may well come at the cost of Trieste, and if Russia backstabs and orders A War -&gt; Gal instead of Sil (as, in this system, Russia is supposed to open), Austria is in a bind.

====Budapest Variation (A Vie -&gt; Bud)====

The Budapest Variation is also aberrant in its purpose. Moving Vienna east to start, instead of north to Galicia or south/west to Tyrolia or Trieste, provides nothing in terms of defensive advantages; if neighbors are hostile, then Austria wants to move to those soft spots, not elsewhere. Budapest is an offensive move, used to acquire Rumania with support most of the time and possibly as a springboard to joint Austro-Turkish cooperation in the Balkans and beyond. The flaw lies in that intention, though; Galicia is a far better spot to conduct anti-Russian ventures in, as it also threatens the home center Warsaw and soft spot Ukraine (which border three Russian home centers and one normally-Russian neutral center!). The argument is that one doesn't want to bounce in Galicia, because then the third army isn't arrayed properly against Rumania; but, if Russia is moving to Galicia, and Austria is anti-Russian, it makes no sense to allow Russia a potshot at two home centers. And any ability to defend against Italy is nonexistent.

====Galicia Variation (A Vie -&gt; Gal)====

The Galicia Variation is a logical extension of the logic behind the Balkan Gambit. If a player is going to move Trieste to Albania in the first place, he must have some kind of nonaggression or alliance arrangement with Italy in the first place. In that case, if Italy is lying, Austria is in trouble no matter what he plays, unless he gets preknowledge of Italy's attack and counters it right. At any rate, even defending against Italy only means a slightly slower death by Russia and Turkey. In short, if Italy attacks an Austria doing the Balkan Gambit, then regardless of how successful the defense against Italy is, Austria will die. Why not go all the way, then, and put total trust in Italy? If Austria is wrong, he is no worse off; he will die faster, but his death was inevitable, and in some eyes dragging out one's demise is not better than a quick exit anyhow. But if Austria is right, then he is suddenly in a very powerful position. If Austria can trust his Italian neighbor not to attack him straight away, then moving to Galicia is the best option: either a hostile Russia will be stood out of Galicia, or a passive Russia will have let Austria into Galicia. Then Austria has all kinds of options: an attack on Warsaw, supported moves to Rumania or Greece, or even a powerful position move into Ukraine (good luck sorting THAT out as the Russian player!) are all available, and even if by some crazy circumstance Austria faces hostilities on the border, it can STILL cover against an Italian attack (Gal -&gt; Vie, Ser S Alb -&gt; Tri -- no worse than the Trieste variation!) or the rare German excursion into Bohemia (Gal -&gt; Vie).

===Hedgehog Openings===

The Hedgehog is a more defensive approach to Austria. In the Hedgehog, Austria moves its fleet in Trieste to Venice. The important part to this series of openings is that the move to Venice is '''defensive''', not offensive: Austria doesn't intend to get into Venice, only to stall an Italian attack. The two most common anti-Austrian Italian openings both involve the move A Rom -&gt; Ven (A Ven going to Tyl or Tri as the case may be). The Hedgehog stops that move, stops A Ven -&gt; Tri, and thus hamstrings if not outright shuts down the Italian offensive. The tradeoff is that Austria loses significant influence on Greece, being at best able to send a single unit at it if anything at all.

(N.B. - There exists a similar thread of openings to the Hedgehog known as the &quot;Roadhog&quot; series of openings. The purpose and function of this thread is the same as the Hedgehog thread; the only difference is that the Roadhog has the fleet in Trieste stand, presumably so as not to offend Italy. This thread will not be covered separately because it is essentially a more passive version of the Hedgehog and all of its permutations.)

====Pure Hedgehog: A Vie -&gt; Gal, A Bud -&gt; Rum====

The &quot;pure&quot; Hedgehog sends the majority of the land forces Austria has after Russia, with the intention of standing Russia out of Rumania and Galicia. On the plus side, this can hamper the Russian advance significantly, especially with Turkish assistance; it is one of the better openings for dealing with Russia in an Austro-Turkish alliance, as it puts tremendous pressure on Russia (especially when coupled with Turkish F Ank -&gt; BLA, A Smy -&gt; Arm) while still not sacrificing defense against Italy. However, it is very weak to a Turkey with anti-Austrian intentions, as it can very easily lead to no builds in 1901.

====Alpine Hedgehog: A Vie -&gt; Tyl, A Bud -&gt; Gal====

Much like the &quot;pure&quot; Hedgehog, the Alpine variation sacrifices the guaranteed build in Serbia for the purpose of stopping a hostile opponent completely in its tracks. However, unlike the original, the opponent is Italy, not Russia; and, more importantly, it is guaranteed to stop a hostile opponent in its tracks (whereas Russia with a neutral Turkey can usually handle the pure Hedgehog). Used when Italy seems hostile and Turkish friendship can once again be assured, as the build in Serbia is once again not guaranteed.

====Porcupine: A Vie -&gt; Gal, A Bud S A Vie -&gt; Gal====

The Porcupine, despite the misnomer, is in fact a Hedgehog variant. By forcing Galicia, Austria hopes to try for both Rumania and Serbia (both unsupported) while protecting Galicia from Russian attack. It sacrifices the guaranteed build in Serbia for a shot at two builds while securing the Austrian borders from Russian and Italian attack. The &quot;Dead Porcupine&quot; aberration (aptly named) sends Budapest to Galicia with Vienna support, leaving Austria with basically no chance at a build.

====Southern Hedgehog: A Vie -&gt; Gal, A Bud -&gt; Ser====

The Southern Hedgehog sends the Budapest army south to pick up Serbia instead of east to hit Russia. This opening doesn't put nearly as much pressure on Russia as the move to Rumania does, but it does secure a build against everything but the absurdly rare German incursion into Bohemia. This opening is the quintessential Hedgehog opening; it is the least committal, with enough defensive moves to protect itself from all realistic threats without agitating any neighbors who weren't already committed to attacking Austria in the first place, and it ensures a build to use against whichever neighbor has given Austria most reason for mistrust.

===Miscellaneous Openings===

====Blue Water Opening: F Tri -&gt; ADR====

Austria very rarely sets out to conquer the seas in the early going of a round of Diplomacy; virtually all of its objectives are land-based, as are its potential threats, and while it is true that Austria is more or less required to raise a functioning navy of at least 2-3 fleets to conquer Italy and Turkey and win, such expenditures are rarely affordable early and even more rarely advisable. Nevertheless, in the right diplomatic framework, an opening to the Adriatic Sea can be useful. This most often signals an attack on Italy, especially if done in the &quot;Von Metzke Blitz&quot; opening (named after Conrad von Metzke, an older Diplomacy player reputed for attacking Italy from the start as Austria) which sends Budapest to Trieste and Vienna to Tyrolia. These openings are rarely advised because they either divide Austria's front and make the defense of Austria's gains very difficult or they pull Austria away from the Balkans entirely, sacrificing great gains and putting Austria in peril on the eastern front for relatively sparse gains in Italy.

The most notable exception to the above paragraph is the Blue Water Lepanto, where Austria opens seemingly anti-Italian but actually inserts its fleet into Italy's convoy line. The result of this is to free up Italy's second fleet build for use against France; combined with the army most Italian players leave behind when running the Lepanto and any support from England or Germany, Italy can be a force in the west.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Germany/Second Reich/Kaiserreich (German)==

Leader at 1901: Kaiser Wilhelm II

Color: Black

Neighbors: France, England, Russia, Austria

Home supply centers: Berlin, Munich, Kiel

The Germans can often do well in the first year, and can also hinder others; notably Russia in Sweden and France in Holland/Belgium. However, when playing Germany it is vital that you have good relations with England and/or France, as their target is naturally Germany. Playing with Germany can be a challenge as a result of its central position, but its advantage is the great many options that are available to it.

Germany can guarantee the supply centres Denmark and Holland in the first year, and has roughly an equal claim on Belguim together with England and France. Germany could take part in two major alliances in the beginning: Ally with England into France, or ally with Russia, Turkey, and Italy into Austria. France is going to be a large enemy, because Germany is the best way for France to break through. Going through the Mediterranean with West Mediterranean, Gulf of Lyon, and Piedmont is too slow. Keep in mind, most players who win own Munich, since it is the gateway to Western Europe and/or Eastern Europe.

==18 Center Goal==
Germany is an extremely flexible country--even more so than France.  Switzerland is all that stands between Germany and amazing geographical domination, and a massive central-European powderkeg, similar to the battle for the Balkans in Eastern Europe.  Germany can deploy units in all directions and rush to conquer the final center required for victory.  The ability to build in Munich is key to German flexibility, allowing Germany to throw armies across the stalemate line to conquer VIE or VEN to win.

Germany needs its three home centers, plus the Low Countries (2), Scandinavia (3), England (3), PAR and BRE from France, STP, WAR, and MOS from Russia for 16.  Then Germany needs two of MAR, SPA, POR, VIE, VEN, and SEV to win.  MAR, SPA, and POR are usually the easiest, but require a strong naval presence.  Otherwise, Germany can push troops across the stalemate line to grab the final few centers.

==Opening Strategy==

Germany has almost as much flexibility as France, but is not in as safe a position.  Germany is guaranteed Denmark and nearly guaranteed Holland, and usually has a finger in the debate over Belgium.

Germany's main choice is where to put his fleet--moving the fleet to Denmark provides leverage against Russia, but moving the fleet to Holland gives a better shot at three builds.

===A MUN - RUH, A BER - KIE: Blitzkrieg Openings===
Diplomatically neutral, this is the most popular German opening, gives him a shot at three builds, and focuses on the main point of contention for the West in 1901--the Low Countries.

====F KIE - DEN: Danish Variation====
Recommended opening to every German player, since Denmark is always guaranteed for Germany (lest Fleet Kiel should slack off and do not move, allowing a English Fleet North Sea able to take over). This also opens the way to Scandinavia for Germany, whom it will have to fight with England and Russia to conquer it.

====F KIE - HOL: Dutch Variation====
Those who think that Denmark can still be captured later prefer this move - it guarantees Holland. Of course, keep in mind that Scandinavia can be taken very quickly.

===A MUN - BUR===
Most of these are arranged standoffs with France over BUR--it is difficult for Germany to mount an effective attack on France in 1901 because he does not have enough units bordering French territory.  All of France's centers can be covered if Germany manages to slip the army in, and the German army is better positioned in RUH to take BEL and HOL.

===A MUN - BUR, F KIE - HOL, A BER - KIE===
This move requires the alliance of Russia and Austria-Hungary. With this move you have a possibility of 3 gained supply centers by spring 1902. This move is very anti-France and should (with the help of England) be able to take down France fairly quickly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Italy/Italia (Italian)==
Leader at 1901: Prime Minister Giuseppe Saracco (to February 15) and Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli

Color: Green

Neighbors: France, Germany, Austria, and Turkey

Home supply centers: Rome, Venice, Naples



Italy is often considered as one of the weaker countries because it has minimal access to neutral supply centers; it can only reach Serbia, Greece, and Tunisia in the first year, it must choose between the latter two, and the first one is not only Austria's only guaranteed center but it also requires Austria to give that center up. Italy cannot get off to a rapid start without attacking its neighbors in 1901. Fortunately for Italy, it can often be the catalyst of a massive invasion of any one of those neighbors, and in the short term often profits from three such invasions (Germany being the only one in which Italy is likely to get the short end of the stick right off the bat.) Italy's second problem, though, is that in the long term it often gets picked off after catalyzing the invasions, because it never manages to consolidate its position diplomatically, tactically and strategically, and its former friends decide to continue expansion without it.

The primary challenge to Italian supremacy, then, is the difficulty involved in making allies for the long term; it takes a player of sound tactical skill, honed persuasive abilities, and keen strategic vision to excel as Italy, even moreso than the other powers. Most Diplomacy players fail to conduct the nuanced diplomacy needed to secure allies for the long term, or fail to see the strategic picture correctly, or otherwise flop in tactics during the opening round of invasions and fail to make any substantial progress in the first place, and so Italy has developed a reputation for weakness. For a player with all of the talents needed to excel, however, the Italian position is one of the best in the game: extremely easy to defend by land, available oceans for the kind of naval supremacy any winning power (not named Austria) must develop, home centers placed near several stalemate lines for quick reinforcement (on defense) or sudden breaches (on offense), and several small knots of easily-defended centers which can be seized in the initial strike and converted to a strong power base through the middle and end games (southern Balkans, Turkey, Iberia). The trick is to get the alliances needed to seize one or more of these knots in the beginning and then maintain the alliances needed to secure them until Italy is ready for a winning push.

Italy can open against any four of its neighbors, though which neighbors can be targeted first can also be narrowed down without much trouble. Germany is highly impractical as the only efficient means of accessing the country is through its home center in Munich; ignoring Munich, it takes the Italian armies two years to get in position to take Berlin, and Munich is nearly impossible to hold from the south, let alone converted to a strong base of operations. The remaining three neighbors are more reasonable options for the initial strike: Austria can be hit through the Tyrolean corridor or surprised with convoys into the southern Balkan region, Turkey can be hit with a Lepanto opening, and Italy can often profit from an Anglo-German-spearheaded assault on France.

==18 Center Goal==
Italy has one of the most diverse sets of winning centers. The only truly sure things for Italy are that it will hold Venice, Rome, Naples, and Tunisia in any winning line. The most common winning set contains Italy, Austria, Tunisia, Iberia, Marseilles, Balkans, Turkey, and Sevastopol for a winning 18.

The realm of reasonable expansion for Italy likely extends to England in the north; most excursions to the British Isles occur as isolated lone-raider fleets swiping Liverpool coming out of the Middle Atlantic Ocean, though in a lasting alliance with Austria which sees Italy KOing France first, Italy could reasonably secure the whole island as part of a campaign through France and England into Germany or even Scandinavia. In the east, Italy can reach as deep into Russian lands as Warsaw and Moscow, though St. Petersburg is fairly unlikely (unless a raider fleet managed to sneak through into the Atlantic to Barents Sea). That one can even discuss the possibility of Italy capturing St. Petersburg by moving armies into Moscow and fleets into Barents Sea illustrates the point: Italy has a reasonable (though unlikely) shot at ANY center on the board, a feat shared by no other power sans Russia and perhaps Germany.

There are a few sets of 18 which make the most logical sense, however, depending on Italy's focus in the game.
Western: Italy, Tunisia, England, France, Iberia, Lowlands, Munich, Norway, Denmark, Kiel
Southern: Italy, Tunisia, Austria, Balkans, Turkey, Sevastopol, Marseilles, Iberia
Eastern: Italy, Tunisia, Austria, Balkans, Turkey, Russia (or Russia-minus-St. Petersburg + Munich, Berlin, Marseilles, or Spain)
Austrian: Italy, Tunisia, Greece, Turkey, Iberia, France, England, Belgium, Trieste

Western series indicates an Italian in a game-long alliance with Austria wherein Italy starts by opening against France, and continues focusing on the west to achieve victory. Eastern series indicates an Italian in a game-long alliance with France wherein Italy focuses its entire efforts in the east, only grabbing a western center for #18. Southern series is probably the most common and indicates a balanced Italian approach, where the western trio of Marseilles+Iberia is most likely claimed during a middle game push before France can turn into the Mediterranean. The Austrian series indicates a near-game-long alliance with Austria which started with a Lepanto; Greece is probably taken by stab, Trieste definitely by stab, both coming near the end as Italy pushes for a solo after securing the limits of reasonable western expansion without Austrian help.

In short, Italy's 18 center goal is incredibly diverse and allows for quite a bit of flexibility in picking a target. This flexibility is a counterbalance to its lack of neutral centers, and must be exploited to the fullest if Italy has a serious hope of winning.

==Opening Strategy==

As mentioned before, Italy needs to focus on diplomacy above all other powers. The first step is to see where the winds are blowing regarding France, Austria, and Turkey; it's incredibly unlikely that all three of these powers are going to avoid being targeted first, and so Italy can figure out which one is most liable to being attacked and join in. All the while, care should be taken to avoid being the next one on anyone's list, and so Italy needs to foster strong relations with all the other powers to keep things mixed up across the board. Italy wants to see England and Germany attack France first, without a doubt, so that Italy can turn east and seek its opening centers elsewhere (if opportunity beckons) or seek them from France in a three-power pileup. In the east, Italy needs to foster an airtight alliance with Russia and steer the east toward a three-way invasion of Austria or Turkey; this will inevitably leave a survivor between Russia and Italy, perfect for the next partition. If Italy is looking west first, then Italy should want to see a Russia-Austria alliance against Turkey, because Austria-Turkey is disastrous for Italy, and because Russia-Turkey will lead to Turkey outracing Italy in the contest to build a navy and either Russia excelling too much (by way of a good stab) or almost certainly elimination by Turkey.

Italy's fleet usually heads to ION, so his main choice is where to put the army in VEN.  It can head north--to TYR, either to grab MUN from Germany or to attack Austria, hold its position, or head west towards France.

===A VEN - TYR: Tyrolian Opening===
Opening to Tyrolia usually means an early Italian attack on Austria, a popular and strong strategy.

====A ROM - VEN: The Obriani Attack====
The most popular opening for Italy, this opening gives Italy a great shot at two builds, TUN and an Austrian center or MUN.  Although the attack on Austria is quick and often deadly, an Italian attack on Germany through MUN has become more popular, with the northern army bothering the Western Triple, conquering a center every now and then, until Italy can muster enough troops to turn west in force.

====A ROM - APU: The Tyrolian Lepanto====
The opening advocated by Leif Bergman in his article on Italy, [http://www.diplom.org/Zine/F1997M/Bergman/Italy.html Go Fasta Go Fasta], it is extremely powerful and duplicitous.  It requires incredibly strong diplomatic skill to pull off, but if the opening works, Italy can take TUN or convince Turkey to help him into GRE, and grab TRI, VIE, or MUN with his army in TYR.

===A VEN - PIE: Alpine Openings===
The attack on France is generally quite weak--even if Italy manages to grab MAR in 1901, he is unlikely to keep it.  France and Italy are natural allies, as they extend their territorial reach towards Russia.

====A ROM - APU: The Alpine Lepanto====
A hopeful opening--if Italy can enlist German and English support, the attack can dismantle France very quickly.  This is a big if, and is usually used only as part of the [[Diplomacy/Alliances|Triple Alliance]].

====A ROM - VEN: The Alpine Chicken====
Named because it often indicates an Italian desire to attack Austria without showing his hand immediately by stepping into TYR, the move is often followed by A VEN - TRI, A PIE - TYR, giving Italy a position against Austria.

===A VEN H or A VEN - TRI and A ROM - APU: The Lepanto===
One of the most popular opening strategies for Italy is alliance with Austria. The border region of TYR-TRI-VEN is kept clear - usually by a constant bounce between TRI and VEN.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Russia/Russian Empire/Российская Империя (Russian)==

Leader at 1901: Tzar Nicholas II

Color: Purple (White in American edition)

Neighbors: Germany, Austria, Turkey

Home supply centers: Moscow, Warsaw, St. Petersburg, Sevastopol. (Fleet at St. Petersburg starts the game on the South Coast)


At first glance, Russia may seem to be the strongest power, as she begins the game with four units, compared to the three allotted to every other power. However, Russia has the largest territory to defend, and can find herself in a very vulnerable position. She must fight either England/Germany for control of Scandinavia or Turkey/Austria for control of the Balkans. If attacked by Germany through Moscow early on, Russia may encounter a three-front war and find it difficult to prevail. Thus, Russia must rely on her diplomacy, and hope that her neighbors do not ally against her. Fortunately for Russia, well-coordinated attacks by multiple alliances are rarely successfully staged against one power early on. Not until that power's growth rate is too large and becomes a clear threat to all the others will they ally, and by then it may be too late.

== 18 Center Goal ==
4 home supply centers, Scandinavia (Norway, Denmark, Sweden), Turkey (Constantinople, Ankara, Smyrna), Austria (Budapest, Vienna, Trieste), the Balkans (Serbia, Bulgaria, Rumania,Greece) makes it 17. The remaining one most likely would be Venice, Tunis, or Munich.

== Opening Strategy ==

Russia has the largest and most robust choice of openings out of any power on the board. She can attack England, by moving A Moscow to St. Petersburg, challenging Norway, attack Germany through Silesia, attack Austria through Galicia, or attack Turkey through the Black Sea, all on the first turn! Russia's opening position, however, is almost as vulnerable as Austria, and The Bear can be forcibly brought down by her neighbors if she is not careful, or strong enough to defend.

=== A MOS - STP: The Northern System ===
The Northern Opening flexes Russia's diplomatic muscle--now relations with England, France, and Germany become equally important as the relations with the Eastern powers.

==== A WAR - GAL: The Octopus ====
Named because Russia stretches all of its units out in all directions, threatening Austria, Turkey, England, and Germany. It provides maximum flexibility, as well as a shot at multiple builds. Russia can sometimes even convince England to give up NWY by opening to STP. Richard Sharp considers this Russia's strongest opening. Also known as the Austrian Attack

==== A WAR - UKR: The Squid ====
Extremely pro-Austrian, this opening is named because a squid is like an octopus, but with two weak legs. The opening gives Russia more say over RUM, but at the cost of losing some traction with Austria, who can make a grab for RUM or WAR in the fall if he moves to GAL.

==== F SEV - RUM: The Jellyfish ====
A weaker version of the Squid takes RUM as quickly as possible, and is terribly pro-Turkish to the point of groveling. A shrewd Turkey will take this opportunity to attack Russia, possibly with Austrian help.

=== A MOS - UKR: Southern Systems ===

More popular than the Northern System by a fair margin, the southern system is safe, though not likely to inspire fear in England or Germany, and almost guarantees a build in RUM.

==== F SEV - RUM: The Austrian Defense ====

==== A WAR - SIL: The German Attack ====

=== A MOS - SEV: Sevastopol Openings ===
;Fleet Sevastopol to Black Sea
Although the Black Sea may seem unimportant because it is so small, it borders five supply centers, one of which is a Russian home supply center, and two of which are Turkey's. Of course, should Fleet Ankara make a surprise move to Armenia, you will have to move Fleet Sevastopol back, unless you want Ankara.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The niche for modern man ==
The Neanderthal man was not a threat to the survival of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, rather the contrary. The niche for Homo Sapiens Sapiens (and the species itself) existed well before the extinction of Homo Neanderthalis. The proliferation of the latter was the likely cause of the extinction of the former.

== &quot;previous Universe&quot;?? ==

There is no time trans-universe. I should think the theme would imply that at least some attention was paid to the developments in physics over the last ten years.


and still no mention of the AP.

== Evolution does not have a goal to reach Homo Sapiens ==

Evolution does not happen by placing a goal ahead of it. It is a random process. Homo erectus does not have the goal to evolve into Homo sapiens.
It evolved in Homo neanderthalensis Homo floresiensis and Homo sapiens. Survival of only one branch is not proof of God.

Evolution has not stopped. We are still evolving as every living organism is.

BTW, we have named ourselves Homo sapiens that means wise men. If some much more intelligent being has to name us, he may name us Homo Stupidus.</text>

Revisions by Marc Hunt

* Add the banner to the top of the page with the objectives listed 
* In the examples of implementing a one-to-many, use the example from later in the chapter with cities and hotels
* Add more data about the inter-document relationship
* Place the empty element tag within the schema data types section, or create another section for it
* Place the first and third paragraphs located after the implementation techniques in the introduction section
* Create a section header for the schema section including data types, patterns, regex, and the example
* Move the Regex section up before the schema example to go with the discussion of patterns
* Fix the examples so that the text stays within the box and doesn't scroll across the screen
* Title the document and stylesheet sections


'''Revisions by editorial board - Moussa'''

After looking at the chapter and the points that Marc mentioned, these are the one I would focus on:
* Should start like previous chapter with a short introduction then the model and use Tourguide example instead of player as Marc mentioned, this will help us stay consistent with the structure and content.
* XML Schema Data Types should go further down next to Empty Elements with Attributes in XML Documents.
* The introduction is empty, Marc has a good idea to get rid of the teams example, then we can keep the paragraphs and use them as the introduction.
* Should reorganize the contents: give more relevant sections and get rid of the “Common Errors in NetBeans”, it will go to the part dedicated to “XML Editor”.
* About the exercises, I noticed that they do include some advance stylesheet, we can put some easier exercises and transfer these to the Stylesheet chapter.
* &quot;Move the Regex section up before the schema example to go with the discussion of patterns&quot; (N/A Regex section will no longer be in this chapter).
* &quot;Fix the examples so that the text stays within the box and doesn't scroll across the screen&quot; (I think this one only depends on the size of your screen).
* &quot;Place the empty element tag within the schema data types section&quot; (I think this one would be better than creating a new section)

'''Revisions by editorial board - viji'''

* there are document examples for containment, intra-document, and inter-document representations for a 1:many relationship, but the schema only addresses the containment method; please include schemas for the intra-document and inter-document methods (feel free to ask Dr. Watson for resources or advice)

thank you


[[user:Rick|rtw]] 01:30, 2 Feb 2006 (UTC)

The preceding plan and suggested changes make sense. Go ahead Marc.

== post-revision comments ==

'''viji'''
* Good work on including the intra and inter document schema examples.
* Please cut the Exercises stuff and paste into a separate examples page.

nice job

== Final comments - Moussa ==
Overall good job. Just need to add link to exercises and answers.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The way the inborn gifts manifest is specified by the culture ==
The different forms of above-average intelligence (or genius) appear in all reasonably rich human populations. Nevertheless, it is likely that specific forms of intelligence are selected for in specific cultures. But it is on cultural level that we differentiate between technically progressing civilisations and steady-state civilisations, the frequency of geniuses is a biased measure and not a cause of progress.

== There are no superior or inferior races ==

To say that God has created some people differently is racism. [[User:63.199.37.10|63.199.37.10]] 20:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)Assuming there is a god[[User:63.199.37.10|63.199.37.10]] 20:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
Did God deliberately make some people less intelligent? 

If we have to believe your opinions, Christians are the best creation of God and Australian aborigines are one of the least ones, others falling some where in between.
In addition, God does not want people to worship golden calf.

So what He wants us to worship? Let me guess, Jesus Christ!
Otherwise, he will make us less intelligent.

God’s rule is simple worship Jesus Christ; become more intelligent, worship others; become less intelligent and less developed, poor … !!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== AIDS is not a cure ==
The AIDS pandemy will hopefully be tammed and the disease cured with progress of medicine. The pandemies are not specific to our times. It is disputable whether (and unlikely that) sexually transferred diseases are protagonists in development of morality and mental health. The birthrate in developed countries is low, so the overpopulation fatum is not strictly linked with progress.

=================

What about a child who got infected by AIDS from his/her mother. Did God punish that child for no sin and no immorality?
What kind of God will devise such method to make us progress!!
How is it a progress??</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Emperor (a six player format), two players are the emperors, and the remaining four players are the guards (two for each emperor). Players can only attack, target, and affect the players sitting immediately next to them. If an emperor dies, his or her team loses.

The main strategy for the emperor player is to use cards that give everybody bonuses (card draws, mana production, creature power, life gain, etc.) This enables the emperor's guards to play larger threats more quickly and ultimately should cause the opponents to lose due to being overwhelmed by powerful threats and answers.

Some Emperor formats ban alternate win cards (Barren Glory, Mortal Combat, etc.) to prevent abuse of the amount of time it would take to get past the emperor's guards and stop that condition from happening. Generally by suspending a Greater Gargadon with Barren Glory to sacrifice all of his other permanents or use Cephalid Illusionist and Shuko to empty one's deck into their graveyard with Mortal Combat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome to Wikibooks==

Thank you for contributing to Wikibooks.  We value new cotributions to this project.

I would like to ask you to get to know some of the general policies that we have here on Wikibooks:

*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]
*[[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]

I noticed a new Wikibook that you are starting called [[Where There Is No Dentist]].  This is an awsome project, but unfortunately this is not something we encourage here on Wikibooks.  Things of this nature are more appropriate on our sister project called [[wikisource:|Wikisource]].  I would strongly recommend that you try to drop a message at the [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium|Wikisource Scriptorium]] first and ask them for some guidance for how to proceed, although I don't see any reason to stop this effort in general.  You may want to post the original English content as well, making sure that you have copyright permission from the original author.

Make sure that all content that you add here can be added through the Gnu Free Document License or a compatable content license.  Since this is a relatively new book, we generally presume that copyright permission was not granted unless explicit permission from the author is somehow noted with some way to verify the copyright permission, including from any publisher of the book as well.

Like I said, this is a very noble project you are working on, and I would like to encourage you to continue that project.  Just keep in mind that we are aiming here to produce English language textbooks here and this is not just an open web server to put whatever content you would like to add.  Still, we want to encourage new contributors to Wikibooks and I hope I havn't discouraged you from making any progress.

If you have any questions, you can add a note at the bottom of [[User talk:Robert Horning|my user talk page]] or you can even write a [[Special:Emailuser/Robert Horning|private e-mail message]] to me asking for further assistance.  I want to see that you can proceed with your translation project in the best possible place, and not get accidently deleted because of a misunderstanding of what it is all about.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:59, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

== About the translation project ==

Out of curiosity, would it not be easier to first translate it into French and then retranslate from French? You might be able to tap into a larger pool of translators, no? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:for}} is a Java keyword.

It starts a looping block.

The general syntax of a {{java:for}}, using {{Java:EBNF}}, is

 for-looping-statement ::= {{java:for}} ''condition-clause'' 
                                     ''single-statement'' | ''block-statement''
  
 condition-clause    ::= '''&lt;code&gt;( before-statement; &lt;/code&gt;''' Boolean Expression '''&lt;code&gt;; after-statement )&lt;/code&gt;'''
 single-statement    ::= [[Java Programming/Statement|Statement]]
 block-statement     ::= '''&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;''' [[Java Programming/Statement|Statement]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Java Programming/Statement|Statement]] &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;'''

For example:
{{java|code=for ( int i=0; i &lt; maxLoopIter; i++ ) {
    System.println(&quot;Iter: &quot; +i);
}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:int}} is a [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] which designates the 32 bit signed integer [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]].

The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/code&gt; class is the nominal wrapper class when you need to store an {{Java:int}} value but an object reference is required.

Syntax:
 {{java:int}} &lt;variable-name&gt; = &lt;integer-value&gt;;

For example:
{{java|code=int i = 65;}}

This was very good, I think I can grasp the concept of God &quot;Speaking to us through the computer&quot; It makes sense, and you're very straight forward, blunt. So many people would be offended and probably assume you were the Anti-christ, possessed, or mislead, and you probably know that, but you stuck with it anyway.

'''Editorial Board Revisions - viji'''


* show the tree structure diagram on this page, not as a link - instructions can be found in the wikibook help page

* allow the summary section to also be a reference section

* remember to remove the exercise section to another page linked from the bottom of this page (+ a link to answers on both those pages) (see single - entity chapter)

* This is a well laid out chapter - you are right it just needs more clarification and explanation

thanks

==Professor==
The proposed plan is fine and the comments appropriate.

I would prefer to see the sample tree structure display an XML file rather than some HTML code.

== post revision comments ==

It looks good.  I don't remember what I meant by 
* allow the summary section to also be a reference section
but the summary sounds fine

== Inaccurate and one-sided ==
The article displays just *one* services implementation (and they differ on some networks a lot) and talks about client-side commands like &quot;/clear&quot; or &quot;/clearall&quot; as if they would be standardized IRC commands (which they are not) and available in every client (which they probably also aren't). I also think that it is wrong to call a command &quot;/join&quot; as the command itself is just &quot;JOIN&quot; and the slash indicates sending it directly to a server. Therefore, the commands should probably be listed without the slash and a small section above the command list should explain how to use them in most common clients (by putting / or sometimes /quote in front of it).

|Gold has no way to make progress with the h6 rabbit
}}The most straightforward strategy in Arimaa is to advance a rabbit and some strong pieces, attempting to rip a hole in the opponent's defenses through which the rabbit can score a goal.  If both players try to do this, the game turns into a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Race_Positions | race]].  Each player in a race must judge how many steps to spend delaying the opposing rabbit, and how many steps to use furthering their own rabbit.

Before long, however, the Arimaa community discovered that if one player tries to force goal in the opening while the other player defends, advantage accrues to the defender.  The board is too crowded for rabbits to make headway until some defenders have been captured, but the defender can easily protect his troops from capture while they are all still at home.  Meanwhile the attacking rabbit ''is'' vulnerable to capture in the defender's home traps.  In the diagram at right, the h6-rabbit is no threat to reach the goal, but the rabbit itself is in danger of capture in f6.  Furthermore, rabbits can't retreat, so the h6-rabbit can't save itself.  Finally, if the gold elephant advances to g6 to protect the h6-rabbit, the elephant will be [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade | blockaded]].

=== Capturing Is Impossible Too? ===

In light of the futility of forcing an early goal, top Arimaa players next turned to capturing pieces as the most plausible strategy.  Each player can easily defend his home traps, so the main offensive strategy was to drag an opposing piece to one's own home traps for capture.  (An elephant can safely go hunting for a piece to pull home, because elephants aren't vulnerable to capture.)  Unfortunately, this strategy also initially appears futile, because the opposing elephant can camp out by the trap in which the dragged piece has been threatened, and permanently make that trap safe.

|Silver has defended against an elephant with an elephant, and against a camel with a camel
}}
Since a defensive elephant can make any one trap safe forever, attackers resort to ''overloading'' the defending elephant by simultaneously threatening to capture two different pieces in two different traps.  Yet even this may lead to one more round of frustration.  If you make a capture threat with your elephant, the opposing elephant will block it, and if you make a second capture threat with your camel, the opposing camel will block it.  In the diagram at left, Gold is apparently stymied despite having generated a capture threat in each home trap.

Indeed, one might wonder why pieces of equal strength don't stalemate each other on down the line, resulting in a quagmire where neither side can ever make progress.  Some Arimaa players feared that the game was by nature too defensive for attacking play to ever pay off.

The strategic answer to this conundrum, namely taking a ''camel hostage'', was the first deep strategy ever discovered in Arimaa.  It gave humans their first advantage over computer programs in what had been, before then, a nearly equal contest.  Indeed, to this day the fact that neither player can afford to give up a camel hostage informs every opening strategy.  It makes the [[Arimaa/Lone_Elephant_Attacks | lone elephant attack]] ultimately effective, and discourages counter-attack when one launches an [[Arimaa/Elephant_and_Horse_Attacks | elephant-horse attack]].

Throughout the opening and midgame, a player who can't punish an opposing camel advance will likely be unable to make any progress whatsoever, because most trouble apart from a camel hostage can be relieved by the opposing elephant and/or camel.  Applying secondary strategies first, even successfully, will only lead to frustration when the opposing heavy pieces sail to the rescue.  Gaining a camel hostage, in contrast to subtler plans, not only gives one an advantage, it also makes the resulting position simpler and easier to play.  Therefore the camel hostage should be every beginner's first study after the basic tactics.

|The gold elephant is holding the silver camel hostage.
}}

In the position at right, the gold elephant is holding the silver camel hostage.  The camel is frozen, so it can't escape, and on any turn Gold could flip or pull it into the c3 trap.  To preserve the camel, Silver must station his elephant next to the c3 trap.  Silver can't defend with less than the elephant, because any other silver defender could itself be captured in c3, unless there were ''two'' silver defenders securely in place, which would be hard to maintain if the silver elephant were elsewhere.

Herein lies the answer to the defensive conundrum of equal forces stalemating each other.  Gold's elephant is tying up Silver's elephant and camel both, leaving Gold's camel unopposed as the strongest free piece.  As long as the camel hostage remains in place, Gold can dominate the other side of the board. The silver camel obviously can't defend f3, and at present the silver elephant can't defend f3 without losing the silver camel.

===Horses Advance===

Gold might be inclined to immediately advance the free camel, but advancing horses is much safer.  Imagine in this diagram that instead of the horse, the gold camel were on a6.  Silver to move could send his elephant to b6, setting the stage for an even camel trade, which would be a disappointing outcome for Gold. Since the camel captures would each use all four steps of a turn, neither elephant could come back and save its own camel. 

The gold horse on the west wing is actually not attacking so much as it is defending the c6 trap.  The hostage camel keeps Silver's elephant next to the c3 trap, but it can still dart around as long as it is on c4, d3, or even c2 at the end of a turn.  This mobility could allow the silver elephant to dislodge a small gold piece and gradually move it up.  If the silver elephant could get a weak gold piece into silver territory, and Gold had nothing there to protect it, that gold piece would soon be lost while the silver camel would remain safe.  The gold horses are prepared to defend the c6 and f6 traps, short-circuiting any such shenanigans by Silver. The gold horse in the west must keep some distance from the silver elephant, to avoid being frozen on c5 and then captured in two steps.

As long as the camel hostage is intact, Gold's best bet is to use his horse on the east wing to drag down one little piece at a time for capture in f3. This seemingly tedious strategy can ultimately decimate Silver's forces, if the silver camel and elephant both remain away from the action. Silver rabbits in the northeast are especially vulnerable, since Silver cannot hope to shield them all, and a rabbit cannot retreat backward. With the silver camel stuck in the west and the silver elephant committed to defending it, any available silver piece which tries to protect the f3 trap will itself be captured by the gold camel. On g3, the gold camel can deter silver horses from advancing, or capture them if they are reckless enough. The gold horses are the pieces which should operate away from home territory for the time being. Even if a smaller gold piece were to get pulled up, the gold horses could defend the c6 and f6 traps, and still deliver smaller silver pieces to the f3 trap. Depending on what Silver does, Gold may later want to advance his camel, but should keep f3 protected, and avoid offering Silver a camel trade.

Realizing that Gold is poised to take control, what should Silver do? Silver needs to free his elephant. It will be hard to save the camel, but in this case Silver can contain the damage. If Silver moves his elephant to b6, and the silver camel is then captured, Silver can pull the gold horse from a6 into c6, capturing it in return. Alternatively, if Silver still wanted to try to preserve his camel, he could unfreeze it with his horse and push the gold dog away, burrowing the camel so that it could not be captured in one turn&amp;mdash;this is an option only because Gold has neglected to put a piece on b2, which would have blockaded any a3 hostage in place. Even as things are, however, burrowing the camel would only be a delaying tactic by Silver, since the camel would hardly be free, and could still be captured if the silver elephant left.

===Active Defense===

|The silver elephant has regained mobility, so Gold has no advantage from holding a camel hostage 
}}

Whether or not one can get immediate compensation for a camel loss, it is crucial that one's elephant be freed from a hostage which gives the enemy the strongest free piece.  The best answer to a camel hostage is to rotate out one's elephant.  Two other pieces can defend the trap if they have support behind them.  In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=16609&amp;s=w this game], diagrammed at right, Gold is strategically lost because the arrival of the silver dogs has freed the silver elephant to roam, whereas the gold elephant must stay put to prevent an immediate goal.  Suddenly the tables have turned and Silver's elephant is the strongest free piece.

This is the last and most subtle reason for the gold camel to stay home on defense when Gold has the silver camel hostage.  Imagine that the gold camel were at home in the diagram at right, lurking on d2 for example. Once the silver elephant left the f3 trap, the gold camel could confront the new silver defenders. Silver would then have to scramble to prevent multiple captures.  
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|Gold must now attack Silver's home traps 
}}
The most active defense against a camel hostage is to bring up pieces either numerous enough or strong enough to contest both enemy traps.  In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=19732&amp;s=w this game], diagrammed at left, Gold can't make a capture in either c3 or f3, despite holding the silver camel hostage.  The gold camel would like to help regain control of c3, but the silver elephant is well-positioned in the way.

Who has the strongest free piece now?  The silver elephant is more free than the gold elephant, but it isn't totally free, because if it crosses back to the silver side of the board, the gold camel will smash across into the silver horses around c3.  Likewise, the gold camel isn't really a free piece, because it needs to lurk around in order to keep the silver elephant committed to defending c3.

As it turns out, the gold horses are suddenly the strongest free pieces. Gold can't yet force a capture at home, but he can use both horses to take over an enemy trap (most likely f6), threatening captures and ultimately goals. Silver might then move his elephant to the defense of that trap, and further threaten one or both of the gold horses with capture, but in that case Gold will stand to gain even more than that in c3 and f3. Gold's upper hand traces back to the camel hostage.  

These few positions are only scratching the surface of possible play when a camel is held hostage, but they should give an inkling both of how a camel hostage gives one an advantage, and of how it is the foundation of much deeper strategies.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide 3.3 Creating A Hand (an intrinsically organic shape) Now that you have the basics down you can try to model something more challenging than a dog house. Wings3D uses a modeling technique know as subdivision surfaces, a technique favored by many to create organic, or natural world, type of models. So it seems fitting that for our second model we attempt to create an organic type model; in this case we will attempt a hand. So do a File | New to get a fresh slate and put a cube in your work area. Since hands are not cubes, let us begin by scaling the cube into a flatter shape, more conducive to hand building. Switch to Body selection mode by clicking on the Body icon on the icon bar or by hitting the B key. Then click on the cube to select it.


Figure 18: Cube preparation. A selected object becomes highlighted in the current Selection Color as set in the user's Color Preferences. Here the cube is selected.

DRAFT 1.6 27

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Now that the cube is selected we can change its basic shape via some of the Body functions found in the Body Operations menu. With the cube still selected right click out in the open workspace somewhere to call up the Object enu. A menu will pop up with all the available functions for full body manipulation.


Figure 19: A refresher. With the cube selected, right click in the Workspace to bring up the Object Menu. Only operations relevant to object manipulation are available.

28 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide Hover over Scale and a sidebar menu will come up with things you can do regarding the Scale function.


Figure 20: Working with the context sensitive menus. Menu items with side arrows have associated Side Bar Menus. Selecting the menu item, in this case Scale, will bring up the Side Bar Menu. Here we select Scale – Z so that we can make the cube thinner.

DRAFT 1.6 29

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Click on Z to limit changes in scale to the Z axis and then drag your mouse to the left (the -Z direction) to make the cube narrower.


Figure 21: A palm is born. The cube has been adjusted to form the palm of our hand model.

Left click to end the Scale operation.

30 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide 3.4 Adding Detail Now we will add some fingers and a thumb to the basic hand block. Begin by clicking on the Edge Mode Icon at the bottom of the workspace to switch to Edge Selection Mode. Notice that all the edges become highlighted, because they were derived from a previously selected object. Hit the Space Bar to deselect everything. Now select the top two edges, as illustrated below. Right click in the workspace to bring up the Edge Operations menu and choose Cut and then 4 from the side bar menu to cut the top edges into four equal parts. Notice that upon completing the Cut operation you are automatically switched to Vertex Mode with the affected vertices pre-selected as seen on the top right frame of the picture below. Right click in the workspace to bring up the Vertex Operations menu and select the Connect function. New edges will snap into place, as seen in the bottom right frame below, thus forming four new faces on the top side of the hand block. These will eventually become the base faces for our fingers.


Figure 22: Cut in the finger nubs. Select the top two edges (top left). Right click for the Edge Menu (top middle) and Cut by 4. This creates new vertices (top right) which are pre-selected. Another right click brings up the Vertex Menu (bottom left) where we can Connect the vertices to create four new faces (bottom right).

DRAFT 1.6 31

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Now select the two side edges of the hand block. Right click in the workspace to bring up the Edge Menu and select Connect. A new edge will be created that connects the two sides, thus breaking the side face into two equal faces while leaving the new edge in the selected state. While it is still selected right click for the Edge Menu again and Move in the Y direction just a bit. Hit the space bar to deselect everything and then select the two lower vertical edges on the side and Connect them. Slide the resultant edged down with the Move Y function so that it is just above the base of the hand. We now have faces in place that can form the base of the four fingers and the thumb.


Figure 23: Cut in the thumb nub. Select the two side edges (top left) and Connect them. Move the resultant edge (top middle) down in Y via the Edge Menu Move Y function (top right). Then select the two lower edges (bottom left) and connect them. Then using the Edge Menu Move Y function again (bottom middle), move the new edge down along Y to form the base face that will become the thumb.

32 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide Next we will use the Face function Extrude to create some basic fingers. Switch to Face Selection Mode by clicking on the Face Icon at the bottom of the Workspace. Then click on the four faces that will form the base of the four fingers. Right click for the Face Operations menu and select Extrude and then select Y. Move your mouse to the right to extrude the faces up a bit then left click to end the extrusion. Notice that the end faces remain selected, facilitating another extrude. So do another, shorter, extrusion. This will later form knuckles. Then carry on with the extrusions as illustrated in Figure 24. You do not have to constantly right click to bring up the context sensitive menu, however. Wings has a Repeat command, accessed by simply hitting the D key on your keyboard. It can save you quite a bit of time if you are doing many of the same types of functions over and over, as here with the finger extrusions.


Figure 24: Extrude the fingers. Select the finger base faces (top right) and Extrude in Y a little (top center). Do a shorter Extrude for some knuckles (top left). Then carry on as shown in the lower frames.

DRAFT 1.6 33

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL To add a thumb we will do another set of extrusions, but we don't want the thumb to stick straight out from the side of the palm, so we will also use the Rotate function. Select the face we created earlier for the base of the thumb and do a Extrude in X. By now you should have gotten the knack of the context sensitive menus, so I will stop telling you to right click in the Workspace to bring up the Face Operations menu... to help speed things along. The extruded face will still be selected, so now do a Rotate in Z. Move your mouse back and forth to see how the face will rotate about the Z axis, rotating up when moved to the right, and rotating down when moved to the left. Rotate the face up until it looks about like the illustration in Figure 16. Left click to stop rotating. Now do a series of extrusions. This time we will Extrude Normal rather than along one of the primary axis. Extruding in the normal simply means to move the extrusion along a vector perpendicular to its plane. Then it is simply a matter of doing two more extrusions and we have a very crude model of a hand.


Figure 25: Extrude the thumb. Extrude the base thumb face (top left). Then Rotate the end face about the Z axis (top right). Extrude in along the Normal three more times (lower left) to complete our rough-in of a hand (lower right).

34 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide 3.5 Finishing It Off This hand, admittedly, looks very crude. There is a little we can do to make it look better while introducing you to some more Wings3D tools and concepts. So let's take the hand model just a little bit further before calling it quits.

We want to add some additional detail to make the hand look more natural. But first, let's see what it looks like as is, in the smooth shaded mode and again with one Smooth applied to it. I will frequently do a Smooth operation while modeling just to get a feel for how things are going, then Undo to continue modeling. You may find that technique useful too. And a Smooth will help you isolate and fix problems in your model caused by bad geometry that some times lurks in unexpected places.


Figure 26: The Smooth operation. The hand in Flat Shaded Mode (top left) and in Smooth Shaded Mode (top middle). With the hand selected do one Smooth operation (top right). You can see the results of the Smooth in Flat Shaded Mode on the bottom image set here; the left one while the hand is still selected. On the far right is a smooth shaded view of the hand following the Smooth operation. While it looks much more &quot;organic&quot; it still appears to be far from natural.

Hit the Space Bar to make sure nothing is selected. Now left click on the Smooth Shaded Icon (the rightmost icon on the left set of icons) on the Icon Bar to see what our un-smoothed hand looks like. Yikes! Hit the Tab key to leave Smooth Shaded Mode. Note that you can enter and leave Smooth Shaded either way, via the icons or via the Tab key. Now select the hand again and do a Smooth. Hit the Space Bar to deselect the hand and then hit the Tab key to see the smoothed hand in smooth shaded mode. Not very impressive.

DRAFT 1.6 35

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Now undo the smooth by selecting the Undo function from the Edit Menu. Do this as often as needed to get back to the un-smoothed version of the hand. We will now attempt to make it look at least a little more natural by adding some finger nails, some knuckle bumps, and some tendons. To save space and since you should have a pretty good feel for the basic operations by now, I will not take you though the process of adding these details step by step. Rather, I will present you with a set of sample objects in Figure 27 and tell you in general what I did to get the details you see there. I've made the screen shots here a little bigger so that you can see more of the detail. So take a moment to study the edges as they progress in the picture below.

Quick Tip: Overlaying the wireframe on a smooth shaded view.

Some people find it very useful to overlay the wireframe on a smooth shaded view of their model. This serves two purposes; first it helps them find surface anomalies while at the same time being able to see what edges may be the culprits, and second it gives new modelers a sense of how edges and edge loops affect the overall form of the model. To get the wireframe on the smooth shaded view simply hit the Tab key to get the smooth shaded preview of the model then hit the W key to overlay the wireframe. Note that you can change the color of the wireframe in the Edit | Preferences menu.

36 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide Figure 27: Adding details. Detail has been added (top) by selecting edges or vertices as needed and Connecting them to rough in the knuckles and tendons. Then more detail was added (bottom) adding more edges via Connects and then Moving vertices to form knuckle bulges and round out the palm. Finger nails were created by selecting faces and Extruding Region.

In the top portion of Figure 27 above I added more details by doing a series of Connects. One set of Connects was done to create a loop that separates the hand front to back. Then four loops were created the same way to completely encircle the hand down the length and each finger and into and around the palm. Then another another set of edges was created to run from the index finger tendon up the side of the thumb, and back down the other side. Then to create more of a knuckle shape, the vertices at the front and back of each knuckle were Scaled in Y to spread them apart thus creating the diamond shaped areas.

In the bottom section of Figure 27 I added yet more detail. To add detail to to knuckles I Dissolved the edges on the inside of the diamonds (front and back) and then Inset them a bit to create inner diamonds. Then I used Connect on vertices to create the details you see here.

DRAFT 1.6 37

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Then I Moved the inner vertices out to form bumps on the backside of the fingers and in to form creases on the inside of the fingers. Then I selected the faces for the finger nails (four per nail by the way, not just two) and did an Extrude Region slightly into the fingers. Then I scaled down the region just a bit and then did another Extrude Region to raise the nails just past the level of the skin. Of course I did all this stuff for the thumb too.

Now my attention turned to the hand itself. I added four more edge loops that surrounded the hand. Then I added edges to form the V shape around each of the tendons. This allowed me to Move the edges for the tendons out so that they bump up a little. Of course on the palm of the hand I Moved them into the hand a bit to form creases. Then I went about the outside of the hand and in between the knuckles and tried to round things up a bit by moving vertices. It's not looking too bad at this point, in fact, the hand is almost complete.

Figure 28 below shows some final detail I have cut into the palm of the hand, the life lines, as used in palm readings. They were created by doing some Connects on the edges to include the curve of the lines. Then the lines were Beveled to turn them into double lines and then the vertices were Moved into the hand to create the necessary creases. This completed the modeling portion of the hand. Be we are not done. In the bottom half of Figure 28 you can see that I have assigned colors to the hand. It is important for you to assign colors to your models before you consider your task complete because each different color assignment can be used to great effect in subsequent paint and rendering programs.

In the bottom half of Figure 28 you can see that I have made two distinct color assignments; one for the skin of the hand, and one for the nails. later when I create a texture map, I will be able to pull the model apart and arrange the parts nicely in my texture mapping program of choice because I did this. In fact, if I were smart, I would have assigned a different texture to the front and back of the hands so that they could be easily isolated for painting. So, to make these color assignments simply select the faces to be assigned a color and then use the Face | Set Material operation. You will be presented with a pop-up box with New, Default and Hole as choices. Select New and you will be prompted for a material name. Give the faces a short but logical name. Skin and nails come to mind for me here. The Material Editor will come up, as shown in Figure 29 below.

material editor window. Once you are happy

with your settings click the OK button on the material editor window. You don't really need to get too fancy here, especially at first, so just make a color you like for skin and click OK.

The fastest way to do this is to set up the largest material first by selecting the object then switching to Face Mode so that all faces are selected. Then assign all the faces that color, in this case, skin. After hitting OK in the Material Editor you can then select the nails and do another Set Material, and then dream up you nail color. Say OK again. Then hit the Space Bar to deselect everything so you see your creation in full color. Don't forget to Save your model before quitting, and you may also want to Export it into a format that your rendering program can read.

That should give you the basics for organic modeling in Wings since a hand is definitely an organic subject. Not to say my model is a particularly good example of if. It is not a lifelike hand at all. But considering it is the first Human hand I ever modeled, it did not turn out too badly. And since subdivision surface modeling is known to be particularly good for organic type models this was a good exercise. Now you can try something else organic. I recommend you do what I did for the hand. I found some cages (finished hands in wireframe mode prior to smoothing) and analyzed them to see where the artists had placed the edges and then tried to emulate their examples. My thanks to Mike Rickard for providing the hand model that inspired this one. His was much better, but I needed to do this from scratch so that I could adequately describe what the steps were. But there are plenty of cages posted out on the web, simple screen shots of non-smoothed models. Use them as your guide until you develop a style of your own.

=='''Revised''' Outline==
**A Brief Introduction to Pixel Art
***&quot;A great thing to do in school or at the office!&quot;
***&quot;Keep in mind, pixel'rs, the scale of the pixel art is up to you, but keep things CONSISTENT!&quot;
***What you'll need
****MS Paint or a similar paint program with basic zoom functions
****Photoshop is obligatory, but can be a great help when doing anti-aliasing, shading, and transparency.
****An imagination and eye for what's right
*The Basics
**&quot;For ever two pixels across, one pixel down&quot;, the golden rule in pixel art
**Making a box
***Geometry
***Shading
**Some other basic shapes
***Cones, rectangles, spheres
**Combining these shapes to make something
***Buildings
***Statues
***Vehicles
**Doo-dads
***Often, the scale of pixel art does not lend itself to allow smaller objects- such as people- to be drawn according to the traditional pixel art persepective (I.E., for every 2 pixels across, 1 down).  Because of this, it is up to the artist to choose by which method to draw smaller doodads.  Here are some examples on how you may wish to do it:
***People, Animals, and other tiny things
*Pixel Art Gallery
**Inspiration
***Games (Sim City, Habbo Hotel, Coke Music, Ultima Online, etc..)
***Art Gallery
*Links

I have the feeling this book is going to be more of a picture gallery than anything else! :)
All pictures for galleries in this book should be 100x100 or 200x200 so looks nice and is not distorted by thumbnailing.

Yeah, could you do that for me? (The tutorial page is REALLY ambiguous and it is really hard to understand). --[[User:CherryT|CherryT]] 18:11, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

== Do you need any help? ==

I am by no means an expert on pixel art but I enjoy making it. Is there anything I can do to help with your wikibook? --[[User:Kitty the Random|Kitty]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kitty the Random|who?]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:07, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

P.S. - I have a couple examples of my pixel art at [http://kitei.net/pixels.html this site] that you can see.

--Sure Kitty. *blows off cobwebs*. I thought this project was going to die. I haven't updated it in over a year (that's what it seems like...). Please do contribute, maybe I'll start working on it again.

� Section 2: The Wings3D User Interface WINGS3D USER MANUAL 2.8 The Information String If you have an element of geometry selected Wings will display some basic information on that element (or elements) in a string at the top left-hand side of the workspace. 

2.9 Wings Units A Wings Unit (wu) is arbitrary in size and can be thought of in terms of any real world units desired. The Wings grid is composed of squares each 1x1 wu in size. The standard Wings cube is cube is 2 x 2 x 2 Wings Units in size. If building a model from scratch you can arbitarily decide that a wu will represent inches, feet, meters or miles; whichever is most appropriate for the task at hand.

Quick Tip: Working With Wings Units

When working with many Wings commands dragging with the Shift key depressed will cause movement to be constrained to whole units, while the Ctrl key will cause movement to be constrained to tenths of units. Holding down Shift + Ctrl keys constrains operations to hundredths of a wings unit. While it seems the same as the readout – as this is only 2 decimal places – it is possible to do unconstrained drags and get elements that are 3 decimal places when measured, even though the read out only shows two. Had me tearing my hair out on more than one occasion. Where it matters I use Shift + Ctrl.

The color of this text is set in the Edit | Preferences menu via the Text Color parameter. If you find this text string annoying you can hide it by simply changing the text color to match the background color of the workspace. I do not recommend this course of action since you can glean some useful information here. If you select an element, a vertex for example, Wings will inform you of the Vertex ID and it's position in X, Y, and Z. Furthermore, if you select another vertex, so that two are selected at the same time, it will tell you how far apart they are. If you select a single edge it will tell you how long that edge is. This can be very useful, especially in modeling buildings and the like.

It is not uncommon for Wings units and other 3D packages units to be vastly different in size. Therefore you will need to experiment with the import/export sizing options to get suitably sized objects on import/export. Scaling by 1000, for example, brings in a Poser model at a decent working scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Dialog Boxes==
'''Dialog Boxes''' are used to enter values via the keyboard as parameters for operations in Wings.  Some Dialog Boxes popup when the user chooses to enter a value numerically and other popup automatically asking the user to enter a value before proceeding.
===Tab Entry Dialog Box===
The most common is the '''Tab Entry Dialog Box'''.  Perhaps that's not its official name, but it serves as a valid description.  Pressing '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' during most types of operations that involve ''Scaling'', ''Moving'', ''Rotating'', or ''Extruding'' elements of geometry invokes this dialog box.  The Information Line will tell you when this option is available.  When the user presses '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' during such an operation, the '''Tab Entry Dialog Box''' will open with the present value of the operation already entered, ready for the user to edit.
[[Image:Wings_Tab_Entry.png|frame|left|''This screen shot depicts a'' '''Move/Free''' ''operation in progress with the selected face.  Pressing'' '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' ''during such an operation will bring up the'' '''Numeric Input''' ''dialog box.  In this case, the user is asked to enter numeric values for x, y, z.  In other cases, such dialogs may ask the user to specify'' '''Degrees''' ''for rotation, or a'' '''Percentage''' '' for a scale operation.  Entries for these types of'' '''Tab Entry Dialog Boxes''' ''may be either positive or negative, or even include math.  To navigate the dialog box, the user must press'' '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' ''to move from entry to entry, or to'' '''Ok''' ''or'' '''Cancel''' ''the operation.  Mouse functions are disabled during these types of operations.  The active input is highlighted in light blue and bold edged in black.'']]

===Why Use The Tab Entry Dialog Box===
Most often, the '''Tab Entry Dialog Box''' is used to input a specific value for an operation, that is not possible to enter using ''Constraints'' or easily achieved by simple ''Dragging''.

----
:*Using ''Constraints'' for measures while moving or extruding elements allows for 0.010, 0.10, 1.0 increments in Wings Units (wu).
:*Using ''Constraints'' for angles during rotations will do so at  1/15°, 1°, 15° increments.
:*Using ''Constraints'' during scaling types of operation will limit scaling to 1%, 10% and 100% increments.
:*Using simple ''Dragging'' is only good for eyeballing measurements and should not be used for anything that requires precision.
----

Use the ''Tab Entry Dialog Box'' if the value you require is not offered by ''Constraints'' or the operation is too precise to use ''Dragging''.  












====''Math In Dialog Boxes''====
*There are some interesting feature to this dialog box that are not apparent at first glance.  Wings understands most of the common mathematical expressions including addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/).  It is perfectly feasible to type ''12.345+0.1/1.67-4'' into the dialog, press '''&lt;Enter&gt;''' and receive a result for a particular operation.  But honestly, there should be some ''sense'' to the numbers you type so here's a useful example using the Wings cube primitive.

::'''''Situation:'''''  You have an Edge that is 2 wu, and you want it to be 4.563 wu.  Length you have = 2 wu       Length you want = 4.563 wu

::'''''Procedure:'''''  '''1)''' Make a cube.
:::::'''2)''' Select one of its edges.
:::::'''3)''' Open the Right-Click-Context-Menu and select Scale Uniform.
:::::'''4)''' Press &lt;Tab&gt; to open the Dialog Box.
:::::'''5)'''  Enter the following formula substituting in the proper values.
::::::''The length you want multiplied by one hundred and divided by the length you have.''
::::::Or in this case, input '''4.563*100/2''' and press '''&lt;Enter&gt;'''.

::'''''Result:'''''  The length of the selected edge should now be 4.563 wu as displayed in the Status Bar.

::'''''Conclusion:'''''  The reality of the above procedure is that you'll need a pencil and paper for anything complicated.  In the previous example ''the length you have'' was 2, but often this number will be several digits long with a decimal thrown in and on top of that there is ''the length you want''!  So just bear that in mind as Wings still lacks a cut and paste feature.  Also, the described procedure uses Scale Uniform which results in both ends of the edge moving uniformly from the centre point of the edge.  To scale the edge from one point and so keep one end of the edge stationary, you would have to have '''Advanced Menus''' on and select '''Scale Uniform''' the  Right Mouse Button option (&quot;Choose point to scale from&quot;), then &quot;Pick point to scale from&quot; (this will be the one that will remain stationary), and press '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' to input the formula.


----
''Note that Wings also recognizes the following list of mathematical expressions as long as you type '''math:''' before the expression.  ie. '''math:pi''' would be pi.  Here are the allowed expressions: '''sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh, exp, log, log10, pow, sqrt, abs, pi '''''
----


====''Dialog Box History''====

*Another feature of the dialog boxes is a kind of ''history'' feature.  Say you performed the above example and wanted to try it again on another edge of the cube.  Maybe this time trying the alternate example in the ''conclusion'' with '''Advanced Menus''' on.  The formula remains the same for both examples, so when you get to the ''Tab Entry Dialog Box'' try pressing the ''up'' arrow key.  Pressing the up and down arrow key will scroll through the history of past inputs.  In this case, when you push the up arrow key, 4.563*100/2 should popup in the dialog box and you can press enter to complete the procedure.

[[Image:Input_Example.png|frame|left|''Pressing the '''up''' or '''down''' arrow keys will scroll the '''history''' of previous entries in the Dialog Box.'']]

*Access to previous entries in a dialog box can be a useful.  Especially when you have to perform the same procedure more than once in a session.  Here's a good example of where this feature can be helpful.  Consider the '''Tighten''' command in the ''Right-Click Vertex Menu''.  Often times organic modelers will want to use '''Tighten''' to smooth out an extrusion or average out a model's vertices to make a cleaner looking mesh.  Some modelers do this quite often as part of their work flow using a technique called ''Selection Jumping''.  The '''Tighten''' command uses averaging and is tabulated as a percentage.  Applying '''Tighten''' at the same percentage every time you use the tool, will make you more able to predict its results.  This is a good reason to use the history function in the dialog box.  It allows you to quickly repeat a procedure at a constant value.  This way you can press '''Tighten''', '''&lt;Tab&gt;''', '''Up Arrow'''. '''&lt;Enter&gt;''', if you are going to use the same value as the last time.

----
''Note that Dialog Box input history is not exclusive to each tool.  It keeps a running history of the inputs for all tools.  This means it is the last entry you typed, that will appear when you press '''Up Arrow''' once, not necessarily the input you typed for the last time you used that particular tool.''

==Introduction to array operations ==

As arrays are the basic data structure in MATLAB, it is important to understand how to use them effectively. See the previous section for that.

Arrays in MATLAB obey the same rule as their mathematical counterpart: by default, the ''matrix definitions'' of operations are used, unless a special operator called the dot operator is applied.

Because arrays operations are so similar to the equivalent mathematical operations, a basic knowledge of linear algebra is mandatory to use matlab effectively. However, we won't be as precise as in mathematics when using the terms vector and matrix. In MATLAB, both are arrays of doubles (thus being a matrix in the real mathematical meaning), and MATLAB considers vectors as a matrices with only one row or only one column. However, there are special functions just for vectors; see the vector module for an explanation of how to use these.

== Basics ==

=== How to input an array ===

The common way to input an array from the matlab command line is to put the input
figures into list into square brackets:

 &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3]
 
 ans =
 
    1  2  3

Comma is used to separate columns elements, and semicolon is used to separate rows. So
[1, 2, 3] is a row vector, and [1; 2; 3] is a column vector

 &gt;&gt; [1; 2; 3]
 
 ans =
 
    1
    2
    3

If a blankspace is used to separate elements, the default separator is comma, thus making the vector a row vector.

Logically, inputting a matrix is done by using a comma separated list of column vectors, or a semicolon separated list
of row vectors:

 &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
 
 ans =
 
     1     2     3
     4     5     6

=== Variable assignment ===

To reuse an array in subsequent operations, one should assign the array to a variable. Variable assignment is done through the equal symbol:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
 
 a =
 
     1     2     3

Notice that instead of ans =, the name of the variable is displayed by matlab. If you forget to assign the last statement to a variable,
the variable ans always point to the last ''non assigned'':

 &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3]
 
 ans =
 
     1     2     3

 &gt;&gt; a = ans
 
 a =
 
     1     2     3

But:

 &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3]
 
 ans =
 
     1     2     3
 
 &gt;&gt; b = [4, 5, 6]
 
 b = 
 
     4     5     6
 
 &gt;&gt; a = ans
 
  a =
 
     1     2     3

I.e. ans is really the last non assigned result, and not the result of the last statement. 

As it is the case for most interpreted languages, you do not need to declare a variable before using it,
and reusing a variable name in an assignment will overwrite the previous content.

To avoid cluttering the command line of matlab, you can postfix any command with a semicolon:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3];

=== Accessing elements of a matrix ===

Now that you know how to define a simple array, you should know how to access its elements. Accessing the content of an array is done through the operator (), with the index inside the parenthesis; the indexing of the first element is 1:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3];
 &gt;&gt; a(1)
  
 ans =
 
     1

 &gt;&gt; a(3)
 
 ans =
 
     3
 
Accessing an element outside the bounds will result in an error:

 &gt;&gt; a(5)
 ???  Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

To access a single matrix element, you can use the (i,j) subscript, where i is the index in the row, and j in the column:

 &gt;&gt; a= [1, 2; 3, 4];
 &gt;&gt; a(1, 2)
 
 ans = 
 
     2
 
 &gt;&gt; a(2, 1)
  
 ans = 
 
     3
 
You can also access a matrix element through a unique index; in this case, the order is column major, meaning you first go through
all elements of the first column, then the 2d column, etc... The column major mode is the same as in Fortran, and the contrary
of the order in the C language.

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; a(3)
 
 ans =
 
     2


It is also possible to access blocks of matrices using the colon (:) operator. This operator is like a wildcard; it tells MATLAB that you want all elements of a given dimension or with indices between two given values. For example, say you want to access the entire first row of matrix a above, but not the second row. Then you can write:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; a(1,:) %row 1, every column
 ans = 
    1     2     3

Now say you only want the first two elements in the first row. To do this, use the following syntax:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; a(1, 1:2)
 ans = 
    1     2

The syntax a(:) changes a into a column vector (column major):

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
 &gt;&gt; a(:)
 ans = 
    1
    4
    2
    5
    3
    6

Finally, if you do not know the size of an array but wish to access all elements from a certain index until the end of the array, use the end operator, as in

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
 &gt;&gt; a(1, 2:end) %row 1, columns from 2 until end of the array
 ans =
    2     3

=== Logical Addressing ===

In addition to index addressing, you can also access only elements of an array that satisfy some logical criterion. For example, suppose a = [1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.5] and you only want the values between 2 and 4. Then you can achieve this in two ways. The first is to use the ''find'' function to find the indices of all numbers between 2 and 4 in the array, and then address the array with those indices:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.5];
 &gt;&gt; INDICES = find(a &gt;= 2 &amp; a &lt;= 4);
 &gt;&gt; a(INDICES)
 ans =
    2.1   3.2

This does not work in MATLAB 2006b.

The second method is to use logical addressing, which first changes a into a logical array, with value 1 if the logical expression is true and 0 if it is false. It then finds and returns all values in the a which are true. The syntax for this is as follows:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.5];
 &gt;&gt; a(a &gt;= 2 &amp; a &lt;= 4)
 ans =
    2.1   3.2

== Basic operations ==

=== Rational Operators on Arrays ===
The interesting part is of course applying some operations on those arrays. You can for example use the classic arithmetic operations + and -
on any array in matlab: this results in the vector addition and subtraction as defined in classic vector vectors spaces  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, which
is simply the addition and subtraction elements wise:

 &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] - [1, 2, 1]
 
 ans = 
  
    0   0   2

The multiplication by a scalar also works as expected:

 &gt;&gt; 2 * [1, 2, 3] 
 
 ans = 
 
    [2, 4, 6]

Multiplication and division are more problematic: multiplying two vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; does not make sense. It makes sense only
in the matrix context. Using the symbol * in matlab computes the ''matrix product'', which is only defined when the number of columns of the left operand matches the number of rows of the right operand:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2; 3, 4];
 &gt;&gt; a * a
 
 ans =

     7    10
    15    22

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]; b = [1; 2; 3];
 &gt;&gt; a * a
 ??? Error using ==&gt; *
 Inner matrix dimensions must agree.
 &gt;&gt; a * b
 
 ans =
 
    14


Using the division symbol / has even more constraints, as it imposes the right operand to be invertible (see [[Wikipedia:Invertible matrix]]). For square matrices, &lt;math&gt;a / b&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;a * b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For example :

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2; 3, 4]; b = [1, 2; 1, 2]
 &gt;&gt; b / a
 
 ans =
 
     1     0
     1     0

 &gt;&gt; a / b
 Warning: Matrix is singular to working precision.
 
 ans =
 
   Inf   Inf
   Inf   Inf

If you desire to multiply or divide two matrices or vectors componentwise, or to raise all components of one matrix to the same power, rather than using matrix definitions of these operators, you can use the dot (.) operator. The two matrices must have the same dimensions. For example, for multiplication,

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3];
 &gt;&gt; b = [0, 1, 2];
 &gt;&gt; a .* b
 
 ans =
 
   0    2    6

The other two componentwise operators are ./ and .^.

As matlab is a numerical computing language, you should keep in mind that a matrix which is theoretically invertible may lead to precision problems and thus giving imprecise results or even totally wrong results. The message above &quot;matrix is singular to working precision&quot; should appear in those cases, meaning the results cannot be trusted.

Non-square matrices can also be used as the right operand of /; in this case, it computes the [[w:Pseudoinverse|pseudoinverse]]. This is especially useful in least square problems.

=== Boolean Operators on Arrays ===

The same boolean operators that can be used for point values can also be used to compare arrays. To do this, MATLAB compares the elements componentwise and returns them in a logical array of the same size as the two arrays being compared. The two arrays must have the same size. For example,

 &lt;pre&gt;
 &gt;&gt; A = [2,4], B = [1,5];
 &gt;&gt; A &lt; B
 
 ans =
    [0    1]
 &lt;/pre&gt;

You must be careful when using comparisons between arrays as loop conditions, since they clearly do not return single values and therefore can cause ambiguous results. The loop condition should be reducable to a single boolean value, T or F, not an array. Two common ways of doing this are the &quot;any&quot; and the &quot;all&quot; functions. A function call any(''array'') will return true if ''array'' contains any nonzero values and false if all values are zero. It does the comparisons in one direction first then the other, so to reduce a matrix you must call the any function ''twice''. The function ''all'', similarly, returns true if and only if all elements in a given row or column are nonzero.

==Solving Linear Systems==
To solve a linear system in the form '''A'''x = b use the &quot;\&quot; operator.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;A = [4 5 ; 2 8];
b = [23 28]';
x = A\b

x =

     2
     3&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>/* Christian slant? */ indeed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Accurate?==
In the second paragraph it says that &quot;Jehovah presented himself in the human form to Moses . . .&quot;. In the Bible at any rate it doesn’t seem to say anything about whether God/Jehovah was in '''human''' form, so maybe this should be reworded.

== God for the Third Millennium:Deus ex machina (comment ==

Are we being objective here, can you realy ignore the views of over one billion Moslims.
If you dont have accurate information about the faith, then please state the fact.

== Christian slant? ==

I don't mean to be rude, and I identify as a Christian, but it seems to me that this section is very much into the Christian viewpoint, and not so much with anything else. I'd like to take out or attribute as Christian belief some of the more blatant stuff (references to Jesus as God's Only Son, performing miracles, etc), but I'm not sure of how much to do, or how to seperate it. Maybe I'm just being silly and unwilling to completely delete someone's hard work.

: I think this text is beyond repair. It is the typical state of a [[w:Monotheism]]: To narrowminded, uninformed. If he/she informed then he/she whould know that neiter [[w:Hinduism]] nor [[w:Budism]] are considered a [[w:Monotheism]]. That makes 2 of the to 5 religions. Personaly I belive that the [[w:Monotheism]] is a dead end - the universe is just to big for one God and this book is just one more attempt to rescue what canot be rescued. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:26, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

== FIFA Divisions ==

The countries, teams and their leagues are divided into divisions authorized under FIFA. These regions are clearly shown in the following figure.

[[Image:World Map FIFA2.svg|450px]]
 
'''CONCACAF''': Mostly includes the North and Central Americas including Trinidad and Tobago from the South America.

'''CONMEBOL''': All of the South America.

'''UEFA''': The whole Europe, including some countries in Asia.

'''AFC''': The whole Asia excluding those that moved into UEFA.

'''CAF''': The whole Africa.

'''OFC''': As of January 1, 2006 Australia is a member of the AFC.  OFC now consist of Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, and the rest of the Polynesian countries.

==Confederations, Leagues And Teams==

Each division has a confederation which manages a number of leagues lying under its territory. Let's start with the famous European UEFA.

==UEFA==
[[Image:UEFA_Logo.jpg|right|150px]]

UEFA ('''U'''nion of '''E'''uropean '''F'''ootball '''A'''ssociations) is the division where Europe's teams are placed. The most famous teams are especially from this region including Germany, Italy, England ,France, Spain and Netherlands.
The teams that are most famous are from these countries especially. Here's a good sort of all kings of football according to countries and leagues from Europe.

===FA Premier League===
[[Image:FAPL_Logo(Old).jpg|right|50px]]

In 1992 the top division of clubs in England formed a breakaway league, enabling them to take a larger share of income from media rights in comparison to the rest of the football league. The Premier League (originally Premiership) currently consists of 20 clubs.

The top four teams in the Premier League currently qualify for the UEFA Champions League (at various stages during the qualifying process). The fifth place club qualifies for the UEFA Cup, although extra clubs often qualify on the basis of league position depending on the winners of domestic cup competitions. The bottom 3 clubs are automatically relegated.

In terms of income, viewing figures and attendances the Premier League is the most successful domestic football competition in the world, and compares favorably across all sports. However many football fans within England are concerned with the vast sums of money involved, while clubs in the lower divisions struggle, with many entering administration and some going out of business. In addition the formation of the Premier League has lead to a generation of fans growing up with football as a TV only activity (as live games become more expensive to cater for corporate hospitality). This has lead to the slow death of the local football culture which developed over the last 150 years in England.

====Manchester United====
[[File:Manchester United FC crest.svg|right|100px]] 
Manchester United Football Club is an English premier league football club that plays at Old Trafford in Greater Manchester. The club was formed in 1878, as the team Newton Heath F.C.

For those wishing to establish a point in history when checking out the impact of human activities on the environment became a thing worth doing, a good date is 1864, and the event is the publication by George Perkins Marsh of his book, 'Man and Nature, or Physical Geography Modified by Human Action'.  In his travels as an American diplomat, Marsh was well placed not only to document environmental change, but also to evaluate it.  In this respect he is remembered for the way he forcefully pointed out the difference in attitudes between the native people's and European's attitudes to the natural world. The native leaves a slight footprint on the Earth, whilst civilisation &quot;assumes an aggressive attitude, and thenceforward strives to subdue to his control and subject to his uses, all her productivity and all her motive powers&quot;.  Another way of stating this difference is that preindustrial production systems are characteristic of 'inscribed groups', who organise for the sustained exploitation of local natural resources. They are inscribed, or embedded, into local ecosystems by being linked to the productivity of a narrow range of biophysical flows which limit the number of people who can partake of the local resources.   Modern production systems are characteristic of 'constructive groups' who construct a landscape to serve their economic aspirations, populating it beyond the limits of the local natural productivity, importing goods and services from elsewhere, thereby destroying its ecosystems. Costructive groups gather around sites where there is an application of inventions for mass production. Workers migrate attracted by better wages and prospects, taking advantage of improved communications.  

'Man and Nature' was the most comprehensive statement about land management that had ever appeared.  It was culled from Marsh's own farming experiences in New England and his research into the works of European naturalists, geographers, foresters and hydrologists.  There is no better exposition of need for environmental impact assessment and its precautionary principle than the following: 

&quot;The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve and we can never know how wide a circle of disturbance we produce in the harmonies of nature when we throw the smallest pebble in the ocean of organic life&quot;

==GEMS and Surveillance==

As far as wildlife was concerned Marsh advised farmers to err on the side of caution rather than risk destroying a vital part of their production system.

Just over a century later the US National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 required the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments for the evaluation of any detrimental effects of new schemes that would affect landform and drainage.  This was followed two years later by the Global Monitoring System (GEMS), which was endorsed by the U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.  Then followed a spate of conventions and conferences that placed the topic of environmental evaluation at the top of international and national strategies of economic development.  The practical outcomes were the application of ecological principles to programmes of surveillance, monitoring and impact assessment at the levels of biosphere, ecosystem, landscape and population.  Some of the early milestones are:

==Environmental impact assessment==

===Introduction===

Environmental Impact Assessment can be defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made.  The aim of an assessment is to address biodiversity at all appropriate levels and allow for enough survey time to take seasonal features into account. It should focus on processes and services which are critical be conserved and protected in this context, it is essential that it is linked to the issue of securing sustainable livelihoods for local people based on biodiversity resources.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The starting point of every environmental assesssment is that biodiversity must be conserved to ensure it survives, continuing to provide services, values and benefits for current and future generations. The aim is to identify, protect and promote sustainable use of biodiversity, so that yields/harvests can be maintained over time. This involves examining the likely impacts of development on the benefits of biodiversity arising from the provision of essential life support systems and ecosystem services such as:

*water yield; 
*water purification; 
*breakdown of wastes; 
*flood control; 
*storm and coastal protection; 
*soil formation and conservation; 
*sedimentation processes; 
*nutrient cycling; 
*carbon storage; 
*and climatic regulation. 

An assessment process also takes into account the costs of replacing these services.

Areas with &quot;important biodiversity&quot; are those that:

*Support endemic, rare, declining habitats/species/genotypes.
*Support genotypes and species whose presence is a prerequisite for the persistence of other species.
*Act as a buffer, linking habitat or ecological corridor, or play an important part in maintaining environmental quality.
*Have important seasonal uses or are critical for migration.
*Support habitats, species populations, ecosystems that are vulnerable, threatened throughout their range and slow to recover.
*Support particularly large or continuous areas of previously undisturbed habitat.
*Act as refugia for biodiversity during climate change, enabling persistence and continuation of evolutionary processes.
*Support biodiversity for which mitigation is difficult or its effectiveness unproven including habitats that take a long time to develop characteristic biodiversity.
*Are currently poor in biodiversity but have potential to develop high biodiversity with appropriate intervention.


In 2005 the International Association for Impact Assessment (http://www.iaia.org/) published a public document on the guiding principles intended to promote &quot;biodiversity-inclusive&quot; impact assessment (IA), including Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for projects, and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for policies, plans and programs.

The aim was to help practitioners to integrate biodiversity in IA, decision-makers to commission and review IAs, and other stakeholders to ensure their biodiversity interests are addressed in development planning.  This document serves as a useful introduction to the concept.

It centralises biodiversity as a cross-cutting theme relevant to all fields of IA, where the aim for conservation is to work to biodiversity-related Conventions that are based on the premise that further loss of biodiversity is unacceptable. 

Impacts of development projects are assessed in terms of:

*avoiding irreversible losses of biodiversity.
*seeking alternative solutions that minimize biodiversity losses.
*mitigation to restore any loss of biodiversity.
*compensation for unavoidable loss by providing substitutes of at least similar biodiversity value.
*highlighting opportunities for enhancement.

This approach can be called &quot;positive planning for biodiversity.&quot; It helps achieve no net loss of biodiversity by ensuring:

*Priorities and targets for biodiversity at international, national, regional and local level are respected, and a positive contribution to achieving them is made.

*Damage is avoided to unique, endemic, threatened or declining species, habitats and ecosystems; to species of high cultural value to society, and to ecosystems providing important services.

===Guiding Principles===

The ‘Convention on Biological Diversity’ advocates an &quot;ecosystem approach&quot; to impact assessment because people and biodiversity depend on healthily functioning ecosystems that have to be assessed in an integrated way, not constrained by artificial boundaries. The ecosystem approach is participatory and requires a long-term perspective based on a biodiversity-based study area and adaptive management to deal with the dynamic nature of ecosystems, uncertainty and the often unpredictable nature of ecosystem functions, behavior and responses. Biodiversity concerns are not limited to protected areas. Elements of natural systems remain in even the most urbanized cities and play an often important role in the quality of life in those cities.

Traditional rights and uses of biodiversity are recognized in IA and the benefits from commercial use of biodiversity are shared fairly. Needs of future should be considered as well as current generations (inter-generational needs).  Alternatives should be sought that do not trade in biodiversity &quot;capital&quot; to meet short term needs, where this could jeopardize the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

The precautionary principle is applied in any situation where important biodiversity may be threatened and there is insufficient knowledge to either quantify risks or implement effective mitigation. Application of the precautionary principle requires that development consent should be delayed while steps are taken to ensure that best available information can be obtained through consultation with local stakeholders/experts and/or new information on biodiversity can be obtained/consolidated.

An evironmental assessments involves consulting widely to ensure that all stakeholders have been consulted and that important biodiversity values are taken into account. Valuation of biodiversity can only be done in negotiation with the different groups or individuals in society (stakeholders) who have an interest in biodiversity. Use traditional and indigenous knowledge wherever appropriate. Work carefully with indigenous communities to ensure that knowledge of biodiversity is not inappropriately exploited.

===Operating Principles===

====Screening====

Biodiversity inclusive screening criteria are used to determine whether important biodiversity resources may be affected.

Biodiversity screening &quot;triggers&quot; for IA should include:
• Potential impacts on protected areas and areas supporting protected species.
• Impacts on other areas that are not protected but are important for biodiversity.
• Activities posing a particular threat to biodiversity (in terms of their type, magnitude, location, duration, timing, reversibility).
• Areas that provide important biodiversity services including extractive reserves, indigenous people's territories, wetlands, fish breeding grounds, soils prone to erosion, relatively undisturbed or characteristic habitat, flood storage areas, groundwater recharge areas, etc.
Encourage development of a biodiversity screening map indicating important biodiversity values and ecosystem services. If possible, integrate this activity with the development of a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and/or biodiversity planning at sub-national levels (e.g., regions, local authorities, towns) to identify conservation priorities and targets.

====Scoping====

Scoping leads to Terms of Reference for IA, defining the issues to be studied and the methods that will be used. Use scoping as an opportunity to raise awareness of biodiversity concerns and discuss alternatives to avoid or minimize negative impacts on biodiversity.

It is good practice to produce a scoping report for consultation. This should address the following issues (on the basis of existing information and any preliminary surveys or discussions):

* The type of project, program, plan or policy, possible alternatives and a summary of activities likely to affect biodiversity
* An analysis of opportunities and constraints for biodiversity (include &quot;no net biodiversity loss&quot; or &quot;biodiversity restoration&quot; alternatives)
* Expected biophysical changes (in soil, water, air, flora, fauna)resulting from proposed activities or induced by any socioeconomic changes
* Spatial and temporal scale of influence, identifying effects on connectivity between ecosystems, and potential cumulative effects
* Available information on baseline conditions and any anticipated trends in biodiversity in the absence of the proposal
* Likely biodiversity impacts associated with the proposal in terms of composition, structure and function
* Biodiversity services and values identified in consultation with stakeholders and anticipated changes in these (highlight any irreversible impacts)
* Possible measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for significant biodiversity damage or loss, making reference to any legal requirements
* Information required to support decision making and summary of important gaps
*Proposed IA methodology and timescale
*For practical use, develop in-country (sectoral) guidance translating this generic scoping sequence into tools, such as guidelines and sample Terms of Reference.

===Survey===

Address biodiversity at all appropriate levels and allow for enough survey time to take seasonal features into account. Focus on processes and services which are critical opportunity to raise awareness of biodiversity concerns and discuss
alternatives to avoid or minimize negative impacts on biodiversity.

The CIAI recommends basing the assessment on the following questions:

At the gene level, to what extent will the proposal have significant effects on:
*Genetic diversity of species, particularly rare and declining species and those with identified as priorities in NBSAPs and/or subnational biodiversity plans?
*Opportunities for species populations to interact, e.g., by increasing habitat fragmentation and isolation?
*Risk of extinction?
*Persistence of locally-adapted populations?

At the species level, to what extent will the proposal:
*Alter the species-richness or species-composition of habitats in the study area?
*Alter the species-composition of communities?
*Cause some species to be lost from the area?
*Affect species identified as priorities in NBSAPs and/or subnational biodiversity plans?
*Increase the risk of invasion by alien species?

At the ecosystem level, to what extent will the proposal:
*Change the amount, quality or spatial organization of habitat?
*Affect plans to enhance habitat availability or quality?
*Damage ecosystem processes and services, particularly those on which local communities rely?

Finally:
*If habitats will be lost or altered, is alternative habitat available to support associated species populations?
*Are there opportunities to consolidate or connect habitats?
Take an ecosystem approach and involve relevant stakeholders (including local communities). Consider the full range of factors affecting biodiversity. These include direct drivers of change associated with a proposal (e.g., land conversion and vegetation removal leading to loss of habitat-a key driver of biodiversity loss, emissions, disturbance, introduction of alien and genetically modified species, etc.); and indirect drivers of change which are harder to quantify, including demographic, economic, socio-political, cultural and technological processes or interventions.

Evaluate impacts of alternatives with reference to the baseline situation.
Compare against thresholds and objectives for biodiversity. Use NBSAPs, sub-national biodiversity plans and other conservation reports for information and objectives. Take into account cumulative threats and impacts resulting either from repeated impacts of projects of the same or different nature over space and time, and/or from proposed plans, programs or policies.

Biodiversity is influenced by cultural, social, economic and biophysical factors. Cooperation between different specialists in the IA team is thus essential, as is the integration of findings which have bearing on biodiversity.
Provide insight into cause-effect chains. If possible, quantify the changes in quality and amount of biodiversity. Explain the expected consequences of any biodiversity losses associated with the proposal, including the costs of replacing biodiversity services if they will be damaged by a proposal. Find out how these relate to relevant biodiversity priorities and objectives or any legal obligations? Indicate the legal issues that create the boundary conditions for decision making.

====Mitigation====
 
Remedial action can take several forms, i.e., avoidance (or prevention), mitigation (including restoration and rehabilitation of sites), and compensation. Apply the &quot;positive planning approach,&quot; where avoidance has priority and compensation is used as a last resort measure.
Avoid &quot;excuse&quot;-type compensation. Look for opportunities to positively enhance biodiversity. Acknowledge that compensation will not always be possible; there will still be cases where it is appropriate to say &quot;no&quot; to development proposals on grounds of irreversible damage to biodiversity.

====Review for decision-making====
Peer review of environmental reports with regard to biodiversity should be undertaken by a specialist with appropriate expertise, where biodiversity impacts are significant. Depending on the level of confidentiality of public decision-making, consideration should be given to the involvement of affected groups and civil society.

====Decision making====
Avoid pitting conservation goals against development goals; balance conservation with sustainable use for economically viable, and socially and ecologically sustainable solutions. For important biodiversity issues, apply the precautionary principle where information is insufficient and the no net loss principle in relation to irreversible losses associated with the proposal.

===Management, monitoring, evaluation and auditing===
It is important to recognize that all prediction of biodiversity response to perturbation is uncertain, especially over long time frames. Management systems and programs, including clear management targets (or Limits of Acceptable Change (LC)) and appropriate monitoring, should be set in place to ensure that mitigation is effectively implemented, unforeseen negative effects are detected and addressed, and any negative trends are detected. 
Provision is made for regular auditing of impacts on biodiversity. Provision should be made for emergency response measures and/or contingency plans where upset or accident conditions could threaten biodiversity.

{{Java Programming/ConcurrentTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Java's Remote Method Invocation (commonly referred to as RMI) is used for client and server models. RMI is the object oriented equivalent to [[w:Remote procedure call|RPC (Remote procedure call)]].

The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system allows an object running in one Java Virtual Machine (VM) to invoke methods on an object running in another Java VM. RMI provides for remote communication between programs written in the Java programming language.

RMI is defined to use only with the Java platform. If you need to call methods between different language environments, use [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]]. With [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]] a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.

== STUB and SKELETON ==

The remote method invocation goes through a STUB on the client side and a so called SKELETON on the server side.
 CLIENT --&gt; STUB --&gt; ... ''Network'' ... --&gt; SKELETON --&gt; REMOTE OBJECT


== rmiregistry ==
Remote objects are listed in the '''rmiregistry'''. Clients will get a reference to the remote object by querying the rmiregistry. After that, the client can call methods on the remote objects.

The rmiregistry is a separate process that has to be started before remote objects can be added to it. It can be started by the command line in Unix:
{{XCode|1='''rmiregistry on Unix'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
rmiregistry &lt;port&gt; &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
or under Windows:
{{XCode|1='''rmiregistry on Windows'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
start rmiregistry &lt;port&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

If the ''port'' is not specified the default 1099 is used. The client will need to connect to this ''port'' to access the remote object.

The rmiregistry can also be started from a program by calling the following code:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 1: rmiregistry starting'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
...
Registry reg = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(iPort);
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Objects passed in as '''parameters to the remote objects's methods will be passed by value'''. This is the only thing developers need to keep in mind (program logic wise) when using remote objects. If the remote object changes the passed in object values, it won't be reflected on the client side, this is opposite what happens when a local object is called. Objects that used as parameters for remote methods invocation, must implement the &lt;code&gt;java.io.Serializable&lt;/code&gt; interface, as they are going to be serialized when passed through the network, and a new object will be created on the other side.

Chinese tractors are being imported in increasing numbers by dealers and individuals who find them useful on hobby farms, small farms, etc. due to their attractive pricing.  A typical Chinese tractor owner is someone who has some mechanical ability  and who is not averse to doing much of his own maintenance and repair.  Typical manuals provided by the Chinese manufacturers are brief, unclear, poorly worded and incomplete. Due to the size of the market, third-party manuals are rare. One easy to read and understand example is the Operators manual prepared in the UK for Siromer tractors. Siromer tractors are built in the Jinma plant at Yancheng, Jiangsu Province. But many owners &quot;learn by doing&quot;, often with the help of dealers and other tractor owners who participate in on-line forums or at the Chinese Tractor Owners Association which is a site dedicated to owners and dealers of these tractors. This site is located at www.ctoa.net .  A collaborative book in which experienced and &quot;newbie&quot; tractor owners alike can contribute their experience and knowledge would be an immense help to those owners who need more information to aid them in maintaining their tractors.

This section contains generic information that is applicable to most tractor models.
==== Operation ====
===== Starting =====
The starting procedure is as follows:
* Ensure that the fuel flow valve is turned on. This valve is either on the bottom of the fuel tank where the fuel exits the tank or it is on the sediment bowl.
* Sit on the operator's seat and depress the clutch.
* Put the transmission in neutral.
* Set throttle to a little bit above the idle setting.
* If the engine is cold (not warm to the touch) then do the following:
** If the engine has glow plugs set the ignition switch to the Heater (glow plug) position for 3 to 20 seconds. Leave the ignition switch in this position for only a short period of time. The colder the air temperature is the longer you leave it in this position. If the air temperature is 60F you can try 3 seconds. For an air temperature of 20F you might try 20 seconds. You do not want to stay in this ignition switch position for an extended period since it will significantly shorten the life of the glow plugs.
** NOTE: The first few times that you do this note the current draw on the amp/charging meter. If during a future engine start you see a lower current draw, one or more glow plugs may have burned out.
* Do the following if your tractor has a Compression Release knob and the engine is cold (or you can do it for every engine start):
** The Compression Release steps can be done while waiting for glow plugs to warm up.
** Locate the Compression Release knob.
** Pull/turn the Compression Release knob to the release position and hold it in the release position. It can require a significantly strong pull/twist to move the knob. It has to push against all of the intake and exhaust valve springs to release the compression.
* Turn the ignition switch to engage the starter.Do not run starter motor more than 20 to 25 seconds or damage to the windings may result.
* If you are using the Compression Release knob:
** Watch oil pressure to ensure oil pressure reaches normal operating pressure. Although this is not strictly required it does ensure that the engine is fully lubricated before encountering the stress of firing cylinders. This will prolong the life of the engine.
** Release the Compression Release knob. The spinning mass of the engine parts ensures that the engine will turn over with compression fairly rapidly (faster than the starter alone under compression) to ease starting. Since the engine now has compression it should start.
* When the engine fires turn the ignition switch back to the run position.
* If the engine does not start wait 10 seconds and try again.

=== KAMA ===
KAMA tractors is a brand name that has been applied to tractors manufactured by Shandong Worldbest Shatuo Company limited. In late 2006, the company was reorganized as a stock company but continues to operate as Shandong Tractor Works.  The factory is located in Yanzhou City in the Shandong Province of China.  The factory uses the KAMA name which it adopted when part of Woldbest KAMA at some time in the past.  The common name for tractors produced by this factory is TaiShan, named for a famous mountain located nearby.

Shandong Tractor Works has approximately 5000 employees and is one of the oldest and largest tractor factories in China. The company have their own foundry, machine shops and assembly lines on site. They produce 2 and 4 cylinder diesel engines used in tractors and in other applications.  None of these engines have EPA approval for sale in the USA so the company purchases engines from othe Chinese engine companies with EPA compliant engines.

==== KAMA 454, 554 ====
The KAMA KM454 and KM554 were developed in conjunction with a European company and offer some enhanced design features not commonly found on Chinese tractors such as constant mesh transmission and wet disk brakes. Shandong Tractor factory was the first Chinese factory to offer a &quot;Shuttle shift&quot; device on the transmission to allow simple shifting from forward to reverse in the same gear ratio.

=== Task Master 438 ===
The TM Task Master Tractor TM438 is no longer sold in the U.S. or Canada due to emission standards.  It utilizes the TY395E1 engine and might also be branded as the 435A.  Check out [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/TY395]] for some Task Master Parts.

== Tractor Model Page(s) Sub-Sections For Manual Authors ==

Each tractor model or group of closely related models have their own page containing information specific to the model or group of models. To keep the size of pages from growing too large, page size will be kept &lt; 30k bytes. This will main that some models  will have many pages of information.

To have a consistent look throughout the manual the following hierarchy and order of information for a tractor model is highly recommended. If some subsection may not apply to a particular model (example: shuttle shift) then leave the section our of the page(s) for the tractor model. 

*Specifications
*Operation (Starting, Break-in, Normal Operation, Operating Limits)
*Fluid Capacities (Engine oil, coolant, differential, power steering, hydraulic system
*Maintenance Schedule (pre-startup,50,100,...hour maintenance
*Engine (May want to link to a page specific to the engine model so that information is not repeated).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Classical View of Light==
[[Image:light-wave.png|thumb|This is a light wave frozen in time and shows the two components of light; an electric field and a magnetic field that oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a transverse wave).]]

The classical view of light is simply a wave.  This wave has two orthogonal (perpendicular) components.  These are an electric field and a magnetic field.  In the diagram shown the light is traveling to the right, the electric field is in the same plane as the page, and the magnetic field is traveling in and out of the page.  All three of these are perpendicular to each other.  The electric and magnetic component share anti-nodes.  Anti-nodes are the points where the wave passes through the zero and changes sign.  Since both waves are similar it is possible to refer to the wavelength of light, and not just the wavelength of the electric component of light.  

==Photoelectric Effect==
The '''Photoelectric effect''' is the emission of electrons from metal when it is shined on by light. The amount of electrons released depends on the type of metal and the frequency of the light. For some metals, if the light is below a certain frequency, it will not emit any electrons. Light was originally thought as a form of energy, but for this to be true, electrons would have been emitted, regardless of the frequency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=More Features of an XML Stylesheet=

In the last chapter, a stylesheet was created to simply output text from the XML document to a HTML page.  The presentation of a document can be formatted using table to layout the content for display.  In addition, a different background color, font size, font weight, and alignment can be defined using the style tag in HTML to design the output page.  Table 3-3 shows the features mentioned. Note that HTML commands are uppercase.

Note: Comment Tags are not formatted properly.  In order to get the to show up on the screen, slight alterations were needed.  You will need to add the ! to make sure that you can validate your stylesheet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
Example: &lt;!--This is a Named Custom SimpleType that is called from Hotel whenever someone types in an email address--&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Table 3-3:  XML Stylesheet for a one-to-many relationship &lt;/small&gt;'''


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; &gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color:linen&quot;&gt;
The output can be formatted using HTML tables for layout with an XML stylesheet.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Refers to Chapter 2 - A single entity for steps in using NetBeans to create the above XML stylesheet.

Output result of the above stylesheet (city_hotel.xsl) using city_hotel.xml that validate with city_hotel.xsd:  [[link to city_hotel.html]]

==Regex==
Special regular expression (regex) language can be used to construct a pattern.  The regex language in XML Schema is based on Perl’s regular expression language.  The following are some common notations:

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; bgcolor=&quot;FFFFCC&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;. (the period) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any character at all &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\d &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any digit &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\D &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any non-digit &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\w &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any word (alphanumeric) character &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\W &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any non-word character (i.e. -, +, =) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\s &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any white space (including space, tab, newline, and return) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\S &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any character that is not white space &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x* &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have zero or more x's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(xy)* &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have zero or more xy's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x+ &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;repetition of the x, at least once&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x? &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have one or zero x's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(xy)? &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;To have one or no xy's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[abc] &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to include one of a group of values &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[0-9] &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to include the range of values from 0 to 9 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x{5} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have exactly 5 x's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x{5,} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have at least 5 x's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x{5,8} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;at least 5 but at most 8 x's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(xyz){2} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have exactly 2 xyz's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; bgcolor=&quot;FFFFCC&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

For example, the pattern for validating a Social Security Number is \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}

The prior schema code has a check for &lt;b&gt;emailAddressType&lt;/b&gt; \w+\W*\w*@{1}\w+\W*\w+.\w+.*\w* &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[w+]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;at least one word (alphanumeric) character,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. answer &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[W*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by none, one or many non-word character(s),&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. -&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w*@{1}]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by any (or none) word character and one at-sign,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. my@ &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w+]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by at least one word character, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. mail&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[W*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by none, one or many non-word character(s),&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. _&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w+.]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by at least one word character and period,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. please.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w+.*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;zero to infinite times followed by the previous string,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. opentourism. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;finally followed by none, one or many word character(s)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. org&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;email-address: &lt;b&gt;answer-my@mail_please.opentourism.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The XML style sheet in Table 4-3 introduces the if statement as well as the ability to sort elements.&lt;br&gt;
The if statement executes code based on the evaluation of the condition given in the &quot;test&quot; attribute,e.g.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;xsl:if test=&quot;population &amp;amp;gt;= 10000&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Big Town&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;xsl:if test=&quot;population &amp;amp;lt; 10000&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Small Town&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Possible expressions for the condition are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;H3&gt;Operator&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;H3&gt;Meaning&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;equality of two values&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;!=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;inequality of two values&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;less than&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;greater than&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;lt;=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;less than or equal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;gt;=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;greater than or equal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;and&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;logical and-conjunction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;or&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;logical or-conjunction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Output can be sorted based on the value of the select attribute of the &lt;xsl:sort&gt; element.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting an Open Source Compiler==



With a fast internet connection, gcc &amp;mdash; a free compiler that can compile C, C++, and Fortran, as well as other languages and works on Windows &amp;mdash; can be obtained through [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]. When installing Cygwin, select to install the &quot;devel/gcc&quot; package and optionally also &quot;graphics/opengl&quot;, depending on what type of program you're planning to write. Another Windows port of the GCC compiler collection is [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)], an approximately 10MB download 1/10th the size of Cygwin. You could also download [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp DJGPP], but it is designed more for 32-bit console programs. An alternative to obtaining the gcc compiler via porting is to compile from command line within a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization virtualized] version of Linux, which not only comes with gcc, but whose kernel &quot;... is written in the version of the C programming language supported by GCC...&quot; 

=== Command Line GCC Illustration ===
To compile, open a command-line interface and use the commands:

 c:\cygwin\bin\gcc -s -Os -mno-cygwin -o &lt;outputfilename&gt; &lt;inputfilename&gt;

for command-line programs and

 c:\cygwin\bin\gcc -s -Os -mwindows -mno-cygwin -o &lt;outputfilename&gt; &lt;inputfilename&gt; -lopengl32 -lwinmm

for GUI programs.

Description of command-line flags:
* -s: makes the output program smaller by stripping out information that is useful for debugging crashed applications
* -Os: optimizes for size (-O3 for execution speed)
* -mno-cygwin: makes the program work without any external nonstandard .dll-files
* -mwindows: makes it a GUI application
* -lopengl32: optionally lets you use OpenGL for graphics
* lwinmm: optionally adds some multimedia support such as sound, joysticks, and high resolution timers

One must be in the bin directory of Cygwin in order to compile with Cygwin, whereas in Linux gcc is already aliased to work in all directories.

=== Graphical Integrated Development Environments ===

For a more user-friendly environment, like Visual Studio, an excellent open source IDE for Windows is Bloodshed's [http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html Dev-C++]. It has a well-organised Graphical User Interface, and comes with everything necessary for setting up a Windows C/C++ development environment, installing and using the Mingw port of GCC by default (though it can be configured to work in combination any other GCC-based compiler such as Cygwin). Its source (written in Delphi) is available from the Bloodshed Website, as are the pre-compiled binaries. Dev-C++ has not been updated in quite some time, though, and alternatives like [http://www.codeblocks.org Code::Blocks] or [http://codelite.org/ CodeLite] have since emerged. [http://www.netbeans.org Netbeans] is an IDE developed by Sun Microsystems as the official IDE for Java however Netbeans now supports multiple languages and is very extensible via its plugin system. Another open source IDE is [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse], which was initially developed by IBM. One more IDE, created specifically for C++, is [http://www.ultimatepp.org/ Ultimate++].

== GCC, DJGPP, MinGW and others==
These are three well-known FOSS development toolsets for compiling applications, although they function in a way slightly different to Microsoft and Borland's Windows programming tools. 

===GCC===
''GCC'' stands for the ''GNU Compiler Collection''. Although it provides support for compiling sources in several programming languages, it is most commonly used for C and C++ code. Because it is a compiler and not an IDE, approaches such as DJGPP wrap some more arcane details away from the user, easing the creation of programs, as well as providing other features, described below.

===DJGPP===
'''DJGPP''' is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by DJ Delorie since 1989. It is a DOS application with 32-bit awareness and allows the creation of software with DPMI support. As a combined port of GCC and other GNU utilities, it is commonly used to write, compile and debug console applications. It can make use of libraries such as Allegro, in order to create applications with graphics, Other add-ons extend its functionality. It has support for cross-platform development, meaning that you may create software without needing a physical instance of a target machine type or operating system in order to build the executable that will be shipped to that configuration. 

===MinGW===
'''MinGW''' stands for the ''Minimalist GNU for Windows'' and includes the needed header files for using the Win32 API; it supports creation of native Windows executables. As of late December 2006, Wikipedia defines the goal of MinGW as to &quot;provide only a free compiler and toolchain, prioritizing performance&quot;. This contrasts the Cygwin objective of creating a POSIX compliant development environment. Like DJGPP, it can be used for cross-platform development. Because MinGW is available for other systems outside of Windows (such as Linux), even developers lacking a copy of Windows can create Win32 API applications. Furthermore, PE executables (.exe files) can be run using the WINE program (which translates Windows API calls to the corresponding UNIX system functions) to get a taste of what the application will look like - without actually having to install Windows.

===Dev-C++===
Dev-C++ is a free graphical IDE that comes packaged with MinGW and can also use the Cygwin compiler.

===Other tools===
GCC, DJGPP and MinGW do not have support for graphic-oriented resource and GUI editing commonly needed for Windows programming. 

However open source libraries such as QT, GTK+ and wxWidgets provide user interface frontends as well as simplified models wrapping around the complexities of the Windows API. The minimal trade-off is that these may require special licensing and the bundling of runtime DLLs. 

== Cygwin ==
'''Cygwin''' is an environment made for Windows that emulates Unix behavior. It can be obtained from cygwin.com via a small setup.exe package that when run, asks for a selection of features that are then fetched. A fast internet connection is suggested, since Cygwin comprises many non-trivial shells, programs, and even GUIs.

The setup program allows the user to download the following parts, among others:

* Bash shell
* Development tools, with debugger, several languages supported by gcc compilers, as well as AWK, SED, YACC and Bison support
* Network tools, such as ssh, lynx web browser, nmap, and others
* Programmer text editors, such as GNU Emacs, nano and vi
* X, which is a very difficult environment to fetch for free on Windows otherwise

The software, after selected, is downloaded and installed to a folder at the root of the user's hard drive. It does not repartition the drive, require installation of any Unix system nor use a disk image. Files are simply installed in a Unix hierarchy within the cygwin folder. 

To run Cygwin, the user will have a Start Menu program or Desktop shortcut called '''Cygwin Bash Shell'''. Upon opening it, a DOS-like window opens and displays a classic bash prompt. It is color coded, unlike its DOS underpinnings, and can interact with DOS by being aware of path settings and other system variables, so be aware of the fact that your Windows applications may be located from your system path variable and conflict with a folder's current filename because of DOS's implicit EXE extension expansion.

===Directory information===

As an added detail, if you need access to different drives in your computer, instead of using '''/mnt/''', you have to cd into '''/cygdrive/''' to see your drives listed. Seeing your C: drive's root, then, is just a matter of typing cd '''/cygdrive/c''' at the command line.

===Emacs editor information===
When using Emacs, the normal key combination to exit the program has no effect, by default, though adept users will probably find an Emacs keybinding trick to overcome this issue. Thus, when you want to exit the editor from command line mode, you may end up getting tired, and suspend the program to do a later kill of the process at the command line. Instead of pressing C-x C-c, to leave emacs, you must press F10 to get the menu. Once there, press f and then e. This summons the File Menu and later its Exit option, returning to the command line and prompting for the appropriate saving when some changed files need to be committed to disk.

===Compiling without Cygwin library bindings===
Compiling with g++, as stated in a previous section, needs to include the appropriate flags. gcc will normally bind the executable code to the cygwin1.dll file, unless your gcc flags explicitly include &quot;-mno-cygwin&quot; as a switch. To solve this, you can add this and all other switches to your .bashrc file, by using a known Unix option:

Open the .bashrc file at your Cygwin home directory in any editor. Look for the lines starting with &quot;alias&quot;. There, you will see some shell commands tweaked to have specific options. Under the line containing

 alias l='ls -CF'

you may add:

 alias g++='g++ -mno-cygwin' #do not depend on cygwin1.dll on target system

In case you need to add more fine tuning tags, you may either add them to that same line after the -mno-cygwin switch, or just re-alias the g++ command so that the shell stacks up the current meaning of g++ to further tags. For example, you may add

 alias g++='g++ -Wno-deprecated' #silence deprecation talk. 

To keep the g++ compiler from reminding you about the standard practice of including &lt;string&gt; instead of the now deprecated &lt;string.h&gt; header.

===No root nor su switching===
Cygwin was created with a few differences in mind. It does not have a different root account, though it may claim files are owned by the '''Administrator''' user. Though this may be beyond the scope of the book, it is worth a line or two to say that you won't easily be able to experiment with programs that run under different user rights, because it does not seem that Cygwin tries to enforce account security. You may read any file in the OS that Windows allows Cygwin to access.

      <comment>/* Windows Kernels */ Typo fix</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==

Windows was originally a 16-bit graphical layer for MS-DOS that was written by Microsoft. As it grew, it gained the ability to handle 32-bit programs and eventually became totally 32-bit when Windows NT and 2000 came out. After Windows 95, Microsoft began to remove dependencies on DOS and finally fully implemented the separation in Windows 2000.  Windows has many advanced features as well as many platform specific problems.  It possesses an Application Programming Interface that consists of thousands of mostly undocumented GUI functions as well as having varying degrees of MS-DOS compatibility.  Additionally, with the advent of NT (New Technology), Windows relies completely on the NT kernel instead of its MS-DOS subsystem, the NT kernel is capable of emulating the necessary DOS functionality. In addition to the NT kernel, Microsoft has also introduced many API wrappers, such as the MFCs (Microsoft Foundation Classes), COM (Component Object Model), and .NET technologies.

The most popular languages for use on Windows include [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic|Visual Basic/VB6]] and [[Programming:c|C/C++]], although C++ is quickly being replaced by the [[w:.NET_Framework|.NET]] platform, specifically [[C Sharp Programming|C#]] (C Sharp).

== Windows Kernels == 

Windows 1.0, 2.0, and 3.11 are considered to be an older generation of Windows systems that were built to be a simple graphical layer over the MS-DOS operating system. Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME were designed to bypass MS-DOS (although DOS was still present), and were all based on the same code structure known as the &quot;9x Kernel&quot;. Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server are all based on a collection of code known as the &quot;NT Kernel&quot;.

== System Architecture ==

The Windows NT Kernel is divided into several sections, here we will briefly discuss how the Windows operating system is put together. At the most basic level is the file NTOSKRNL.EXE, the kernel of the Windows operating system, and the most important file on your computer. If you are interested in seeing this for yourself, you can find it in the C:\Windows\System32 folder (this can also be found using the following path %systemroot%\system32 ) on your own Windows NT machines.

NTOSKRNL.EXE provides some of the basic functionality of Windows, but one file alone cannot make the whole system work. NTOSKRNL relies heavily on a '''Dynamic Link Library''' (DLL) known as HAL.DLL. HAL stands for &quot;Hardware Abstraction Layer&quot;, and is the portion of code that allows low-level mechanisms such as interrupts and BIOS communication to be handled independently.

If we consider Windows architecture as a layered architecture, with NTOSKRNL.EXE and HAL.DLL on the bottom layer, the next layer up contains two important files, NTDLL.DLL, and WIN32K.SYS. NTDLL contains a number of user-mode functions such as system call stubs and the run-time library (RTL) code, collectively known as the (largely undocumented) &quot;Native API&quot;. Much of the run-time library code is shared between NTOSKRNL and NTDLL. WIN32K.SYS is a kernel-mode driver that implements windowing and graphics, allowing for user interfaces to be created.

The next layer up contains a number of libraries that will be of primary interest to us. This layer comprises what is called the '''Win32 API''', and it contains (almost) all the functions that a user will need in order to program in Windows. The Win32 API is divided into 4 component parts, each one a .DLL:

;kernel32.DLL: This contains most of the system-related Win32 API functions. Most of these functions are just wrappers around the lower-level NTDLL functions, but some functionality such as National Language Support (NLS) and console handling are not available in NTDLL.

;advapi32.DLL: This contains other system-related functions such as registry and service handling.

;gdi32.DLL: This contains a number of basic functions for drawing. These functions are all relatively simple, and allow the user to draw shapes (circles, rectangles, etc.) on the screen, to display and manipulate bitmaps, etc. 

;user32.DLL: This contains a number of functions that implement the familiar user-interface of Windows. Programs, message boxes, prompts, etc are all implemented using the User32 functions. User32 performs its tasks by calling system calls implemented by WIN32K.SYS.

In addition to the 4 primary libraries in the Win32 API, there are a number of other important libraries that a Windows programmer should become familiar with:

;MSVCRT.DLL: MSVCRT.DLL is the dynamic link library that contains the implementations of the C standard library ('''stdlib''') functions that C programmers should be familiar with. These are the functions defined in the common header files stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h, etc.

;WS2_32.DLL: This is the Winsock2 library, that contains the standard Berkeley socket API for communicating on the internet. We will talk about winsock programming later in this book.

== Windows Does It ==

The Windows system, it might be surprising for some people to learn, is a very hands-on system. This is not a familiar concept for people who are just beginning C programming using the standard library. In a normal software project, there is typically a main function, and the main function in turn calls other functions that are defined in your project. In a Windows function, typically the programmer provides function pointers to the system, and Windows will make calls ''into your program''. Also, in a Windows program, your code will sit idle when there is nothing to be done. Using the '''message loop architecture''', Windows will send messages to your program when an event needs to be handled, and the program responds to the messages. If the program doesn't respond, the message is ignored. 

For each program, Windows sets up a message queue structure to handle the message transmission process. Windows will maintain a listing of all the objects and system resources in use by a program, and will assign each one a '''handle'''. These handles are useless by themselves, but they can be passed to the system to reference particular objects and resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Windows Platform SDK ==

The Microsoft Windows '''Software Development Kit''' is a simple, free set of tools and libraries to create windows programs in C and C++. The SDK contains the standard windows header files, the link libraries, the compiler (cl.exe), and the linker (link.exe). The SDK is available as a free download from Microsoft.

[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&amp;displaylang=en Download the SDK]

== Visual Studio ==

Another option is [http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/ Microsoft Visual C++], a commercial IDE and is an option worth looking into for serious Windows programmers. MSVC++ is almost a de facto standard Windows programming IDE.

The best option for a beginner is Microsoft's .NET platform.  .NET developers can use [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/ Microsoft Visual Studio.NET], Borland C#Builder (discussed earlier), the [http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/ Visual Studio Express products] and [http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/ SharpDevelop].

The Visual Studio Express products are Microsoft-provided stripped down versions of Visual Studio, designed to provide an entry-level product for Windows programmers. They are currently free and in beta, but they are expected to become a low-priced commercial product once they are released.  As of this writing, Visual Studio Express supports Managed C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, and J# for Windows programming. All Visual Studio Express products use the same compilers as the commercial Visual Studio .NET.

== Borland Compiler ==

In addition, Borland has released several of its compilers for free (although still proprietary) as [http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html Borland Command Line compiler tools]. Borland requires users to log in in order to download these tools. They are quite small and fast, more so than gcc and DJGPP, and can build Windows applications with ease, especially for those accustomed with Borland tools.

Other notable downloads from Borland are [http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilderx.html C++BuilderX] and 
and [http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_csharpbuilder.html C#Builder], both with IDEs. Both products impose restrictions on your software and must not be for commercial use.

== Other Tools ==

SharpDevelop is a free and small IDE. It supports C# and partially supports Visual Basic.NET. However, you also need to obtain [http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx Microsoft's .NET SDK], which can be freely downloaded from Microsoft's site.

It's also possible to develop Windows programs in [[Forth]] (see [[w:Forth | the Forth article at Wikipedia]]) using WinForth, Win32Forth, SwiftForth, and RetroForth. Several of these can generate native Windows applications with much less bloat than C/C++.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the DDK? ==

Microsoft offers a free '''Driver Development Kit''', for people who are interested in writing device drivers, system services, and other kernel-mode code. The DDK comes with a number of different libraries, extensive documentation, link libraries, a special compiler and linker, and many examples for new driver programmers.

This book discusses the DDK in depth in throughout Section 4, but specifically in [[Windows Programming/The DDK|the chapter about the DDK]].

== Obtaining the DDK ==

The DDK is available free from microsoft, but not as a download. To obtain the DDK, you must order the software on CD, and this comes with a small shipping and handling fee. The DDK has a number of different options, and installing the DDK with every option will require a large amount of disk space.

The DDK used to be available as a download, but to conserve bandwidth, Microsoft has changed their policy to only offer the DDK as a CD. The SDK, and a number of other CDs are also available to order from Microsoft for free (plus shipping and handling), so this might be worthwhile to check out as well.

[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ddk/default.mspx Order the DDK]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Obtaining MASM ==

Many people claim that Microsoft has discontinued the use of MASM, but this is not the case. MASM is still maintained by Microsoft for use in house, and is updated on a needs basis. This means that MASM is only updated when presented with a specific need, such as the migration to 64 bits, or the migration to Vista. MASM comes as part of the standard DDK distribution (on the CD), and can also be found for download on the Internet, or can be ordered separately by contacting Microsoft sales and service at 1-800-426-9400.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Antibiotics==
Oral antibiotics are usually the first line of defence prescribed by doctors to relieve papules, pustules, inflammation and some redness. There are two families of antibiotics normally used, traditionally the tetracycline family and now macrolide families[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15562139&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus] have been proven to help treat rosacea. Antibiotics are used for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than their ability to kill micro-organisms. Generally they are prescribed in quantities too small for them to be effective at stopping the growth of micro-organisms.

The Tetracyclines family include: Aureomycin, Demeclocycline,  Doxycycline, Minocycline, Oxytetracycline and Tetracycline.

Tetracycline use should be avoided during pregnancy and in the very young (less than 6 years) because it will result in permanent staining of teeth causing an unsightly cosmetic result.

Doxycycline is commonly prescribed by medical doctors for infections and to treat acne. It may also be used to treat urinary tract infections, gum disease, and other bacterial infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Doxycycline is also used commonly as a prophylactic treatment for infection by Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). It is also effective against Yersinia pestis and malaria. At subantimicrobial doses, doxycycline is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, and has been used in various experimental systems for this purpose.

Oracea is a 40mg modified-release formulation of doxycycline that is taken once daily for the treatment of rosacea and is patented by Collagenex Pharmaceuticals. Oracea works by reducing inflammation.

Minocycline hydrochloride, also known as minocycline, is an antibiotic of the tetracycline class. It is marketed under several trade names, including Minomycin, and Dynacin. It is primarily used to treat acne.

Metronidazole can be taken orally or as a gel or cream. It is sold as MetroLotion&amp;reg;, Metrocream&amp;reg; and '''Metrogel&amp;reg;''' by Galderma Laboratories]] and as Noritate&amp;reg; by Dermik.

Metronidazole tastes very bitter, and can cause headaches. Long term or high dosage administration of metronidazole can lead to peripheral neuropathy, which often manifests itself as a tingling or numbness in the fingers or toes. Patients who experience neuropathy should stop taking the drug and immediately contact their physician. Patients taking metronidazole must avoid consuming alcohol in any form (including cough syrup), as it will react badly with the medication, leading to severe nausea and cramping. Another common side effect is the darkening of the urine. Patients should drink plenty of water to avoid constipation. Patients taking metronidazole have also reported loss of appetite and mild nausea. Forcing oneself to eat, despite lack of appetite and fatigue, may reduce the nausea.

==Clonidine==
Flushing and blushing can be reduced with a centrally-acting alpha-2 agonist Clonidine. Clonidine has side effects of drowsiness and lowered blood pressure. Moxonidine can be used as an alternative to Clonidine as it has less side effects but most people find Clonidine more effective. Beta-Blockers like Propanol are similar to alpha-2 agonists and work better for anxiety and chronic social blushing. More information about Clonidine can be found at the following page (http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/sadhelp/clonidine.htm).

==Beta blockers==
Beta blockers or beta-adrenergic blocking agents are a class of drugs used to treat a variety of cardiovascular conditions and some other diseases.

There are two types of beta receptors: &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptors located mainly in the heart, and &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-receptors located all over the body, but mainly in the lungs, muscles and arterioles.

Drugs that block beta 2 receptors generally have a relaxing effect and are prescribed for anxiety, migraine, esophageal varices and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, among others. Many beta blockers affect both type 1 and type 2 receptors; these are termed ''non-selective'' blockers. Some non-cardio selective beta blockers are Nadolol, Oxprenolol, Propranolol, Pindolol and Sotalol.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker Wikipedia] - Full Beta blocker article
*[http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/rosacea-support/message/9717 Rosacea Support archives msg:9717] - A patient talks about their experiences with taking atenolol.

==Isotretinoin==
Isotretinoin is a powerful medication normally used for the treatment of acne but in low dosage can be used to treat rosacea. It is a retinoid, meaning it is derived from Vitamin A and is found naturally in the body, produced by the liver in small quantities. Isotretinoin is sold under many brand names, including '''Accutane&amp;reg;''' and '''Roaccutane&amp;reg;''' by Roche. It is also marketed as '''Accure&amp;reg;''' (Alphapharm), '''Oratane&amp;reg;''' (Douglas Pharmaceuticals), '''Isohexal&amp;reg;''' (Hexal Australia), '''Amnesteem&amp;reg;''' (Bertek) and '''Claravis&amp;reg;''' (Barr).

Isotretinoin is effective at treating rosacea but because of the many side effects it is normally prescribed after other treatments such as antibiotics have been tried. Isotretinoin is typically prescribed at between 0.5 mg/kg/day to 2.0 mg/kg/day for severe acne. For rosacea it is normally prescribed at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day to 1.0 mg/kg/day or lower.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intense Pulsed Light (IPL)==
[[File:Lumenis_One_IPL.JPG|thumb|210px|IPL handpiece on a Lumenis One]]

Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) is a treatment where a broad spectrum of light is applied to the skin. IPL differs to dermatological lasers in that they emit a large spectrum of light while lasers emit a single wavelength, but in practice they are quite similar. IPL machines are expensive and the treatments are normally only available from dermatologists and beauty salons. Using different settings IPL machines can be used for treating vascular lesions, fine wrinkles and also for hair removal. For vascular treatments the goal is to destroy blood vessels in the inner layers of the skin by heating them to 70&amp;nbsp;°C. Although blood vessels are targeted, the light energy is also absorbed by other structures in the skin such as melanin (pigment for skin and hair) and water. IPL has only been around since 1995 and new research to maximise effectiveness while reducing side effects and new technologies and procedures are still being developed. 

=== IPL Machine ===
IPL machines are powered using a xenon flash lamp. Xenon, which is also used for camera flashes produces a flat spectrum of light from 400nm to 1200nm when excited with electricity. Different filters can be used to filter out lower wavelengths depending on the treatment performed. The size of the glass prism (spot size) varies between machines but at ~4.5x1cm they are much larger than typical lasers at ~1cm circle. A light pulse can be triggered by the operator using the hand piece. There is a delay between pulses while the capacitors recharge and the flash lamp cools down.

=== Settings ===
* ''Wavelength or Filter:'' A Xenon flash lamp produces a wavelength from 400nm to 1200nm. For vascular/rosacea treatments the light is filtered generally at the lower end. A 590nm filter would reduce the wavelength from 400-1200nm to 590-1200nm. Lower wavelengths penetrate lower and higher wavelengths penetrate more deeply into the skin.
* ''Fluence or energy level:'' The amount of energy applies over the whole pulse generally ranges from 20-60 joules per square centimetre (J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and may be spread over a series of short pulses. A joule is equal to 1 W·s (watt second).
* ''Pulse width:'' The duration of each pulse. Can be a single pulse or three short pulses.
* ''Repetition rate:'' The delay between the short pulses.
For the Matrix system of Medical Assist the settings are:
380nm-1800nm / upto 15 pulses times two. maximum 80 joules per square centimeter. This is the most powerfull IPL system in the world with the best effect. The machines are available in two different types, the first is a salon equipment and the other is a hospital use. Both are very reliable machines with high quality.

=== How it works ===
Selective photothermolysis. The absorption of haemoglobin is significantly higher than the absorption by melanin the skins natural pigment. The haemoglobin absorb the light heating up causing the blood vessel walls to heat up causing coagulation of the blood vessels which are eventually reabsorbed by the body and replaced by scar tissue. Their are two systems. The first one is a ELOS system, which is working only for 70% for black or dark hair with a white skin. It wont work for blond, red or grey hair. Also it is not safe to use on dark skin. The second system is a Matrix system from Medical Assist. This system works on a thin part of the hair follicle which is effective for all colours of hair and is safe for every type of skin.

=== Cost ===
Generally treatments are sold as single treatments or as discounted packages of five treatments with a period of 3-4 weeks or 6 weeks with the Matrix system, between each treatment. Prices per treatment are usually between US$300-700 (€230-500) but can vary depending on country, IPL machine type and the qualifications and skill of the operator.

=== Treatment procedure ===
Topical anaesthesia can be applied 10-30 minutes before the treatment. Eye protection is generally worn by the patient and the operator. The operator selects the settings based on the skin type and similar characterisitcs and proceeds with the treatment. Each pulse of the IPL feels like having a rubber band snapped against the face. The skin will be redder and painful after the treatment and improves over the day continues to improve for months after the treatment. Newer procedures include pre flushing using a heating pad on the back of the neck and macrolide antibiotics because of their anti-angiogenesis properties which stop the regrowth of blood vessels shortly after treatments. &lt;ref name=&quot;triple_pass&quot;&gt;Dr. Geoffrey Nase, PhD. ''Latest Advances: Triple-pass laser tx.'' Dermatology Times, 1 March 2005 Issue. [http://www.drnase.com/rosacea_photoderm.htm Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risks/parameters that affect outcome ===
* For men if the area of facial hair growth is treated then it could result in temporary stunted hair growth and possible hair loss.
* If the patient has dark skin or has a tan or sunburn then this will reduce the effectiveness of the treatment, this is not for the Matrix system from Medical Asist which can treat all skin types and skin colors.
* If the operator presses too hard with the handpiece on your skin, the effectiveness of the treatment will be reduced because the blood will be pushed out of the area being treated.
* If the energy levels are too high then purpura or bruising can result. Purpura is the appearance of purple discolourations on the skin caused by bleeding underneath the skin. Purpura can last up to 2 weeks.
* Blisters
* Alcohol, isotretinoin

=== Effectiveness ===
{{sect-stub}}
In a study of 63 patents with telangiectasia owing to rosacea that were treated with IPL concluded that IPL is an effective tool in achieving meaningful and lasting rosacea clearance. The study found a mean clearance of 77.8% was achieved and was maintained for a follow-up period averaging 51.6 months (range 12-99 months).&lt;ref&gt;Schroeter CA, Haaf-von Below S, Neumann HA. ''Effective treatment of rosacea using intense pulsed light systems.'' Dermatol Surg. 2005 Oct;31(10):1285-9. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16188180&amp;query_hl=2 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

Another study was performed in order to detect the effect of IPL application with simultaneous topical antibiotics in inflammatory rosacea and to assess the efficacy of IPL therapy in routine treatment of rosacea.
Twenty patients aged between 34 and 70 with papulopustular rosacea (14 female and 7 male) were included in the study. Ten patients (group I) were treated for 21 weeks with topical metronidazole. The other ten patients (group II) received an additional 3 sessions with IPL 515-755 nm Photoderm VL technology over 4 weeks. Treatment effectiveness was recorded by digital visualisation and patient satisfaction scale before each IPL session.
In all patients, significant reductions in papulopustular elements were observed. Eight out of 10 patients (group I) still showed permanent erythema and telangiectasias despite topical treatment. In 3/10 patients a few telangiectasias remained following the treatment in contrast to 5/10 satisfied group I patients. MD Ferdinand Bisselink did a study on 116 patients for the treatment rosacea and found out that 103 from the 116 patients see that there whas a reduction of more as 70% after four treatments with the Medical Assist Matrix IPL system.

=== Trademarks and procedures ===
* Photoderm®: ESC Medical (now Lumenis) first introduced IPL machines for dermatological use in 1995. The Photoderm VL machine for vascular lesions was among the line-up and the treatments were often marketed as &quot;Photoderm&quot;.
* Photofacial™: A trade secret procedure developed by Dr. Patrick Bitter Sr. M.D. and Dr. Patrick Bitter Jr, who train IPL operators in their protocols for a fee.
* FotoFacial™: Dr. Patrick Bitter Jr later developed the Fotofacial protocol and the FotofacialRF using Syneron ELOS technology.
* Photorejuvenation is not trademarked.
* Intens Pulsed Light Matrix system is developed by Medical Assist (medicalassist@hotmail.com)

== Laser ==
[[File:Dermatological_laser.JPG|thumb|200px|Dermatological laser]]
Dermatological Lasers can be used to treat rosacea and work by applying a high energy single wavelength beam to the skin to target blood vessels. This heats them up, damaging them and they are then removed by the body's defence mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are still many insurance companies that refuse to cover Laser/IPL treatments because they view rosacea as a &quot;cosmetic concern&quot;. Here are some simple steps taken by previous rosacea sufferers to get insurance to reimburse both fully or partly.

Ring up your insurer and ask if it will be covered.  Even if your insurance company will cover the procedures, they usually require pre-certification outlining the number of treatments and type of laser. Prepare a submission outlying your rosacea symptoms and how they affect and limit your lifestyle. Get photos of your severe flushing so the insurance company can see what you are really dealing with. Include peer-reviewed articles photocopied from books or medical journals or printed from the Internet.

The following symptoms are viewed as cosmetic (less important): Papules, pustles, redness and visible telangiectasias. The following are not cosmetic (more important): Flushing, blushing, burning, itching, facial swelling and pain.

Other major points to include:
*A letter of medical necessity from a physician in your plan including the CPT code for the procedure.  (It was 17108 in 2003)
*A list of all other remedies you have tried (antibiotics, prescription topicals, diet and lifestyle changes, etc)
*In your letter explain that when lasers are used for cosmetic purposes the settings are different than when treating rosacea.  
*As of 2004 many Laser/IPL machines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/k030527.pdf Lumenis 510(k) submission]. URL accessed on 23 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;.

*If it is not treated it will progress into more advances stages
*You may be able to stop taking current rosacea medications after the Laser/IPL treatments

Be persistent.  Fax your request and then send it with signature verification of the recipient.  Call in a few days to confirm receipt, find out when the review committee will be meeting, follow up the day after that and keep on top of your request.  Document the names and dates of people you speak with, it may be beneficial if you need to appeal a rejection. If your claim is rejected, ask why your claim was rejected then refute those claims with evidence. Ask at one of the online support groups for help if you need it.

==Sample Letter==

Below is a sample letter that was used by Adam to convince his insurance company to provide full coverage.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear Committee Members:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My name is Adam. I am 19 years old. Dr. xxxxxx xxxxxxxx , M.D., my dermatologist, submitted
a request for Photoderm device coverage to alleviate my disabling rosacea. Dr. xxxxxx's request
on my behalf was denied based on your determination that this procedure would be a cosmetic
one. I believe you have made a mistake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


I have a tentative appointment set up to have my first Photoderm treatment on December 6, 2001
at Dr. xxxxxx's (different doc, this is the one who im actually getting the procedures done
by) Office based on your decision after reading this letter. I am not doing this for cosmetic
reasons - I am doing this for reasons that are medically necessary. My Rosacea is accompanied
by severe flushing, swelling, inflammation, and worst of all a disabling burning pain. My condition
is worsened by almost everything imaginable. Most foods, sun exposure, hot weather, warm rooms,
cold weather, wind, humidity, exercise, embarrassment, anger, mental concentration, stress,
facial movements such as chewing and smiling, certain medications, most topicals, lotions,
sunscreens, soaps, cleansers, showering, shaving, daily physical activities (walking up a flight
of stairs), cuddling up with someone, my head touching my pillow, and the heat from talking
on the phone, are just SOME of the things that I run into each and every day that cause my
facial pain to get substantially worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


I have tried numerous creams, lotions and oral medications in an effort to alleviate the severe
discomfort caused by my facial rosacea. The cost before insurance of all the prescription medications
I have used in connection with my condition since the beginning of this calendar year totals
over $2,500. In recent weeks I have begun experimenting with different antihistamines in an
attempt to reduce the swelling, inflammation, and pain associated with the majority of foods
I eat. This has not helped much, and I will soon be looking into adding a Cox-2 inhibitor such
as Celebrex into my daily regimen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The physical pain I live with every day, which is worsened by almost any movement I make, has
become extremely debilitating. This disabling pain has caused me to become very depressed.
My condition impairs my ability to function normally in society. I am unable to work, and have
come close to dropping out of school more than once. I need to be able to get rid of the pain
I live with every day so that I will be able to function normally once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



This condition continues to be extremely costly for all parties involved. The insurance portion
alone of the payment for the Psychiatrist I have begun seeing as a result of the depression
this pain causes me, is $160 every month. Additional costs include doctor and dermatologist
visits that I have needed as a result of my condition. In addition, I have already gone through
one month of outpatient hospitalization at a substantial cost, because of the depression my
Rosacea has caused me. By eliminating the need for most of these, five to ten treatments with
Photoderm (which would cost a total of $1200-$1950) would be substantially less expensive than
my current course of therapy has been. Payment for these five to ten treatments would be an
extreme hardship for me, as my condition leaves me unable to seek employment. I have also begun
to develop early-stage Rhynophymia as a direct result of my Rosacea, which if left untreated
may eventually require an even more costly medically necessary surgery. Photoderm will prevent
this aspect of my condition from getting worse, eliminating the possible need for more costly
surgery in the future. It is important to remember that Rosacea is a progressive disease. Every
symptom I have mentioned will more than likely continue to become more and more debilitating
in the future without proper treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



My condition and the constant, debilitating pain it causes has left me unable to work. Since
developing this condition I have been unable to maintain a steady job. The pain caused by simply
placing my face against my pillow at night has left me unable to sleep properly. I usually
am finally able to fall asleep around 4 A.M. with the help of powerful prescription sleep aids
such as Ambien. Basically, my condition has left me unable to live a normal life. As you may
or may not know, Photoderm has many different settings associated with it. The shallow filters
are used to remove superficial, cosmetic redness from a person's skin. These are used for many
cosmetic procedures. The deeper filters, which the doctor who would be performing the procedure
has assured me will be used almost exclusively in my treatment, can be used to treat the underlying
vascular reactivity, permanently decreasing my facial swelling, inflammation, and burning.
This is why I require treatment with Photoderm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



I am asking you to please reconsider your decision. I am not having these treatments done for
cosmetic reasons. I am having these treatments done because nothing else has worked. In my
case, this is anything BUT a cosmetic problem. I have submitted supporting documentation from
Dr. xxxxxx (my derm) with my request that you reconsider your original determination. Thank
you for your review.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Netwide Assembler is an x86 and x86-64 assembler that uses syntax similar to Intel. It supports a variety of object file formats, including:

#ELF32/64
#Linux a.out
#NetBSD/FreeBSD a.out
#MS-DOS 16-bit/32-bit object files
#Win32/64 object files
#COFF
#Mach-O 32/64
#rdf

NASM runs on both Unix and Windows/DOS.

== NASM Syntax ==

{{Wikipedia|Netwide Assembler}}

The Netwide Assembler (NASM) uses a syntax &quot;designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less complex&quot;. This means that the operand order is '''dest''' then '''src''', as opposed to the AT&amp;T style used by the GNU Assembler. For example,

 mov ax, 9

loads the number 9 into register ax.

For those using gdb with nasm, you can set gdb to use Intel-style disassembly by issuing the command:

 set disassembly-flavor intel

=== Comments ===

A single semi-colon is used for comments, and functions the same as double slash in C++: the compiler ignores from the semicolon to the next newline.

=== Macros ===

NASM has powerful macro functions, similar to C's preprocessor. For example,
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
%define newline 0xA
%define func(a, b) ((a) * (b) + 2)

func (1, 22) ; expands to ((1) * (22) + 2)

%defmacro print 1 ; macro with one argument
  push dword %1 ; %1 means first argument
  call printf
  add  esp, 4
%endmacro

print mystring ; will call printf
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example I/O (Linux and BSD) ==

To pass the kernel a simple input command on Linux, you would pass values to the following registers and then send the kernel an interrupt signal. To read in a single character from standard input (such as from a user at their keyboard), do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; read a byte from stdin
mov eax, 3		 ; 3 is recognized by the system as meaning &quot;read&quot;
mov ebx, 0		 ; read from standard input
mov ecx, variable    ; address to pass to
mov edx, 1		 ; input length (one byte)
int 0x80             ; call the kernel
&lt;/source&gt;

After the &lt;code&gt;int 0x80&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; will contain the number of bytes read. If this number is &lt; 0, there was a read error of some sort.

Outputting follows a similar convention:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; print a byte to stdout
mov eax, 4           ; the system interprets 4 as &quot;write&quot;
mov ebx, 1           ; standard output (print to terminal)
mov ecx, variable    ; pointer to the value being passed
mov edx, 1           ; length of output (in bytes)
int 0x80             ; call the kernel
&lt;/source&gt;

BSD systems (MacOS X included) use similar system calls, but convention to execute them is different. While on Linux you pass system call arguments in different registers, on BSD systems they are pushed onto stack (except the system call number, which is put into eax, the same way as in Linux). BSD version of the code above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; read a byte from stdin
mov eax, 3		; sys_read system call
push dword 1		; input length
push dword variable	; address to pass to
push dword 0		; read from standard input
push eax
int 0x80		; call the kernel
add esp, 16		; move back the stack pointer

; write a byte to stdout
mov eax, 4		; sys_write system call
push dword 1		; output length
push dword variable	; memory address
push dword 1		; write to standard output
push eax
int 0x80		; call the kernel
add esp, 16		; move back the stack pointer

; quit the program
mov eax, 1		; sys_exit system call
push dword 0		; program return value
push eax
int 0x80		; call the kernel
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello World (Linux) ==

Below we have a simple Hello world example, it lays out the basic structure of a nasm program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _start

section .data
        ; Align to the nearest 2 byte boundary, must be a power of two
        align 2
        ; String, which is just a collection of bytes, 0xA is newline
        str:     db 'Hello, world!',0xA
        strLen:  equ $-str

section .bss

section .text

&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -f elf32 -g helloWorld.asm
$ ld -g helloWorld.o
$ ./a.out
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello World (Using only Win32 system calls) ==

In this example we are going to rewrite the hello world example using Win32 system calls. There are several major differences:

#The intermediate file will be a Microsoft Win32 (i386) object file
#We will avoid using interrupts since they may not be portable and therefore we need to bring in several calls from kernel32 DLL


&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _start

extern _GetStdHandle@4
extern _WriteConsoleA@20
extern _ExitProcess@4

section .data
        str:     db 'hello, world',0xA
        strLen:  equ $-str

section .bss
        numCharsWritten:        resb 1

section .text
        _start:

        ;
        ; HANDLE WINAPI GetStdHandle( _In_  DWORD nStdHandle ) ;
        ;
        push    dword -11       ; Arg1: request handle for standard output
        call    _GetStdHandle@4 ; Result: in eax

        ;
        ; BOOL WINAPI WriteConsole(
        ;       _In_        HANDLE hConsoleOutput,
        ;       _In_        const VOID *lpBuffer,
        ;       _In_        DWORD nNumberOfCharsToWrite,
        ;       _Out_       LPDWORD lpNumberOfCharsWritten,
        ;       _Reserved_  LPVOID lpReserved ) ;
        ;
        push    dword 0         ; Arg5: Unused so just use zero
        push    numCharsWritten ; Arg4: push pointer to numCharsWritten
        push    dword strLen    ; Arg3: push length of output string
        push    str             ; Arg2: push pointer to output string
        push    eax             ; Arg1: push handle returned from _GetStdHandle
        call    _WriteConsoleA@20


        ;
        ; VOID WINAPI ExitProcess( _In_  UINT uExitCode ) ;
        ;
        push    dword 0         ; Arg1: push exit code
        call    _ExitProcess@4
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following. This example was run under cygwin, in a Windows command prompt the link step would be different. In this example we use the &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; command line option when invoking &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; to specify the entry point for program execution. Otherwise we would have to use &lt;code&gt;_WinMain@16&lt;/code&gt; as the entry point rather than &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt;. One last note, &lt;code&gt;WriteConsole()&lt;/code&gt; does not behave well within a cygwin console, so in order to see output the final exe should be run within a Windows command prompt:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -f win32 -g helloWorldWin32.asm
$ ld -e _start helloWorldwin32.obj -lkernel32 -o helloWorldWin32.exe
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello World (Using C libraries and Linking with gcc) ==

In this example we will rewrite Hello World to use &lt;code&gt;printf(3)&lt;/code&gt; from the C library and link using &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;. This has the advantage that going from Linux to Windows requires minimal source code changes and a slightly different assemble and link steps. In the Windows world this has the additional benefit that the linking step will be the same in the Windows command prompt and cygwin. There are several major changes:

#The &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello, world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; string now becomes the format string for &lt;code&gt;printf(3)&lt;/code&gt; and therefore needs to be null terminated. This also means we do not need to explicitly specify it's length anymore.
#gcc expects the entry point for execution to be main
#Microsoft will prefix functions using the &lt;code&gt;cdecl&lt;/code&gt; calling convention with a underscore. So &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; will become &lt;code&gt;_main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_printf&lt;/code&gt; respectively in the Windows development environment.


&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global main

extern printf

section .data
        fmtStr:  db 'hello, world',0xA,0

section .text
        main:

        sub     esp, 4          ; Allocate space on the stack for one 4 byte parameter

        lea     eax, [fmtStr]
        mov     [esp], eax      ; Arg1: pointer to format string
        call    printf         ; Call printf(3):
                                ;       int printf(const char *format, ...);

        add     esp, 4          ; Pop stack once

        ret
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -felf32 helloWorldgcc.asm
$ gcc helloWorldgcc.o -o helloWorldgcc
&lt;/source&gt;

The Windows version with prefixed underscores:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _main

extern _printf                ; Uncomment under Windows

section .data
        fmtStr:  db 'hello, world',0xA,0

section .text
        _main:

        sub     esp, 4          ; Allocate space on the stack for one 4 byte parameter

        lea     eax, [fmtStr]
        mov     [esp], eax      ; Arg1: pointer to format string
        call    _printf         ; Call printf(3):
                                ;       int printf(const char *format, ...);

        add     esp, 4          ; Pop stack once

        ret

&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prior to beginning any new rosacea treatment, one needs to prepare the skin, and allow the skin to heal from the effects of previous treatments, which may have left the skin damaged or overly sensitive. We often hear people tell us that the rosacea treatments they had been using left their skin so sensitive that “even water hurts their skin” which can be very true. If one then uses a harsh acidic or invading rosacea treatment such as laser, skin rejuvenation or anti-wrinkle treatment, or retinoids, then obviously the rosacea sufferer is going further down the wrong rosacea treatment pathway.

So many times rosacea or the worsening of rosacea from a mild stage to a more severe stage is the result of treatments that we have used in the past or are currently using. Use of acne treatments containing ingredients such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide cause increased redness to the facial skin; often we overuse these products because we feel they are not working. For instance you have more pimples so you use more of the acne treatment. When you do this, the skin reacts by trying to form a barrier of more oil to protect itself from the harmful effects of the offending treatment. So you tend to use more to counteract this effect and in doing so the pores tighten and close resulting in clogged pores, pimples and papules.

While coping with Rosacea, a way to successful skin care is to avoid doing anything to irritate your skin which may cause a flare up and worsen the condition. Anything that makes your skin (more)red is just worsening the problem. 
When selecting a skin care regimen, it is important to avoid ingredients that may irritate the skin. Alcohol, alpha-hydroxys, glycolic acid, should generally be avoided. Additionally, exfoliation should be avoided, particularly in affected areas. 
The key to managing skin with Rosacea is recognizing that the skin is suffering an inflammatory response.

Rosacea is very often associated with sun exposure, so protection of the skin with sunscreens is important.

==Cleansing==
Experts agree that a gentle cleansing regime is very important. Avoiding chemicals that aggravate the rosacea, but will clean and moisturise the skin is a step in the right direction. Routine everyday care of skin is an essential part of optimal patient management. Common problems such as xerosis, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, acne, rosacea, and photodamage leave the skin vulnerable to external insults, partly as a result of varying levels of barrier dysfunction. Cosmetic surgery procedures also typically damage the stratum corneum (SC) and leave skin with a very weak barrier during recovery phase. Cleansing is an important aspect of any skin care, since it not only removes unwanted dirt, soil, and bacteria from skin, but also removes dead surface cells, preparing skin to better absorb topically applied drugs/medication. Care must be taken to minimize any further weakening of the SC barrier during cleansing. Cleansers based on mild synthetic surfactants and/or emollients that cause minimal barrier perturbation are ideal for these patients.

Absolutely no way should harsh cleansers and toners be used. The natural oils on the skin must be regulated to allow the skin to form it’s own defenses against any harmful bacteria or environmental distress.
Stick with mild cleansers targeted at sensitive skin. Cetaphil is one of the mildest cleansers out there and an ideal choice for delicate, irritable skin. Avoid cleansers that are heavily perfumed or contain detergents, alcohol, or other known irritants. Just because a cleanser says it provides &quot;mild cleansing&quot; doesn't mean it will be kind to rosacea skin. When looking for a cleanser, look for &quot;Sensitive Skin Tested&quot; on the label. The bottom line: If it stings, don't use it. It's as simple as that. Return it, throw it out, or give it away and start again.

After using the cleaner, the face will be rinsed with plentifulness of water and smudge with a soft towel in order not to irritate your skin. Because the skin touched of rosacea is very dry, you should avoid using coppices or rough towels to rub your face skin. When washing your face you should utilise lukewarm water instead of hot water.

==Basic Skin Care==
Never rub the skin. This can be difficult rule to follow, particularly when applying makeup, shave, or dry the skin after cleansing, but it is important. All these activities should be done in a way that does not move the skin. Use a very light touch at all times. An alternative to using a cleanser is to use a warm water rinse. Let your skin air dry as much as possible, and if needed blot very lightly with a soft towel. 

Use a moisturizer free of fragrance, dyes, and other known irritants. As with washing and  drying, do not rub the product into your skin. Rub the product between your hands before applying very gently and use more product than may seem needed, as this will prevent friction, If you find it easier, simply blot the moisturizer onto your skin after you have rubbed it onto your hands. Any extra product can be removed by placing a tissue over your face and neck and blotting it off. Lay it flat and lightly press and peel off. This method should be used by those who wear a foundation to cover redness. Also of course, pay attention to ingredients in your makeup as well. 

==Sunscreen==
An unexpected day out at the beach or a sport game in the back yard in the searing heat will leave a rosacea sufferer red all over. The heat from the sunlight can cause flushing and the sunburn cause extra redness. Even when not out in the sun wearing a sunscreen is reccommended.

UV light is of a shorter wavelenght than visible light and is subdivided into three bands UVA, UVB and UVC. UVA light penetrates deeply and contributes to ageing, UVB causes burning and redness. Very little UVC light makes it past the atmosphere.

The SPF (sun protection factor) of a sunscreen is a laboratory measure of its effectiveness against UVB light that causes sunburn. SPF 15 means that a user can nominally remain in the sun 15 times longer than would otherwise cause them to have sunburn, but this varies with a number of factors. The SPF is not a linear measure of the amount of Ultraviolet blocked. A sunscreen rated 15 blocks 93.3% of UV, and an SPF 30 sunscreen blocks 96.7%. The SPF does not measure a sunscreens effectiveness agaings UVA light.

Sunlight was identified as the most common trigger by a survey by the national rosacea society. In many studies it has been found beneficial for rosacea patients to use sunscreen everyday to reduce their symptoms. Sunscreen is also highily reccommended for patients taking treatments that cause photo sensitivity such as various antibiotics and isotretoin.

Find a broad sprectrum sunscreen preferably with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the main active ingredient that is also noncomedogenic and nonirritating skin. zinc oxide and titanium dioxide both block UV light instead of absorb then like most sunscreens. They also work immediately after application while other sunscreens need to be applied 30 minutes beforehand.

It is important to have sun protection while in the sun, but it is also important to use a sunscreen that will not cause irritation. Select a sunscreen target towarde those for rosacea or sunscreens that have good reviews by rosaceans.

==Shaving==
Shaving will always cause some irritation but it can be minimised.

Get a good rotary head electric razor, a wet/dry one if possible so you can use it in the shower.
You can use a shaving lotion to allow the shaver to glide easily over your face. Recommended lotions are jojoba oil, an aloe-based shaving cream or Edge Gel for Sensitive skin. Don't use anything with alcohol in it.
You can shave before bed time, in the shower or after having a shower.
Shave with light, short strokes in the direction of hair growth. Shaving with the grain helps prevent ingrown hairs, razor burn, and cuts. Instead of shaving against the grain to get a close shave, shave twice.
If you use a blade, make sure that your face is coated with a thin stream of hot water before applying shaving cream. Give the cream a few minutes to settle in. Use a sharp razor that has a double blade attached to it. Take your time and rinse with cold water, not hot. Allowing the steam of a shower or hot towel to soften the follicles of a tough beard can be a better preparation.

Do not forget to shave gently and shaving too frequent shaving will irritate skin.

==Concealers and makeup==
Both men and women can benefit from the vast range of rosacea friendly makeup products. Give yourself the edge by testing the impact that correctly applied makeup can have. We hope that in reading this, you're armed with the information you need to make this a success. 

Make yourself familiar with ingredients which may aggravate or irritate rosacea skin. Some find that they are only able to use mineral makeup. Ingredients to various brands of mineral makeup can be found at the Mineral Powder Foundation Ingredients List website (http://people.delphiforums.com/tracikenyon/IngredList22405.html).         
Many of the main stream commercial brands may include ingredients that may irritate. Sometimes the only way to know is to try so it's a good idea to do a bit of research in regards to ingredients. Lots of great brand name foundations out there though. No one product will work for everyone!
If you wanted a more sheer look, find a liquid foundation that matches your skin tone and doesn't irritate and mix a few drops into your daily moisturiser. It will give sheer coverage, natural and it may be all you need. Lighter, oil free foundations are better for those with oily skin, and more emollient products are better for dry skin.

Always go for a foundation with a yellow base. Some opt for a green makeup base or primer. Some use concealers with a green tint. For the most part, this is just an added step, with more products now on your skin. Most people find that once they find the appropriate foundation, using green based products isn't necessary.

===Application===
Open your mouth when applying foundation to expose the neck area and eliminate an obvious line at the jaw line. When testing, apply a sample to the jawline and then go outside with a small mirror. If you can't see where the foundation is, then you've got the right colour. 

Buy 2 different shades of the same foundation, one lighter and one darker, so that as the seasons change you can mix the colours to accommodate any changes in your natural skin colour. Some find that this is not necessary.

As far as application, always apply your makeup in natural daylight. And for novices, spend time at how perfecting application. 
Always start with less as it is easier to add more as you go along if needed. Put a little foundation on the hand (add a complimentary tone if necessary). Dot it over the face-on the nose, the cheeks, the chin and the temples and in between the brows. Using the tips of two fingers or a small clean, dampened sponge(from which excess water has been removed) blend the foundation. Always work from the face outwards, to avoid an accumulation of the foundation around the hairline-move from the cheeks to the ears, from between the brows down over the nose, from the chin out towards the jaw, then onto the neck. Work quickly, carefully and lightly. Blend well around the hairline, on the neck, below the eyes and behind the ears. Also take the foundation over the eyelids. Finally blot the face with a clean dry tissue, pressing it lightly over the skin. Apply a little powder to set the foundation if necessary. Go lightly the first time and go back to focus on certain areas the second time. Try to make everything look better, not look perfect. Whatever isn't covered by your first application/subsequent spot treating (very light spot treating) you might want to just leave alone. It has to match exactly. Even if you get &quot;Wow, this is nearly invisible&quot;, try to see if you can get to the point where you say &quot;Wow, this is invisible.&quot; It's absolutely critical it matches. If you try something and for whatever reason this brand doesn't offer you a good enough match, don't buy it just because. Try a different brand, first. When testing, apply a sample to the jawline and then go outside with a small mirror. If you can't see where the foundation is, then you've got the right colour. But, don't judge your match in blinding sunlight, this light will &quot;blend&quot; almost anything seamlessly and will not be accurate.

===Extra bit For Men===
Although the above information applies to everyone, I figured I'd touch on this subject further.
Don't gravitate to products that say &quot;For Men&quot; on them. The color selections are almost always horrible and they are either too expensive or lacking in formulation. Or both. In short: The men who want to buy this stuff have already bought it and don't care if something is designated &quot;For Men.&quot; The difference is in the packaging.
&quot;For Men&quot; is for the men with fragile egos. Stick with bigger brands, they have more color selection, better formulations, you name it. MAC, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Armani, Becca, etc. 
You can do some browsing online for products you might want to try but just jot down the names of the products, don't bother remembering the name of the color. They're usually far off base in person. If going to a counter makes you uncomfortable, you might want to go in the morning when there are less people. Remember: You're not the only guy they've done this for!
Sometimes sales associates will try to sell you things you don't need, so in case you didn't already know: you don't need primer, you don't need seperate cleansers, etc. While you're learning, sponges and brushes are not necessary. Tell them you'll stick to using your fingers for now. (Unless of course you want to buy them.) Ask them for samples! Even if they have to put them in a little jar or something. Most if not all counters/stores do this. Keep in mind you will need a cleanser that is able to remove makeup. Lastly, if you're going to worry all the time that you have makeup on, always running to the mirror, being self conscious, etc, it defeats the purpose of wearing it. Don't feel forced into this. This should be something to help you feel better about yourself. Not worse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In '''Windows''' (and most modern operating systems), there is a distinction between code that is running in &quot;user mode&quot;, and code that is running in &quot;kernel mode&quot;. This chapter is going to point out some of the differences. Firstly, Intel CPUs have modes of operation called ''rings'' which specify the type of instructions and memory available to the running code. There are four rings:

* ''Ring 0'' (also known as ''kernel mode'') has full access to every resource. It is the mode in which the Windows kernel runs.
* Rings 1 and 2 can be customized with levels of access but are generally unused unless there are virtual machines running.
* ''Ring 3'' (also known as ''user mode'') has restricted access to resources.

The reason for this is because if all programs ran in kernel mode, they would be able to overwrite each others' memory and possibly bring down the entire system when they crashed.

== Virtual Memory ==
[[File:VirtualMem01.png|thumb|The program thinks it has a large range of contiguous addresses; but in reality the parts it is currently using are scattered around RAM, and the inactive parts are saved in a disk file.]]

When a program is started (e.g. a web browser or a word processor), it runs in its own ''process''. A process contains its own &quot;virtual&quot; memory space and resources. Its memory is &quot;virtual&quot; because the process thinks memory is at address &lt;code&gt;0x12345678&lt;/code&gt; may actually be at address &lt;code&gt;0x65f7a678&lt;/code&gt; in physical memory. Similarly, two different processes may have different data stored at (to them) &lt;code&gt;0x00401000&lt;/code&gt;. This is implemented by dividing memory into chunks called ''pages''; on x86 systems one page is 4 kilobytes in size. Each page can have its own set of attributes, such as read-only/read-write. The CPU has a transparent mechanism for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses through a ''page table'' which the operating system sets up.

Virtual memory is useful for many reasons:

# The process cannot access other process' memory,
# Each page can have different protection settings (read-only or read-write, kernel-mode-only), and
# Inactive memory regions of the process can be &quot;paged out&quot; (stored) to the ''pagefile'' and be retrieved by the operating system when needed. This is also done when the system is low on physical memory.

== User Mode ==
Every process started by Windows (with the exception of the ''System'' &quot;process&quot;) runs in user mode. In this mode, programs cannot modify paging directly and so have no way of accessing other programs' memory except through API functions. Programs in user mode also cannot interfere with interrupts and context switching.

== Kernel Mode, Interrupts, and System Calls ==
When Windows is first loaded, the Windows kernel is started. It runs in kernel mode and sets up paging and virtual memory. It then creates some system processes and allows them to run in user mode. How does the CPU ever switch back to kernel mode then? This is not done automatically by the CPU. The CPU is often interrupted by certain events (timers, keyboard, hard disk I/O), and these are called ''interrupts''. The kernel must first set up ''interrupt handlers'' to deal with these events. Then, whenever interrupts occur, the CPU stops executing the currently running program, immediately switches to kernel mode, and executes the interrupt handler for that event. The handler saves the state of the CPU, performs some processing relevant to that event, and restores the state of the CPU (possibly switching back to user mode) so the CPU can resume execution of the program.

When a program wants to call a Windows API function&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, it triggers an interrupt&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which causes the CPU to switch to kernel mode and begin executing the desired API function. When the API function has finished processing, it switches back to user mode and resumes execution of the program. This is because API functions like &lt;code&gt;ReadProcessMemory&lt;/code&gt; cannot work in user mode; the program can't access other programs' memory. In kernel mode, however, the API function can read any memory region without restriction.

&lt;small&gt;1. Actually, Windows API functions eventually call a different API: the ''Native API''. This is the API used by the Windows NT family of kernels. ''This'' is when the CPU switches to kernel-mode.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;2. Modern CPUs have special, faster instructions for system calls, such as &lt;code&gt;sysenter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sysexit&lt;/code&gt; on x86. These instructions cause the CPU to switch to ring 0, and then begin executing a handler set up by the operating system.&lt;/small&gt;

== Context Switching ==
So, a program runs and calls API functions. How do other programs get a chance to run, then? Most of the time, programs simply allow the operating system to switch to another program because they are waiting for something (human input, hard disk). These programs are known as ''unrunnable'' programs, and since they make calls to the kernel to wait for something, the kernel knows to perform ''context switching'' to allow another program to run. This is done by:

# Saving the current program's state (including registers),
# Figuring out which program to run next,
# and restoring a different program's state.

If a program (''thread'' or ''process'' to be more accurate) runs for more than a certain period of time (the ''thread quantum'' or a processes ''time slice''), the operating system will context switch to another program. This idea is called ''preemption''. Preemption is accomplished by setting a timed interrupt in the processor that will invoke context switching.  The time slice that is used may be different for each process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== C and Windows ==

Many of the low-level functions in Windows were created using the C programming language. C code tends to be relatively small and fast compared to VB code or even C++ code, and has a shorter development time compared to raw assembly code. All of the DLLs in the Win32 API, and most of the kernel-level structures are implemented in C code.

== Visual Basic and Windows ==

Visual Basic is essentially a &quot;Windows-only&quot; programming language - although some ports either exist or are in development for other systems, VB is not nearly as popular on other operating systems as it is on Windows. The VB runtime libraries tap into the Win32 API and the MFC libraries, to implement its functionality. The new version of VB, &quot;VB.NET&quot;, uses the .NET platform, and therefore will not be covered in this wikibook. Old versions of VB, or &quot;VB Classic&quot; utilize the same Win32 API and MFC interfaces that C and C++ use to communicate with Windows. However, not all of the functions are identical, because VB uses different data types, and stores data differently than C or C++. As we discuss the Win32 API and MFC, we will attempt to show how the same functionality is implemented in VB.

Visual Basic uses the STDCALL calling convention for implementing function calls. Most of the Win32 API uses the STDCALL calling convention as well, so much of the hard work for interfacing the two is done by the compiler. C and C++, on the other hand, do not use STDCALL by default, and if you want to manually link a VB object code file     with a C object file, you will need to explicitly make the C interface a STDCALL one.

== COM and Windows ==

Microsoft implemented a technology known as the '''Component Object Model''' for Windows. COM essentially takes the object-oriented programming paradigm to the next level, by standardizing the class interface, and allowing classes to be written in different languages (C++, VB, etc.) and interfaced together seamlessly. COM programs (or &quot;COM clients&quot;) can be written in most languages that allow object-orientation.

== Other Languages ==

Many other programming languages have been implemented on Windows systems, and many of them have some sort of method for interfacing the Win32 API, or the MFC libraries. These interfaces are known collectively as ''wrappers'', because they wrap the functionality of the Win32 API in another programming language. Common wrappers are provided for Perl, Ada, Python, PHP, AutoIT, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== windows.h ==

The primary C header file for accessing the Win32 API is the &lt;code&gt;&lt;windows.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header file. To make a Win32 executable, the first step is to include this header file in your source code. The windows.h header file should be included ''before'' any other library include, even the C standard library files such as stdio.h or stdlib.h. This is because the windows.h file includes macros and other components that may modify, extend, or replace things in these libraries. This is especially true when dealing with UNICODE, because windows.h will cause all the string functions to use UNICODE instead. Also, because many of the standard C library functions are already included in the Windows kernel, many of these functions will be available to the programmer without needing to load the standard libraries. For example, the function &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; is included in windows.h automatically.

== Child Header Files ==

There are a number of header files that are automatically included with windows.h. Many of these files cannot simply be included by themselves, because of dependencies. The windows.h header file is actually a relatively small file, that provides conditional inclusion for a number of other header files, definitions of a few important macros, etc.

== Additional Header Files ==

This section will talk about some other interesting header files and libraries that can be included with your project, but which are not included by default with windows.h.

== windows.h Macros ==

This section will briefly detail some of the changes that the user can make in the windows.h structure at compile time using macros.

=== WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN ===

The WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN macro causes several of the child headers to not be included in the build. This can help to speed up the compilation process.

=== UNICODE and _UNICODE ===

These macros, which we will discuss later, can generally be used interchangeably, but are frequently both defined together. These cause the program to be compiled with UTF-16 encoded strings instead of ASCII encoded strings. UTF-16 is one internationalized encoding based on the UNICODE standard and allows for more characters than the American ASCII encoding, although UTF-8 is often preferred in modern programming.

=== WINVER and _WIN32_WINNT ===

You must set these to a number greater or equal to 0x500 or you will not get some of the useful functions that are in Windows 2000 (and thus in any modern Windows) but were not in Windows 98.

      <comment>Unicode is not 16-byte wide,</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For a reference of Unicode standard, see [[Unicode]].
== Introduction to Unicode ==
{{wikipedia|Unicode}}
'''Unicode''' is an industry standard whose goal is to provide the means by which text of all forms and languages can be encoded for use by computers.
Originally, text-characters were represented in computers using byte-wide data: each printable character (and many non-printing, or &quot;control&quot; characters) were implemented using a single byte each, which allowed for 256 characters total. However, globalization has created a need for computers to be able to accommodate many different alphabets from around the world. 

The old codes were known as ASCII or EBCDIC, but it was apparent that neither of these codes were capable of handling all the different characters and alphabets from around the world. The solution to this problem created Unicode. Windows NT implements many of its core functions with a &quot;wide&quot; 16-bit characters set, close to Unicode standard, although it provides a series of functions that are compatible with the standard ASCII characters as well.

UNICODE characters are frequently called &quot;Wide Characters&quot;, &quot;Generic Characters&quot;, or &quot;T Characters&quot;. This book may use any of these terms interchangeably.

=== Variable-Width Characters ===

Before Unicode, there was an internationalization attempt that introduced character strings with variable-width characters. Some characters, such as the standard ASCII characters would be 1 byte long. Other characters, such as extended character sets, were two bytes long. These types of character formats fell out of favor with the advent of UNICODE because they are harder to write and much harder to read. Windows does still maintain some functionality to deal with variable-width strings, but we won't discuss those here.

Unfortunately all advantages of using wide characters were lost because the number of characters needed quickly exceeded the 65,536 possible 16-bit values. Windows actually uses what is called UTF-16 to store characters, where a large number of characters actually take //two// words, these are called &quot;surrogate pairs&quot;. This development is after much of the Windows API documentation was written and much of it is now obsolete. You should never treat string data as an &quot;array of characters&quot;, instead always treat it as a null-terminated block. For instance always send the entire string to a function to draw it on the screen, do not attempt to draw each character. Any code that puts a square bracket after a LPSTR is wrong.

At the same time, variable-width character-based strings made a big comeback in the multi-platform standard called UTF-8, which is pretty much the same idea as UTF-16 except with 8-bit units. Its primary advantage is that there is no need for two APIs. The 'A' and 'W' APIs would have been the same if this were used, and since both are variable-sized, it has no disadvantage. Although most Windows programmers are unfamiliar with it, you may see increased references to using the non-UNICODE API.

== Windows Implementation ==

The Win32 API classifies all of its functions that require text input into two categories. Some of the functions have an &quot;A&quot; suffix (for ASCII), and some have a &quot;W&quot; suffix (for Wide characters, or Unicode). These functions are differentiated using the macro &quot;UNICODE&quot;:

 #ifdef UNICODE
 #define MessageBox MessageBoxW
 #else
 #define MessageBox MessageBoxA
 #endif

Because of this differentiation, when you receive a compiler error, you will get an error on &quot;MessageBoxW&quot; instead of simply &quot;MessageBox&quot;. In these cases, the compiler is not broken. It is simply trying to follow a complex set of macros.

== Unicode Environment ==

All Windows functions that require character strings are defined in this manner. If you want to use unicode in your program, you need to explicitly define the UNICODE macro before you include the windows.h file:

 #define UNICODE
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

Also, some functions in other libraries require you to define the macro _UNICODE. The standard library functions can be provided in unicode by including the &lt;tchar.h&gt; file as well. So, to use unicode in your project, you need to make the following declarations in your project:

 #define UNICODE
 #define _UNICODE
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 #include &lt;tchar.h&gt;

Some header files include a mechanism like the following, so that when one of the two UNICODE macros is defined, the other is automatically defined as well:

 #ifdef UNICODE
   #ifndef _UNICODE
     #define _UNICODE
   #endif
 #endif

 #ifdef _UNICODE
   #ifndef UNICODE
     #define UNICODE
   #endif
 #endif

If you are writing a library that utilizes UNICODE, it might be worthwhile for you to include this mechanism in your header files as well, so that other programmers don't need to worry about including both macros.

== TEXT macro ==

In C, to make a string of wide characters, you need to prefix the string with the letter &quot;L&quot;. Here is an example:

 char *asciimessage = &quot;This is an ASCII string.&quot;;
 w_char *unicodemessage = L&quot;This is a Wide Unicode string.&quot;;

The data type &quot;TCHAR&quot; is defined as being a char type if unicode is not defined, and is defined as being a wide type if UNICODE is defined (in tchar.h). To make strings portable between unicode and non-unicode, we can use the TEXT() macro to automatically define a string as being unicode or not:

 TCHAR *automessage = TEXT(&quot;This message can be either ASCII or UNICODE!&quot;);

Using TCHAR data types, and the TEXT macro are important steps in making your code portable between different environments.

Also, the TEXT macro can be written as:

 TEXT(&quot;This is a generic string&quot;);
 _T(&quot;This is also a generic string&quot;);
 T(&quot;This is also a generic string&quot;);

All three of these statements are equivalent.

The TEXT macro is typically defined like this:

 #ifdef UNICODE
 #define TEXT(t) L##t
 #define _T(t) L##t
 #define T(t) L##t
 #else
 #define TEXT(t) t
 #define _T(t) t
 #define T(t) t
 #endif

=== Control Characters ===
Unicode characters 0 to 31 (U+0000 to U+001F) are part of the C0 Controls and Basic Latin block. They are all control characters. These characters correspond to the first 32 characters of the ASCII set.

      <comment>/* Create Windows */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== WinMain ==

Programming Windows in C can be a little bit different from what most people are used to. First off, there isn't a '''main()''' function, but instead there is a '''_tWinMain()''' function to start your program off. _tWinMain() is defined as a macro in tchar.h as such:

 #ifdef _UNICODE
 #define _tWinMain wWinMain
 #else 
 #define _tWinMain WinMain
 #endif

This means that Windows functions can be written easily in Unicode or ASCII. Besides the difference in function name, _tWinMain also has different parameters than the standard main function:

 int WinMain(HINSTANCE hThisInstance, 
               HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, 
               LPSTR lpszArgument,  // LPWSTR for wWinMain
               int iCmdShow);

HINSTANCE objects are references to a program instance. hThisInstance is a reference to the current program, and hPrevInstance is a reference to any previously running versions of this same program. However, in Windows NT, the hPrevInstance data object is always NULL. This means that we can't use the hPrevInstance value to determine if there are other copies of the same program running on your system. There are different ways of checking for other copies of a program running, and we will discuss those methods later.

lpszArgument essentially contains all the information that the argc and argv variables used to show, except that the command-line arguments are not broken up into a vector. This means that if you want to sort individual arguments from the command line, you need to either break them up yourself, or call one of the available functions to break it up for you. We will discuss these functions later.

The last argument, &quot;int iCmdShow&quot; is a data item of type int (integer) that determines whether or not a graphical window should be displayed immediately, or if the program should run minimized.

WinMain has a number of different jobs:

#Register the window classes to be used by the program
#Create any Windows used by the program
#Run the message loop

We will explain each of those tasks in more detail.

=== Register Window Classes ===

Every little graphical detail you see on the screen is known as a &quot;window&quot;. Each program with a box around it, each button, each text box are all called windows. In fact, all of these various objects all get created in the same manner. This must mean that there are a large number of options and customizations available in order to get things as different as textboxes and scroll bars from the same method. Each window has an associated &quot;Window Class&quot; that needs to be registered with the system, to specify the different properties of the window. This is done by following 2 steps:

#Fill in the fields of the WNDCLASS data object
#Pass the WNDCLASS object to the RegisterClass function.

Also, there is an &quot;extended&quot; version of this procedure, that can be followed with similar results:

#Fill in the fields of the WNDCLASSEX object
#Pass the WNDCLASSEX object to the RegisterClassEx function.

Either of these methods can be used to register the class, but the -Ex version has a few more options.

Once the class is registered, you can discard the WNDCLASS structure, because you don't need it anymore.

== Create Windows ==

Creating Windows can be done with the CreateWindow or the CreateWindowEx functions. Both perform the same general task, but again, the -Ex version has more options. You pass some specifics to the CreateWindow function, such as the window size, the window location (the X and Y coordinates), the window title, etc. CreateWindow will return a HWND data object, that is a handle to the newly created window. Next, most programs will pass this handle to the '''ShowWindow''' function, to make the window appear on the screen.
The way CreateWindow() creates a window is as follows:
  
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;hwnd=CreateWindowEx(
     WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,
     g_szClassName,
     &quot;The title of my window&quot;,
     WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
     CW_USERDEFAULT,CW_USERDAFAULT,240,120,
     NULL,NULL,hTnstance,NULL);&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first parameter WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE is the extended window style. Next we have the class name g_szClassName, this tells the system what kind of window to create. Since we want to create a window from the class we just registered, we use the name of that class. After that we specify our window name or title which is the text that will be displayed in the caption, or title bar on our window. The parameter we have as WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW is the Window Style parameter. There are quite a few of these and you should look them up and experiment to find out what they do.
The next four parameters (CW_USERDEFAULT,CW_USERDAFAULT,240,120) are the X and Y co-ordinates for the top left corner of your window, and the width and height of the window. The X and Y co-ordinates are se to CW_USERDAFAULT to let the window choose where on the screen to put the window.
Next, (NULL,NULL,hTnstance,NULL) we have the parent window handle , the menu handle, the application instance handle, and a pointer handle to window creation data. In windows, the window on the screen is arranged in a hierarchy of the parent and child windows. When one sees a button on a window, the button is the Child and it is contained within the window that is it's Parent. In this example, the parent handle is NULL because we have no parent, this is our main or top level window. The menu is NULL for now since we don't have one yet. The instance handle is set to the value that is passed in as the first parameter of the WinMain(). The creation data that can be used to send additional data to the window that is being created is NULL.

== Message Loop ==

Once the window is created, the window will interact with the rest of the system by way of '''messages'''. The system sends messages to the window, and the window sends messages back. Most programs in fact don't do anything but read messages and respond to them! 

Messages come in the form of an MSG data type. This data object is passed to the GetMessage() function, which reads a message from the message queue, or waits for a new message from the system. Next, the message is sent to the TranslateMessage function, which takes care of some simple tasks such as translating to Unicode or not. Finally, the message is sent to the window for processing using the DispatchMessage function.

Here is an example:

 MSG msg;
 BOOL bRet;
 while( (bRet = GetMessage( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0 )) != 0)
 { 
    if (bRet == -1)
    {
        // handle the error and possibly exit
    }
    else
    {
        TranslateMessage(&amp;msg); 
        DispatchMessage(&amp;msg); 
    }
 }
 
 return msg.wParam;

That last line will be explained later.

== The Window Procedure ==

A window procedure may be named anything you want, but the general prototype for one is as follows:

 LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc (HWND hwnd, 
                           UINT msg, 
                           WPARAM wParam, 
                           LPARAM lParam);

An LRESULT data type is a generic 32-bit data object, that can be type-casted to contain any 32-bit value (including a pointer). The hwnd parameter is a handle to the window itself. The msg data value contains the current message from the operating system, and the WPARAM and LPARAM values contain the arguments for that message. For instance, if a button is pressed on the keyboard, the msg field will contain the message WM_KEYDOWN, and the WPARAM field will contain the actual letter pressed ('A' for instance), and the LPARAM field will contain information on whether or not the CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT buttons are down, and whether the type-matic repeat function has been triggered. Several macros have been defined that are very useful in separating out the WPARAM and LPARAM into different sized chunks:

;LOWORD(x): returns the low 16-bits of the 32-bit argument
;HIWORD(x): returns the high 16-bits of the 32-bit argument
;LOBYTE(x): returns the low 8-bits of the 16-bit argument
;HIBYTE(x): returns the high 8-bits of the 16-bit argument

For instance, to access the 2nd byte in the wParam field, we will use the macros as follows:

 HIBYTE(LOWORD(wParam));

Since the window procedure only has two available parameters, these parameters are often packed with data. These macros are very useful in separating that information out into different fields.

Here is an example of a general Window Procedure, that we will explain:

 LRESULT CALLBACK MyWinProc (HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
 {
    switch (msg)       
    {
        case WM_DESTROY:
            PostQuitMessage(0);
            break;
        default:           
            return DefWindowProc (hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);
    }
    return 0;
 }

Most window procedures only contain a simple loop that searches for particular messages from the system, and then acts on them. In this example, we are only looking for the WM_DESTROY message, which is the message that the kernel sends to the window when the window needs to close. In response to the WM_DESTROY message, the window calls the PostQuitMessage function, which puts a WM_QUIT message (which is defined as 0) into the message queue. When the message loop (described above) gets the WM_QUIT message, it breaks from the loop, and returns the value from the PostQuitMessage function.

Any message that is not handled by the loop should be (must be) passed to the DefWindowProc function. DefWindowProc will perform some default actions based on the messages received, but it won't do anything interesting. If you want your program to do something, you will need to handle these messages yourself. 

== Messages ==

There are a few other messages that we will talk about later on:

;WM_CREATE: Your window receives this message only once, when it is first created. Use this message to perform tasks that need to be handled in the beginning, such as initializing variables, allocating memory, or creating child windows (buttons and textboxes).
;WM_PAINT: This message indicates that it is time for the program to redraw itself. Use the graphical functions to redraw whatever is supposed to be on the window. If you don't draw anything, then the window will either be a boring white (or grey) background, or if the background was not erased, will keep whatever image is already shown on it (which looks unstable.)
;WM_COMMAND: This is a general message that indicates that the user has done something on your window. Either the user has clicked a button, or the user has selected a menu item, or the user has pressed a special &quot;Accelerator&quot; key sequence. The WPARAM and LPARAM fields will contain some descriptions on what happened, so you can find a way to react to this. If you do not process the WM_COMMAND messages, the user will not be able to click any buttons, or select any menu items, and that will be very frustrating indeed.
;WM_CLOSE: The user has decided to close the window, so the kernel sends the WM_CLOSE message. This is the final chance to preserve the window as necessary - if you don't want it closed completely, you should handle the WM_CLOSE message and ensure that it does not destroy the window.  If the WM_CLOSE message is passed to the DefWindowProc, then the window will next receive the WM_DESTROY message. 
;WM_DESTROY: The WM_DESTROY indicates that a given window is removed from the screen and will be unloaded from memory. Normally, your program can post the WM_QUIT message to exit the program by calling PostQuitMessage(). 

These are some of the most basic messages, and we will discuss other messages as the need arises.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''So you want to be a substitute teacher - or plan a lesson for a sub?  Here are some secrets for success.'''


== For the substitute ==

'''Follow the lesson plan.'''
A substitute teacher needs self-confidence.  You do matter and what you do during your time with students counts.  A conscientious teacher will leave you well-prepared plans accounting for every minute of each class period.  If this is the case, do not change the plan - especially when pressured by students who inevitably have a better idea, or a reason why they can't possibly complete the teacher's lesson.  Be firm, don't hesitate and don't accept whining or cajoling. Just do what you've been asked to do. Bear in mind that most often the classroom teacher has put time and effort into the substitute's plan and will depend on you to get the students to do the work. 

'''Get an early lead!'''
The sooner you can get the students seated and working, the easier and more effective your job will be. Take the time before the day's classes begin to read the plans carefully.  Be certain that you understand your charge and that you have all materials organized and ready for the entire day. 

'''Silence sometimes works best.'''
You are now organized and ready for your day. Consider handing students the assignment as they walk in the door, saying very quietly to each that he or she may take a seat and get started as you point to the assignment written on the board.  It would be helpful to write on the board the number of minutes the students will be given to complete the work.  Getting control of a class from the first minute will help to minimize outbursts, wisecracks, and other attempts at insurrection.

'''&quot;But we already did this!&quot;'''
Students work really hard to convince substitutes that the work left was an error on the part of the teacher.  They have, &quot;in fact&quot;, already completed this assignment.  Remember that the teacher is depending on you to have the students complete this assignment. Ask them to redo the work or pass it in.  Don't argue or challenge the students.  Simply say OK and remind them that the work will be graded based upon what is submitted at the end of the class.  If they have already done the work, they may go on to the next assignment or read or study silently. Remind them that you will ask for the assignment at the end of the class. Students that have already completed the work will pass in a note to the teacher saying they have already submitted said work.  These notes will be signed by the student and left for the teacher.  You'll be surprised that most students will complete the work.

'''Don't make deals!'''
You are the teacher.  You don't have to make deals. Don't negotiate an early dismissal or a shortened assignment. Don't feel like you have to schmooze the students into working.  Be cordial, soft-spoken, direct, and firm.  Never be confrontational or sarcastic. Teachers can tease their students because they have developed a trusting rapport.  But the students don't know you well enough for you to treat them casually. What's more, they will often take advantage of an opening to use sarcasm and humor to disrupt the entire class. Be proper and sincere, demonstrating your earnest desire to complete the work as outlined by the classroom teacher.

'''Don't be afraid to ask for help. ''' 
There are teachers all around you who can lend a hand.  Don't hesitate to ask for intervention if you have questions or need assistance.  You will earn more respect by asking for help than you will if you lose control of the class. 


=== Substituting in inner-city schools ===  
Subbing in an inner-city American secondary school can be an entirely rewarding experience or an unforgettable nightmare.  Your boundaries are going to be tested.  There are vast differences regarding student expectations in American schools.  Try to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the school when you enter.  Ask yourself some of these questions: Are the classes with the regular teachers loud and chaotic?
Are large numbers of students roaming the hallway?
Are students wearing hats in school?  
Do students mill around after the bell in the hallway?  
Do teachers shut their doors during classtime?

If the answer to these questions is yes, it is likely you are in a failing school.  Expectations of a substitute vary in each school.  If students are tossing a football around the hallway DURING class (I have been in schools where this has happened) or in front of an administrators office, the chances of you having a productive class are quite slim (although not entirely impossible). Unfortunately, in some schools it is expected that a substitute serves as a &quot;certified&quot; babysitter.  Most likely, if a school has a chaotic atmosphere, it is likely that administrators view a substitute as a babysitter.  In these failing schools, it is also likely the regular faculty and staff are regarded in the same manner.  It is unfortunate that a large number of inner-city schools in America operate in this dysfunctional manner.  Below are some do's and don'ts when subbing in a tough inner-city environment.

*'''Don't''' become emotional - never show anger, frustration or fear.

*'''Don't''' call administrators for minor behavior infractions, such as talking, not sitting in the proper seat, chewing gum, etc. You will end up getting a bad reputation.

*'''Don't''' let more than 3 students go to bathroom, nurse etc. during period.

*'''Do''' call administrators if you are sworn at or threatened, students are fighting, or if you encounter a weapon or drugs.

*'''Do''' take attendance...several times.

*'''Do''' list your rules on the blackboard for the class at the beginning of the period.

*'''Do''' bring in an extra assignment - something fun, like a wordsearch.


Some techniques that have proven effective in even the most difficult of environments are listed below:

*When a student asks to use the lav, ask him or her to ask you in five minutes.  When the first student asks to use the lav, or nurse etc., tell him or her that you will let them go, but they must wait for five minutes.  This technique is usually effective at controlling the number of students who leave a classroom in a given period.

*Tell class you only let three people out of the class at the beginning of the class.  

*If possible, read out loud. Don't rotate reading around room - ask for volunteers.

*If a teacher leaves a lesson that you feel is inadequate, don't be afraid to add on to it.  For example, your sub plans might say:  &quot;''p.435, #2-8; ALL CLASSES''&quot;.  The teacher has spent very little if any time preparing this lesson.  Do the lesson with the class, but maybe have a wordsearch or a popular crossword to complete after this assignment is complete.  By the way, students will very seldom answer questions out of a textbook.  If you are in a class where this is the assignment, don't be surprised if there is a fair amount of chaos.

*Remember, it's not your fault if the students are not doing their work.  It is not a reflection on you.  Keep calm and professional at all times.  You are the leader of the class for that particular day. It takes a lot strength and fortitude, mixed with a great amount of compassion and empathy to teach in an inner-city school.  Do not become discouraged, and have high expectations for ALL students you meet. Students can feel high expectations and will strive to meet them. 


== For the classroom teacher ==


'''Make expectations of substitutes clear.''' 
Take the time to discuss your expectations of student behavior with substitutes early in the year in case you are absent. When you are going to be absent, take the time to write thorough plans that account for every minute of class time.  Consider leaving alternative activities in case the class finishes early. If you know that you will be absent, organize your students the day before by telling them your expectations, detailing the assignment, and stating simple consequences for lack of compliance. If the students will work alone, tell them so and write it into the sub plans.  If they will be in groups, define the groups and include that information in the sub plans.  Specify if students are allowed to move their desks or chairs, or if they're allowed to work sitting on the floor, or even out in the hallway, the library, or outdoors.  Always let the sub know if classwork, homework, etc. is to be collected, or if the students are to place their work in specially designated baskets, trays or folders.  Let the substitute know if this includes ALL work, or only completed work.  If the latter, then specify what is to be done with incomplete work.

Two very essential items are a time schedule of each period (necessary if working in middle or  high schools), and a map of the school, including a map of &quot;duty&quot; stations.

Never say, &quot;You have cafeteria duty during period 5.&quot;  What exactly does the duty entail?  Does the sub stand by the doors, walk among the tables of students, stand by the food line, etc.  What exactly is the sub supposed to be looking out for?  Another example:  &quot;You have bus duty outside door #35.&quot;  Does the sub stand on the sidewalk?  Does she stand right by the door but within the building?  Does she go up to each bus and greet the students as they come out?  Is she supposed to stop by the main office first, to get a walkie-talkie?  How do you use the walkie-talkie?  Another example:  If there is bathroom duty and the bathrooms have to be locked and unlocked for safety reasons, where would the sub find the key?

Please advise if there is an accessible restroom for the sub, and let the sub know where the restroom is located.  It's humiliating for an adult to have to ask strangers &quot;Can you please open up the restroom for me?&quot;  Some subs won't use the restroom all day just for that reason.

Lesson plan packets usually include information about fire drills, lockdowns, eating policy, etc.  Although it is the sub's responsibility to know these regulations, it would still be greatly appreciated if you leave a list of basics.  Here is an example:
1. No staff or students may eat or drink in the classroom. (Then the sub knows not to take her lunch break in the classroom.)
2. Only two students out at a time, regardless of where they are going. (Very straightforward and helfpul.)

It's probably best not to advise the sub about which student behaves and which doesn't.   Sometimes, it is the so-called &quot;good&quot; student or &quot;honor&quot; student who misbehaves, while many so-called &quot;troublesome&quot; students behave pretty well.  Don't scare the sub with a biased picture; let the sub make up her own mind about how each student or class behaved.

Also ask the substitute to leave you feedback on a standard questionnaire or simply by leaving you a note. When you receive negative feedback about a student or a class, be sure to address it and assign reasonable but firm consequences including a hand-written note and/or verbal apology from the student to the substitute.

'''Make expectations of students clear.'''
Give students no opportunity to contradict the substitute. Distribute copies of the plan to the class. A well-prepared group of students will most often comply with the substitute. Explain to students that they must be on their best behavior for the substitute since he or she won't know them as you do, and may misinterpret their well-meaning quips. Define best behavior for them.  Never make jokes about substitute teachers and don't let students think that you have low expectations for days that you aren't there. 

'''Make a lesson plan.'''
It is vital that you take an adequate amount of time preparing for a substitute teacher. Give the substitute as much detail as necessary to make your wishes clear.  Review, organize and clearly label materials to be left for the substitute. The substitute needs enough material to keep the students busy for the entire class period.  Your instructions should be fairly detailed and legible, leaving no doubt about what you are trying to accomplish on that given day.  It might even be a good idea to include the actual goals and objectives that you are trying to attain to.  But at all costs, leave the substitute more than enough activities/material to keep the students busy.  Also, if you copy a ditto, always make a few extra copies.

Subs are expected to bring SOME things with them (#2 pencils, red pens, etc.), but the school should provide the majority of materials, since the school administration has its own requirements about which supplies are desired.  If you wish to leave your desks and cabinets locked, that is understandable, but at least leave a large sealed envelope marked &quot;FOR THE SUBSTITUTE&quot;, containing all the items the sub will need for the day.  For example, if you want papers collected from all classes, make sure you leave binder clips, large paper clips, or a stapler with enough staples (rubber bands are not good because they can snap).

Try not to make procedures or terminology complicated (many subs have not yet learned about KWL, concept webs, Bloom's Taxonomy questions, context clues, etc.).  Do give as much work as you like, but keep methods and instructions as simple as possible.

'''One more piece of advice:''' find out which substitute is your students' least favorite.  Usually you can find this information out fairly easily.  For instance, when you tell them that you will be gone, some students will inevitably say, &quot;Don't get Mrs. so-and-so&quot;.  If there is a particular sub that your students do not want, seek that person out.  Usually, the reason that the students don't &quot;like&quot; the sub is because he or she does a pretty good job of carrying out your instructions. This could also be a result of a sub who is simply not good. You should use judgement in this case. Students do sometimes like subs who follow the lesson plan, some are just plain crazy. It could be a legitimate reason for not wanting a sub. Ask the students why they don't want this person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:private}} is a Java [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]]
which declares a member's [[Java Programming/Access Modifiers|access]]
as private. That is, the member is only visible within the class,
not from any other class (including subclasses). The visibility of 
{{Java:private}} members extends to [[Java Programming/Nested Classes|nested classes]].

Please note: Because access modifiers are not handled at instance level but at class level, private members of an object are visible from other instances of the same class!


Syntax:
 {{java:private}} {{java:void}} method();

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:boolean}} is a [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] which designates the
{{Java:boolean}} [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]].
There are only two possible {{Java:boolean}} values: {{Java:true}} and {{Java:false}}.
The default value for {{Java:boolean}} fields is {{Java:false}}.

The following is a declaration of a {{Java:private}} {{Java:boolean}} field named &lt;code&gt;initialized&lt;/code&gt;, and its use in a method named &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt;. {{java|code=
private boolean initialized = false; 
public synchronized void {
   if ( !initialized ) {
      connection = connect();
      initialized = true;
   }
}
}}

Note that there is no automatic conversion between integer types (such as {{Java:int}})
to {{Java:boolean}} as is possible in some languages like [[Programming C|C]].
Instead, one must use an equivalent expression such as &lt;code&gt;(i != 0)&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates
to {{Java:true}} if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is not zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:public}} is a Java [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] which declares a member's [[Java Programming/Scope|access]] as public. Public members are visible to all other classes. This means that any other class can access a {{Java:public}} field or method. Further, other classes can modify {{Java:public}} fields unless the field is declared as {{Java:final}}.

A best practice is to give fields {{Java:private}} access and reserve {{Java:public}} access to only the set of methods and {{Java:final}} fields that define the class' public constants. This helps with encapsulation and information hiding, since it allows you to change the implementation of a class without affecting the consumers who use only the public API of the class.

Below is an example of an immutable {{Java:public}} class named &lt;code&gt;Length&lt;/code&gt; which maintains {{Java:private}} instance fields named &lt;code&gt;units&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;magnitude&lt;/code&gt; but provides a {{Java:public}} constructor and two {{Java:public}} accessor methods.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing: Length.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4, 5, 16-18, 20-22&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.java;

public class Length {
   private double magnitude;
   private String units;

   public Length(double magnitude, String units) {
      if ((units == null) || (units.trim().length() == 0)) {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;non-null, non-empty units required.&quot;);
      }

      this.magnitude = magnitude;
      this.units = units;
   }

   public double getMagnitude() {
      return magnitude;
   }

   public String getUnits() {
      return units;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The Gastrointestinal System is responsible for the breakdown and absorption of various foods and liquids needed to substain life. Many different organs have essential roles in the digestion of food, from the mechanical disrupting of the teeth to the creation of bile (which is an [[w:Emulsifier|emulsifier]]) by the liver. In order to understand the interactions of the different components we shall follow the food on its journey through the human body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Believe it or not, fake Seikos not only exist, they are fairly common.  For collectors, there is also the problem of &quot;FrankenSeikos&quot;, watches using authentic Seiko parts, but from various sources.  Sometimes frankens are merely repaired using whatever parts are available, but sometimes these are trying to look like a more collectable watch. 



Common Signs of a fake:

Electra 360.  These were cheap pinlever movements

Bling--Frequently an Electra, fake diamonds as markers.  These will frequently be missing in places.

Mismatch of movement number
Seiko movement numbers are the first 4 digits of both the dial and case numbers.  While sometimes backs are swapped, it may be a sign that the watch is fake, especially on a &quot;new&quot; or &quot;NOS&quot; watch.  

Mismatch between jewel count and movement:  

Vibration engraved:  One Feiko I wound up with had the back engraved with a vibrating engraver--A series of small dots rather than continuous lines.  This one also had no serial number on the caseback, and was marked &quot;Rotomatic&quot; on the dial, a Swiss trademark.  Inside was a Ricoh movement.  

5 etched on the crystal of a non-5 watch

Holographic sticker on the crystal

Look for signs that letters were removed before and after the name--Some watches were printed as ASEIKON or ESEIKOR, with ink that can be easily removed.  

Day/date disks poorly aligned, cheaply printed.  

&quot;Swiss Made&quot;--Seiko did not use Swiss movements, but some fakes have cheap Swiss or Hong Kong pinlevers. 

Pinlever movement

Chrome plated--Not sure of older Seikos, but from the late 60's on, silvertone Seikos were stainless steel, not chrome.  

Quartz Seiko 5  The 5 is always an automatic. 

Misspellings--One fake Seiko had &quot;Sevesteen jewels&quot; engraved on the rotor, visible behind the display back.

Poor quality/misaligned day or date wheels

Aseikon watches are sold by thieves who will place one dial over the a and the other dial over the n so the watch reads &quot;seiko&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trusses are series of trianglular supports with no intraspan loads.  Classified as two force members,the beams have applied forces only at the ends.  The resultant forces at the ends must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, along the line of the joints of the member. These forces are called axial forces. The member is said to be in compression if T is negative (ie, the forces at each end are toward each other) or in tension if T is positive.

The main strategies for analyzing trusses are the method of joints and the method of sections.

==Example 1==

===Question===

[[Image:StaticsTrussEx1.svg|thumb|Blue lines are members of the truss, the blue circle is the joint which all members are attached to]]

The following picture shows a three member truss.  Angles, and one force are given in the picture.  Find the force in the vertical and diagonal member by using what you know about equilibrium.

===Answer===

Assign a coordinate system.  In this problem a two dimensional X,Y plane can be used with the positive X axis being horizontal running from left to right(pointing to the right).  The Y axis will be vertical and pointing upwards.

Since this is a statics problem, the joint cannot move.  The only way the joint won't move is if the forces acting on it are in equilibrium (the net force must be equal to zero in all directions).  An intelligent step now would be to sum X and Y forces at the joint.

Assign variable names so you don't get members confused with each other, let's call the vertical member's tension &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; and the diagonal member's tension &lt;math&gt; T_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = 0 = -10 - T_2\cos(30) + T_1\cos(90)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = T_1 + T_2\sin(30)&lt;/math&gt;

The cosine of 90 degrees is zero so &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; drops out.  You could also drop out &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; simply by noticing that &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; does not have an X component.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = 0 = -10 - T_2\cos(30)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ T_2 = -11.547N&lt;/math&gt;

The negative sign indicates that the force is in the opposite direction as in the picture.  This means the member is in compression instead of tension.  Now we can solve for &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = T_1 + T_2sin(30) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = T_1 + -11.547sin(30) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ T_1 = 5.774N &lt;/math&gt;

This answer came out positive, meaning the direction indicated in the picture was correct and the member is in tension.  

The problem has been solved, we know the force in every member of the truss and whether the member is in tension or compression.  If you are having problems visualizing the problem see if the image below helps.

[[Image:StaticsTrussEx1Ans.svg|thumb|center|This picture displays every force acting on the joint in the correct orientation, you can see that the forces add to zero so the joint will not move.]]

==Notes==
The moments about all axes must also be zero, but the moments are already known to be zero about the joint because all forces pass directly through the joint.

'''Keywords''' are special tokens in the language which have reserved use in the language. Keywords may not be used as identifiers in Java &amp;mdash; you cannot declare a field whose name is a keyword, for instance.

Examples of keywords are the primitive types, {{Java:int}} and {{Java:boolean}}; the control flow statements {{Java:for}} and {{Java:if}}; access modifiers such as {{Java:public}}, and special words which mark the declaration and definition of Java classes, packages, and interfaces: {{Java:class}}, {{Java:package}}, {{Java:interface}}.

Below are all the Java language keywords:
&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot; style=&quot;column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3;&quot;&gt;
* {{Java:abstract}}
* {{Java:assert}} (since Java 1.4)
* {{Java:boolean}}
* {{Java:break}}
* {{Java:byte}}
* {{Java:case}}
* {{Java:catch}}
* {{Java:char}}
* {{Java:class}}
* {{Java:const}} (not used)
* {{Java:continue}}
* {{Java:default}}
* {{Java:do}}
* {{Java:double}}
* {{Java:else}}
* {{Java:enum}} (since Java 5.0)
* {{Java:extends}}
* {{Java:final}}
* {{Java:finally}}
* {{Java:float}}
* {{Java:for}}
* {{Java:goto}} (not used)
* {{Java:if}}

* {{Java:void}}
* {{Java:volatile}}
* {{Java:while}}
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== XML Style Sheet ==

Similar to the layout we visited in chapter 3, this style sheet lists each hotel in the XML document by country.  But this time some new features have been added.  Price range elements have been included, each hotel’s amenities are now listed, and the population of each country has been formatted to improve readability.


=== XSLT Functions ===

When formatting XML output, there may be times when you might want to massage the data or get certain values for display.  Placed within the XML style sheet, functions can be used to manipulate data during the transformation.  We saw an example of this in chapter 3 when displaying the number of hotels within a city.

&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;count(hotel)&quot; /&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;

In order to make the population a little easier to read in our style sheet, we need to separate the digits into groups of threes and add commas.  To do this we use the format-number( ) function.  The purpose of this function is to convert a numeric value into a string using specified patterns that control the number of leading zeroes, separator between thousands, etc.  The basic syntax of this function is as follows:

&lt;center&gt;'''format-number (number, pattern)'''&lt;/center&gt;

* number is the numeric value to be formatted
* pattern is a string that lays out the general representation of a number.  Each character in the string represents either a digit from number or some special punctuation such as a comma or minus sign.

In order to display &lt;population&gt; with the digits grouped by three’s using commas as the separator, the format-number function was used in line {51} of our XML style sheet.  

The following are the characters and their meanings used to represent the number format when using the format-number function within a style sheet:


&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;font-size:small; width:50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;10%&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; Symbol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Meaning &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;# &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;. &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;, &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;; &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;% &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;X &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‘  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
A digit.&lt;br&gt;
A digit, zero shows as absent.&lt;br&gt;
(period) Placeholder for decimal separator.&lt;br&gt;
Placeholder for grouping separator.&lt;br&gt;
Separate formats.&lt;br&gt;
Default prefix for negative.&lt;br&gt;
Multiply by 100 and show as a percentage.&lt;br&gt;
Any other characters can be used in the prefix or suffix.&lt;br&gt;
Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



There are numerous other functions that you may find use for within a style sheet.  The following are some additional numeric based functions that are useful when handling numbers within a stylesheet.

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;font-size:small; width:50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;28%&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Name &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Description &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ceiling() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Returns the smallest integer that is not less than the number argument &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;floor() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Returns the largest integer that is not greater than the number argument &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;number() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Converts the value argument to a number &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;round() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Rounds the number argument to the nearest integer &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;sum() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Returns the total value of a set of numeric values in a node-set &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

                                            &lt;BR/&gt;

                                            &lt;/b&gt;

                                &lt;/TABLE&gt;

'''Figure 5-5  XML stylesheet – amenity.xsl'''

In the XML stylesheet, you will see two additional functions '''position()''' and '''last()'''.  The position function returns the position of the current context node in the current context node-set.  The last function returns the index number of the last node in the context.  To list each amenity for each hotel, the transformation checks to see if the current position of the node is different than the position of the last context node in the set.  If this returns true, then a comma is added as the amenities are listed.

Although this stylesheet builds upon the one we saw in chapter 3, notice the use of embedded tables to further specify the layout of the data being conveyed.  Values and their indicators have been separated into table cells, allowing for a cleaner look and feel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the first things that is going to strike many first-time programmers of the Win32 API is that there are tons and tons of old data types to deal with. Sometimes, just keeping all the correct data types in order can be more difficult than writing a nice program. This page will talk a little bit about some of the data types that a programmer will come in contact with.

== Hungarian Notation ==

First, let's make a quick note about the naming convention used for some data types, and some variables. The Win32 API uses the so-called &quot;Hungarian Notation&quot; for naming variables. Hungarian Notation requires that a variable be prefixed with an abbreviation of its data type, so that when you are reading the code, you know exactly what type of variable it is. The reason this practice is done in the Win32 API is because there are many different data types, making it difficult to keep them all straight. Also, there are a number of different data types that are essentially defined the same way, and therefore some compilers will not pick up on errors when they are used incorrectly. As we discuss each data type, we will also note the common prefixes for that data type. 

Putting the letter &quot;P&quot; in front of a data type, or &quot;p&quot; in front of a variable usually indicates that the variable is a pointer. The letters &quot;LP&quot; or the prefix &quot;lp&quot; stands for &quot;Long Pointer&quot;, which is exactly the same as a regular pointer on 32 bit machines. LP data objects are simply legacy objects that were carried over from Windows 3.1 or earlier, when pointers and long pointers needed to be differentiated.  On modern 32-bit systems, these prefixes can be used interchangeably.

== LPVOID ==

LPVOID data types are defined as being a &quot;pointer to a void object&quot;. This may seem strange to some people, but the ANSI-C standard allows for generic pointers to be defined as &quot;void*&quot; types. This means that LPVOID pointers can be used to point to different types of objects, without creating a compiler error. However, the burden is on the programmer to keep track of what type of object is being pointed to. 

Also, some Win32 API functions may have arguments labeled as &quot;LPVOID lpReserved&quot;. These reserved data members should never be used in your program, because they either depend on functionality that hasn't yet been implemented by Microsoft, or else they are only used in certain applications. If you see a function with an &quot;LPVOID lpReserved&quot; argument, you must always pass a NULL value for that parameter - some functions will fail if you do not do so.

LPVOID objects frequently do not have prefixes, although it is relatively common to prefix an LPVOID variable with the letter &quot;p&quot;, as it is a pointer.

== DWORD, WORD, BYTE ==

These data types are defined to be a specific length, regardless of the target platform. There is a certain amount of additional complexity in the header files to achieve this, but the result is code that is very well standardized, and very portable to different hardware platforms and different compilers.

DWORDs (Double WORDs), the most commonly occurring of these data types, are defined always to be unsigned 32-bit quantities. On any machine, be it 16, 32, or 64 bits, a DWORD is always 32 bits long. Because of this strict definition, DWORDS are very common and popular on 32-bit machines, but are less common on 16-bit and 64-bit machines. 

WORDs (Single WORDs) are defined strictly as unsigned 16-bit values, regardless of what machine you are programming on. BYTEs are defined strictly as being unsigned 8-bit values. QWORDs (Quad WORDs), although rare, are defined as being unsigned 64-bit quantities. Putting a &quot;P&quot; in front of any of these identifiers indicates that the variable is a pointer. putting two &quot;P&quot;s in front indicates it's a pointer to a pointer. These variables may be unprefixed, or they may use any of the prefixes common with DWORDs. Because of the differences in compilers, the definition of these data types may be different, but typically these definitions are used:

 #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;


 typedef uint8_t BYTE;
 typedef uint16_t WORD;
 typedef uint32_t DWORD;
 typedef uint64_t QWORD;

Notice that these definitions are not the same in all compilers. It is a known issue that the GNU GCC compiler uses the ''long'' and ''short'' specifiers differently from the Microsoft C Compiler. For this reason, the windows header files typically will use conditional declarations for these data types, depending on the compiler being used. In this way, code can be more portable. 

As usual, we can define pointers to these types as:

 #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;


 typedef uint8_t * PBYTE;
 typedef uint16_t * PWORD;
 typedef uint32_t * PDWORD;
 typedef uint64_t * PQWORD;

 typedef uint8_t ** PPBYTE;
 typedef uint16_t ** PPWORD;
 typedef uint32_t ** PPDWORD;
 typedef uint64_t ** PPQWORD;

DWORD variables are typically prefixed with &quot;dw&quot;. Likewise, we have the following prefixes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Data Type !! Prefix
|-
|BYTE || &quot;b&quot;
|-
|WORD || &quot;w&quot;
|-
|DWORD || &quot;dw&quot;
|-
|QWORD || &quot;qw&quot;
|}

== LONG, INT, SHORT, CHAR ==

These types are not defined to a specific length. It is left to the host machine to determine exactly how many bits each of these types has. 

;Types:
 typedef long LONG;
 typedef unsigned long ULONG;
 typedef int INT;
 typedef unsigned int UINT;
 typedef short SHORT;
 typedef unsigned short USHORT;
 typedef char CHAR;
 typedef unsigned char UCHAR;

;LONG notation: LONG variables are typically prefixed with an &quot;l&quot; (lower-case L).

;UINT notation: UINT variables are typically prefixed with an &quot;i&quot; or a &quot;ui&quot; to indicate that it is an integer, and that it is unsigned.

;CHAR, UCHAR notation: These variables are usually prefixed with a &quot;c&quot; or a &quot;uc&quot; respectively.

If the size of the variable doesn't matter, you can use some of these integer types. However, if you want to exactly specify the size of a variable, so that it has a certain number of bits, use the BYTE, WORD, DWORD, or QWORD identifiers, because their lengths are platform-independent and never change.

== STR, LPSTR ==

STR data types are string data types, with storage already allocated. This data type is less common than the LPSTR. STR data types are used when the string is supposed to be treated as an immediate array, and not as a simple character pointer. The variable name prefix for a STR data type is &quot;sz&quot; because it's a zero-terminated string (ends with a null character).

Most programmers will not define a variable as a STR, opting instead to define it as a character array, because defining it as an array allows the size of the array to be set explicitly. Also, creating a large string on the stack can cause greatly undesirable stack-overflow problems.

LPSTR stands for &quot;Long Pointer to a STR&quot;, and is essentially defined as such:

 #define STR * LPSTR;

LPSTR can be used exactly like other string objects, except that LPSTR is explicitly defined as being ASCII, not unicode, and this definition will hold on all platforms. LPSTR variables will usually be prefixed with the letters &quot;lpsz&quot; to denote a &quot;Long Pointer to a String that is Zero-terminated&quot;. The &quot;sz&quot; part of the prefix is important, because some strings in the Windows world (especially when talking about the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Driver_Kit DDK]) are not zero-terminated. LPSTR data types, and variables prefixed with the &quot;lpsz&quot; prefix can all be used seamlessly with the standard library &lt;string.h&gt; functions.

== TCHAR ==

TCHAR data types, as will be explained in the section on Unicode, are generic character data types. TCHAR can hold either standard 1-byte ASCII characters, or wide 2-byte Unicode characters. Because this data type is defined by a macro and is not set in stone, only character data should be used with this type. TCHAR is defined in a manner similar to the following (although it may be different for different compilers):

 #ifdef UNICODE
 #define TCHAR WORD
 #else
 #define TCHAR BYTE
 #endif

== TSTR, LPTSTR ==

Strings of TCHARs are typically referred to as TSTR data types. More commonly, they are defined as LPTSTR types as such:

 #define TCHAR * LPTSTR

These strings can be either UNICODE or ASCII, depending on the status of the UNICODE macro. LPTSTR data types are long pointers to generic strings, and may contain either ASCII strings or Unicode strings, depending on the environment being used. LPTSTR data types are also prefixed with the letters &quot;lpsz&quot;.

== HANDLE ==

HANDLE data types are some of the most important data objects in Win32 programming, and also some of the hardest for new programmers to understand. Inside the kernel, Windows maintains a table of all the different objects that the kernel is responsible for. Windows, buttons, icons, mouse pointers, menus, and so on, all get an entry in the table, and each entry is assigned a unique identifier known as a HANDLE. If you want to pick a particular entry out of that table, you need to give Windows the HANDLE value, and Windows will return the corresponding table entry.

HANDLEs are defined as being unsigned 32-bit quantities in &lt;windows.h&gt;, but HANDLEs should never be used like integers. They are unique identifiers, and if you edit them, or use them in arithmetic, then they can never be used to get the table entry that they correspond to. In other words, HANDLEs should be stored, but they should never be changed by the programmer.

HANDLEs are generally prefixed with an &quot;h&quot;. Below are a few special handles that are worth discussing:
A handle is actually a pointer to a pointer to a memory location.Handles are unsigned integers that Windows uses internally to keep track of objects in memory. Windows moves objects like memory blocks in memory to make room, if the object is moved in memory, the handles table is updated.

=== HWND ===

HWND data types are &quot;Handles to a Window&quot;, and are used to keep track of the various objects that appear on the screen. To communicate with a particular window, you need to have a copy of the window's handle. HWND variables are usually prefixed with the letters &quot;hwnd&quot;, just so the programmer knows they are important.

Canonically, main windows are defined as:

 HWND hwnd;

Child windows are defined as:

 HWND hwndChild1, hwndChild2...

and Dialog Box handles are defined as:

 HWND hDlg;

Although you are free to name these variables whatever you want in your own program, readability and compatibility suffer when an idiosyncratic naming scheme is chosen - or worse, no scheme at all.

=== HINSTANCE ===

HINSTANCE variables are handles to a program instance. Each program gets a single instance variable, and this is important so that the kernel can communicate with the program. If you want to create a new window, for instance, you need to pass your program's HINSTANCE variable to the kernel, so that the kernel knows where the new window belongs to. If you want to communicate with another program, it is frequently very useful to have a copy of that program's instance handle. HINSTANCE variables are usually prefixed with an &quot;h&quot;, and furthermore, since there is frequently only one HINSTANCE variable in a program, it is canonical to declare that variable as such:

 HINSTANCE hInstance;

It is usually a benefit to make this HINSTANCE variable a global value, so that all your functions can access it when needed.

=== HMENU ===

If your program has a drop-down menu available (as most visual Windows programs do), that menu will have an HMENU handle associated with it. To display the menu, or to alter its contents, you need to have access to this HMENU handle. HMENU handles are frequently prefixed with simply an &quot;h&quot;.

== WPARAM, LPARAM ==

In the earlier days of Microsoft Windows, parameters were passed to a window in one of two formats: WORD-length (16-bit) parameters, and LONG-length (32-bit) parameters. These parameter types were defined as being WPARAM (16-bit) and LPARAM (32-bit). However, in modern 32-bit systems, WPARAM and LPARAM are both 32 bits long. The names however have not changed, for legacy reasons.

WPARAM and LPARAM variables are generic function parameters, and are frequently type-cast to other data types including pointers and DWORDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In 1999, a study group on Veterinary Public Health (VPH), convened jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United nations (FAO), and the Office International des epizooties (OIE), and including twenty-eight experts from eighteen countries, defined veterinary public health as  &quot;the contribution to the complete physical, mental, and social well-being of humans through an understanding and application of veterinary science.&quot; The emphasis was on the human ecosystem where the contribution of veterinary science to human health has been fundamental and sustained over millennia. It is not generally appreciated that this contribution pertains not only to livestock and food production, animal traction, and transportation, which have laid the basis for most urban societies around the world. The study and management of animal diseases have also laid the basis for much of what we know about the dynamics and management of infectious human diseases, and the promotion of environmental quality.  

Defined as diseases transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans, zoonotic diseases (zoonoses) include bubonic plague, Lyme disease, salmonella, and rabies. Disease-carrying animals, called reservoirs, infect humans through several pathways: when they are eaten by humans, when they bite humans, or when arthropods that have fed on them, such as mosquitoes or ticks, then feed on a human host. It has been estimated that over 60% of infectious diseases impacting humans are zoonotic in origin and zoonoses are on the rise globally, accounting for over 75% of emerging diseases.

Many important human diseases have originated in animals, and so changes in the habitats of animals that are disease vectors or reservoirs may affect human health, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively.  For example, the Nipah virus is believed to have emerged after forest clearance fires in Indonesia drove carrier bats to neighbouring Malaysia, where the virus infected intensively farmed pigs, and then crossed to humans. Intensive livestock production, while providing benefits to health in terms of improved nutrition, has also created environments favourable to the emergence of diseases. Greater human contact with wild species and 'bush meat' from encroachment in forests and changes in diet also create opportunities for disease transmission. Trends ranging from forest clearance to climate-induced habitat changes also appear to have impacted certain populations of mosquitoes, ticks and midges, altering transmission patterns for diseases like malaria and lyme disease.

Until recently, zoonotic diseases have not been treated as part of ecological systems. In response to the prevalence of zoonoses, the multidisciplinary field of disease ecology has emerged. It involves the study of any ecological system that includes pathogens and incorporates the complexity of multiple interactions.  The research area covers basic processes underlying the linkages between climate, ecosystems, and infectious disease, particularly the different ways that climate can influence the emergence and transmission of infectious disease agents.  For example Mexican researchers adopted an ecosystem approach to better understand the complex set of factors that influenced the incidence and spread of malaria in Oaxaca. This project includes the molecular biology of the vector and the parasite, community perceptions of malaria, statistical analyses, and a geographic information-based surveillance system.  

Mammals are the most common reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, with rodents leading the pack. The plague (Yersinia pestis), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) all owe their spread to the presence of rodents. From an ecological perspective, rodents occupy the middle rung of the food chain. Primarily herbivores, with diets rich in plant matter, they are a food source for vertebrate predators such as foxes, and owls. 

Aquatic animals that carry human parasites are also a source of disease and death. The human cost is high: The World Health Organization (WHO 2004, 2) estimates that globally &quot;1.8 million people die each year from diarrhoeal diseases, 200 million people are infected with schistosomiasis and more than 1 billion people suffer from soil-transmitted helminthes infections.&quot; 

Unfortunately, agricultural systems, especially irrigated ones, have long been associated with manifestations of extreme human ill-health arising from water-related diseases. The major reason is that public health and disease control programs have not been concerns of the water resources sector, which typically has focused on potential economic benefits of water bodies in terms of food production and power generation. This theme of applied ecology aims to increase knowledge of the relationship between water, human health and ecosystems; and to develop practical measures to reduce negative environmental health impacts by:

* mitigating adverse impacts due to malaria and other water-related parasitic diseases through water and land management strategies;
* managing the agricultural use of polluted water sources (including urban and industrial waste) so as to optimize food production and livelihoods benefits and minimize adverse health and environmental impacts;
* exploring the trade-offs necessary to provide for environmental water requirements in river basins, the wise use of wetland ecosystems, and the conservation of biodiversity through the application of eco-agricultural principles.

Another important issue is the dangerous integration of circumstances when animals and consumers from different ecosystems come into contact. The lack of resistance to new pathogens makes humans and animals replicating reservoirs, for viruses and bacteria to adapt and rapidly mutate. Further, the staggering numbers of animals and people in contact change one-in-a-million odds of a disease transfer into almost a daily possibility. Even under the most hygienic conditions, this pool of viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens creates optimal conditions for diseases to multiply rapidly and jump between species to exploit new potential hosts; something the most &quot;successful&quot; diseases do all too well. Under this scenario, two problems are created. First is the high risk of new diseases spreading into human populations. Second is that this can create a &quot;fear factor&quot; amongst people - their concern that wildlife is unhealthy might cause them to try to remove the threat by killing the wildlife. Shooting flying foxes was proposed in Southeast Asia when they were thought to be carrying nipa virus, even though the link has not been definitively proven and the disease is rarely found in flying foxes.  

The global trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms that not only cause human disease outbreaks but also threaten livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and the health of ecosystems. Outbreaks resulting from wildlife trade have caused hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage globally. 

In almost all cases, eradication schemes are not cost efficient or effective means to reduce disease spread when compared to health education, sanitation, and controlling animal movement. Moreover, eradication schemes do not address the fundamental problem of our creating conditions, which maximize opportunities for disease build-up and cross-species transmission. Much research is still needed on the links between viruses in different species and human disease, and means of transmission between the two. Rather than attempting to eradicate pathogens or the wild species that may harbour them, a practical approach would include decreasing the contact rate among species, including humans, at the interface created by the wildlife trade. Since wildlife marketing functions as a system of networks with major hubs, these points provide control opportunities to maximize the effects of regulatory efforts.

Intensive production has also given rise to new disease problems, such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease) and Avian flu. These indicate the potential for disease transmission through human food chains that are now often extended halfway across the globe. Industrialized animal production systems are now major features of human ecology.  They have considerable impacts on the quality of the atmosphere, water and soil due to nutrient overloads; they impact terrestrial ecosystems directly and indirectly; in addition, disruption of marine fisheries occurs locally with pollution and runoff from production facilities and globally in terms of depletion of fish stocks where fishmeal has become a large commodity in the production of livestock feeds. 

The response to the fact that several vector-borne, parasitic or zoonotic diseases have (re)-emerged and spread in Europe with major health, ecological, socio-economical and political consequences, has been the establishment of EDEN (Emerging Diseases in a changing European Environment). Most of these outbreaks are linked to global and local changes resulting from climate change, human-induced landscape changes or the activities of human populations. Europe must anticipate, prevent and control new emergences to avoid major societal and economical crises (cf. SARS in Asia, West Nile in the USA). EDEN offers a unique opportunity to prepare for uncertainties about the future of the European environment by exploring the impact of environmental.  Other aims are to identify, evaluate and catalogue European ecosystems and environmental conditions linked to global change, which can influence the spatial and temporal distribution and dynamics of human pathogenic agents. The project will develop and co-coordinate at the European level a set of generic methods, tools and skills such as predictive emergence and spread models, early warning, surveillance and monitoring tools and scenarios, which can be used by decision makers for risk assessment, decision support for intervention and public health policies both at the EU and at the national or regional level. Part of EDEN's innovation will be to combine spatial data (earth observation data, GIS etc.) with epidemiological data.

EDEN has selected for study a range of indicator human diseases that are especially sensitive to environmental changes and will be studied within a common scientific framework (involving Landscapes, Vector and Parasite bionomics, Public Health, and Animal Reservoirs). Some of these diseases are already present in Europe (tick- and rodent-borne diseases, leishmaniasis, West Nile fever); others were present historically (malaria) and so may re-emerge, whilst others are on the fringes of Europe (Rift Valley fever) in endemic regions of West and Northern Africa.

      <comment>/* Dynamic link libraries */ changed 'containing' to 'that contains'</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dynamic link libraries ==
'''Dynamic Link Libraries''' (DLLs) were introduced with the first releases of the Microsoft Windows operating system, and today are a fundamental structural component of the OS. They are found not only on the OS core, but as part of many of the frameworks created by Microsoft like the MFC, ATL, .NET, etc, even C and the C++ runtime libraries are distributed as DLLs.

DLLs allow certain code fragments to be compiled into a single library, and to be linked to by multiple programs. This means that only one copy of the library needs to exist, and multiple programs can share the functions and the data between them. The Windows system makes itself accessible, in several of its user-space features, by providing DLLs that programmers can use.  

The difference between a DLL and a static library is that when you compile your programs, the DLL is not compiled into your executable, but instead remains a separate module. This feature helps to keep executable size low, and also allows for a DLL to be loaded into memory only when it is needed. As a self contained entity a DLL also permits kick and target updates to the system and to applications. By simply replacing a DLL with a newer version that contains fixes or improvements, it is easy to extend the alteration to multiple dependent programs instantly.

The exact method of building a DLL file is dependent on the compiler you are using. However, the way in which DLLs are programmed is universal. We will talk about how to program DLL files in this chapter.

=== DLL hell ===
The common problem referred generically as &quot;[[w:DLL hell|DLL hell]]&quot; has always been a bane to Windows programmers and it really doesn't seem to have a solution in the horizon. The problem was stated in the 90s and there was when the term was coined. The issue is on the permissibility of the OS to let incorrect DLLs version to be loaded upon the request from an application, that would invariably lead to a crash. Today an application will simply refuse to run.

== __declspec ==

The '''__declspec''' keyword is a strange new keyword that is not part of the ANSI C standard, but that most compilers will understand anyway. '''__declspec''' allows a variety of non-standard options to be specified, that will affect the way a program runs. Specifically, there are two '''__declspec''' identifiers that we want to discuss:

*__declspec(dllexport)
*__declspec(dllimport)

When writing a DLL, we need to use the '''dllexport''' keyword to denote functions that are going to be available to other programs. Functions without this keyword will only be available for use from inside the library itself. Here is an example:

 __declspec(dllexport) int MyFunc1(int foo)

The '''__declspec''' identifier for a function needs to be specified both in the function prototype and the function declaration, when building a DLL.

To &quot;import&quot; a DLL function into a regular program, the program must link to the DLL, and the program must prototype the function to be imported, using the '''dllimport''' keyword, as such:

 __declspec(dllimport) int MyFunc1(int foo);

Now the program can use the function as normal, even though the function exists in an external library. The compiler works with Windows to handle all the details for you.

Many people find it useful to define a single header file for their DLL, instead of maintaining one header file for building a DLL, and one header file for importing a DLL. Here is a macro that is common in DLL creation:

 #ifdef BUILDING_DLL
 #define DLL_FUNCTION __declspec(dllexport)
 #else
 #define DLL_FUNCTION __declspec(dllimport)
 #endif

Now, to build the DLL, we need to define the '''BUILDING_DLL''' macro, and when we are importing the DLL, we don't need to use that macro. Functions then can be prototyped as such:

 DLL_FUNCTION int MyFunc1(void);
 DLL_FUNCTION int MyFunc2(void);
 .......

(just a note: Microsoft did not intend for this __declspec syntax to be used. Instead the intention was that the public api of a DLL would be declared in an &quot;exports&quot; file. However the above syntax, despite requiring the macro to switch it back and forth, was much more convenient and is pretty much used by all software today).

== DllMain ==

When Windows links a DLL to a program, Windows calls the library's '''DllMain''' function. This means that every DLL needs to have a DllMain function. The DllMain function needs to be defined as such:

 BOOL APIENTRY DllMain (HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)

The keywords &quot;BOOL&quot;, &quot;APIENTRY&quot;, &quot;HINSTANCE&quot;, etc., are all defined in &lt;windows.h&gt;. So, you must include that file even if you don't use any Win32 API functions in your library.

'''APIENTRY''' is just a keyword that Windows uses internally. So, you don't need to worry about it. The variable &quot;hInstance&quot; is the HINSTANCE handle for the library, and you can keep this and use it, or you can trash it. '''reason''' will be one of four different values:

;DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: a new program has just linked to the library for the first time.
;DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: a program has unlinked the library.
;DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: a thread from a program has linked to the library.
;DLL_THREAD_DETACH: a thread from a program has just unlinked the library.

The DllMain function doesn't need to do anything special for these cases, although some libraries will find it useful to allocate storage for each new thread or process that is being used with the library.

The DllMain function must return TRUE if the library loaded successfully, or FALSE if the library had an error and could not load. If you return FALSE, the program will pop up a warning message and crash.

Here is a general template for a DllMain function:

 BOOL APIENTRY DllMain (HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD reason, LPVOID lpReserved)
 {
    switch (reason)
    {
      case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        break;
      case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
      case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        break;
      case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
 }

However, if you aren't interested in any of the reasons, you can remove the entire switch statement from your program and return TRUE.

== Linking a DLL ==

DLL libraries can be linked to an executable in two ways: Statically and Dynamically.

=== Static Linking to a DLL ===

When static linking to a DLL, the linker will do all the work, and it will be transparent to the programmer that the functions are located in an external library. That is, it will be transparent if the library writer has properly used the _DECLSPEC modifier in the library's header file.

When compiling a DLL, the compiler will generate two files: the DLL library file, and a static-linking stub .LIB file. The .LIB file acts like a mini static library, that tells the linker to statically link the associated DLL file. When using a DLL in a project, you can either provide the linker with the .LIB stub file, or some linkers allow you to specify the DLL directly (and the linker will then try to find the .LIB file, or may even attempt to create the .LIB file automatically).

=== Loading DLLs Dynamically ===

The real power behind DLL files is that they can be loaded into your program dynamically at execution time. This means that while your program is running, it can search for and load in new components, without needing to be recompiled. This is an essential mechanism for programs that allow plugins and extensions to be loaded at execution time. To Dynamically load the DLL file, you can call the '''LoadLibrary''' function to get a handle to that library, and then pass that handle to one of several other functions to retrieve data from the DLL. The prototype for LoadLibrary is:

 HMODULE WINAPI LoadLibrary(LPCTSTR lpFileName);

HMODULE is a HANDLE to a program module. ''lpFileName'' is the file name of the DLL you want to load. Keep in mind that when loading a module, the system will check in your PATH first. If you want the system to check in other specified directories first, use the '''SetDllDirectory''' function first.

Once a DLL is loaded, and you have a handle to the module, you can do various things:

*Use '''GetProcAddress''' to return a function pointer to a function in that library.
*Use '''LoadResource''' to retrieve a resource from the DLL.

Once you are finished with a DLL file, and you want to remove it from memory, you can call the '''FreeLibrary''' function with the DLL's module handle.

==URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) / Common cold==

&lt;p&gt;Common. Take temperature and ask the patient the following:
Hot and shivery? / muscle pains? (signs of systemic viraemia)
Cough +/- sputum? (associated chest infection)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viraemia carries a risk of cardiac involvement with a predisposition to perioperative cardiac arrhythmias (dysrhythmias).&lt;br&gt;Associated chest infection may worsen with either general or major regional anaesthesia (impaired cough and ciliary escalator). Elective surgery should be postponed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apyrexial (&lt;37.5°C) and no muscle pains or cough: probably OK to proceed with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: the prodromal period of many systemic viral illnesses is indistinguishable from the typical short-lived URTI. The patient recovering from major surgery may find this complicated by a developing viral illness. &lt;p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What are the Rules of Accounting? ==

'''Accounting''' is the mechanism used to record activities and transactions that occur within a business.. In its simplest terms, Accounting is the &quot;language of business.&quot; However, in order to have an understandable record, a standard set of rules for accounting within the U.S. has been established. These rules are called the '''Generally Accepted Accounting Principles''' (GAAP), and all U.S. businesses are expected to follow them. 

The '''first general rule''' of accounting is that every transaction is recorded. It has been said that businesses that do not record transactions, or incorrectly record transactions, are committing fraud, although this is not necessarily the case. Fraud is part of a much broader area called material misstatement which also can include error. An error is not necessarily fraud under the law. While there are exceptions to this rule, the guidance for applying those exceptions is specifically defined by GAAP, and is applicable to all businesses.

The '''second general rule''' of accounting is that transactions are recorded using what is called a &quot;double-entry&quot; accounting method. Originally developed in Italy in the 1400s, double-entry means that for a complete record of a transaction, two entries are made.'' For example, if you have $5 in cash, and want to buy some gasoline for your lawn mower, you take your portable gas can and your money to the gas station and exchange $5 in cash for $5 in gas. This transaction is recorded as an increase in the asset &quot;gas&quot; for $5, and a corresponding reduction in the asset &quot;cash&quot; for $5. In this example, one transaction contained two entries.'' This takes a little time to get used to, but it is a critical concept in basic accounting. Double entry is tied to the concept of Debits and Credits, which you will learn about in the next section. The act of recording transactions is commonly referred to as making journal entries. In a few more paragraphs, we'll discuss what a journal entry looks like.

The '''third general rule''' of accounting is that every recorded transaction is captured in a log called the &quot;General Journal.&quot;

In general, &quot;Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, summarizing and interpreting a business transaction.&quot;

To make this easier, we can follow the golden rules of accounting.  Accounts are one of three basic types:

&lt;!-- Mostly copied from [[wiki:Double-entry_bookkeeping_system#Account_types_.28nature.29]] --&gt;

Example: The ''Sales'' account is opened for recording the sales of goods or services. At the end of the financial period, the total sales are transferred to the revenue statement account (''Profit and Loss Account'' or ''Income and Expenditure Account'').

Similarly, expenses during the financial period are recorded using the respective ''Expense'' accounts, which are also transferred to the revenue statement account.
The net positive or negative balance (profit or loss) of the revenue statement account is transferred to reserves or capital account as the case may be.&lt;!-- End copied portion --&gt;

== The Nature of Accounts: Definitions ==

An ''''account'''' is a specific location for recording transactions of a like kind. For example, in the gas-for-cash transaction above, two accounts are used, a &quot;Cash&quot; account and a &quot;Gas&quot; account. Unused by that example, but described is an account for &quot;Equipment&quot; which would include the portable gas can and the lawn mower.

The basic types of accounts are:

''''Assets:'''' items of value that the company owns or has right to. Examples include: cash, real estate, equipment, money or services that others owe you, and even intangible items such as patents and copyrights.

''''Liabilities:'''' obligations that are owed to other parties. Examples include: wages payable, taxes due, and borrowed money (also called debt).

''''Equity:'''' the ownership value of a company. Examples include: common stock and retained earnings (we'll describe retained earning below in &quot;Financial Statements&quot;)

''''Revenues:'''' the mechanisms where income enters the company (note that revenue and income are not the same thing--they are used here to describe each other in basic terms only).

''''Expenses:'''' the costs of doing business. Examples include: salary expense, rent, utilities expense, and interest on borrowed money.

''''Income:'''' in U.S. business and financial accounting, the term 'income' is also synonymous with revenue; however, many people use it as shorthand for net income, which is the amount of money that a company earns after covering all of its costs.

== Overview of the accounting cycle ==

&lt;!-- This section can discuss the process of journalizing your transactions, then posting those transactions. --&gt;
When a transaction occurs, a document is produced. Most of the time, these documents are external to the business, however, they can also be internal documents, such as inter-office sales. These documents are referred to as a source document. Some examples of source documents are:
* The receipt you get when you purchase something at the store.
* Interest you earned on your savings account which is documented in your monthly bank statement.
* The monthly electric utility bill that comes in the mail.

These source documents are then recorded in a '''Journal'''. This is also known as a '''book of first entry'''. The journal records both sides of the transaction recorded by the source document. These write-ups are known as '''Journal entries'''.

These Journal entries are then transferred to a '''Ledger'''.The group of accounts is called ledger. A ledger is also known as a '''book of accounts'''. The purpose of a Ledger is to bring together all of the transactions for similar activity. For example, if a company has one bank account, then all transactions that include cash would then be maintained in the Cash Ledger. This process of transferring the values is known as '''posting'''.

Once the entries have all been posted, the Ledger accounts are added up in a process called '''Balancing'''. (This will make much more sense when you learn about Debits and Credits. Balancing implies that the sum of all Debits equals the sum of all Credits.)

A particular '''working document''' called an '''unadjusted trial balance''' is created. This lists all the balances from all the accounts in the '''Ledger'''. Notice that the values are not posted to the trial balance, they are merely copied.

At this point accounting happens. The accountant produces a number of '''adjustments''' which make sure that the values comply with accounting principles. These values are then passed through the accounting system resulting in an '''adjusted trial balance'''. This process continues until the accountant is satisfied.

[[../Financial statements/]] are drawn from the trial balance which may include:
*the [[../Income statement/]]

===Debits and Credits===

For the purposes of accounting, please forget what you know about credits and debits. In accounting, debit (Dr.) and credit (Cr.) have nothing to do with plastic cards that let you buy stuff. In fact, what most beginning accounting students need to know about Dr/Cr can be boiled down to two sentences.

&lt;center&gt;'''Debit is on the left. Credit is on the right.'''&lt;/center&gt;
How are debit and credit rules applied to different types of accounts?

{{center|
'''DEBIT'''......NATURE OF A/Cs.......'''CREDIT'''

Increase.........'''ASSETS'''........Decrease&lt;br/&gt;
Decrease......'''LIABILITIES'''......Increase&lt;br/&gt;
Decrease.........'''REVENUE'''.......Increase&lt;br/&gt;
Decrease.........'''EQUITY'''........Increase&lt;br/&gt;
Increase........'''EXPENSES'''.......Decrease&lt;br/&gt;
Increase........'''DRAWINGS'''.......Decrease&lt;br/&gt;
}}

In case of ASSETS and EXPENSES; increases go to the debit side, while decreases go to credit side. On the other hand, in case of LIABILITIES, REVENUE and EQUITY; increases go to the credit side and decreases go to debit side.

An account will have either a &quot;'''normal credit balance'''&quot; or a &quot;'''normal debit balance'''&quot;, depending on the type of account. The normal balance indicates which side of the account the amount goes to when the account balance increases. For example, the account 'Cash' has a normal debit balance: receiving cash results in a debit entry, spending it results in a credit entry.

Debits and credits may be derived from the ''fundamental accounting equation''. They result from the nature of double entry bookkeeping.  Two entries are made in each balanced transaction, a debit and a credit.  This allows the accounts to be balanced to check for entry or transaction recording errors.

{{bookkeeping journal
|name=Example
|page=1
|entry=
{{bookkeeping entry|date=2005&lt;br/&gt;Feb|day=1|description=account1|dr=350}}
{{bookkeeping entry|description=account2|cr=350}}
}}

''Owner's Equity = Assets - Liabilities''  is written from the perspective of the owner.  In accounting this is generally rewritten from the perspective of the business or commercial entity the books detail:

''Assets = Owner's Equity + Liabilities'' (Fundamental Accounting Equation)

Entries in the books are in pairs and track the advantage or asset of the company simultaneously with the disadvantage or liability.  In this view the Owner's equity is a claim of the investor against the company.

* On the left side or ''Assets'' side of the Fundamental Accounting Equation:
** Transaction halves which increase the business assets are &quot;debits&quot; on the left side of the equation.  
** Transaction halves which decrease the business assets are &quot;credits&quot;.  
* On the right or balancing side or ''Owner's Equity + Liabilities'':
** Transaction halves (i.e. the part of the transaction) that increase the Owner's Equity are credits to the company books as they are claims of what the company owes the owner or investor
** Transaction halves that decrease the Owner's Equity (dividends paid or loss writeoffs) are beneficial to the company's future financial position by reducing claims and are considered debits.
** Liabilities incurred by the business entity (which are tracked by the books) are credits
** Liabilities reduced or paid off are debits.

==Separate Entity Concept==

Even when a business has a single owner we make a distinction between the owner's assets and the assets of the business.  For example if the owner gives a van to the business this will count as capital introduced, if the owner takes a salary this will be accounted for as drawings.Famous case laws are &quot;salomon vs salomon &amp; co.ltd&quot;,Lee vs Lee's air farming ltd.&quot; etc


=== Journal Entries ===

All accounting transactions are first recorded in a ''journal''. The most common of these is the '''General Journal''', sometimes also known as the Book of Original Entry, because it is the first place a transaction is entered into the books. Journal Entries are made from ''source documents'', which can be anything from receipts to invoices to bank statements.

{{bookkeeping journal
|name=General
|page=1
|entry=
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2005&lt;br/&gt;Jan| day = 1| description = Cash | dr = 10,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Sales | cr = 10,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = ''To record cash sales.''}}
{{bookkeeping entry}}
{{bookkeeping entry| day = 6 | description = Equipment | dr = 15,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Accounts Payable | cr = 15,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = ''To record purchase or equipment on credit'' }}
}}

These two entries show the premise of ''double-entry accounting''. Note that the ''form'' of what is written is as important as the actual text:
*Debits are always recorded first, followed by the credits.
*In keeping with the rule of &quot;Debit = Left, Credit = Right&quot;, all accounts that are credited have their titles indented (&quot;Sales&quot; and &quot;Accounts Payable&quot; in this example).
*The year and month are only recorded once in the date column. They are recorded again at the top of every new page, and whenever the month or year changes. However, a new page is usually started at the beginning of each month, because end-of-period entries are normally recorded on a separate page.
*A description of each entry is placed on the line below the entry. While this is not required, it is good practice because, at times, account titles may not be enough to describe what actually occurred for a specific transaction.
*A blank line is inserted between entries.

The process of recording entries to a journal is called '''journalizing'''.

=== T-Accounts ===

&lt;pre&gt;
Form:                              Example:
    Account Name                          Cash
    -------------                     -------------
    Debit | Credit                  $700.00 |  50.00
          |                           65.00 |  80.00
   _______|_______                  ________|_______
 Subtotal | Subtotal                 765.00 |  130.00
   _______|_______                  ________|_______
  Balance | Balance                 $635.00 |
&lt;/pre&gt;
One representation of an account is called the '''T-account''', shown above. A T-account contains just the basic elements of the account, so it lacks the necessary detail for use in bookkeeping operations. However, it has its uses as both an illustrative tool and a quick reference.

Each account needs to have a unique ''Account Name'', such as Cash, for ease of reference later on. In modern accounting systems, you will often see an account number alongside the name in order to facilitate report generation and computer entry. Under the bar are the debit (from the Latin ''debere'', to owe) and credit (''credere'', to believe) columns.

As it shows in the example above, the balance of a T-account can be figured by first totaling each column. Second, subtract the smaller subtotal from the larger, and finally placing the total in the larger number's column.

=== Ledger Accounts ===

While a T-Account is useful for quickly summarising an account's balance, it only contains a fraction of the information that was recorded in the Journal.

===Types of Accounts===

&lt;center&gt;'''Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity'''&lt;/center&gt;

A central axiom for accounting is the accounting equation above. Depending on the type of company involved, Owner's Equity may be &quot;Shareholder's&quot; or simply &quot;Equity&quot;, but the equation holds. The list of all of the accounts (along with their respective account numbers) is called the '''Chart of Accounts'''

'''Asset accounts''' indicate what a company owns. This can be actual possession or the right to take possession, such as a loan extended to another company. Some assets are identifiable by the term ''&quot;Receivable&quot;''. Assets have a normal debit balance.

'''Liability accounts''' indicate what a company owes to others. Examples of liabilities include loans to be repayed and services that have been paid for that the company hasn't performed yet. Many liabilities can be identified by the term ''&quot;Payable&quot;'' in their account name. Liabilities have a normal credit balance.

'''Equity accounts''' are a group of accounts that represent the amount of owner's equity in the business. There are four main types of Equity accounts:

*'''Revenue accounts''' indicate revenue generated by the normal operations of a business. Fees Earned and Sales are both examples of Revenue accounts. Revenue accounts have a normal credit balance.

*'''Expense accounts''' indicate the expenses incurred by a business during normal operations. Most account names ending in ''&quot;Expense&quot;'' are classified as expenses. Expenses have a normal debit balance.

*The '''Owner's Equity''' or '''Owner's Capital''' accounts (for a Proprietorship/Partnership) or the '''Shareholder's Equity''' accounts (for a Corporation) indicate the owner's equity in the business. As the accounting equation indicates, equity is the difference between the assets of the company, and the company's debts. Equity accounts are directly affected by Revenue and Expenses, and the standard Equity accounts have Credit balances.

*'''Dividends''' represents equity removed from the business by the owners. In a proprietorship or partnership, each owner has an '''Owner's Withdrawals''' account. In a corporation, equity is removed by way of dividends, and a Withdrawal account is not needed. Since these accounts represent capital removed from the business, they have a Debit balance.

The effects of debits and credits on the types of accounts is shown on the following table:

==== Summary of types of account ====
The main axiom to remember is that :
*  ''Assets = liabilities + equity''' 
* Debits and credits are opposite , for any one type of account.
* At the first level of the equation,  on the left, debits increase, on the right, credits increase.
* Common assets accounts, that are short-term, liquid, or current,  are cash in bank, accounts receivable, inventory. They are on the left.
* common non-current asset accounts include property , plant and equipment. They are on the left, however changes to their value is accumulated in contra-asset accounts, called accumulated depreciation, and hence they are contra to debit being positive, credits increase accumulated depreciation. They can be thought of as negative asset accounts on the left, paired with a non-current asset account which shows cost value, or revaluation value, in which case they are also paired with a revaluation reserve account to show the amount of revaluation ( in order for the above equation to stay in  balance after revaluation).
* Common current liability accounts  are accounts payable, bills payable, salaries payable. They are on the right , so credit increases the liability and debit decreases.
* common non-current liability accounts include bank loans , debentures and mortgage payable, which all incur interest expense and are either repaid in full or incrementally over time with cash in bank. These are on the right too, so an initial credit establishes the long term liability, and debits coupled with cash in bank credits (decrease) account for repayment.
* Common equity accounts are divided according to the entity type: for a sole trader, it is owner capital ; for partnerships, there is a owner capital account for each partner; for companies, there is shareholder's equity, and a retained earnings account to hold accumulated profits. Equity is on the right, so ''credit increases equity''.
* Other accounts arise from temporary , periodic operations, and are '''temporary accounts'''. They mainly deal with recording accumulated changes to equity, and are usually divided into Incomes and Expenses. ''Income accounts move equity positively, so Credit increases Income accounts''. ''Expenses move equity negatively'', so increase in these accounts  decreases equity, ie in the same direction as Debit, so ''Debits increase expense accounts''.
* Common income accounts are  (operating) revenue, dividends, interest, gains.
* Common expense accounts are (operating) expenses such as Cost of Goods sold, salary expense, utilities expense (telephone, electricity), rent expense, insurance expense.
* When equity decreases, assets decrease by the same amount, or liability increases, in order to meet the equation. 
* As expense accounts decrease equity, they usual decrease assets , usually as a decrease in cash in bank. 
* A special type of expense is depreciation, which decreases non-cash / non-current assets, and for depreciable assets, usually there is a contra-asset account set up, called accumulated depreciation for each type of asset, to record the accumulated depreciation expense. When the accumulated depreciation equals the current assessed value of the non-cash asset, the asset can be disposed of, and ''written-down'' , so both the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the statement of accounts.
* Another special type of expense is bad debts expense, as they also do not decrease cash asset directly, but decrease accounts receivable asset. There is a contra-asset account which records bad debt expense accrued estimation,''allowance for bad debts'', which is eventually balanced in the equation with a decrease in accounts receivable asset when bad debts are determined to have occurred, and are ''written down'', and accounts receivable asset as well as the allowance have the amount determined to be bad debt ''written off''. ''Allowance for impairment of accounts receivables'' is another name for the allowance account, and it is deducted from the accounts receivables account on the balance sheet , in order to show that the accounting equation balances in the period when the estimated bad debts expense is incurred.

==Basic Accounting Principles==

'''Historical Cost Principle:'''
Assets and liabilities should be recorded at the price at which they were acquired. This is to ensure a reliable price; market values can fluctuate and be different between differing opinions, so the price of acquisition is used.

'''Matching Principle:'''
Expenses should be matched with revenues. The expense is recorded in the time period it is incurred, which means the time period that the expense is used to generate revenue. This means that you can pay for an expense months before it is actually recorded, as the expense is matched to the period the revenue is made.

'''Revenue Recognition Principle:'''
Revenues should not be recorded until the earnings process is almost complete and there is little uncertainty as to whether or not collection of payment will occur. This means that revenue is recorded when it is earned, which means the job is complete.

== Financial Statements==

The '''Income statement''' is a list of all inflows and outflows of economic benefits(revenues and expenses).

The '''statement of cash flows''' is a listing of the inflows and outflows of cash.

It follows the general subdivision of business activity into trying to make money by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.  ''Operating activities'' include the main business that is concentrated on, and paying taxes on this business, as well as interest for liabilities from owning non-current assets such as machinery to run the business. ''Investing activities'' include cash used for investment in plant and equipment or recovered from sale of plant or equipment, and  money made outside of the main business activity using resources available from the business : this include investing cash available in other investments , receiving cash   interest or dividends from continuing other investment. ''Financial activities'' are cash activities undertaken when other entities  invest in the operations of the main business. So finance activities include cash from issuing shares in the company, cash given as dividends to shareholders, cash from borrowing and cash out due to borrowing repayment .

Hence this derives a list of activities to account for cash flow:
* operating activities - cash from operations : customer receipts, and supplier payments ; cash paid for taxes; cash paid as interest for borrowings to operate plant and equipment.
* investing activities - cash out for purchase plant and equipment, and cash in from sale of these ; cash put in other investments; cash received from dividends received and from interest earned related to running other investments.
* finance activities - cash in from issuing shares, cash out from payment of dividends  ; cash in from borrowing money, cash out for repayment of borrowing

A few items are reported as netted if they are sufficiently short term or liquid ( such as other investments, equity shareholding changes) : e.g. &quot;quick turnover, short maturity and large - AASB 7&quot;;, but many items are required to be reported as gross i.e. cash out and cash in for the same type of item are required to be reported separately e.g. property sale and purchase, interest paid and interest earned , borrowings and repayment of borrowings.

== Basic Accounting  Classes Course Notes ==

* ALL accounting transactions are entered as journal entries consisting of the Account name, and either a debit (left side) amount or credit (right side) amount. For each entry the debits and credits must balance, and overall on the trial balance (lists all the debits and credits for all the accounts) must always balance.

* There are 5 main classes of Accounts:	
					
** '''Assets''': Anything of value that the business owns. This includes tangible assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, buildings, and machinery, as well as intangible assets such as copyrights, trademarks, and goodwill. Asset accounts normally have a Debit (left side) balance. In transaction entries, a debit to an asset account shows an increase in its amount, while a credit (right side) indicates a decrease in the asset value.
*** Example: Buying Equipment for Cash. One asset (Equipment) increases, and therefore it is Debited. Cash, which is also an asset, is decreased with a Credit.
  Equipment (debit)			$40,000
      Cash (credit)			     $40,000

** '''Liabilities''': Debts and obligations that the business owes. This includes accounts payable, payroll liabilities, and long term debts (such as bonds). Liabilities accounts normally have a Credit (right side) balance. In transaction entries, a credit to a liability account signifies an increase in its amount, while a debit (left side) indicates a decrease in the liability value.
*** Example: Buying Inventory on credit. Merchandise Inventory (an asset) increases with a debit, and Accounts Payable (a liability) also increases with a credit.
  Merchandise Inventory (debit)	$100,000
      Accounts Payable (credit)		     $100,000

** '''Equity''': This is essentially the value that accrues (accumulates) to the owners (shareholders, sole trader…). This ranges from Partner 1’s capital, Partner 1’s profits, retained earnings, etc. Equity accounts normally have a Credit (right side) balance. In transaction entries in the journals, a credit to an equity account signifies an increase in its amount, while a debit (left side) indicates a decrease in the equity value.  Always keep the accounting equation in mind:
                 Assets = Liabilities + Equity				
Since Assets normally have a Debit balance and both liabilities &amp; equity normally have a credit balance, therefore applying the equation above, we always check that the trial balance has a NET value of Zero (the total debits and credits should match).

** '''Revenue''': This is the entire amount of income made through the sale of goods/services, and is sometimes referred to as Income or Sales. Depending on the nature of the goods / services being sold, companies track this account either as one big account (e.g. Sales) or as many separate accounts (e.g. Sales Prod 1, Sales Prod 2, Freight Income etc.). Revenue accounts normally have a Credit (right side) balance, and therefore a credit to a revenue account signifies an increase in its amount, while a debit (left side) indicates a decrease in the revenue amount.  A decrease of revenue would take place in circumstances such as for example sales returns and discounts (explained further down).
*** Example: Recording cash sales. Cash is debited because it is an increase in an asset account, and Sales is credited because a Revenue account is increased.
      Cash (debit)		       $112,000
      Sales (credit)			     $112,000
							
** '''Expenses''': These are the general costs of doing business. This would include operating expenses such as Salaries Expense, Rent Expense, and Advertising Expense, as well as non-operating expenses such as Loss on Sale of Assets. Expense accounts normally have a Debit (left side) balance. In transaction entries, a debit to an expense account signifies an increase in its amount, while a credit indicates a decrease (which rarely occurs, unless an error needs to be corrected).	
*** Example: The company rents office space at $15,000 per month. Rent Expense is debited, and Cash is credited.
  Rent Expense (debit)		$15,000
      Cash (credit)			     $15,000

* Some very important aspects to remember in addition to the above: 		
		
** '''Depreciation, Amortization, and Depletion''' are used to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life.  Depreciation is the allocation over time of tangible assets, Amortization is the allocation over time of intangible assets and Depletion is the allocation over time of natural resources.'''Accumulated depreciation''' is a contra-asset account (with a normal Credit balance) used to keep a running total of the depreciation to date. The book value of any asset at any time is the Original Cost less any accumulated depreciation. Contra-asset accounts are listed in the assets section of the balance sheet along with the corresponding asset account, making it easier to see what the assets original cost was and what it is presently valued at. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable is also a contra-asset account with a normal credit balance which is netted against the Accounts Receivable account.

			
** '''Sales Returns and Allowances &amp; Sales Discounts''' are '''contra-revenue accounts''', and the normal balance of this account is a Debit. These are used to offset the revenue credit balance. 

								
** '''Cost of Goods Sold''' (COGS): This account is used to track how much you paid for goods / material that was held in inventory until it was sold. COGS normally is a debit balance.  This account is recorded in entries when a sale is made, and COGS is debited for the cost, while inventory is credited (asset account=&gt;decreased) for the cost.	

						
** '''Credit Notes/memo/refunds''' are used to refund customers if they return products bought from the company. The entry for this transaction is usually :
      Revenue (Debit)		sale price
      Inventory (Debit)                     Cost of product
                COGS (Credit)               Cost of product
                Cash or A/R (Credit)	    sale price

* a summary :
  assets ( current asset (cash in bank + accounts receivables - allowance for bad debts)  + ( non-current asset - accumulated depreciation) ) 
   = liability ( current liability + non-current liability ) 
   + equity ( capital + ( issued share equity + retained earnings ) 
   + change in equity ( income (revenue + gains )  - expenses ( operating + depreciation + bad debt ) - drawings )

      <text xml:space="preserve">Antipsychotics interact with a number of receptors, including dopamine receptors, the receptor system involved in psychosis, which is theorized to occur as a result of a functional excess of dopamine in certain parts of the brain.  Many antipsychotics work by targeting dopamine receptors, such that dopamine levels are reduced.  Antagonism of the dopamine D2 receptor subtype, is one well characeterized mechanism of action, although other receptors, including non-dopamine receptors, are involved, depending on the antipsychotic.

The older antipsychotics are also known as &quot;typical antipsychotics&quot; or &quot;first generation antipsychotics&quot;. More recently developed antipyschotics are also known as &quot;atypical antipsychotics&quot; or &quot;second generation antipsychotics&quot;. The atypical or second generation antipsychotics are also active at other receptors, including serotonin receptors, such that side effects, especially motor ones, are thought to be reduced. Neuroleptics is another commonly used name, although its use has fallen out of favor.

Well known antipsychotics include haloperidol (Haldol) and chlorpromazine (Thorazine), which are older agents. The newer agents, many developed near the 1990's, include risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), and aripiprazole (Abilify). Aripiprazole is thought to be a dopamine system stabilizer in that it acts as a funtional antagonist of dopamine where dopamine levels are in excess and a functional agonist where dopamine levels are low.

'Species re-introduction' is a process to establish a plant or animal in an area which was once part of its historical range, but from which it has been extirpated or become extinct.  'Species re-establishment' is a synonym, which usually implies that the re-introduction has been successful. The term translocation is used to describe the deliberate and mediated movement of wild individuals or populations from one part of their range to another. Reinforcement or supplementation means the addition of individuals to an existing population.

'Benign introduction' is a process to establish a species, for the purpose of conservation, outside its recorded distribution but within an appropriate habitat and eco-geographical area.

Zoos, aquaria, marine parks, insect houses, botanical gardens - all have their role to play in captive breeding of plants and animals to provide stocks for reintroductions, be it by actually conducting captive breeding, or providing expertise and help. It is estimated that there are about 500,000 animals in captivity in zoos throughout the world. However, it is widely believed that for best results, captive breeding must be done with minimum human contact. The survival of up to 60,000 plant species - about a quarter of the world's total - will be threatened over the next few decades by population growth, deforestation, habitat loss, destructive development and agricultural expansion.  Human survival is threatened by the destruction of plants on such a massive scale. In addition to the small number of crop plants we use for our basic food, many wild plants also have great economic importance, providing food, fuel, clothing and shelter for hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. Plants also supply medicines, especially in developing countries where vast numbers depend on wild plants for their traditional remedies. Plants also help maintain the planet's environmental balance and ecosystem stability and provide habitats for the world's animal life. 

===Botanical Gardens===

[[File:Botanical_garden_-_Cibodas_-_Indonesia_5.jpg|right|400px|Cibodas Botanical Garden in Java, Indonesia]]

There are about 1,600 botanic gardens in the world. They grow tens of thousands of plant species between them; probably as much as a quarter of all the world's flowering plants and ferns are in their collections. The increasing rate of the loss of plant diversity and wild habitats worldwide has encouraged many botanic gardens to become important conservation centres. 

In many countries, botanic gardens are amongst the leading, and sometimes the only, institutions involved in or capable of undertaking extensive work in wild plant research and conservation. Many new botanic gardens are being opened or developed to act as centres for plant conservation, study and education, particularly of plants native to their own regions. 

Botanic gardens can be defined as public gardens which maintain collections of live plants mainly for study; for scientific research, conservation or education. Many different types of botanic gardens occur, large and small. While their size and resources varies hugely, botanic gardens are united in the belief of the important role that they must play in preserving the world's plant diversity. 

* Botanical gardens grow large collections of endangered plants, holding them safely in cultivation or seed banks in case wild populations are destroyed. 
* They reintroduce plants back to wild as part of species recovery projects. 
* They undertake botanical research to document and record the plants of the world and their characteristics. For example, their collections of dried plants (herbaria) contain millions of specimens as a permanent global reference on plant diversity. 
* They promote environmental awareness amongst the general public through their education work. Globally, botanic gardens receive more that 150 million visitors each year. 
* They are expert centres for horticulture and training; knowing how to grow a plant may be a key to its future survival.

===Zoos and Other Institutions for Animal Breeding===

A commonly stated aim of many captive breeding programmes conducted in zoological parks is to produce founder populations for release into the wild in reintroduction programmes.  Not many zoos possess the know-how for seriously managing captive populations, though that is a situation that is rapidly changing. With new technology, like molecular and DNA analysis, species management has become easier and helps scientists avoid potential pitfalls. For example, mapping genealogical information also helps minimising inbreeding. 

Policy guidelines have been drafted by the Re-introduction Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in response to the increasing occurrence of re-introduction projects worldwide, and consequently, to the growing need for specific policy guidelines to help ensure that the re-introductions achieve their intended conservation benefit, and do not cause adverse side-effects of greater impact.

These guidelines are intended to act as a guide for procedures useful to re-introduction programmes and do not represent an inflexible code of conduct. Many of the points are more relevant to re-introductions using captive-bred individuals than to translocations of wild species. Others are especially relevant to globally endangered species with limited numbers of founders. Each re-introduction proposal should be rigorously reviewed on its individual merits. It should be noted that re-introduction is always a very lengthy, complex and expensive process.  The following sections which illustrate the requirement to integrate ecological knowledge with re-introduction, have been taken from the guidelines.

==Aims and objectives== 

The principal aim of any re-introduction should be to establish a viable, free-ranging population in the wild, of a species, subspecies or race, which has become globally or locally extinct, or extirpated, in the wild. It should be re-introduced within the species' former natural habitat and range and should require minimal long-term management.

The objectives of a re-introduction may include: to enhance the long-term survival of a species; to re-establish a keystone species (in the ecological or cultural sense) in an ecosystem; to maintain and/or restore natural biodiversity; to provide long-term economic benefits to the local and/or nataional economy; to promote conservation awareness; or a combination of these.

A re-introduction requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of persons drawn from a variety of backgrounds. As well as government personnel, they may include persons from governmental natural resource management agencies; non-governmental organisations; funding bodies; universities; veterinary institutions; zoos (and private animal breeders) and/or botanic gardens, with a full range of suitable expertise. Team leaders should be responsible for coordination between the various bodies and provision should be made for publicity and public education about the project.

===Biological===

::(i) Feasibility study and background research

An assessment should be made of the taxonomic status of individuals to be re-introduced. They should preferably be of the same subspecies or race as those which were extirpated, unless adequate numbers are not available. An investigation of historical information about the loss and fate of individuals from the re-introduction area, as well as molecular genetic studies, should be undertaken in case of doubt as to individuals' taxonomic status. A study of genetic variation within and between populations of this and related taxa can also be helpful. Special care is needed when the population has long been extinct. 

:Detailed studies should be made of the status and biology of wild populations(if they exist) to determine the species' critical needs. For animals, this would include descriptions of habitat preferences, intraspecific variation and adaptations to local ecological conditions, social behaviour, group composition, home range size, shelter and food requirements, foraging and feeding behaviour, predators and diseases. For migratory species, studies should include the potential migratory areas. For plants, it would include biotic and abiotic habitat requirements, dispersal mechanisms, reproductive biology, symbiotic relationships (e.g. with mycorrhizae, pollinators), insect pests and diseases. Overall, a firm knowledge of the natural history of the species in question is crucial to the entire re-introduction scheme.
 
:The species, if any, that has filled the void created by the loss of the species concerned, should be determined; an understanding of the effect the re-introduced species will have on the ecosystem is important for ascertaining the success of the re-introduced population. 

:The build-up of the released population should be modelled under various sets of conditions, in order to specify the optimal number and composition of individuals to be released per year and the numbers of years necessary to promote establishment of a viable population.
 
:A Population and Habitat Viability Analysis will aid in identifying significant environmental and population variables and assessing their potential interactions, which would guide long-term population management.
 
::(ii) Previous Re-introductions

:Thorough research into previous re-introductions of the same or similar species and wide-ranging contacts with persons having relevant expertise should be conducted prior to and while developing re-introduction protocol. 

::(iii) Choice of release site and type

:Site should be within the historic range of the species. For an initial re-inforcement there should be few remnant wild individuals. For a re-introduction, there should be no remnant population to prevent disease spread, social disruption and introduction of alien genes. In some circumstances, a re-introduction or re-inforcement may have to be made into an area which is fenced or otherwise delimited, but it should be within the species' former natural habitat and range.
 
:A conservation/ benign introduction should be undertaken only as a last resort when no opportunities for re-introduction into the original site or range exist and only when a significant contribution to the conservation of the species will result. 

:The re-introduction area should have assured, long-term protection (whether formal or otherwise).
 
::(iv) Evaluation of re-introduction site

:Availability of suitable habitat: re-introductions should only take place where the habitat and landscape requirements of the species are satisfied, and likely to be sustained for the for-seeable future. The possibility of natural habitat change since extirpation must be considered. Likewise, a change in the legal/ political or cultural environment since species extirpation needs to be ascertained and evaluated as a possible constraint. The area should have sufficient carrying capacity to sustain growth of the re-introduced population and support a viable (self-sustaining) population in the long run. 

:Identification and elimination, or reduction to a sufficient level, of previous causes of decline: could include disease; over-hunting; over-collection; pollution; poisoning; competition with or predation by introduced species; habitat loss; adverse effects of earlier research or management programmes; competition with domestic livestock, which may be seasonal. Where the release site has undergone substantial degradation caused by human activity, a habitat restoration programme should be initiated before the re-introduction is carried out. 

::(v) Availability of suitable release stock

:It is desirable that source animals come from wild populations. If there is a choice of wild populations to supply founder stock for translocation, the source population should ideally be closely related genetically to the original native stock and show similar ecological characteristics (morphology, physiology, behaviour, habitat preference) to the original sub-population.
 
:Removal of individuals for re-introduction must not endanger the captive stock population or the wild source population. Stock must be guaranteed available on a regular and predictable basis, meeting specifications of the project protocol. 

:Individuals should only be removed from a wild population after the effects of translocation on the donor population have been assessed, and after it is guaranteed that these effects will not be negative. 

:If captive or artificially propagated stock is to be used, it must be from a population which has been soundly managed both demographically and genetically, according to the principles of contemporary conservation biology. 

:Re-introductions should not be carried out merely because captive stocks exist, nor solely as a means of disposing of surplus stock. 

:Prospective release stock, including stock that is a gift between governments, must be subjected to a thorough veterinary screening process before shipment from original source. Any animals found to be infected or which test positive for non-endemic or contagious pathogens with a potential impact on population levels, must be removed from the consignment, and the uninfected, negative remainder must be placed in strict quarantine for a suitable period before retest. If clear after retesting, the animals may be placed for shipment. 

:Since infection with serious disease can be acquired during shipment, especially if this is intercontinental, great care must be taken to minimize this risk. 

:Stock must meet all health regulations prescribed by the veterinary authorities of the recipient country and adequate provisions must be made for quarantine if necessary.
 
::(vi) Release of captive stock

:Most species of mammal and birds rely heavily on individual experience and learning as juveniles for their survival; they should be given the opportunity to acquire the necessary information to enable survival in the wild, through training in their captive environment; a captive bred individual's probability of survival should approximate that of a wild counterpart. 

:Care should be taken to ensure that potentially dangerous captive bred animals (such as large carnivores or primates) are not so confident in the presence of humans that they might be a danger to local inhabitants and/or their livestock.
 
===Socio-economic and Legal===

:Re-introductions are generally long-term projects that require the commitment of long-term financial and political support.
 
:Socio-economic studies should be made to assess impacts, costs and benefits of the re-introduction programme to local human populations. 

:A thorough assessment of attitudes of local people to the proposed project is necessary to ensure long term protection of the re-introduced population, especially if the cause of species' decline was due to human factors (e.g. over-hunting, over-collection, loss or alteration of habitat). The programme should be fully understood, accepted and supported by local communities. 

:Where the security of the re-introduced population is at risk from human activities, measures should be taken to minimise these in the re-introduction area. If these measures are inadequate, the re-introduction should be abandoned or alternative release areas sought. 

:The policy of the country to re-introductions and to the species concerned should be assessed. This might include checking existing provincial, national and international legislation and regulations, and provision of new measures and required permits as necessary. 

:Re-introduction must take place with the full permission and involvement of all relevant government agencies of the recipient or host country. This is particularly important in re-introductions in border areas, or involving more than one state or when a re-introduced population can expand into other states, provinces or territories. 

If the species poses potential risk to life or property, these risks should be minimised and adequate provision made for compensation where necessary; where all other solutions fail, removal or destruction of the released individual should be considered. In the case of migratory/mobile species, provisions should be made for crossing of international/state boundaries. 

::(i) Planning, preparation and release stages

:Approval of relevant government agencies and land owners, and coordination with national and international conservation organizations.
 
:Construction of a multidisciplinary team with access to expert technical advice for all phases of the programme. 

:Identification of short- and long-term success indicators and prediction of programme duration, in context of agreed aims and objectives. 

:Securing adequate funding for all programme phases. 

:Design of pre- and post- release monitoring programme so that each re-introduction is a carefully designed experiment, with the capability to test methodology with scientifically collected data. Monitoring the health of individuals, as well as the survival, is important; intervention may be necessary if the situation proves unforseeably favourable. 

:Appropriate health and genetic screening of release stock, including stock that is a gift between governments. Health screening of closely related species in the re-introduction area. 

:If release stock is wild-caught, care must be taken to ensure that: a) the stock is free from infectious or contagious pathogens and parasites before shipment and b) the stock will not be exposed to vectors of disease agents which may be present at the release site (and absent at the source site) and to which it may have no acquired immunity. 

:If vaccination prior to release, against local endemic or epidemic diseases of wild stock or domestic livestock at the release site, is deemed appropriate, this must be carried out during the &quot;Preparation Stage&quot; so as to allow sufficient time for the development of the required immunity. 

:Appropriate veterinary or horticultural measures as required to ensure health of released stock throughout the programme. This is to include adequate quarantine arrangements, especially where founder stock travels far or crosses international boundaries to the release site. 

:Development of transport plans for delivery of stock to the country and site of re-introduction, with special emphasis on ways to minimize stress on the individuals during transport. 

:Determination of release strategy (acclimatization of release stock to release area; behavioural training - including hunting and feeding; group composition, number, release patterns and techniques; timing). 

:Establishment of policies on interventions (see below). 

:Development of conservation education for long-term support; professional training of individuals involved in the long-term programme; public relations through the mass media and in local community; involvement where possible of local people in the programme. 

:The welfare of animals for release is of paramount concern through all these stages. 

::(ii) Post-release activities'''

:Post release monitoring is required of all (or sample of) individuals. This most vital aspect may be by direct (e.g. tagging, telemetry) or indirect (e.g. spoor, informants) methods as suitable. 
:Demographic, ecological and behavioural studies of released stock must be undertaken. 
:Study of processes of long-term adaptation by individuals and the population. 
:Collection and investigation of mortalities. 
:Interventions (e.g. supplemental feeding; veterinary aid; horticultural aid) when necessary. 
:Decisions for revision, rescheduling, or discontinuation of programme where necessary. 
:Habitat protection or restoration to continue where necessary. 
:Continuing public relations activities, including education and mass media coverage. 
:Evaluation of cost-effectiveness and success of re- introduction techniques. 
:Regular publications in scientific and popular literature.

= Free and Bound Variables =

== Informal notions ==

The two English sentences,

: If Socrates is a person, then Socrates is mortal,
: if Aristotle is a person, then Aristotle is mortal,

are both true.  However, outside any context supplying a reference for 'it',

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If it is a person, then it is mortal,

is neither true nor false.  'It' is not a name, but rather an empty placeholder.  'It' can refer to an object by picking up its reference from the surrounding context.  But without such context, there is no reference and no truth or falsity.  The same applies to the variable &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If ''x'' is a person, then ''x'' is mortal.

This situation changes with the two sentences:

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For any object, if it is a person, then it is mortal,
: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For any object ''x'', if ''x'' is a person, then ''x'' is mortal.

Neither the occurrences of 'it' nor the occurrences of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in these sentences refer to specific objects as with 'Socrates' or 'Aristotle'.  But (3) and (4) are nonetheless true.  (3) is true if and only if:

: (5) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Replacing both occurrences of 'it' in (3) with a reference to any object whatsoever (the same object both times) yields a true result.

But (5) is true and so is (3).  Similarly, (4) is true if and only if:

: (6) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Replacing both occurrences of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in (4) with a reference to any object whatsoever (the same object both times) yields a true result.

But (6) is true and so is (4).  We can call the occurrences of 'it' in (1) free and the occurrences of 'it' (3) bound.  Indeed, the occurrences of 'it' in are bound by the phrase 'for any'.  Similarly, the occurrences &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in (2) are free while those in (4) are bound.  Indeed, the occurrences of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in (4) are bound by the phrase 'for any'.

== Formal definitions ==

''An occurrence of a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is bound'' in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if that occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands within a subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; having one of the two forms:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \psi\ ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the formula

: &lt;math&gt;(7) \quad (\exists x_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \forall y_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(y_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Both instances of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are bound in (7) because they stand within the subformula

: &lt;math&gt;\exists x_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, both instances of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are bound in (7) because they stand within the subformula

: &lt;math&gt;\forall y_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(y_0)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


''An occurrence of a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is free'' in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not bound in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The occurrences of both &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(8) \quad (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are free in (8) because neither is bound in (8).


We say that ''an occurrence a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is bound in by a particular occurrence'' of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if that occurrence is also the first (and perhaps only) symbol in the shortest subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the formula

: &lt;math&gt;(9) \quad \forall x_0\, (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \forall x_0\, \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The third and fourth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9) are bound by the second occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  However, they are not bound by the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  The occurrence of

: &lt;math&gt;(10) \quad \forall x_0\, \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in (9)&amp;mdash;as well as the occurrence of (9) itself in (9)&amp;mdash;are subformulae of (9) beginning with a quantifier.  That is, both are subformula of (9) having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Both contain the second third and fourth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  However, the occurrence of (10) in (9) is the ''shortest'' subformula of (9) that meets these conditions.  That is, the occurrence of (10) in (9) is the shortest subformula of (9) that both (i) has this form and (ii) contains the third and fourth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  Thus it is the second, not the first, occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9) that binds the third and forth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  The first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9) ''does'', however, bind the first two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).


We also say that ''an occurrence a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is bound in by a particular occurrence'' of &lt;math&gt;\exists\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if that occurrence is also the first (and perhaps only) symbol in the shortest subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\exists \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Finally, we say that ''a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (not a particular occurrence of it) ''is bound (or free)'' in a formula if the formula contains a bound (or free) occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is both bound and free in

: &lt;math&gt;(\forall x_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

since this formula contains both bound and free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, the first two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are bound and the last is free.

== Sentences and formulae ==

A ''sentence'' is a formula with no free variables.  Sentential logic had no variables at all, so all formulae of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are also sentences of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In predicate logic and its language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, however, we have formulae that are not sentences.  All of (7), (8), (9), and (10) above are formulae.  Of these, only (7), (9), and (10) are sentences.  (8) is not a sentence because it contains free variables.

== Examples ==

All occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(11) \quad \forall x_0 (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound in the formula.  The lone occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is free in the formula.  (11) is a formula but not a sentence.

Only the first two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(12) \quad (\forall x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound in the formula.  The last occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the lone occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the formula are free in the formula.  (12) is a formula but not a sentence.

All four occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(13) \quad (\forall x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \exists x_0 \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound.  The first two are bound by the universal quantifier, the last two are bound by the existential quantifier.  The lone occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the formula is free.    (13) is a formula but not a sentence.

All three occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(14) \quad \forall x_0 (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \exists y_0 \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound by the universal quantifier.  Both occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the formula are bound by the existential quantifier.  (14) has no free variables and so is a sentence and as well as a formula.</text>

== What is a low-sodium diet? ==

A low-sodium diet is normally advised for people who suffer from heart and blood related conditions, such as high blood pressure, angina and for people who have previously suffered heart attacks (myocardial infarction), and also for people who have suffered, or who are prone to, conditions such as stroke or CVA (cerebrovascular attack).

Foods prepared and cooked for patients on this diet should contain as little added salt as possible, preferably none. This allows the consumer to season the food according to their own taste.  Generally meals falling into this category contain &lt; 0.5 grams of sodium per portion (about 1/8tsp).

Some people find food in this dietary grouping quite bland and &quot;boring&quot;, so it is up to the preparer to find new and interesting ways to season the food, in order to provide as much taste as possible, with little salt or sodium. To improve the flavours of sodium-free food, one can add combinations of herbs and spices. 

If you have just started a sodium-free diet, it will take at least 2 weeks for your palate to adjust to the lack of salt.</text>

== Solutions ==

I'm learning Haskell, so I decided to do the exercises on this page.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 -- 1.
 takeInt :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 takeInt 0 _ = []
 takeInt m (n:ns) = n : takeInt (m-1) ns
 main = print (takeInt 4 [11,21,31,41,51,61])

 -- 2.
 dropInt :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 dropInt 0 n = n
 dropInt m (n:ns) = dropInt (m-1) ns
 main = print (dropInt 3 [11,21,31,41,51])

 -- 3.
 sumInt :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer
 sumInt [] = 0
 sumInt (n:ns) = n + (sumInt ns)
 main = print (sumInt [1..5])

 -- 4.
 scanSum :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 scanSum n = scanSum' n 0
 scanSum' [] _ = []
 scanSum' (n:ns) a = n+a : (scanSum' ns (n+a))
 main = print (scanSum [2,3,4,5])

 -- 5.
 diffs :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 diffs [] = []
 diffs (m:[]) = []
 diffs (m:n:ns) = n-m : (diffs (n:ns))
 main = print (diffs [3,5,6,8])
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
--[[User:Colonel panic|Colonel panic]] 21:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Maybe something like this is what the author was looking for, based on the hint:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 -- 5.
 diffs' :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 diffs' _ [] = []
 diffs' [] _ = []
 diffs' (a:ax) (b:bx) = (b-a) : diffs' ax bx
 diffs :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 diffs [] = []
 diffs (a:ax) = diffs' (a:ax) ax
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

-- [[User:Fshahriar|Fshahriar]] 23:44, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

I think it would be more intuitive to substract the second from first element, and so on. At least when I read &quot;difference between adjacent elements&quot; I immediatly thought that [3,5,6,8] should produce [-2,-1,-2], only the example clarifies that.

-- Moritz, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

:Hi folks, would you maybe consider updating the [[Haskell/Solutions/More_about_lists|solutions page]] to this module?  Thanks -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:28, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

== Alternate Solution for scanSum ==

There's a solution for creating scanSum with only one function.  The trick is in the pattern matching - &quot;(x:y:zs)&quot; will match the first element in a set, the second element, and the remainder.

== Aborting evaluation ==

The note about aborting evaluation is useful here, but it may be a good idea to also include it in an earlier chapter, where factorial is introduced.  In that chapter, it mentions that you can get into an infinite loop by feeding in a negative number, but it doesn't tell you how to abort.  Also, it may be a good idea to spell out the keypress, in the case that the reader doesn't know what &quot;C-c&quot; means.  [[User:65.201.194.91|65.201.194.91]] 23:13, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

== head/tail ==
ghci gives an error on compiling your solution of the head/tail-based implementation of &quot;lastOf&quot;:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 lastOf :: [a] -&gt; a
 lastOf [] = error &quot;Empty list&quot;
 lastOf ls = if (tail ls == [])
   then head ls
   else lastOf ls
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Error:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
    Could not deduce (Eq a) from the context ()
      arising from a use of `==' at taken.hs:68:15-29
    Possible fix:
      add (Eq a) to the context of the type signature for `lastOf'
    In the predicate expression: (tail ls) == []
    In the expression: if (tail ls) == [] then head ls else lastOf ls
    In the definition of `lastOf':
        lastOf ls = if (tail ls) == [] then head ls else lastOf ls
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Before giving this solution,  you should explain the expression Eq.

By the way there is an error in the last line; it should read: &quot;else lastOf (tail ls)&quot;. The complete correct function would be:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 lastEl2 :: Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
 lastEl2 [] = error &quot;empty list&quot;
 lastEl2 ls = if (tail ls == []) 
   then head ls 
   else lastEl2 (tail ls) 
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

: Well spotted... going to fix both of these issues. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 15:00, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== Rewrite of list comprehensions section ==

As a newbie Haskeller I am following this book chapter by chapter. When I reached the list comprehensions subsection it kind of bothered me because:

* Many of the examples and commentaries were distracting and only tangentially related to the main subject.
* Some of the code examples relied on language features not yet covered at this point of the book.
* As a whole, it made the list comprehensions look far more complicated than they actually are.

In order to alleviate these problems I performed a substantial rewrite of the section. Some details - and, crucially, good exercises - are still to be added, but the key changes are already in place. Since I am still a newbie, I feel it would be mandatory to have the changes discussed and reviewed by more experienced people, so I invite you all to do so. Thanks! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 18:47, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks, and much appreciated! On first glance, your edits sound great to me, but I'll check them in detail when I've got the time.
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 18:43, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

:: Your changes to the list comprehensions are fine. Note, however, that list comprehensions are even more general, they also involve &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the following
:: &lt;code&gt;[ (x,y,z) | x&lt;-[1..50], y&lt;-[1..50], z&lt;-[1..50], x^2 + y^2 == z^2]&lt;/code&gt;
:: lists all the Pythagorean triples with numbers smaller than 50.

:: Concerning the order of the list chapters, however, I recommend the following order for the different functions and concepts:
:: 1 - (:) and [], head and tail
:: 2 - map, filter, [1..100] syntax
:: 3 - list comprehensions as a more readable syntax for  map  and filter.
:: 4 - (++), concat
:: 5 - Defining recursive functions on lists, zip
:: 6 - sum, product, all, any; then show that they are special cases of fold
:: -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 14:16, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

== Renaming to be more clear ==

This chapter covers generalized functions, currying, and mapping… Mostly, it is about how functions work and the concepts aren't all that list-specific. It could have a much more precise chapter title than &quot;More about lists&quot;[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 23:51, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
: Possibly, but there are some subtle issues involved. While about half of the chapter is about lists, the more interesting parts are in the other half. On the other hand, the discussions about functions here aim at introducing &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; as a key function on lists, and not as a convenient example of something else. It's just that higher order functions are too important for their first example to be presented as a black box. There are deeper discussions of higher order functions, partial application and related matters in &quot;More on Functions&quot; and &quot;Higher Order Functions&quot;; however I do not see that as duplication, but as deliberate strategy (i.e. introducing a concept in a very elementary way and then later coming back to it with a deeper treatment). You will find that strategy is used for a few other themes in the book.
: The peculiar status of &quot;More About Lists&quot; and &quot;List Processing&quot; (the latter, in my opinion, has an even worse name than this one) is in part due to historical reasons. In essence, they are a single chapter which was arbitrarily divided in two because it was too big. That is why there is no introductory paragraph in &quot;List Processing&quot;. Furthermore, back in 2010 I swapped large amounts of text between the two chapters in order to eliminate circular dependencies between the topics. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 07:51, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Student Congress is==
Student Congress (Legislative debate) is a high school co-curricular imitating our US Congress. It provides students with the
opportunity to combine the traditional oratory skills of speech and debate with the
interpersonal skills of working and negotiating with others. As members of congress,
students are offered the chance to think and reflect on some of the most difficult and
important issues facing the world today. In a number of ways, Student Congress
provides an education that can exceed the typical education received by many students
in the classroom. The active and engaging environment of congress challenges students
to consider, analyze, and articulate public policy ideas and positions.

==Related Resources==

There is a related book on this wiki:
* [[Issue Guide]] which covers debating topics in general.  Some of the topics in that book may be useful in student debates.

Is there an &quot;in place&quot; space for criticism of Islam?
(obviously, criticism should not be directed to this page.)

Is this something to be handled inside of this wiki city, or, outside
of it?

Thanks.

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:19, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

Criticism against Islam is not allowed inside the book. The reason is this book should contains real life muslim view and practice on their religion. However you have two choice.

# You can put links on the sources part
# Put you critics here in discussion.

I do not understand why this is in My Talk as I have made no contributions to such a discussion!
Why has this come to me?
-
Probably a mistake. The entry in your Talk is deleted, and this entry will be as well.

== Spin off this book ==

In the future, I will spin off this book.
Reason:
# Incompatibility: The [[Islam Way of Life]] talks about The Ancient Islam (not a religion), while this book about The Modern Islam (a religion)
# Too big for a chapter: This book will be expanded with more detail. 

Steps to spin off this book:
# Rename from &quot;Muslim Life&quot; to &quot;Practising Islam&quot;
# Add More Practical Detail (such as types of Zakat)
# Add More Example Story (such as paying Zakat as an employee)
# Add Reference to Fiqh Book (such as Imam Nawawi)
# Spin off the Book

Now that you now how to create a schema to define a conceptual primary/foreign key relationship, you need to know how to access and display that data. Take a look at the stylesheet below for an example. 
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;670&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; bgcolor=&quot;lightyellow&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;
xmlns:fo=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format&quot;&gt;

&lt;!-- See note below about new elements added  --&gt;

&lt;xsl:key name=&quot;predecessor&quot; match=&quot;president&quot; use=&quot;@primaryKey&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--xsl:key name=&quot;name referenced from within XSL file&quot; match=&quot;element in XML file containing key&quot;
use=&quot;attribute or sub-element containing actual value of key &quot;--&gt;
&lt;!--key() function use: key('predecessor',2) will return the nodes contained 
by the president element with attribute: primaryKey=&quot;2&quot;
Since a node list is returned, &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;key('predecessor',2)/firstName&quot;/&gt; 
will output John --&gt;
	&lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
		&lt;table style=&quot;font-family:arial&quot;&gt;
			&lt;tr style=&quot;background-color:#6495ED;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;President First Name&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;key('predecessor',predecessor/@foreignKey)/firstName&quot;/&gt;
							&lt;/td&gt;
							&lt;td&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;key('predecessor',predecessor/@foreignKey)/lastName&quot;/&gt;
							&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
						&lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
							&lt;!--Equivolent to else--&gt;
							&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
                                                 This is the first president!
                                                        &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;SMALL&gt;'''Table 6-3:  XML stylesheet for President Entity – [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/president.xsl president.xsl]&lt;/SMALL&gt;'''

=== A look at the new elements: ===

* &amp;lt;xsl:key&amp;gt; This element is a necessary declaration in order to use the key() function described next. There are three necessary attributes to be used in this element:  
** &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This attribute contains the name to be referenced from within XSL file in the key() function. The value in the name attribute can be thought of in programmatic terms as a variable containing an instance of an object, such as: “String stringVariable” in Java. 
** &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;match&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This attribute is similar to the .&amp;lt;xsd:selector&amp;gt; element described above. This is the element in XML file containing the parent key (primary key of the relationship). 
** &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This attribute is similar to the &amp;lt;xsd:field&amp;gt; element describe above. This is the field containing the parent key value. 
  
* key(string,object) function: This function returns a node set based on the parameters passed to it. The &lt;i&gt;string &lt;/i&gt; parameter is the value defined in the &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; attribute in the &amp;lt;xsl:key&amp;gt; tag. The &lt;i&gt;object &lt;/i&gt; parameter is the value of primary key for which you wish to get the nodes for. key('predecessor',2) will return the nodes contained by the president element with attribute: primaryKey=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; . Since a node set is returned, you can access child nodes of the returned set with an x-path expression just as you would any element. So: &amp;lt;xsl:value-of select=&amp;quot;key('predecessor',2)/firstName &amp;quot;/&amp;gt; would output “John.” For more information on the key function visit: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#key
* &amp;lt;xsl:choose&amp;gt;  This XSL element provides a means for creating an if-else type structure in an XSL stylesheet. This is necessary in our example because the first President will not have a predecessor. We display the predecessor if only there is one! There are two elements within the &amp;lt;xsl:choose&amp;gt; element to perform this: 
** &amp;lt;xsl:when&amp;gt; This element is the equivalent to the programmatic 'if' statement. The &lt;i&gt;test&lt;/i&gt; attribute contains a test statement as described in chapter 5. In the above example, it is simply testing to see if the predecessor element is there (if a President has a predecessor). 
** &amp;lt;xsl:otherwise&amp;gt; This element is the equivalent to the programmatic 'else' statement. Its contents are displayed if the test condition in the &amp;lt;xsl:when&amp;gt; statement fails.

&lt;SMALL&gt;'''Table 6-4:  XML stylesheer for Team Entity – [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/team.xsl team.xsl]&lt;/SMALL&gt;'''

===A look at the new elements===

* &amp;lt;!doctype stylesheet[….]&amp;gt; - This declaration is necessary to declare an entity and must come before the &amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt; tag  
* &amp;lt;!ENTITY space &amp;quot;&amp;lt;xsl:text xmlns:xsl='http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform'&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; {2}- This decaration must come between the brackets “[]” in the doctype  declaration shown above. “space” is the name of the entity you are defining. The value in between the double quotes is what the the entity represents. In our example above, the entity &lt;i&gt;space &lt;/i&gt; is referring to a single whitespace, represented with the &amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt; statement. The &lt;i&gt;xmlns &lt;/i&gt; attribute located within the &amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; element is only necessary for parsers using the Microsoft XML parser, but should be included anyway for cross compliance. The syntax for using the entity is the same syntax for using any other entity in an XSL stylesheet, which is an ampersand (“&amp;amp;”) followed by the entity name and a semi-colon. In the example above, this would be &amp;amp;space; as shown on. Now whenever a space is needed in the style sheet “&amp;amp;space;” can be used instead of &amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rosacea ([[w:IPA|IPA]]:{{IPA|ɹəʊ.ˈzeɪ.ʃə}}) is a common but often misunderstood condition that is estimated to affect over 45 million people worldwide. Most often, it begins as flushing and redness on the central face and across the cheeks, nose, or forehead but can also less commonly affect the neck, chest, scalp or ears. As rosacea progresses, other symptoms can develop such as permanent redness, red bumps (some with pus), red gritty eyes, burning and stinging sensations, small blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin, and in some advanced cases a bulbous nose. The disorder can be confused and co-exist with acne vulgaris and/or seborrheic dermatitis. People that are fair-skinned are disproportionately affected. Rosacea affects both men and women of all ages, but middle-aged women are more susceptible because of hot flushes caused by menopause.

===Subtypes and symptoms===
There are four identified rosacea subtypes&lt;ref name=&quot;JAmAcadDermatol2004-Wilkin&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wilkin J, Dahl M, Detmar M, Drake L, Liang MH, Odom R, Powell F | title=Standard grading system for rosacea: report of the National Rosacea Society Expert Committee on the classification and staging of rosacea | journal=J Am Acad Dermatol | year=2004 | pages=907-12 | volume=50 | issue=6 | id=PMID 15153893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patients may have more than one subtype present.

#''Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea:'' Permanent redness (erythema) with a tendency to flush and blush easily. It is also common to have small blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) and possibly burning or itching sensations.
#''Papulopustular rosacea:'' Some permanent redness with red bumps (papules) with some pus filled (pustules) (which typically last 1-4 days but sometimes as long as a month or more); this subtype can be easily confused with acne.
#''Phymatous rosacea:'' This subtype is most commonly associated with rhinophyma, an enlargenent of the nose. Symptoms include thickening skin, irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement. Phymatous rosacea can appear on the nose, chin, forehead, cheeks, and ears. Small blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) may be present.
#''Ocular rosacea:'' Red, dry and irritated eyes and eyelids. Some other symptoms include foreign body sensations, itching and burning.

Rosacea sufferers often report periods of depression stemming from cosmetic disfigurement, painful burning sensations, and decreases in quality of life.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ClinDermatol1984-Panconesi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Panconesi, E.| title=Psychosomatic dermatology | journal=Clin Dermatol | year=1984 | pages=94-179 | volume=2 | id=PMID 6242532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
The precise pathogenesis of rosacea still remains unknown, but most experts believe that rosacea is a disorder where the blood vessels become damaged when repeatedly dilated by stimuli. The damage causes the vessels to dilate too easily and stay dilated for longer periods of time or remain permanently dilated, resulting in flushing and redness. Immune cells and inflammatory mediators can leak from the microvascular bed causing inflammatory pustules and papules, especially with those with papulopustular rosacea.

Rosacea has a hereditary component and those that are fair-skinned of European or Celtic ancestry have a higher genetic predisposition to developing it. Women are more commonly affected but when men develop rosacea it tends to be more severe. People of all ages can get rosacea but there is a higher instance in the 30-50 age group. The first signs of rosacea are said to be persisting redness due to exercise, changes in temperature, and cleansing.

Triggers that cause episodes of flushing and blushing play a part in the development of rosacea. Exposure to temperature extremes can cause the face to become flushed as well as strenuous exercise, heat from sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, cold wind, moving to a warm or hot environment from a cold one such as heated shops and offices during the winter. There are also some foods and drinks that can trigger flushing, these include alcohol, foods high in histamine and spicy food.

Certain medications and topical irritants can quickly progress rosacea. If redness persists after using a treatment then it should be stopped immediately. Some acne and wrinkle treatments that have been reported to cause rosacea include microdermabrasion, chemical peels, high dosages of isotretinoin, benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin. ''Steroid induced rosacea'' is the term given to rosacea caused by the use of topical or nasal steroids. These steroids are often prescribed for seborrheic dermatitis. Dosage should be slowly decreased and not immediately stopped to avoid a flare up.

Studies of rosacea and demodex mites have revealed that some people with rosacea have increased numbers of the mite, especially those with steroid induced rosacea.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntJDermatol1998-Erbagcaronci&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Erbagcaronci Z, Özgöztascedili O | title=The significance of Demodex folliculorum density in rosacea | journal=Int J Dermatol. | month=June | year=1998 | pages=421-5 | volume=37 | issue=6 | id=PMID 9646125}}&lt;/ref&gt; When large numbers are present they may play a role along with other triggers.

It has also been suggested that rosacea might be a neurological disorder resulting from hypersensitization of sensory neurons following activation of the plasma kakllikrein-kinin system by exposure to intestinal bacteria in the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClinExpDermatol2004-KendallSN&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kendall SN | title=Remission of rosacea induced by reduction of gut transit time. | journal=Clin Exp dermatol. | month=May | year=2004 | pages=297-9 | volume=29 | issue=3 | id=PMID 15115515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
===Age===
There has never been a thorough study on the incidence of age and rosacea. The National Rosacea Society and their Canadian affiliate the Rosacea Awareness Program report in their 'Standard classification of rosacea' that &quot;Rosacea occurs in both men and women and, although it may occur at any age, the onset typically begins at any time after age 30&quot;. This statement is believed to be based on a large mail in survey which the results are summerised in ''Figure 1''. This can be compared to an Internet survey ''Figure 2'' that reported different results. Both surveys are considered to be inaccurate as both methods used to survey have inherent flaws and large bias.

One of the major defining characteristics of a nation, and, arguably, a world, is philosophy. Philosophy comes from many sources, but usually there are people looked up to as &quot;philosophers,&quot; or lovers of knowledge. There are few well-known modern-day philosophers, but some of the better known and recent ones include Mohandas Gandhi and Albert Einstein. However, you are not interested in the philosophers of this world-- you want to create your own philosophy. To do this, you must first understand how philosophy comes about.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soups|Soups]]

This is the basic recipe and method for Jewish Rosehip Soup. It is also popular in Iceland and parts of Scandinavia, where, because of the cold temperatures, it's often used for colds and sore throats. 

==Ingredients==  
* 1 [[Cookbook:L|litre]] fresh rosehips
* 2 [[Cookbook:L|litres]] [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* For each litre, 1 liquid quart of rosehip pulp
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] potato flour
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:almond|almonds]] 

==Method==
#Rinse the rosehips. Crush dried hips. Boil in water till soft.
#Press through a [[Cookbook:colander|colander]]. Measure the pulp and dilute with water if necessary. 
#Bring the pulp to a boil and add sugar. Add more sugar if it is too tart.
#Mix potato flour with some cold water. Thicken the soup while you stir and bring to a boil. Add blanched and shredded almond.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Hot soup is often served with vanilla ice cream and/or macaroons. 
*Cold soup can be diluted to make a nice thirst-quencher.
*The Icelandic recipe differs in that it contains less sugar (approx. 1 tbsp) and cornstarch is used to thicken it, not potato flour.

I am the [[Wiktionary:robot|'bot]] account under which all of [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]]'s automated and semi-automated editing tools run when major work is being performed.

It is intended that I will be flagged as a 'bot, as my edit load ''will'' flood recent changes.  However, that is not the case yet, and all of my edits are currently subject to the usual scrutiny of edits made by pseudonymous users.

For details of the tools used, see [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]].

== Tasks ==
This is what I do.
=== Renaming Cookbook talk pages ===
When the &lt;tt&gt;Cookbook:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace was created, the talk pages (&lt;tt&gt;Talk:Cookbook:X&lt;/tt&gt;) were not renamed (&lt;tt&gt;Cookbook talk:X&lt;/tt&gt;).  I have a list of the 525 cookbook talk pages that exist, and I am using WIKIMOVE.exe to rename all of them to the &lt;tt&gt;Cookbook talk:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace.

      <comment>update example, showing the complete usage of the assert syntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:assert}} is a Java [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] used
to define an [[Java Programming/Statements/assert|''assert statement'']].
An assert statement is used to declare an expected boolean condition in a program.
If the program is running with assertions enabled, then the condition
is checked at runtime. If the condition is false, the Java runtime system
[[Java Programming/Statements/throw|throws]] a {{Java:api|java.lang|AssertionError}}.

Assertions may be declared using the following syntax:

{{XCode|1=&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
assert expression1 [: expression2];
&lt;/source&gt;}}

&lt;tt&gt;expression1&lt;/tt&gt; is a boolean that will throw the assertion if it is false.  When it is thrown, the assertion error exception is created with the parameter &lt;tt&gt;expression2&lt;/tt&gt; (if applicable). 

An example: 
{{XCode|1=&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
assert list != null &amp;&amp; list.size() &gt; 0 : &quot;list variable is null or empty&quot;;
Object value = list.get(0);
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Assertions are usually used as a debugging aid.  They should not be used instead of validating arguments to public methods, or in place of a more precise runtime error exception. 

Assertions are enabled with the Java &lt;code&gt;-ea&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-enableassertions&lt;/code&gt;
runtime option. See your Java environment documentation for additional options
for controlling assertions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The {{Java:if}} ... {{Java:else}} statement is used to conditionally execute one of two
statements, depending on the result of a boolean condition.

Example:

 {{Java:if}} (list == null) {
   {{Java://|this block of statements executes if the condition is true
 }
 {{Java:else}} {
   {{Java://|this block of statements executes if the condition is false
 }

An {{Java:if}} statement has two forms:

 {{Java:if}} ({{Java:boolean-condition}})
    {{Java:statement1}}

and

 {{Java:if}} ({{Java:boolean-condition}})
    {{Java:statement1}}
 {{Java:else}}
    {{Java:statement2}}

Use the second form if you have different statements to execute if the
{{Java:boolean-condition}} is true or if it is false.
Use the first if you only wish to execute {{Java:statement1}} if
the condition is true and you do not wish to execute alternate
statements if the condition is false.

The following example calls two {{Java:int}} methods, &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;, stores the results, then uses an {{Java:if}}
statement to test if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is less than y and if it is,
the {{Java:statement1}} body will swap the values. The end result is
x always contains the larger result and y always contains the smaller result.

 {{Java:int}} x = f();
 {{Java:int}} y = y();
 {{Java:if}} ( x &lt; y ) {
   {{Java:int}} z = x;
   x = y;
   y = z;
 }

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Java '''Literals''' are syntactic representations of boolean, character, numeric, or string data. Literals provide a means of expressing specific values in your program. For example, in the following statement, an integer variable named &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is declared and assigned an integer value. The literal &lt;code&gt;'''0'''&lt;/code&gt; represents, naturally enough, the value zero.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-61&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.61: Numeric literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int count = 0;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The [[#code-section-62|code section 3.62]] contains two number literals, followed by two boolean literals at line 1, one string literal, followed by one number literal at line 2 and one string literal, followed by one real number literal at line 3:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-62&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.62: Literals.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
(2 &gt; 3) ? true : false;
&quot;text&quot;.substring(2);
System.out.println(&quot;Display a hard coded float: &quot; + 37.19f);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Boolean Literals ==
There are two boolean literals

* {{Java:true}} represents a true boolean value
* {{Java:false}} represents a false boolean value

There are no other boolean literals, because there are no other boolean values!

== Numeric Literals ==
There are three types of numeric literals in Java.
=== Integer Literals ===
In Java, you may enter integer numbers in several formats:

# As decimal numbers such as &lt;code&gt;1995&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;51966&lt;/code&gt;. Negative decimal numbers such as &lt;code&gt;-42&lt;/code&gt; are actually ''expressions'' consisting of the integer literal with the unary negation operation &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;.
# As octal numbers, using a leading &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (zero) digit and one or more additional octal digits (digits between &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;), such as &lt;code&gt;077&lt;/code&gt;. Octal numbers may evaluate to negative numbers; for example &lt;code&gt;037777777770&lt;code&gt; is actually the decimal value -8.
# As hexadecimal numbers, using the form &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;0X&lt;/code&gt;) followed by one or more hexadecimal digits (digits from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;). For example, 0xCAFEBABEL is the long integer 3405691582. Like octal numbers, hexadecimal literals may represent negative numbers.
# Starting in J2SE 7.0, as binary numbers, using the form &lt;code&gt;0b&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;0B&lt;/code&gt;) followed by one or more binary digits (0 or 1). For example, 0b101010 is the integer 42. Like octal and hex numbers, binary literals may represent negative numbers.

By default, the integer literal primitive type is {{Java:int}}. If you want a {{Java:long}}, add a letter ''el'' suffix (either the character &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; or the character &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;) to the integer literal. This suffix denotes a ''long integer'' rather than a standard integer. For example, &lt;code&gt;3405691582L&lt;/code&gt; is a long integer literal. Long integers are 8 bytes in length as opposed to the standard 4 bytes for {{Java:int}}. It is best practice to use the suffix &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; to avoid confusion with the digit &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (one) which looks like &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; in many fonts: &lt;code&gt;200l&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ne; &lt;code&gt;2001&lt;/code&gt;. If you want a short integer literal, you have to cast it.

Starting in J2SE 7.0, you may insert underscores between digits in a numeric literal. They are ignored but may help readability by allowing the programmer to group digits.

=== Floating Point Literals ===
Floating point numbers are expressed as decimal fractions or as exponential notation:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-63&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.63: Floating point literals.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double decimalNumber = 5.0;
decimalNumber = 5d;
decimalNumber = 0.5;
decimalNumber = 10f;
decimalNumber = 3.14159e0;
decimalNumber = 2.718281828459045D;
decimalNumber = 1.0e-6D;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Floating point numbers consist of:
# an optional leading &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; sign, indicating a positive or negative value; if omitted, the value is positive,
# one of the following number formats
#* ''integer digits'' (must be followed by either an exponent or a suffix or both, to distinguish it from an integer literal)
#* ''integer digits'' &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
#* ''integer digits'' &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; ''integer digits''
#* &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; ''integer digits''
# an optional exponent of the form
#* the exponent indicator &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;
#* an optional exponent sign &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (the default being a positive exponent)
#* ''integer digits'' representing the integer exponent value
# an optional floating point suffix:
#* either &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; indicating a single precision (4 bytes) floating point number, or
#* &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; indicating the number is a double precision floating point number (by default, thus the double precision (8 bytes) is default).

Here, ''integer digits'' represents one or more of the digits &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.

Starting in J2SE 7.0, you may insert underscores between digits in a numeric literal. They are ignored but may help readability by allowing the programmer to group digits.

=== Character Literals ===
Character literals are constant valued character expressions embedded in a Java program. Java characters are sixteen bit Unicode characters, ranging from 0 to 65535. Character literals are expressed in Java as a single quote, the character, and a closing single quote ({{Java:ch|a}}, {{Java:ch|7}}, {{Java:ch|$}}, {{Java:ch|π}}). Character literals have the type {{Java:char}}, an unsigned integer [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]]. Character literals may be safely promoted to larger integer types such as {{Java:int}} and {{Java:long}}. Character literals used where a {{Java:short}} or {{Java:byte}} is called for must be cast to {{Java:short}} or {{Java:byte}} since truncation may occur.

== String Literals ==
String literals consist of the double quote character (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) (ASCII 34, hex 0x22), zero or more characters (including Unicode characters), followed by a terminating double quote character (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), such as: {{Java:string|Ceci est une string.}}

So a string literal follows the following grammar:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;STRING :
        &quot;\&quot;&quot;
        (    (~[&quot;\&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\&quot;,&quot;\n&quot;,&quot;\r&quot;])
        |(&quot;\\&quot;
            ( [&quot;n&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;\\&quot;,&quot;'&quot;,&quot;\&quot;&quot;]
            |[&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;]([&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;])?
            |[&quot;0&quot;-&quot;3&quot;][&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;][&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;]
            )
        )
        )*
        &quot;\&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Within string and character literals, the backslash character can be used to escape special characters, such as [[Java Programming/Syntax/Unicode Escape Sequences|unicode escape sequences]], or the following special characters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
! Name
! Character
! ASCII
! hex
|-
| Backspace
| &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt;
| 8
| 0x08
|-
| TAB
| &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt;
| 9
| 0x09
|-
| NUL character
| &lt;code&gt;\0&lt;/code&gt;
| 0
| 0x00
|-
| newline
| &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;
| 10
| 0x0a
|-
| carriage control
| &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;
| 13
| 0xd
|-
| double quote
| &lt;code&gt;\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| 34
| 0x22
|-
| single quote
| &lt;code&gt;\'&lt;/code&gt;
| 39
| 0x27
|-
| backslash
| &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt;
| 92
| 0x5c
|}

String literals may not contain unescaped newline or linefeed characters. However, the Java compiler will evaluate compile time expressions, so the following String expression results in a string with three lines of text:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-64&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.64: Multi-line string.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String text = &quot;This is a String literal\n&quot;
            + &quot;which spans not one and not two\n&quot;
            + &quot;but three lines of text.\n&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== null ==
{{Java:null}} is a special Java literal which represents a ''null value'': a value which does not refer to any object. It is an error to attempt to dereference the null value &amp;mdash; Java will throw a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;. {{Java:null}} is often used to represent uninitialized state.

== Mixed Mode Operations ==
In concatenation operations, the values in brackets are concatenated first. Then the values are concatenated from the left to the right. Be careful when mixing character literals and integers in String concatenation operations:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-65&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.65: Concatenation operations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
int one = '1';
int zero = '0';

System.out.println(&quot;120? &quot; + one + '2' + zero);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Console for Code section 3.66'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
120? 49248
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The unexpected results arise because {{Java:ch|1}} and {{Java:ch|0}} are converted twice. The expression is concatenated as such:
{| style=&quot;margin: auto; text-align: center;&quot;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;120? &quot; + one + '2' + zero&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;120? &quot; + '''49'''&lt;/u&gt; + '2' + '''48'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''&quot;120? 49&quot;''' + '2'&lt;/u&gt; + 48&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''&quot;120? 492&quot;''' + 48&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;'''&quot;120? 49248&quot;'''&lt;/code&gt;
|}

# &lt;code&gt;one&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; are integers. So they store integer values. The integer value of {{Java:ch|1}} is 49 and the integer value of {{Java:ch|0}} is 48.
# So the first concatenation concatenates {{Java:string|120? }} and &lt;code&gt;49&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;49&lt;/code&gt; is first converted into String, yielding {{Java:string|49}} and the concatenation returns the string {{Java:string|120? 49}}.
# The second concatenation concatenates {{Java:string|120? 49}} and {{Java:ch|2}}. {{Java:ch|2}} is converted into the String {{Java:string|2}} and the concatenation returns the string {{Java:string|120? 492}}.
# The concatenation between {{Java:string|120? 492}} and {{Java:ch|0}} returns the string {{Java:string|120? 49248}}.
The [[#code-section-66|code section 66]] yields the desired result:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-66&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.66: Correct primitive type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
char one = '1';
char zero = '0';

System.out.println(&quot;120? &quot; + one + '2' + zero);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Console for Code section 3.66'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
120? 120
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

'''Question 3.9''': Consider the following code:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-9&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.9: New concatenation operations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4-6&quot;&gt;

System.out.println(&quot;  3? &quot; + (one + '2' + zero));
System.out.println(&quot;102? &quot; + 100 + '2' + 0);
System.out.println(&quot;102? &quot; + (100 + '2' + 0));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

It is nearly midnight at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley]] home, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], crouched under his bed covers, is reading ''A History of Magic'' and writing a summer homework essay on witch burning. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] locked Harry's school trunk in the cupboard, and Harry had to pick the cupboard lock and steal his books, quill, parchment, and ink, in order to do his homework.

As usual, Harry celebrates his birthday alone. Other than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] botched phone call, which ended with Uncle Vernon hanging up on him, Harry has heard nothing from his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] friends all summer. As Harry prepares to go to sleep, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]] (the Weasley’s owl) arrive with presents. Ron sends Harry a Pocket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|Sneakoscope]] and a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']] article about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Ron’s father]] winning a contest. The Weasleys used the prize money for a trip to Egypt; the article's photo shows the entire Weasley family, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Ron's pet rat]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] wearing his new Head Boy badge. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], vacationing in France with her parents, sends Harry a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Broomstick]] Servicing Kit. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] gift is a strange book titled ''The Monster Book of Monsters''. It almost seems alive, nipping at Harry and nearly waking the Dursleys as it scrambles around the room before Harry subdues it.

Another owl delivers the usual Hogwarts' letter with instructions about classes, textbooks, and supplies. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] has included a permission form that a parent or guardian needs to sign, allowing students to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], the Wizarding village in which Hogwarts is located. Harry doubts he can persuade the Dursleys to sign it, but for now, he is happy that his birthday has been remembered by his friends.

== Analysis ==

Harry must endure yet another unhappy summer at the Dursleys. His confinement there only reinforces what little connection Harry retains to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle world]] and how he longs to return to Hogwarts, the only place he feels he truly belongs. Although Harry's first eleven years at the abusive Dursleys were unhappy, he survived relatively well, unaware then that he actually belonged somewhere else. Now, knowing that another world exists where he is happy, has friends, and is accepted for who and what he is, his confinement to Privet Drive is intolerable. He was prematurely liberated the previous year by Ron and the Twins, who rescued him in the flying car and took him to their home, but it seems unlikely Harry will be as fortunate this summer. He has not been totally shut off from the Wizarding realm, however. Reading ''A History of Magic'' is one means by which he remains connected. Also, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid have remembered him, sending gifts and letters. Ron's present, an inexpensive Sneakoscope, likely will play a significant role in the plot, as may the photograph of the Weasleys in Egypt. Hagrid's gift is also notable, though it seems more aligned to his own interests than Harry's. And while Harry is left confused as to why Hagrid sent such a &quot;ferocious&quot; gift, the &quot;Monster&quot; book, as well as Hermione's present, may also foreshadow upcoming plot elements.

Readers might notice a minor mistake in early editions of this book. The textbook that Harry is reading, ''A History of Magic'', is said to be by Adalbert Waffling. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we are told that ''A History of Magic'' is by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]. Adalbert Waffling is the author of ''Magical Theory'', according to Book 1. This mistake is pointed up by Bathilda's becoming a more important character in book 7. While it is possible, as in the Muggle world, that these are two separate books by different authors that just happen to have identical titles, and that ''Magical Theory'' is another book by Waffling, it seems in fact to be only a minor mistake, corrected in later editions.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Weasley family photograph, though seemingly mundane and insignificant, is actually what spurs the majority of the book's action. When Harry's convicted godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] sees the picture in the Daily Prophet, he recognizes Ron’s rat as being something other than a pet; this compels him to escape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison, apparently intent on murdering Harry, but actually for another purpose.

Ron mentions that the Sneakoscope is cheap and probably faulty, it having gone off two times when he believes it should not have. Harry's thought that it had reacted to the Twins, and later Ron, behaving in an untrustworthy manner, leaves us wondering whether Ron's assessment is correct. It will go off twice more, and though the warnings are again disregarded, the Sneakoscope is, in every case, correctly signaling an untrustworthy person's nearby presence. 

Hermione's gift, a broomstick servicing kit, while unimportant to the plot, may represent just how significant Harry's brooms are to him, as well as foreshadowing a major subplot involving Harry's treasured Nimbus 2000 broom. When it is accidentally destroyed, he will receive an expensive replacement from an anonymous benefactor, only to have it confiscated by concerned Hogwarts staff, though it is eventually returned when it is declared to be safe. This cycle's effect of loss and recovery will be felt by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as well as the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and it could also be seen as a metaphor for Harry's own life.

Unknown to Harry just yet, Hagrid is the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher. ''The Monster Book of Monsters'' is his chosen &quot;set book&quot; (textbook), and he has partly selected it because he finds it humorous. The book can only be opened by stroking it, whereupon it purrs and relaxes. No one will be able to figure this out, and the entire class will have bound their textbooks with belts and ropes to prevent attacks. This is hardly surprising; the Flourish &amp; Blotts staff, who as booksellers should know such details about the books they sell, are equally unable to tame the vicious tomes and keep them securely caged.

=== Connections ===
* The Sneakoscope will appear twice more in this book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|once on the Hogwarts Express]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 11|again near Christmas]]. A different Sneakoscope will appear on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody's]] desk [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 20|in the fourth book]], and another, possibly Moody's, will appear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|the Room of Requirement]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 18|in the fifth book]]. The specific Sneakoscope that we see in this chapter will not be seen after this book until, old and broken, it is cleaned out of Harry's school trunk [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 2|in the final book]]. Hermione will give Harry a new Sneakoscope [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|for his birthday that year]], and it will be used multiple times during the Trio's travels through England in that book.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;They strive for a global theocracy and are not above using terrorism to achieve their ends.&quot;

I think that you should make up your mind here wether you are writing
a simple Islamic explanation page, or a POV page. If it is a POV page, then be honest about it and link to something to balance it.

I notice that you didn't mention
the same problem with Christians, who have killed and murdered far more people in the name of their religion than any other.
And who actually achieved a near global theocracy at the height
of the Roman Catholic Empire.

I'm not going to edit it, and to be truthful, I agree with you, but
that isn't the point. I think that having two pages, one to simply tell the &quot;Nuetral facts&quot; and one to then discuss the serious problems, is in order, and far more fair.

On the other hand, i could go find a dozen Islamic BBSes, post your
article, leave a link, and let you hear from them what they think about it...lol.
(Sorry, i wouldn't do that,)

Also, I think that it is very important, even whilst indicting 
Islam for its serious flaws, to make a distinction between those
who follow the faith ernestly, and those who are actually politicos,
using the faith as a way to manipulate the populations.
(And again, the same thing goes for christianity)
Islams Core tenets, just as Christianities core tenets, do have injunctions against war and violence.

* Hello Prometheuspan:
Yes, you make a good point. But I was referring to “Islamists,” not Muslims (this also covers your last point, I think) and referring to current, not past, behaviours. Christians, certainly, behaved just as badly (or even worse). But someone might like to edit the text to clarify this point. Thanks. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 22:00, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt; [[Portuguese/Contents|Contents]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Function==

The conditional mood in Portuguese is the equivalent of the &quot;would + infinitive&quot; construction in English. 

It is used to express a situation in which there are &quot;conditions&quot;.
For example:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''I would go''' to the party if you took me. &lt;br&gt;
''Eu iria à festa se você me levasse''

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The conditional is frequently used along with the imperfect subjunctive, as in the context above.
 
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''conditional + if + imp. subjunctive''' - Eu compraria um carro se tivesse dinheiro. 

'''If + imp. subjunctive + conditional''' - Se eu tivesse dinheiro, compraria um carro.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

It is also used with the verb gostar. For example:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE7AA&quot;&gt;
''' Eu gostaria de ir ao centro. ''' - ''I would like to go into town.'' 

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Also note that the first person plural contains an accent over the last &quot;i&quot;. 

'''''Gostaríamos''''' ''de ir ao centro se você chegasse também.''

==Formation==

In regular verbs, the conditional is formed by adding these never-changing endings to the infinitive.

'''FALAR - to speak'''
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot;
 border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eu falar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;íamos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (p) would speak&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;V&amp;oacute;s falar&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;íeis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They would speak&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eles falar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;iam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

*This would be a classically good book for collaboration.  It is a subject of which many people have knowledge, it is a basic subject on which we should have a top-quality text, and it isn't just some stub hoping to be a book some day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The balance of a watch needs thin delicate pivots and fragile jewels to run well.  The balance is generally one of the largest and heaviest jewelled wheels in the watch, and thus one of the most likely to be damaged if the watch is dropped or bumped.  

==Shock Springs==
Modern shock protection began commercially with the introduction of the [[wikipedia:Incabloc]] system in the 1930s, although not widely used until the 50's.  
{|
|[[Image:321 balance a.jpg|thumb|upright|Incablock balance spring]]
|[[image:BwcSeikoDiashock.jpg|thumb|upright|Seiko Diashock spring]]
|}

In this system the balance jewels are spring-mounted, and the balance staff is specifically shaped.  In the event of a shock, the balance can push the jewels out of position temporarily.  If the shock is severe, a thicker and stronger portion of the balance staff will contact a strong part of the jewel setting before the jewel reaches the end of its travel.  After the shock, the springs force the jewels back to their proper place.    The same basic system is also used by Kif, Seiko's Diashock and Citizen's Parashock.   


==Other systems==
Wyler had the Incaflex system as an alternative to shock springs.  In this system, the rim of the balance is connected to the staff with springy spiral arms.  
{|
| [[Image:Incaflex2.jpg|thumb|right|Wyler Incaflex balance in movement]]
| [[Image:Incaflex1.jpg|thumb|left|Wyler Incaflex balance wheel]]
|}

Under a shock, the heavy rim of the balance would displace and contact a rim around the circumference before enough force was applied to damage the staff or jewels.  (Note the cap jewel with no shock spring)  

Timex used the V-Conic system.  Instead of the traditional arrangement of slender pivots, Timex used a conical profile.  Instead of jewel bearings, they used metal cups shaped to match the V-conic pivots.  This system was both less expensive to manufacture, but also inherently stronger than traditional pivots, allowing Timex to meet shock-resistance standards with no springs.  

==Other wheel springs==
Sometimes you may see what appear to be shock springs on other wheels--These are actually retaining springs rather than shock springs, to allow the cap jewels to be more easily removed for cleaning.  Seiko calls their version Diafix rather than Diashock.

The '''harmonica''' is a free reed wood-wind instrument. Harmonicas have an incredibly rich range of expression, are easy to pick up, since there's no need for fingerings, etc. They play numerous &quot;intervals&quot; (two or more notes), which is difficult or impossible for many other wind instruments. It also works very well in the modern musical setting, where one needs to play most music through an amplifier or loadspeaker. A harmonica player can easily adapt to this by cupping a microphone and his harmonica in his hands, without sacrificing any other aspect of playing.

Harmonicas are extremely important for Blues music - in order to acquire its unique, soulful sound, a harmonica is needed. Harmonicas cross many genres - the diatonic harmonica is frequently used for rock, country, folk music and Irish jigs; and the chromatic harmonica is often associated with Jazz music, and more recently, Classical music. The tremolo harmonica is often used for Japanese folk songs.

The harmonica is also a very portable instrument. They can fit easily into any reasonably sized jacket pocket, which is very rare for wind instruments.

Furthermore, learning the harmonica can improve your breathing, and thus, your health. The constant breathing into and out of a harmonica is substantial exercise for the diaphragm, which is why harmonicas are sometimes used to improve breathing.

      <comment>/* Blues Chords */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The blues genre of music originated in the USA in the 19th century and was a form of music developed by African-Americans. It is described as a soulful and emotional music whose themes are primarily about the lives, loves, hardships and hopes of African-Americans. 

Slowly the blues spread into urban areas which was mainly due to the fact that many rural blues musicians were leaving the countryside to find work in the factories of major cities. By 1920, three major formats of blues were common: The 8 bar blues, the 12 bar blues and the 16 bar blues. Blues also developed various styles, or subgenres, such as Mississippi Delta blues and Chicago electric blues.

==Blues scale==

Blues leads are played relying heavily on the notes of a minor pentatonic scale.  The minor pentatonic scale played over major chords creates the baseline for the dissonances that drive blues to a resolution.  The flatted seventh degree of the minor pentatonic lines up with the flatted seventh in the V7/IV chord which ties the chord progression and the leads together.  

Since the chord progression being played are mostly made up of major chords though, degrees from the major scale may also be included when playing blues leads.  The major third and major sixth are often added to the minor pentatonic scale to further tie the leads and chords together.  

The major third is most often played in blues immediately after the minor third and it often precedes either a resolution to the tonic of the scale or a jump up to the fifth degree.  

The major sixth is most often played immediately after the fifth degree of the scale and often precedes a resolution to the tonic of the scale or a jump to the minor third.  The tritone jump from major sixth to minor third is commonly played over the IV chord because it outlines the dominant seventh chord played based on that degree of the scale (V7/VII).  

The second and minor sixth degrees of the scale may only be played in a context where they are part of a chromatic run at least three notes long, for example: the motion from second - minor third - major third, or the motion from fifth - minor sixth - major sixth.  

Another common note present in the blues scale is the flatted fifth or tritone of the tonic of the scale.  The most common idea of a blues scale, and the quickest and easiest to pick up consists of a minor pentatonic scale with the added flatted fifth because use of the flatted fifth does not depend heavily on context and may be relied upon almost as frequently as any of the other notes in the pentatonic scale.  

The real blues scale includes all the chromatic notes between octaves except for the major seventh and minor second in the following order of commonality of use: tonic, minor third, perfect fifth, minor seventh, perfect fourth, major third, tritone, major sixth, minor sixth, major second.  

==Blues Chords==

Blues chord progressions are often made up by major chords and dominant seventh chords.  In 12 bar blues (explained later), the chord progression follows the most common underlying driving chord progression in western music moving from the tonic (I) to the sub-dominant (IV) to the dominant (V) back to the tonic (I).  In blues, the first tonic is often played as a dominant seventh chord written as the V7/IV.  This dominant seventh chord departs from the basic major scale by flatting the seventh degree, but it also creates a dissonance which resolves very nicely to the IV chord.  The IV chord then resolves up to the V chord weakly which is often played as a V7 chord, crating a dissonance which resolves to the I chord.  

The most common chord progression played in blues is the 12 bar blues pattern which follows this general outline:

  I |  I | I | I
 IV | IV | I | I
  V | IV | I | I

This pattern is heavily based on jazz progression and was mainly adopted to create some sense of uniformity among blues songs.  In early blues, the verses were not locked in to twelve bars and the only common line between songs was that it tonally moved from the tonic (I) to sub-dominant (IV) to dominant (V) back to tonic (I).  The usual chords to meet these purposes weren't even set, for example the dominant was occasionally played as a III chord rooted on the minor third, or just by hitting the minor third and fifth together to create some semblance of resolution when the 1 chord was returned to.  Blues verses could range anywhere from around seven bars in length to fifteen.  When record companies began to discover blues musicians, they realized this looseness of playing made blues songs less marketable and made it more difficult to bring many blues musicians together to play with each other, so they urged blues musicians to record their songs in uniform sets of twelve bars like jazz musicians did.  

The 12 bar blues progression is essentially a more complicated version of a I IV V progression.  If you simplify the bars into sets of two by the strong chords in the set, you can begin to see how this tonally makes sense: (I I)(I), (I I)(I), (IV IV)(IV), (I I)(I), (V IV)(V), (I I)(V).  The 12 bar blues can be further simplified into three sections the first being the tonic section with four bars of the tonic (I I I I)(I), the second being the sub-dominant section with two bars of the sub-dominant and two bars of the tonic (IV IV I I)(IV), and the third being the dominant section with a bar of the dominant, a bar of the sub-dominant, and two bars of the tonic (V IV I I)(V).  The presence of the two bars of tonic in the sub-dominant section doesn't change the tonal feel of the section, but gives it a feeling of motion and interest, just as the presence of the sub-dominant and tonic in the dominant section do.  The V IV I return to I also creates a more powerful resolution because the most powerful motions in music are the V - I relationship, and scalar movement.  The V to IV creates scalar motion without losing the dominant feel of the first chord then resolves to the I in the same direction of the scalar motion.  Since the dominant feel has not been lost, the resolution still feels like it is moving straight from from V to I.  Any twelve bar blues song can be played in a simplified version by playing the chord progression:  

  I |  I |  I |  I
 IV | IV | IV | IV
  V |  V |  I |  I

Another common practice in blues is to play the entire song over a single chord, for example, listen to catfish blues, first recorded by Skip James, or I'm a Man by Bo Diddly.  The song is often driven by a single riff that adds interest and a backbone behind the lyrics.  This practice doesn't warrant too much explanation due to its simplicity.

==Common Blues Elements==

One of the most recognizable blues riffs is the Mannish Boy riff.  This riff is commonly played over a single chord song and creates space between the lines.  It can also be heard in Hoochie Coochie Man, and George Thourogood's Bad to The Bone.  It is most commonly played in the key of G because in this key it can be played easily on all Bb brass instruments, harmonica, slide guitar in both standard tuning, and open G, piano, and bass.  The riff is played: G A G Bb G.  

Another common blues practice, especially on electric guitar is the shift from a power chord to the interval on the major sixth and back.  This rhythm switching back and forth serves as the backbone of most electric blues and early rock.  Over twelve bar blues, this rhythm would be played

|}

Finally, the turnaround is a common element of almost every blues song.  The turnaround is how blues musicians make transition from the dominant section back to the tonic more interesting.  The most simple turnaround is just hitting the V chord at the end of the dominant section again instead of just sitting on the I.  The basic concept of most turnarounds is the chromatic run from the minor seventh to the fifth.  Many blues musicians abandon the harmonic root of this practice and just play either the notes alone, or some chord containing the minor seventh and chromatically move the chord down four half steps.  The chord progression that gave rise to this practice though is V7/IV -&gt; Idim -&gt; IVadd9 -&gt;  IIm7b5 -&gt; I.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of blues usually takes the form of a narrative. Most blues lyrics deal with personal woes and hard times, or simply day to day life. Blues lyrics rely on the idea that simple and understandable is easier for an audience to relate to than the eloquent and sometimes obscure lyrics in other popular genres of music.  Many blues songs also deal with the topics of personal pride, defiance, or other powerful emotions than woe such as love or anger.  While blues lyrics seldom turn to extremely happy topics, they are often uplifting and empowering or humorous.  It cannot be said that blues is a 'sad' genre.  The blues are a way of dealing with sorrow, rather than wallowing in it.  

There are a few main structures of blues lyrics.  

Most commonly, a verse over one repetition of a I IV V or twelve bar blues progression consists of two distinct rhyming lines.  The first line is repeated twice, first over the tonic section and second over the sub-dominant section.  The second line is sung over the dominant section and often sums up the emotion of the first line.  A good example of this structure lies in How Many More Years, in which Howlin' Wolf sings:

I   &quot;How many more years, do I have to let you dog me around,
IV  How many more years, do I have to let you dog me around,
V   I'd rather be dead, lyin' six feet underground&quot;

A second common structure for blues lyrics contains a refrain and a few lines that change in every verse.  The progression is played with extra-long measures to accommodate the words.  The variable lyrics are sung over the tonic section and the refrain is sung over the sub-dominant and dominant sections.  The variable section of lyrics often rhymes with itself and the refrain rhymes with itself, but the rhyme schemes don't carry over between each other.  A good example of this structure is the verses of Muddy Waters' song, Can't be Satisfied, in which he sings:

I   &quot;Well I'm goin' away to leave, won't be back no more
I   Goin' back down south, child, don't you want to go?
IV  Woman I'm troubled, 
I   I be all worried in mind
V   Well baby I just can't be satisfied
I   And I just can't keep from cryin'&quot;

A final common structure for blues lyrics is a single line that repeats twice.  The first repetition of the line is sung over the tonic chord, and the second is split into two halves, covering the sub-dominant and the dominant chords.  A good example of this structure is Robert Johnson's Walking Blues, where he sings: 

I   &quot;Woke up this morning, looked 'round for my shoes
I   You know I had those mean old walking blues
IV  Woke up this morning,
I   Looked round for my shoes
V   You know I had those
I   Mean old walking blues&quot;

Welcome to the '''XML Schema''' book. It describes the structure of an XML Schema and explains how XML Schemas are used to validate XML documents.
{{Editor note|This book is designed as a reusable [[w:Learning Object|Learning Object]] and must take into consideration the constraints of many learning environments.  Please think carefully about adding material that would not allow the course to be reused by a broad variety of audiences and thus the course should be kept as modular as possible. These materials are designed to be implementation technology neutral so the course can be integrated into open source learning management systems such as Moodle.  For example, please do not put examples that depend on either using Java or Microsoft .Net. Computer language and operating system-specific issues such as Java, Microsoft, Mac, GNU/Linux and Windows dependencies should be isolated into separate labs that can be optimally included by instructors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
All the examples should use [[w:IEC_11179|ISO/IEC 11179]] three-part [[w:CamelCase|UpperCamelCase]] notation (ObjectPropertyTerm). This is designed to be consistent with [[w:ebXML|ebXML]] and [[w:NIEM|NIEM]] standards. See [[w:Data Element Name|Data Element Name]] and [[w:Representation term|Representation term]] for more information.
}}

==Prerequisites==
{{wikipedia|XML Schema (W3C)}}
{{TOC right}}
Students reading this book should already be familiar with the fundamental principles of [[XML]] and have some background on [[w:Data Type|Data Types]].

==Course Guidelines==
Only the [[#The prefix|The prefix]], [[#The root element: &lt;xs:schema&gt;|The root element: &lt;xs:schema&gt;]] and [[#Elements|Elements]] sections are required to build XML Schemas. [[#History of the XML Schema|History of the XML Schema]], [[#What are XML Schemas used For?|What are XML Schemas used For?]], [[#When XML Schema become inefficient at validating complex rules|When XML Schema become inefficient at validating complex rules]] and [[#XML Schema Example|XML Schema Example]] can be skipped and the sections following the [[#Elements|Elements]] section are additional information starting from the most important ones.

==History of the XML Schema==
'''XML Schema''' is a standard created by the world wide web consortium [http://www.w3c.org http://www.w3c.org]. Unlike DTDs, XML Schema uses XML file formats to define the XML Schema itself. Once you learn the structure of an XML file, you don't have to learn another syntax.

==What are XML Schemas used For?==

XML Schemas are primarily used to validate the structure and data types of an XML document. By structure we mean that an XML Schema defines:

# what data elements are expected
# what order the data elements are expected in
# what nesting these data elements have
# what data elements are optional and what data elements are required

XML Schemas can also be used by XML data mapping tools for quickly extracting data from databases and transferring them in XML files.

One of the best analogies is the blueprint analogy. Just like there are architectural blueprints that describe the structural design of a house, an XML Schema provides the &quot;structural design&quot; of a file.

==When XML Schema become inefficient at validating complex rules==
Although XML Schemas are excellent at sequential validation of data elements and data types, XML Schema tend to be cumbersome at expressing highly complex business rules. For example when you are at the end of a large file it is difficult to state a rule that checks if a data element has some value that another data element at the beginning of the file should have had another values. This can be done by using XML transforms and XPath expressions.

==XML Schema Example==
Here is a full example of a complete XML Schema file of personal contacts.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML instance file example

  targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
  xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
  elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
      &lt;xs:documentation&gt;
        File of personal contacts.
      &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;

              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

==Structure of an XML Schema Document==
Like any other XML file, XML Schema files normally begin with an XML declaration (&lt;code&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which is followed by a root element (always &lt;code&gt;xs:schema&lt;/code&gt;).

===The prefix===
Although any prefix can be used to refer to the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, the most common convention is to use &quot;xs&quot;. Some people prefer &quot;xsd&quot;; some prefer to use the default namespace (which means no prefix is necessary). All XML Schema elements are in this namespace.

===The root element: &lt;xs:schema&gt;===
All XML Schema files must begin and end with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:schema&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
  targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
  xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
  elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
    ...other structure here...
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
    ...any elements here...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}
The schema MUST end with an &lt;code&gt;&lt;/xs:schema&gt;&lt;/code&gt; end markup.

An XML Schema defines elements and attributes which are available in a namespace (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/contactExample&lt;/nowiki&gt;). In the XML Schema, this namespace is defined using the &lt;code&gt;targetNamespace&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

In an XML file, a namespace can be imported using the &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; attribute (&lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; stands for '''XML''' '''N'''ame'''S'''pace). The &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; attribute name can be ended with &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and a prefix (i.e. &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;). In this case, the imported tags must be used with this prefix. Prefix are used to distinguish tags with same names imported from different namespaces.

You can see that the target namespace we are defining in the example is one of the namespace imported in the XML file. You can see that we are importing the namespace of the document itself with the &lt;code&gt;tns&lt;/code&gt; prefix, so that elements we are defining in the document can be used in the document itself starting with &lt;code&gt;tns:&lt;/code&gt; .

&lt;xs:sequence&gt; is used for ordered group of elements for unordered group of elements use &lt;xs:all&gt;.

===Elements===
Elements are defined in XML Schema using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd &quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

=== Elements with text body ===
For elements with text body, the type of the text can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;ex:PersonGivenName&gt;Sue&lt;/ex:PersonGivenName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName&gt;Smith&lt;/ex:PersonFamilyName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; type=&quot;xs:date&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate&gt;1990-09-23&lt;/ex:PersonBirthDate&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Here are the common XML Schema primitive data types:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;

Some schema restrictions and facets can be defined to the data type using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:simpleType/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:restriction/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markups. For instance, a body text of string type can be fixed to a length of 5 characters using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:length/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup as above:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:white&quot;| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:simpleType&gt;
       &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xs:length value=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
     &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
   &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:PersonGivenName&gt;Kevin&lt;/ex:PersonGivenName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:PersonGivenName&gt;Helen&lt;/ex:PersonGivenName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Here are all the schema restrictions and facets that can be used:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;

===Complex element===
Any element type that can have sub-elements and/or attributes is considered as a complex element. Complex element types are defined using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:complexType/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.

==== Sub-elements of a complex element ====
Sub-elements are defined with different apparition rules.

Sub-elements can be defined into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:all/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup: the sub-elements must all exist and can appear in any order.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:all&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:all&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Sub-elements can be defined into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup: the sub-elements must appear in the same order.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Sub-elements can be defined into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup: one and only one sub-element must appear.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example

     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:choice&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Some apparition rules can be included into others apparition rules. &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup and &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup can be included into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup or a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.

            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonAge&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
       &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName /&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate /&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Number of occurrences can be changed with the &lt;code&gt;minOccurs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxOccurs&lt;/code&gt; attributes of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; minOccurs=&quot;0&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; minOccurs=&quot;3&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

By default, the minimum occurrence is 1 and the maximum occurrence is 1. To define an infinite number of occurrence, specify &lt;code&gt;unbounded&lt;/code&gt;.

===== Complex element with sub-elements and text =====
Complex elements can contain text in their body before, between and after their sub-elements setting the &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType mixed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    You can add text before,
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName /&gt;
    between,
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName /&gt;
    and after the sub-elements.
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

By default, the &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Attributes of a complex element ====
The attributes of an element can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:attribute/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;relation&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person relation=&quot;a colleague&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

If the element contains both attributes and sub-elements, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:attribute/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markups must be defined above the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:all/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup. Data types, restrictions and facets can be defined for attributes as it is for text-body-only elements.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;        
        &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;professional&quot;
            type=“xs:boolean”/&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;gender&quot;&gt;
           &lt;xs:simpleType&gt;
              &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;xs:enumeration value=&quot;woman&quot;/&gt;
                 &lt;xs:enumeration value=&quot;man&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
           &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
        
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person professional=&quot;true&quot; gender=&quot;woman&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName /&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

By default, attributes are optional. This can be changed with the &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
* If its value is &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt;, the attribute can be left.
* If its value is &lt;code&gt;required&lt;/code&gt;, the attribute must be present.

A default value can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; attribute. If the attribute is not present, the parsers will consider the attribute is present and its value is the default value.

The attribute can be restricted to a constant value with the &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute. As the &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute also acts as a default value, you must not define a &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; attribute too.

        &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;comment&quot; default=&quot;no comment&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;

...
  &lt;ex:Person gender=&quot;woman&quot; professional=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

===== Complex element with attributes and text body =====
Elements can contain both attributes and text body using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:simpleContent/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup (remember that a simple type element can't contain attributes).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
       &lt;xs:simpleContent&gt;
          &lt;xs:extension base=&quot;xs:positiveInteger&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;lastUpdate&quot; type=&quot;xs:date&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
        &lt;/xs:simpleContent&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person lastUpdate=&quot;2009-09-10&quot;&gt;
    1864
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

=== Type definition ===
Simple and complex types can be defined beside the element tree. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup has no body, keeps its &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute and has a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attribute. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:complexType/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup is then defined outside the root element with a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute containing the element type name. There is no change for the XML file validation. Let's take this XML Schema:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;LastUpdate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:simpleType&gt;
          &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:date&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xs:minExclusive value=&quot;2003-05-06&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
        &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
      &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd&quot;
    LastUpdate=&quot;2003-05-07&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Now let's define Person complex type and the LastUpdate simple type beside the root element tree:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;

Complex and simple types can be defined in any order. A defined type can be reused in different elements of the schema and then its description is not duplicated. It avoids the XSD file to be too much indented. Moreever, using type definitions, the elements have not only a name but also a type name which can be used as a class name too. Some tools used to parse XML content according to an XML Schema can require a type name for complex type elements.

=== Element and attribute reference ===
Elements and attributes can be reused using references. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup or &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:attribute/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup has no body, no &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute and has a &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute. This &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute contains the name of another element or another attribute. Let's use a reference on the Person element on the previous example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-

        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;

  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;Person&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;LastUpdate&quot; type=&quot;LastUpdateType&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The difference between separate type definition above and using reference is that any element or attribute can be referenced. Moreever, using reference, links are done using names instead of type names. This means the we are not linking classes but instances of classes.

=== Extension ===
Defined complex types can be reused adding sub-elements or attributes. The complex type is then extended. It can be done using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:complexContent/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:extension/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markups. The extended type name is defined in the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:extension/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup. Here is an example where the &lt;code&gt;PersonType&lt;/code&gt; complex type is extended with the &lt;code&gt;professional&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; element:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

    &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;
              &lt;xs:extension base=&quot;PersonType&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;professional&quot; type=&quot;xs:boolean&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
            &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ex:Person professional=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-

Various elements with common and different sub-elements or attributes can be defined like that. The common items would be defined in a common complex type and the different items would be defined in different complex types extending the first one.

===Instance Document Attributes===

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== [[XForms]] and [[XRX]] ==

I just wanted to let you know that I've been watching some of your edits recently (I watch the entire live RC feed) and you're doing some really great work on these two books. 

Also, the [[XForms]] book was voted to become a featured book a while back, so I've taken the liberty of putting the appropriate template onto the book. I hope you don't mind, but it's a nice little reminder of what a good condition that book is in. Keep up the good work! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:15, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:It's no problem, when I see good work, I like to acknowledge it. 
:Hit counting is something that we've been pursuing through the technical channels, but unfortunately it's difficult to do. We had a simple counter set up at one point, but the server for that has been down for some time. Digging back through my logs (and I have to go back to about October to get any data at all), it appears that the [[XForms]] book is getting about 300 page hits per day, total. Unfortunately, I can't break that number up by individual chapters. If I had to make a guess, I would assume that many of the page hits from readers (and the 300 number would include page hits from you and other editors) are probably centralized in the beginning chapters. Sorry I can't be more helpful in this. We are working to get a better page counter set up, but progress is slow. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:20, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Google Analytics ==

We tried Google Analytics before. However, the WMF has a privacy policy that prevents us from sharing personal tracking information with third parties. This means that we cannot install Google Analytics here on our website. There was an attempt for us to have users install the Analytics for themselves, but not enough users subscribed to it to make it worthwhile. 

A big problem with page counting is that the website is aggressively cached so we can't record hits on the database servers themselves, but the volume at the caches is huge (because WP, WB, and all the other WMF websites go though the same caches). They are working on solutions, but they are far from being available. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:42, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Screenshots ==

Hi Dan,

A quick note on your screenshots. As they are derivative works of the software they depict, they must be licensed accordingly. I updated your latest image upload license. Could you please go through your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?limit=50&amp;tagfilter=&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Dmccreary&amp;namespace=6&amp;year=&amp;month=-1 uploads] and ensure that these are properly tagged. Free license software needs compatible licensing (and should be uploaded to [[Commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] if they can be of use outside Wikibooks). Non-free may be kept in accordance with [[Wikibooks:Media]], but require a fair-use statement. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:08, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:Hello Swift.  Thank you for looking at the licenses for the images.  I apologize that I do not understand your note.  Since I create the images from my own forms I did not think they were derivative works.  I am the creator of both the form and the image.  They go together.  Neither is created by anyone else.  Perhaps I misunderstand the term &quot;derivative work&quot;.  I thought it implied that I took the work from some other area.  I also create all the forms specifically for this book.  Others are fee to put them in the commons area but I do want them to give attribution to the original authors.  My understanding is that the licenses should all be consistent with the wikibooks (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0).  I have worked hard to make sure that all images are in fact Creative Commons with Attribution but I know that sometimes I don't select the right selection dropdown list.  Is there some way to generate a report of all the images to make sure that they in fact Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0?  Do you have any documents that I should read to help create precise guidelines for the authors?  --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 12:18, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

:: The images must be licensed identically to the software and an indication should be made that they are screenshots, that you did not create the image, but rather that it is a visual representation of software. Swift added &lt;nowiki&gt;{{free screenshot|license=BSD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the image he refers to in order to indicate this. I couldn't find what license XForms uses to know if a BSD license is correct, but it would be similar for GPL or LGPL software. See [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files#Screenshots]] for more information. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:37, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

::: Hello Adrignola.  Just to clarify, XForms is not a software package but a [[W3C|World Wide Web]] standard, just like HTML or CSS.  This is a book about the standard, not a specific software package.  There are many tools use to transform the forms into HTML and CSS.    [http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms See W3C Specification] I am still trying to figure out how to license the screen images and I very much want to conform to the guidelines in the Wikibooks.  This is really complicated!  --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 13:46, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: Ah, well no wonder I couldn't find licensing information.  Maybe you'd also want to consider {{tlx|PD-ineligible}}, though that would sacrifice attribution.  Personally, I'm fine with the licensing you've put on the images (Creative Commons). -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:00, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

::::: Yes really don't want to sacrifice attribution.  We want to give our authors as much credit as we can to encourage them to contribute more.  If you are OK then I am OK.  I will wait to see if Swift has any other suggestions.  Thanks Bunches! --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 15:38, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Disp==
Disp ''variable or expression''
e.g. :Disp &quot;HELLO!&quot;

Displays on screen and scrolls down. Numbers right, strings left.
To make a blank line, type :Disp &quot;&quot;

There can be multiple expressions or variables with each having its own line

 :Disp &quot;HELLO&quot;,&quot;WORLD!&quot;

If no arguments are added, the Home screen is displayed.

==Pause==
 Pause ''variable or expression''
e.g.
 :Pause &quot;Press the right arrow key to see the rest of this sentence.&quot;

Displays on screen and scrolls down. Numbers right, strings left. If item is longer than 16 widths, user can scroll.

== Text() ==
Text(y,x,Var) or Text(y,x,Str) or Text(y,x,Str,Var)

e.g. 
&lt;pre&gt;
:Text(1,1,A) or :Text(1,1,&quot;HELLO&quot;) or :Text(1,1,&quot;VALUE IS&quot;,A)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This command displays text or variables like all the other commands, though it displays text on the draw screen, using a slightly more space efficient font size. &lt;br&gt;*Notice that this command inverts the x and y coordinates when displaying text and that it starts from the upper left 1,1 coordinate.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Text(-1,1,1,A)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This command writes the text as big as it would be written on the HomeScreen.

==Output==
Output(''x'',''y'',''expr'')
e.g. :Output(1,1,&quot;HELLO!&quot;)
This displays text starting on that square, and wraps to next line. If it is the 8th/last line, subsequent text is ignored. If it is the last command in the program, &quot;Done&quot; is prevented from displaying.
Therefore, it is useful to end a program:
&lt;pre&gt;
...
:''commands''
:''commands''
:Lbl Q:''closing commands'':'''Output(1,1,&quot;&quot;)'''
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes how to get out of problems when programs go wrong. The most common way is by killing the process - an individual program or one of its parts. If you kill a process, you'll probably lose any unsaved data in that program, and possibly from other programs it has spawned or is communicating with..

This page also describes what to do if the computer is completely frozen.

These suggestions have more adverse consequences the further down the list you go. For example killing a window in KDE will lose the unsaved data in that program, whereas pressing the reset button could corrupt all data on a hard drive (in extreme cases). Don't resort to extreme measures unless you have no other choice.

== On the Desktop ==

=== In X-Window (general) ===

The default easy-to-use application for killing frozen pieces of software when using an X environment is '''xkill'''. When executed, the mouse cursor will change to an icon of a skull and crossbones, and the next window you click will be killed.
  xkill

Sometimes this can be done by doing Control+Alt+Escape, or alternatively by bringing up the &quot;Run&quot; dialog box with ALT+F2 and typing in &quot;xkill&quot; followed by RETURN.

=== In KDE ===

[http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdebase/ksysguard/usingtheksysguard.html KDE System Guard] (installed by default) can be used to kill troublesome processes. '''Ctrl+Esc''' is the default key combination for starting it, or run ''ksysguard''.

=== In GNOME ===

The '''gnome-system-monitor''' GUI program is one way to view active processes, end processes, and kill them too. There is also a &quot;Force Quit&quot; widget which can be added to a panel which replicates the function of '''xkill'''.

== Killing at the Console ==

The easiest way of stopping a program running on the terminal you are using is pressing '''Ctrl+C''', which asks a program to stop (sends [[w:SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]]) - but the program can ignore this. Ctrl+C also works on programs like XTerm or Konsole. See also [[#Alt+SysRq|Alt+SysRq+K]] below.

In addition, there are several commands to kill processes from any terminal window, not just the one a program is running from. You can use a program like XTerm or Konsole to provide a fake terminal, or you can switch to a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+function key; ie '''Ctrl+Alt+F2''' to Ctrl+Alt+F6 (depending on your system). Ctrl+Alt+F7 gets you back to the desktop (again, depending on your system).

The [[Guide to UNIX/Commands/Process Management]] page has more information on process management commands, but a few popular ones are below:
* '''pkill''' and '''killall''' are the most useful program-killing commands, and they do similar things. Just type
 pkill -[[w:SIGTERM|TERM]] ''program_name''
:or
 killall ''program_name''
:In addition, '''pgrep''' can be used to list running processes.

== Forcing the X Window System to Quit ==

* To kill and restart the X Window System, press '''Ctrl+Alt+Backspace'''. Lots of programs need X-Window, so using this will cause most running programs to quit or crash.
* You should probably try to reset your computer after this: type
 shutdown -r now
:to do this. You may need to be root.
* If you have access to the command line, you can also type
 sudo /etc/init.d/(gdm or kdm or xdm) shutdown
:to stop X.
* Note that the ability to restart X by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Backspace can be disabled from X's configuration file. In the X.Org implementation, a &quot;DontZap&quot; option can be added to xorg.conf to do this. If Ctrl+Alt+Backspace is not working, this may be the reason why.

If you do '''Ctrl+Alt+Backspace''' and you have a login manager like XDM enabled usually you will be thrown back to that after x RESTARTS. If you started X by typing startx this will usually throw you back to the command line

'''Ctrl+Alt+Backspace''' is useful for restarting X after changing the resolution, for example, too.

== Alt+SysRq ==

If all else fails, you may still be able to communicate with the [[w:kernel|Kernel]].

To use, just press the Alt and [[w:sysrq|SysRq]] (PrintScreen) keys and one of the keys listed below, all together. You should try switch into a terminal window, if possible, first by pressing '''Ctrl+Alt+F2''' ''(use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the desktop)''.

If your computer is not responding you can use the following steps to perform a reboot with less chance of [[w:fscking|fscking]] your files. This is a suggested method:
# Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch to a terminal window. Sometimes, this is not possible.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''R''' to get the keyboard
# If pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2 before failed, try it again now.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''E''' to term all processes.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''I''' to kill all processes.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''S''' to sync your disks.
# '''Wait''' for OK or Done message. If you don't see a message, look at your HDD light to see if Sync made a difference.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''U''' to umount all disk drives.
# '''Wait''' for OK or Done message. If you don't see a message, in 15-30 seconds, assume disks are unmounted (or that an unmount is not posssible) and proceed.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''B''' to reboot.

The Letters used spell REISUB - use the mnemonic ''Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken''. Another popular one is ''Raising Elephants Is So Utterly Boring'', or just spell BUSIER backwards.

The Full list of available commands is shown below. It's largely taken from [http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysrq.txt Documentation/sysrq.txt] in the Linux Kernel Sources.

Certain systems (systems administrated by a department or group other than yourself, e.g. a corporate or government location) may remove the ability to use the SysRq key combinations in order to secure their system from low level commands. If you try a few commands and notice nothing is happening, or error messages occur, this may be the case.

== The Big Red Button ==

The final option is, of course, the power button on your computer's physical exterior. Modern PCs have [[wikipedia:ACPI|ACPI]] buttons, which just send the shutdown request to the kernel. If the ACPI [[wikipedia:software daemon|daemon]] is listening and correctly configured, it can signal &lt;code&gt;[[wikipedia:init|init]]&lt;/code&gt; and perform a clean shutdown.

If ACPI doesn't work, you will need to cut off electrical power. This is done through a &quot;hard switch&quot; (generally labeled &quot;reset&quot;), possibly using the same button as before but holding it pressed for 5 or so seconds. Taking out the battery (on laptops) and physically disconnecting all power cables is, of course, the only method guaranteed to work. (Make sure no other method listed above works. Even as a last resort, unplugging your computer while it is running is still not recommended.)

Resetting without shutting down can cause problems with the file system. To try and fix this problem, fsck will be run when you next boot up, and journaling filesystems will attempt to complete or rollback files which were changing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I am creating this XML Schema WikiBook for used by XML instructors everywhere.  The goal is to have linkable learning content that can be integrated into open source learning managment systems such as Moodle.  I have tried to be consistant and use ISO/IEC data element name conventions so this class is consistant with other classes in ebXML, NIEM and GJXDM.

Please feel free to add content by linking to seperate pages.

Hello,

Under &quot;Common XML Schema Primitive Data Types&quot; table, the definition of &lt;sequence&gt; states that children can have zero or unbounded occurrence. The default is that it has a minimum occurrence of one time, and a maximum occurrence of one time. So, a child element must appear once and only once, unless the minOccurs or maxOccurs option is used.

Also, &quot;xsd&quot; as a prefix is used in the table, but xs is used in the example. Although both are valid, it seems inconsistent.

[[File:Deforestation near Bukit Tiga Puluh NP.jpg|right|400px|Deforestation and forest burning for oil palm plantation in the buffer zone of Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Riau Province, Indonesia.]]
In the second half of the 20th century the pace of growth of the world population and its technological capacity to utilise natural resources increased to such a degree that human activity now impinges on all segments of the biosphere. As the scale of habitat destruction has multiplied so have human efforts for the remainder to be vigilantly protected by applying ecological principles to safeguard, legislate, evaluate and manage fragile ecosystems and their declining species.  

Conservation on a global scale may be approached either through organisations that focus on its rare and endangered species or through the work of others that highlight the world's 'fragile' habitats. The international bodies that illustrate these two complementary approaches are the World Conservation Union and UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere programme.

The World Conservation Union (http://www.iucn.org/) began as the International Union for the Protection of Nature (or IUPN) founded in October 1948 following an international conference in Fontainebleau, France. The organization changed its name to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 1956 and became the  &quot;World Conservation Union&quot; began in 1990.  The full name and the acronym are often used together as many people still know the Union as IUCN

The theme of 'man and the biosphere' became an international concern in 1972 with the launch of UNESCO's programme of environmental research.  It is an interdisciplinary undertaking of environmental research initiated to develop the basis, within the natural and social sciences, for the rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere, and for the improvement of the global relationship between people and the environment. The hallmark of the MAB Programme is its holistic and interdisciplinary approach. Examination of human impacts on a specific ecosystem - that is, the interrelationship between people and the environment - requires studies of both the natural sciences (e.g. climatology, biology, soil sciences and forestry) and the social sciences (e.g. economics, human geography and sociology). Hence, the name of the programme: &quot;Man and the Biosphere&quot; or 'MAB'(http://www.unesco.org/mab/). 

The World Conservation Union is probably best known for monitoring the state of the world's species through the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  But it also supports and develops conservation science; implements this research in field projects around the world; and then links both research and results to local, national, regional and global policy by convening dialogues between governments, civil society and the private sector.

The priority of the Union's current Programme (2005-2008) is to build recognition of the many ways in which human lives and livelihoods, especially of the poor, depend on the sustainable management of natural resources.
In its projects, the Union applies sound ecosystem management to conserve biodiversity and builds sustainable livelihoods for those directly dependent on natural resources. The Union is actively engaged in managing and restoring ecosystems and improving people's lives, economies and societies.

The Union's databases, assessments, guidelines and case studies, prepared by its global membership, Commissions and Secretariat, are among the world's most respected and frequently cited sources of information and reference on the environment.

As the world's largest environmental knowledge network, the Union has helped over 75 countries to prepare and implement national conservation and biodiversity strategies. The Union also has the official status of Observer at the United Nations General Assembly.

UNESCOs MAB programme uses an applied ecological approach that focuses on mountain ecosystems, on arid lands or on humid tropical forests. Shortly after the programme was launched in April 1973, a panel of experts met in Salzburg, Austria, to discuss the &quot;Impact of human activities on mountain and tundra ecosystems&quot;. Its task was to elaborate the scientific content of projects to be proposed under the MAB Programme. The panel recommended study of the following factors: 

:human settlements at high altitudes;
:effects of land-use alternatives on mountain ecosystems;
:impact of large-scale technology on mountain ecosystems;
:effects of tourism and recreation on mountain ecosystems.

A working group assembled in Lillehammer, Norway, later in 1973 to define further the scope, objectives, methodologies and possible outputs of studies in areas where problems were acknowledged. This meeting led to a more clearly defined identification of thematic and regional problems requiring study, as follows: 

:resource development and human settlements in high tropical mountains (i.e. above 2 500 us and between the latitudes 30° north and 30° south), including the tropical Andes, the South Asia mountain complexes and the East African and Ethiopian highlands; 

:tourism, technology and land use in temperate mountains in the middle latitudes (approximately latitudes 30° to 60° north and south), where there are distinct winter and summer seasons; 

:land-use problems in high-latitude mountain and tundra ecosystems, with special reference to grazing, industrial development and recreation.

In order that study methods and results could be compared, the working group in Lillehammer identified tentative &quot;minimal&quot; research requirements for both natural sciences (e.g. climatology and soil sciences) and social sciences (e.g. sociology and economics). It was considered vital that the results of regional mountain studies in one area could be compared with those elsewhere in an international context. 

The variables identified for study in mountain areas may appear obvious and simplistic - air temperature, precipitation and wind velocity, for example, in climatic studies. Nevertheless, considerable efforts were made to achieve international agreement on a uniform and consistent methodology for research on mountain ecosystems within the framework of an intergovernmental scientific programme. Conceptually, the establishment of this catalogue of minimal research requirements was an important step forward in international cooperative research. As a consequence, a large number of case studies were carried out worldwide within the framework of the MAB Programme, in particular in the Andes and the Alps. 

In the early 1990s, the MAB Programme entered into a new phase following the decision of its governing body, the MAB International Co-ordinating Council. The three new major thrusts are: scientific capacity building, research on biological diversity and ecological processes, and promoting the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The third undertaking proved to be particularly successful and there are currently 352 biosphere reserves in 87 countries; of these, over 40 percent are located in mountain regions. 

Biosphere reserves are areas of terrestrial and coastal/marine ecosystems where, through appropriate zoning patterns and land management, the conservation of ecosystems and their biodiversity is combined with the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of local communities. Thus, they represent a major tool for implementing the concerns of Agenda 21 (such as Chapter 13 on mountains), the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international agreements. 

The concept of &quot;biosphere reserve&quot; implies environmental conservation, scientific research and sustainable development. The management of biosphere reserves aims to show that environmental conservation can be used to promote sustainable development based on scientific research findings together with a partnership with the local people. This is realized through a specific land-use system, which takes into account the topographic, biological, economic and socio-cultural characteristics of each site. 

Biosphere reserves have three different, but interrelated, functions: 

; Conservation : Biosphere reserves provide protection of indigenous genetic resources, plant and animal species, ecosystems and landscapes of value for the conservation of the world's biological diversity. 

; Development : Biosphere reserves seek to combine conservation concerns with sustainable use of resources through close cooperation with local communities, taking advantage of traditional knowledge, indigenous products and appropriate land management.
 
; Networking : Biosphere reserves are linked through a global network; they provide facilities for research, monitoring, education and training at the local level as well as for comparative research and monitoring programmes at an international or regional level.

While the relative importance of these three basic functions will vary from case to case, it is a combination of their roles that characterizes the distinctive feature of biosphere reserves. The articulation of these roles is translated on the ground through a pattern of zonation. This includes a core area (or areas) that is strictly protected according to pre-established conservation objectives. The core area is surrounded by, or contiguous with, a delineated buffer zone (or zones) where only activities that are compatible with the conservation objectives can take place. Finally, a more loosely defined transition area encircles the core and buffer areas and here cooperation with the local population and sustainable resource management practices are developed. 

At the heart of the international community's interactions with the global environment, particularly through actions mandated by two World Environment Summits, is the United Nationals Environment Programme (UNEP (http://www.unep.org/))  Biodiversity information for policy and action to conserve the living world is provided by UNEP's World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge.  Its programmes concentrate on species, forests, protected areas, marine, mountains and freshwaters; plus habitats affected by climate change such as Polar Regions. It also address the relationship between trade and the environment and the wider aspects of biodiversity assessment.(http://www.unep-wcmc.org/) 

Between them, MAB the WCU and the WCMC, are well placed to provide answers to questions about the state of major international habitats and rare species.

== Objective ==

This module is intended to describe some of the protected sites and species of major international importance with respect to the following three questions about their state as an endangered resource:

* What is happening?
* What is being done?
* What should be done?

Welcome to the Ada implementations of the [[Algorithms]] Wikibook.  For those who are new to [[Ada Programming]] a few notes:

* All examples are fully functional with all the needed input and output operations. However, only the code needed to outline the algorithms at hand is copied into the text - the full samples are available via the download links. &lt;small&gt;(Note: It can take up to 48 hours until the cvs is updated)&lt;/small&gt;.
* We seldom use predefined types in the sample code but define special types suitable for the algorithms at hand.
* Ada allows for default function parameters; however, we always fill in and name all parameters, so the reader can see which options are available.
* We seldom use shortcuts - like using the attributes {{Ada/attribute|Image}} or {{Ada/attribute|Value}} for String &lt;=&gt; Integer conversions.

All these rules make the code more elaborate than perhaps needed.  However, we also hope it makes the code easier to understand

== You found me! ==

Why you came here, is a mystery,

A mystery so involved,

That you can think till hell would freeze,

and never would it be solved!


Sorry, This is my talk page, you are welcome to leave a message after the scream, or alternatively write a message down, stick it to my igloo and I will pick it up when I get back!!!
[[Image:igloo.jpg|160px|right|This is my igloo.]]

Here comes the scream...




== AAAAAARGH!!!!! ==

== denoting dietary restrictions ==

Hi, I added a section to [[Cookbook:Policy#Cookbook_Pages]] which should be clear about what I meant. What I want to avoid is &quot;tagging&quot; all recipes which happen to be gluten-free/vegan/vegetarian in the page title; that is what categories are for. &quot;Tagging&quot; substantial variations in the title, however, is necessary for disambiguation. Oh, and I'm not sure &quot;(Diabetic)&quot; is the best naming convention... maybe &quot;(Low-GI)&quot;? When you decide on one, please add it to [[Cookbook_talk:Low-GI Diet]] [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Enjoy. I see you're a fellow IT guy too.  Nice. Please visit [[w:Special:MergeAccount|Special:MergeAccount]] to merge your accounts. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:36, 22 June 2010 (UTC)
:I was importing some templates and noticed your concern about pending changes at Wikipedia on a template talk page.  Must be quite the twilight zone here, then, with every main space page subject to the system once an initial review is performed. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:48, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
::It's not quite the twilight zone, Adrignola.  The only thing which annoys me about pending changes is that it takes away some of the spirit of &quot;The encyclopedia anyone can edit&quot; - for some people, half the fun of editing Wikis is knowing that your work is out there immediately and you can feel proud of it.  Waiting for someone to check it first, (which on the German version of wikipedia has taken up to 4 weeks, and in my case, I still have an unsighted edit there from nearly 2 years ago), removes some of the joy of the work.  

I spoke to someone about PC here on the IRC channel yesterday evening, and they said someone here could assign me the editor bit, since I'm active at so many Wikis and well known to the en.wp community. Is that possible? [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 00:51, 25 June 2010 (UTC)
:Yes it is, and it's done.  I see that you've contributed here since 2006, so that was the basis for my decision to assign it.  (We don't take other wikis into consideration on that, by convention, despite the clout that Wikipedia does indeed have).  We have a backlog here too, but for many of us, there's not much to do about it because the system was in place before we got here and there's not enough participation to get a consensus for or against its continued use. Some people are concerned about it decreasing participation, just as some are at Wikipedia.  It's essential for the Wikijunior namespace at least, but elsewhere, that's the question.  Many just use it as a replacement for page patrol, which wasn't the point.  So there we stand. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:04, 25 June 2010 (UTC)

== I requested the removal of the editor flag ==
Hello BarkingFish. I'm sorry in having to contact you on this terms, but due to recent discussions regarding reviewer and editor flags and the future of these groups, I started to analise the status of some accounts especially in the editors group and noticed that your level of contribution and your requirements to perform normal Wikibookian tasks may not warrant granting you the editor flag.&lt;br&gt;
With all respect for you and your activity on the project, and hopping that you indeed get to need and use the reviewer and editor tools, I requested for the flag to be removed. Feel free to express your opinion on the running [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions#BarkingFish|Removal of access request]] or ask any questions here on your talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:34, 4 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Double Entry is the principle of accounting which requires that every transaction has two effects one of which is a debit and the other of which is a credit of the same amount. What this means is that the total of the Debits must always equal the total of the Credits.

In this example we deposit 10 units of currency into our bank account.
{{Drcr| date=2005&lt;br&gt;Feb | day=1 | cr = Cash (Asset) | dr = Bank (Asset) | amount = 10}}
Since the total of the Debits equals the total of the Credits we say the transaction is Balanced.


==The Accounting Equation==

*&lt;math&gt; A = Assets &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; L = Liabilities &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; F = Owners' Funds &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; C = Capital &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; D = Drawings &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; P = Profit &lt;/math&gt;

The Value of the business is the value of its assets less the value of its liabilities and this value belongs to the owners of the business:

&lt;math&gt;A - L = F &lt;/math&gt;

The Owners fund must also equal the amount the owners have put into the business (Capital) less any amounts they have taken out (Drawings) plus any profit.  For the time being we assume the business is profitable.


&lt;math&gt;A - L = C - D + P &lt;/math&gt;

We add &lt;math&gt;D + L&lt;/math&gt; to both sides to remove the minus signs.
&lt;math&gt;A + D = C + P + L&lt;/math&gt;

We call items on the left hand side Debits and items on the right hand side Credits.  Then:

&lt;math&gt; Total Debits = Total Credits &lt;/math&gt;

In order that this equation holds we must also ensure that a loss is on the opposite side to a profit and therefore a loss is a debit.  

Note that items of income increase profit so they are also credits, while expenses decrease profit and are therefore debits.

==When to Debit, when to Credit?==
Another look.
Debit (Dr) and Credit (Cr) only refer to which side of the double entry an account/value goes to. Debit on left, and Credit on right. The '''normal''' of an account refers to which side it normally increases on, whether it be good or bad for the company.

The D.E.A.D. C.O.I.L. Mnemonic

*Debit side
**Expenses
**Assets
**Drawing (of Equity)
*Credit side
**Owner's Equity
**Income
**Liabilities

Another-nother look.

Debit/Credit-ishness of an account comes from the elements of the accounting equation, Owner's Equity=Assets - Liabilities, and lots of flipping. 

Start by looking at the Dr. side. 
#If your account is an Equity term, flip it. 
#*Equity terms are Capital, Drawing, Income, Expenses. These are the financial borders of the business.
#If it's a Liability, flip it.
#*Liabilities are negative (well, it's good to have access to resources now, but they still are a hole that demands filling). Remember, if somebody prepaid you for a something you haven't fulfilled, that's a liability too!
#If is an [[Wikipedia:Mirror%2C_Mirror_%28Star_Trek%29 |&quot;evil parallel universe&quot;]] form of  an Asset, Liability,or Equity, then flip it (again, if need be).
#*Expenses are equity accounts, in a negative way. Drawing is a negative overlay to Capital, and gets flipped here, too. Depreciation (an overlayed contra-asset), flips as well.
#You now know the '''normal''' of the account. One last flip if the account needs to be reduced.
Within all of this flipping, Debit/Credit has two meanings, whether a term is negative to the company's finances, and whether it is external to the company. By demanding each entry set to balance, the journal tracks motions of money (or widgets, labor..) in the company. Changes of value are expressed as a motion into yet another account, such as moving part of the &quot;Merchandise&quot; Asset (as Cr) into the &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; Expense (as Dr).

As a mnemonic device for students:
Note that only Assets and Expenses show an Increase for Debits and Decrease for Credits. All other accounts are the reverse. First memorize the acronyms AID (Assets Increase Decrease) &amp; EID (Expenses Increase Decrease)and then keep in mind that the table reads Debits on the left and Credits on the right.

== Overview ==

'''''Hannah Abbott''''' is a Hufflepuff student in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s year, a pink-faced blonde girl who wears her hair in pigtails. She's sweet, kind and giggly.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Hannah Abbott is the first student called up to be Sorted; the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] places her in Hufflepuff.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

'''Hannah Abbott''', here identified only as ''Hannah'', is one of the group of Hufflepuffs discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]]'s decision to remain in hiding when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is thought to be the Heir of Slytherin, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets/Chapter_11|''The Duelling Club'']].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===
At one point in their third year, Hannah was convinced that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] could turn into a flowering shrub, which in hindsight is less silly than it might sound at first.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

House loyalty had Hannah wearing a ''Support [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]!'' badge [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 19|early]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. Despite occasional incidents like this, she and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]] are on friendly terms with Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Both Hannah and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]] became [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefects]] in August of Harry's fifth year.

Hannah is one of the students present at the initial meeting, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], of the group that becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]].

It is mentioned that Hannah Abbott, at Easter break some six weeks before the OWL exams, is looking frantic and checking stacks of books out of the library.

Hannah had the unhappy distinction of being the first of Harry's year to crack under the strain of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.]] study, requiring a Calming Draught from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] after she broke down crying in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], saying she was too stupid to take her exams.

While Harry is taking his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|transfiguration]] O.W.L, Hannah somehow manages to turn her ferret into a flock of flamingos, postponing the exam for ten minutes.

Hannah is also one of the six members of Dumbledore's Army who see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] attempting to jinx [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] on the Hogwarts Express, and promptly return fire, leaving Draco, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] looking like gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts robes.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In this book, Hannah's mother is killed by a rumoured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], and she leaves the school for most of the term after being told this in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] class.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry sees a grave marked &quot;Abbott&quot; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] and wonders aloud whether the person was one of Hannah's relatives. The question is never answered, but it serves to remind us of Hannah's mother having recently been killed by Death Eaters.

As Harry is on his way to the Room of Requirement, where he now believes Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem is hidden, he passes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], and Hannah Abbott guarding a hole behind a plinth where a statue had fallen. The statue had previously been masking one of the secret passages into Hogwarts.

As the renewed battle rages, Harry from under the Invisibility Cloak, casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|Shield spells]] in the path of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s curses. Voldemort's intended victims, Hannah and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]], run past and into the Great Hall.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==
OWL exams make her worry to no end.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

She is most often seen in the company of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]].

In an interview given following the publication of the final book in the series, the author said that Abbot marries [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], and becomes the new landlady of the Leaky Cauldron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depreciation relates to an entity's change in fair market value and how the fluctuation in value is processed as a tax-deductible expense. 

* [[/Property, plant, and equipment/]]

== Depreciation ==
Depreciation occurs over a period of useful economic life, in which the property, plant or equipment is used to generate income for the business.

Several methods can be used to calculate the depreciable cost of an asset over its life, the most commonly used are:

*Straight-line method
*Reducing balance method

=== Straight-line Method ===

The Straight-line Method reduces the Net-Book value of an asset by the same amount each period.
This amount is determined by dividing the total value of said asset by some number of periods, then subtracted from the balance at the end of each period. 

For example,if you purchased a sewing machine for $12,000 and you wrote it off over 12 months using the Straight-line method, you would divide the original cost ($12,000) by the term of useful life (12 months).  In this case, $12,000 / 12 months = $1,000/month.  To apply depreciation on this item, you would deduct $1,000 at the end of the first month to leave a balance of $11,000. The second month you would deduct another $1,000 leaving a balance of $10,000. At the end of the 12th month, you would deduct the last $1,000 from the previous (11th months) balance of $1,000, leaving you with a balance of $0.

At this point you would say that you have ''written off'' the sewing machine. In practice, things get a little more complicated. In this example it would not be fair to assume that at the end of the 12th month the machine would suddenly stop working, or be absolutely worthless, though for tax purposes it is considered to have zero basis. It is possible you could still sell the completely written off sewing machine for $1,000, causing you to recognize a $1,000 taxable gain.

The economic reasoning behind the Straight-line method is, essentially, the acceptance that depreciation is an approximation of the rate at which an asset transfers value to the Operations of a business by participating productively in it, and so we should use the most economical one (regarding computational effort) to calculate and record it in the accounting books. There are certain ''Intangible Assets'' for which the Straight-Line method can be considered the relatively more accurate one. But for most ''Tangible Assets'' there is good argument that the Declining Balance method is more suitable (see below). Nevertheless, the simplicity of the Straight-line method had made it the prevailing one, accepted by economists, accountants, analysts, businesses, and even state authorities (for tax purposes).

=== Declining (or Reducing) Balance Method ===
The Net-Book value of an asset is reduced by the same proportion each period. That is, at the end of every period you reduce the value by a fixed percentage. Each period uses the previous period's balance to work out the amount.

For example, we purchase a motor-vehicle for $10,000 and we depreciate it by 10% per month. At the end of the first month we take $10,000 * 10% = $1,000, making the balance $9,000. At the end of the second month, we take the '''balance''' from the previous month and apply the 10% factor: $9,000 * 10% = $900.  Note the change in depreciation: in the first month the expense was $1,000, but in this month it is $900. At the end of this second month, you subtract the new depreciation amount, resulting in $9,000 - $900 = $8,100. The depreciation for the third month, then, is $8,100 * 10% = $810; the remaining value at the end of the third month is $8,100 - $810 = $7,290. At the end of 12 months the balance would be $3138.11.

The economic reasoning behind the Declining Balance Method of Depreciation is that any asset (think of machinery to stay focused), no matter how carefully serviced by its user, is most productive during the earlier periods of its productive use. Mathematically, the same depreciation rate will extinguish the value of an asset much more quickly under The Straight Line Method than under the Declining Balance Method. In the above example, a $10,000 value with a 10% monthly depreciation rate will be extinguished after 10 months of calculating and recording depreciation by the Straight Line method. But it will take ~22 months to extinguish 9/10 of the value under depreciation using the Declining Balance Method on the same value and with the same depreciation rate. So caution should be exercised when choosing the Declining Balance Method.

=== The &quot;Useful Life&quot; approach ===
Since Accounting Depreciation attempts to capture a real economic phenomenon, it must be based on economic reasoning. It is not a mechanical procedure or an arithmetic exercise. The prevailing concern when determining depreciation methodology should not be to &quot;guess&quot; the correct depreciation rate, but to estimate reasonably the useful life of the asset under depreciation in time-units, and then calculate the corresponding depreciation rate that will result in extinguishing the value of the asset from the books when the estimated useful life ends too, given the Depreciation method chosen.

In the Straight-Line method, the mapping of Useful Life to Depreciation Rate is easy. If &quot;x&quot; is the estimated useful life, say in years, then the Yearly Depreciation Rate &quot;d&quot; is d = 1/x. For example, if you expect that the company will use a vehicle for 10 years, then the Yearly Depreciation Rate for this vehicle is 1/10 = 0,1 = 10%, under the Straight-line method.

In the Declining Balance Method, things are trickier. First we must note that from a mathematical point of view, the value of the asset is never fully extinguished under the Declining Balance method, but it approaches arbitrarily close to zero. In practice, companies that use the Declining Balance Method, decide on a &quot;materiality threshold&quot; for the non-depreciated (residual) value of the asset, usually up to 10% of its initial purchase value.  Essentially then, they calculate the depreciation rate which, under the Declining Balance method, will extinguish the largest part of the Value of the asset (i.e. 90% or 95%) at the end of its economic useful life. When they reach that point in time, they depreciate what's left in the next accounting period.

Now, the Declining Balance method is expressed as a Difference Equation. Denote &quot;d&quot; the depreciation rate, &quot;r&quot; the remaining value at the end of the estimated useful life, as a percentage of initial purchase value (=&gt;  0 &lt; r &lt; 1) and V(t) the nondepreciated value of the asset at the end of period t. Denote also &quot;n&quot; the useful life of the asset, say in years. 
Then you have
 V(t) = (1-d)*V(t-1)    subject to  V(n)= r*V(0) where V(0) is the purchase value of the asset.

Going backwards in the Difference equation and writing for period &quot;n&quot; you get

 V(n) = (1-d)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;*V(0)  together with  V(n)= r*V(0)

Solving together the two equations you get
 (1-d)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = r 

So we see that by estimating the useful life of the asset (the &quot;n&quot;), and given that we have chosen a residual value (the &quot;r&quot;, as a percentage of the initial purchase value of the asset), we can uniquely determine the required depreciation rate &quot;d&quot; to use in our depreciation calculations so that our accounting books reflect, at least approximately, what happens in actual economic activity.

==General Elections==

Members of the House of Commons are elected in General Elections.
General Elections are called by the Prime Minister.  General Elections are held at least once every five years. The maximum term that a parliament can exist before a new election interrupts it is defined by parliament. Currently, the [[w:Parliament Act|Parliament Act]] states that five years is the maximum length.

==Local Elections==

From 2007 Scotland will use Single Transferable Vote to elect all of its local councillors.  England and Wales use first past the post or multiple-member first past the post for local elections.  Northern Ireland uses STV for its local elections.

==European Elections==

Members of the European Parliament for Northern Ireland are elected using Single Transferable Vote (STV).  MEPs for England, Scotland and Wales are elected using the D'Hondt method.

There are a number of commercial and free software tools available that are designed to help the System Administrator strengthen the security of their system. Depending on the security requirements, a number of these utilities can be employed on a regular basis to strength-check their system security, look for indications of an attack or a compromised system, and implement more secure procedures.

==COPS==
This venerable package consists of a series of scripts and binaries that can be used to check some basic security configurations on a UNIX system. The last update to this package was version 1.04, released in 1991. hence this tool is starting to show its age, and may require some fine tuning to operate on a modern version of UNIX. The output will vary according to the UNIX vendor and OS version. (There is also a perl version included in the package, but was based on a much older version of perl and is known to have some bugs.)

The following groups of checks are performed by the COPS utility:

# Check selected system directories for world-write permissions.
# Check specific system files for world-write permissions.
# Check all files on the system for setuid status and note changes.
# Check for insecure entries in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.
# Check the format of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file.
# Check the root account &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt;, and for a root entry in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/ftpuser&lt;/code&gt;.
# Check for world-writeable files in &lt;code&gt;/etc/rc*&lt;/code&gt;.
# Check for world-writeable files in &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/crontab&lt;/code&gt;.
# Check specific startup and configuration files in the user home directories.
# Use the ''U-Kuang'' rules-based expert system to check for potential security exploits.

==Checksum utilities==
There are UNIX utilities such as &lt;code&gt;cksum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;md5&lt;/code&gt; that can be used to read the contents of a file and produce a one-way hashed values, or checksums, as an output. The value of the resulting string will change whenever the contents of a file is changed, so this utility can be used to check whether a downloaded file has been tampered with inappropriately. The string can also be used to check whether a file was corrupted during the download process.

For example,

 $ mdf important_data.pdf
 MD5 (important_data.pdf) = 46df33cb1473394c32a8910d162eb913

Whenever a System Administrator downloads a program or patch that will be executed on a UNIX system, it is important that the checksum of the file be compared with the value at a secure source. This will help to protect the system from illicit tampering. Many vendors will provide checksum values for the downloadable files that they make available. When possible, a stronger utility such as &lt;code&gt;md5&lt;/code&gt; should be used instead of &lt;code&gt;cksum&lt;/code&gt;, as this will make it vastly more difficult for an attacker to produce a tampered file that has the same checksum.

Checksums can also be used to validate the binary commands on a system. Some integrity-checking utilities such as &lt;code&gt;tripwire&lt;/code&gt; use multiple checksum programs to search for file modifications.

==OpenSSH==

      <text xml:space="preserve">When distilling herbs into teas, you will likely want to crush them for maximum effect.  This can be done in a number of ways.

==Mortar and pistel==
A [[w:Mortar and pestel|mortar and pestel]] is useful for any kind of leafy, grassy, woody, or tuberous herb.  This consists of a ''mortar'', a small stone bowl; and a ''pestel'', a stone stick.  The pestel can be used to grind anything against the rough surface of the mortar.

A mortar and pestel can be used to crush herbs up very well, releasing as much juice or oil as possible.  The mortar and pestel can easily be flushed into whatever preparation vessel is being used in recipes involving water; this prevents mechanical loss.  Simply pour some of the water over the pestel and into the mortar, then pour out into the preparation vessel.

==Garlic press==
A [[w:Garlic press]] is a quick and dirty way to crush tuberous or bulbous herbs.  It consists of a metal screen and a press, and works by forcing the stiff root through the metal screen.

Garlic presses are also relatively easy to flush, and quick to use; however, they do not crush the herb up as well as a mortar and pestel.

==Shredder==
A shredder or grater can be used as a fast and easy method of grinding up most leafy, grassy, or tuberous herbs.  Many graters have a rough side filled with small holes lined with jagged edges, useful for shredding plants into a pulpy form.

Shredders are fast and easy to use, but difficult to prevent mechanical loss in.  The pulpy result sticks to the grater, and flushing a large one can be difficult.

=Morphy Defence=
By far the most commonly played Black third move in the Ruy Lopez game is the Morphy variation, 3...a6, which &quot;puts the question&quot; to the white bishop.
Although 3...a6 was known earlier, it became popular after it was played by Paul Morphy.
White has only two good options, [[/4. Bxc6|4. Bxc6]] or [[/4. Ba4|4. Ba4]].
The main point to 3...a6 is that after the common retreat 4.Ba4, Black will have the possibility of breaking the pin on his queen knight by playing ...b5.
In fact, White must take some care to not fall into the Noah's Ark Trap in which Black traps White's king bishop on the b3-square with a ...a6, ...b5, and ...c4 pawn advance on the queenside.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some resources on this topic:

In ''Classroom Instruction That Works: Research-Based Strategies for Increasing Student Achievement'', Robert  J. Marzano analyzes research from more than 100 studies on classroom management. He synthesizes the findings from these studies into a series of &quot;Action Steps&quot;, which include specific strategies that educators can use. 
The Action Steps relate to setting the tone, establishing effective rules and procedures, implementing appropriate disciplinary interventions, fostering productive student-teacher relationships, developing a positive &quot;mental set,&quot; and helping students contribute to a positive learning environment. Marzano and his coauthors Jana S. Marzano and Debra Pickering provide stories of teachers and students in classroom situations to help illustrate how the action steps can be used successfully. 

Also available are books by Emmer, Evertson and Worsham, including ''Classroom Management for Secondary Teachers'' and ''Classroom Management for Elementary Teachers''. 

The best-selling book on this topic (according to Amazon.com) is ''The First Days of School'' by Harry Wong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Want a Wikibooks account? ==
Thanks for updating [[US History/Contents/W Bush]] page to match current events. Those expensive printed textbooks might not have Samuel Alito on the US Supreme Court yet, but our free textbook [[US History]] is already updated because of ''you''.

It is optional, but if you want, you can '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. If you already have an account, '''[[Special:Userlogin|log in]]'''. A Wikibooks account is easy to create; it does not require any personal information (only a name or pseudonym, plus a password); it identifies you as a user (even if your Internet address changes from &quot;71.96.150.44&quot; to something else); it lets you track your own contributions and keep a [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] of pages.

Whether you use an account or not, we [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] hope that you enjoy your time at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:51, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Use===

The subjunctive mood is used to describe circumstances in which there is doubt, to express emotion, or opinion through the use of impersonal expressions (Es bueno/malo/triste que...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The perfect subjunctive is used in reference to something that happened very recently. 

Espero que '''tú hayas hecho''' la tarea. &lt;br&gt;
I hope that '''''you have done''''' the homework. &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Es muy triste que '''''los niños no hayan escrito''' sus ensayos. &lt;br&gt;
It is very sad that '''''the children have not written''''' their essays. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Formation===

The perfect subjunctive is formed by combining the present subjunctive form of the verb ''haber'', meaning ''to have'', with the past participle of the functional verb. &lt;br&gt;

'''''Haber''''', present subjunctive
*Yo haya
*Tú hayas
*Usted, ella, él haya
*Nosotros hayamos
*Vosotros hayáis
*Ustedes, ellas, ellos hayan

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Advanced Placement}}

'''[[Subject:Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement]]''' exams are created and administered by the College Board, The same organization that does SATs. The AP exam tests your knowledge of a specific subject at the college level. It is scored from 1 to 5, with 3 usually being the minimum to get college credit. The tests are taken in May, and the scores usually arrive by July.

It is not necessary to take an AP class to take that exam, and vice versa. However, it is a good idea to do so.

Unlike the SAT, AP exams contain open-ended questions in conjunction with multiple choice questions. Before the May 2011 AP exams, points were taken off for incorrect multiple choice answers, but this is not done at present.

== Colour-code a string ==

Is there any method on wikibooks to colour-code a string? Specifically, I want to colour-code the entries in [[The Computer Revolution: A Timeline]] into either hardware, system software and internet. There needs to be a way to follow each individual thread but there also needs to be a way to easily see where they fit in between each other. Thanks for the earlier advice btw. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 08:42, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

:Most format stuff is documented in [[m:Help:Editing]], and they have color in [[m:Help:HTML in wikitext]], but for this you might need [[CSS]]. Things like &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #99ff99;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #99ff99;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) work in my browser. CSS seems to work the same way on this wiki as it does in [[Programming:HTML|HTML]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:16, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks. Ciao.

== [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] ==

I'm trying to understand your motivation on why this Wikibook needs to be merged with the bookshelf that it is part of.  You havn't posted a reason on the discussion pages, although I am presuming there is a motivation.  There are distinctly different motivations between the Wikibook and the other proposed (or stub) Wikibook modules on the bookshelf.  One thing I am trying to avoid doing (but seems to be happening with this Wikibook, unfortunately) is to turn this Wikibook into a macropedia, or a smaller encyclopedia about a specific topic.  By eliminating the serial programming bookshelf, this is encouraging even more the effort to turn this Wikibook that I have organized into chronological chapters intended to be read sequential (or at least reference previous chapters heavily).  By dumping the reference material into this Wikibook, it just encourages more of the macropedia philosophy.

I have it listed under computer network topologies due to my desire to eventually turn this book into an introduction to simple computer networks.  I think serial programming techniques are a good laboratory way to introduce the topic that can teach many levels of the OSI network model where a student can experiment and perhaps come up with other networking models, or at least understand why things happen the way that they happen in current networks.

In addition, there was an earlier VfD discussion [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Archive 2#various Serial Programming orphan-stubs|about this topic on the VdD page]].  The discussion was removed on October 8th if you want to go through the VfD history and find it.

I appreciate you efforts to try and clean up Wikibooks, and this is certainly something that needs a little bit of attention.  I just think that merging the contents of this bookshelf into the Wikibook is not the best approach and will do more harm than good.  I do want to raise the standards of not only this Wikibook but also Wikibooks as a whole.  Work with me to get the serial communication bookshelf cleaned up, and I think there is a compromise that can be accomodated. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:36, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:The cause of my (now removed) merge suggestion was a misapplication of [[WB:NC]]/[[WB:NP]] (neither enforced) and the [[Serial Programming]] redirect. See my comment at [[Talk:Serial communications bookshelf]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:34, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

== Mass, gravity, weight, etc, etc in [[Wikijunior Solar System]] ==

Re all the above, I'd appreciate your thoughts on [[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]]'s comments [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity#Well written -- maybe too much for this book|here]] on my talk page, especially his highlighting [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight]]; thanks in advance. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 16:43, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Have just responded to your comments on the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity#Well written -- maybe too much for this book|''About weight and gravity'' talk page]] &amp;ndash; thank you for your thoughts. Meanwhile, I'd appreciate your pointing out what you found to be obtuse language in the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] module itself, so I may try to avoid it in future. Thanks, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 14:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== De-indenting ==

Thanks for your effort to try and keep Wikibooks clean and usable by fixing the indentation on some talk pages. However, you didn't do it correctly everywhere. In many cases, a direct response (one more : than the previous comment) was changed to a brand new comment (no :s at all). That is not what the talk page help page means by cleaning up and refactoring. In the future, please read the discussion and see what the content of the comments are, not just the user who made them. For example, [[Wikibooks talk:Dispute resolution]] was fine the way it is, but now you moved my responses to Whiteknight out to the left and the discussion is now broken up. I would appreciate a little more caution in the future. Thank you, my friend. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:33, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:Sorry. I was not reading the &quot;refactoring&quot; section of [[Wikibooks:Talk page]], I was reading the section that says &quot;use indenting to keep the conversation straight&quot;. I thought that was consensus on this wiki, but apparently [[Wikibooks:Talk page]] is only a proposed policy, and something that was copied from Wikipedia. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:48, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Deleting a Wikipage ==

It has been noted on [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics Engineering Acoustics]] that I need to clean up or remove some pages.  Problem is that I am not able to remove old pages that have been accidently unlinked.  Any idea how to fix this or delete the pages(old pages are not needed)?  Thanks [[User:Mpspence|Mpspence]]

:This is a [[Meatball:FullHistory|FullHistory]] wiki, so we keep a [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page history]] of all previous versions of every page here. If there is an old orphan page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which was replaced with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, you should make a redirect from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - see '''[[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Help:Redirect]]'''. (But first check that there is no new material in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; missing from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.) Then, on talk page for Acoustic:B, add a comment that some old page history is available at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Any wiki user can do this, so I might make the redirects if no one does it before when I would.

:With a redirect, if there is an external link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; from outside Wikibooks (for example, in a search engine), the link works because Wikibooks redirects it to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

:If you actually need to delete page, read [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:54, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== Question from my RfA ==

You had wondered if I had any experience as an Admin on another MediaWiki. The answer is no, but I feel I should qualify that. I am a very active participant at Wikipedia, including working on the AN, the AN/I, and the AN/3RR. I have followed Admins and know what the task requires. Quite a few people at WP already think I'm an Admin there. A couple of people have discussed nominating me over there as well. I know a few of the tasks can be tricky (IP range blocking, etc.), therefore will start off slow and work my way up to doing the more complicated things. I hope this adresses any concerns you may still have. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:07, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

Hi. Thank you for your vote on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards/elections_2006#Traroth meta]. I'm actually the same person as on Wikibooks :-). [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 09:26, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

==Gross-out songs==

Kernigh, the lyrics for these songs went onto paper (or rather cyberspace) from my own head. The songs are written down as I recall them. There may be an error or two in the words. [[User:Hoishand182|Hoishand182]] 04:34, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Prerequisite 1:  Understanding OpenGL''' ==


OpenGL is an interesting topic to cover, since the Anim8or program and many other commercial 3D modelers run on OpenGL.


'''What is OpenGL'''

OpenGL is an API (Application Programming Interface) which interacts directly with the video hardware in your computer to produce different types of graphics very fast.  This approach to graphics is much faster than what’s called software-based graphics.  The main problem with Software-based graphics is that it is not using the full potential of your video card.  Usually, the software-based approach is used to create simple graphics such as the user interface in Microsoft Word.  But for 3D graphics to run at full speed you need direct contact with the video hardware for optimal performance.  That is the purpose of OpenGL.

One more thing to discuss is how OpenGL makes the programmer’s life a little bit easier.  OpenGL takes care of interfacing with the video hardware by itself without the programmer writing any code to do that.  In the early days of graphics programming, programmers would sometimes have to write a lot of code just to interact with the video hardware.  Now they don’t have to worry about that.  They can just concentrate on drawing graphics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Normal_distribution_pdf.png|thumb|right|400px|Normal distributions of varying means and standard deviations. The green line is the standard normal distribution.]]

A collection of data can be modelled with the Normal Distribution if the data produces a fairly bell-shaped curve when put into a histogram and has the same mean, median and mode - that is to say most of the data is in the middle of the diagram, with the bins becoming smaller toward the outside. If a sample of data is truly normally distributed, about 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

The normal distribution's probability density function is:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \, e^{ -\frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''standard normal distribution''' is a special case in which the mean, &amp;mu;, is 0 and the standard deviation, &amp;sigma;, is 1. Its p.d.f is:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \, e^{ -\frac{x^2}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating this function in order to obtain probabilities is a trifle difficult if you're an S2 candidate, so it is usual to use calculator functions or tables of cumulative probabilities (these give probabilities from -&amp;infin; to a particular value).

      <text xml:space="preserve">C programmers will undoubtedly be familiar with the stdlib memory allocation functions, malloc, realloc, calloc, etc. These functions are based off a number of other functions in the Win32 API that deal with memory segments.

== Windows Memory ==

When talking about the memory subsystem, there are 4 distinct types of memory that Windows manages, and each type of memory has a number of different functions to allocate and free that memory. 

;Virtual Memory: The Virtual Memory subsystem allocates and manages memory by pages. This means that memory can only be allocated in blocks of 4 Kbytes (or larger, depending on OS version) at a time. This is a fantastically large amount of memory for most applications, and using the virtual memory functions in most programs is overkill. However, some programs do need use of entire pages for storage, so the Virtual Memory subsystem can be used for that.
;Heap Memory: The heap is an area of memory that usually takes up a whole page, or a fraction of a page. Each process is allocated a heap immediately by windows, called the process heap. The stdlib functions such as malloc will allocate memory from this memory region. The heap can be divided up into small memory segments, for use with variables and dynamic storage.
;Global Memory: Windows maintains at least 1 page of memory for use as general-purpose global memory. This memory can be read or written by any process running on the computer, using the global memory functions. Data in the global memory space can be shared among various programs, and items sent to the windows clipboard are generally stored in global memory (so it can be &quot;pasted&quot; into any program). Global memory is limited, so it should not be used without a specific need.
;LocalMemory: Local memory has similarities to both global memory and heap memory. It is local to the process, but the memory is managed by the Windows memory manager, and not by the program. We will discuss this later.

== Virtual Memory Subsystem ==

The virtual memory functions, as explained above, allocate memory in terms of pages. Pages are generally 4 Kbytes of memory, so most applications won't need to allocate an entire page (much less more then 1 page). The Virtual memory system is essentially the primitive function base that the other memory functions utilize to perform their tasks. For instance, the heap is comprised of 1 or more pages, and the heap functions will allocate pages using the virtual memory system when needed.

When virtual memory blocks are allocated, they are not actually being utilized, they are simply reserved by the system for future use. Other functions need to be used to segment the virtual memory pages into useful segments. Since virtual memory is allocated by pages, a number of special paging features can be used on virtual memory that can not be used on other types of memory. For instance, pages can be locked (to prevent read/write access), or they can be protected from any particular access mode (read, write, execute).

That said, there are a number of functions in the virtual memory subsystem that can be used:

;VirtualAlloc:
;VirtualFree:
; VirtualProtect:
; VirtualLock:
; VirtualQuery:

== Heap Memory ==

Each program is provided with a default process heap, but a process may optionally allocate any number of additional heaps, if more storage is needed. The heap functions will manage their virtual memory usage automatically, and therefore heaps can be set to grow if they are being filled up with data. If a heap is allowed to grow automatically, the heap functions will automatically allocate additional pages as needed. On the x86 architecture the heap grows in size towards higher memory addresses. 

To use heap memory, a heap must first be allocated (or a handle must be obtained to the default heap). Once you have obtained a handle to a heap, you can pass that handle to the memory allocation functions, to allocate memory from that particular heap.

The stdlib memory functions (malloc, realloc, calloc, free) are all used very similarly to the heap functions, so programmers familiar with the stdlib functions may be able to figure out what many of the heap functions are doing, by examining their names:

;HeapCreate:Allocates a heap, and returns a handle to that heap. All the other heap functions will use this handle to uniquely identify the particular heap that you are accessing. By maintaining multiple handles, your program may interface with multiple separate heaps.
;HeapDestroy:This function closes a heap handle, and deallocates the heap memory so that other processes can use it.
;GetProcessHeap: This function returns a handle to the default process heap. Each program gets a default heap when it is loaded, and in most applications this should be enough space to store data items.
;HeapAlloc:Similar to the STDLIB &quot;malloc&quot; function, HeapAlloc allocates storage space on the heap, and returns a pointer to that space. 
;HeapReAlloc:Similar to the STDLIB &quot;realloc&quot; function, HeapReAlloc reallocates the storage space of a variable to be a different size.
;HeapFree:Frees a memory object on the heap. Attempts to use the same pointer to access memory after it has been freed will cause an error.

== Global Memory ==

Windows maintains a certain amount of global heap memory. This memory is limited compared to regular process heaps, and should not be accessed unless global memory is specially required.

When data has been written to the global memory, you don't get a pointer to that data, but instead you get a handle for that data. Once you give your data to the global memory manager, the system is in charge of it. Remember, a handle is not a pointer, and should never be used as one. The system will manage the memory in the global memory section, moving it between pages, and defragmenting it, et cetera.data doesn't reside within a single segment

;GlobalAlloc:
;GlobalFree:
;GlobalDiscard:
;GlobalLock:
;GlobalUnlock:
;GlobalFlags:
;GlobalSize:
;GlobalHandle:

== Local Memory ==

Local memory, in this sense, is not the kind of storage that programs utilize internally, on the stack and otherwise. Instead, Windows manages a special section of memory that it dubs to be &quot;Local Memory&quot;, and it provides a number of functions to allocate and manage this special memory. Local memory is similar to global memory in the sense that data is written to the local location, and the system returns a handle to that data. The system will manage the data, just like in global memory. The local functions are named very similarly to the global memory functions. However, the global memory and local memory functions should never be mixed. For instance, a global memory handle should never be closed with the LocalFree function. 

;LocalAlloc:
;LocalFree:
;LocalDiscard:
;LocalFlags:
;LocalLock: 
;LocalReAlloc: 
;LocalUnlock:
;LocalHandle:

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=Unicode}}
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Random numbers|next=Classes and Objects}}
__NOTOC__{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Most Java program text consists of [[wikipedia:ASCII|ASCII]] characters, but any Unicode character can be used as part of identifier names, in comments, and in character and string literals. For example, π (which is the Greek Lowercase Letter '''pi''') is a valid Java identifier:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-100&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.100: Pi.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double π = Math.PI;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

and in a string literal:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-101&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.101: Pi literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String pi = &quot;π&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Unicode escape sequences ==
Unicode characters can also be expressed through Unicode Escape Sequences. Unicode escape sequence may appear anywhere in a Java source file (including inside identifiers, comments, and [[Java Programming/Literals|string literals]]).

Unicode escape sequences consist of
# a backslash '&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;' (ASCII character 92, hex 0x5c),
# a '&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;' (ASCII 117, hex 0x75)
# optionally one or more additional '&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;' characters, and
# four hexadecimal digits (the characters '&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;' through '&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;' or '&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;' through '&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;' or '&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;' through '&lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;').

Such sequences represent the UTF-16 encoding of a Unicode character. For example, 'a' is equivalent to '\u0061'. This escape method does not support characters beyond U+FFFF or you have to make use of surrogate pairs.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;3.1 Unicode&quot;, The Java™ Language
Specification [http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jls-7-mr3-fullv-oth-JSpec/JLS-JavaSE7-Full.pdf], Java SE 7 Edition, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any and all characters in a program may be expressed in Unicode escape characters, but such programs are not very readable, except by the Java compiler! They are not compact either!

One can find a full list of the characters [[Unicode/Character reference|here]].

π may also be represented in Java as the ''Unicode escape sequence'' &lt;code&gt;\u03C0&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the following is a valid, but not very readable, declaration and assignment:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-102&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.102: Unicode escape sequences for Pi.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double \u03C0 = Math.PI;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The following demonstrates the use of Unicode escape sequences in other Java syntax:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-103&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.103: Unicode escape sequences in a string literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Declare Strings pi and quote which contain \u03C0 and \u0027 respectively:
String pi = &quot;\u03C0&quot;;
String quote = &quot;\u0027&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Note that a Unicode escape sequence functions just like any other character in the source code. E.g., &lt;code&gt;\u0022&lt;/code&gt; (double quote, &quot;) needs to be quoted in a string just like &quot;.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-104&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.104: Double quote.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Declare Strings doubleQuote1 and doubleQuote2 which both contain &quot; (double quote):
String doubleQuote1 = &quot;\&quot;&quot;;
String doubleQuote2 = &quot;\\u0022&quot;; // &quot;\u0022&quot; doesn't work since &quot;&quot;&quot; doesn't work.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== International language support ==
The language distinguishes between bytes and characters. Characters are stored internally using UCS-2, although as of J2SE 5.0, the language also supports using UTF-16 and its surrogates. Java program source may therefore contain any Unicode character.

The following is thus perfectly valid Java code; it contains Chinese characters in the class and [[Java Programming/Variables|variable]] names as well as in a string [[Java Programming/Literals|literal]]:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-50&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.50: 哈嘍世界.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class 哈嘍世界 {
    private String 文本 = &quot;哈嘍世界&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

They have been developed by the [http://slainte.org.uk Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)] and are accredited by the  [http://www.sqa.org.uk Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)]. The level of the qualifications is roughly equivalent to a UK Higher National Certificate or Diploma (HNC/HND), a US Associate Degree or years 1 and 2 of a UK or US undergraduate degree. Credit for approximately one year of study may be transferable to other academic programmes.


The '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), SLIC, CyMAL''' (the Welsh body) and '''DCAL''' (the Northern Ireland department) supported the development of the qualifications for use throughout the UK. SQA is currently exploring accreditation with the '''QCA (Qualifications &amp; Curriculum Authority)''' and articulation into higher education. The qualifications have been reviewed by content advisers from across the UK in order to balance any variation in the context of library service delivery and the learning materials contain UK-wide examples of best practice.

=== Who are they for? ===


These qualifications will permit library staff who have already undergone the '''People’s Network''' training to obtain accreditation, but they are also suitable for '''new entrants''' to the profession. The main target group is staff working in the UK public library service, but the qualifications are also likely to be of interest to staff in other library services, particularly '''school libraries'''. They may also be of interest to English-speaking library staff in other countries.


Candidates would normally be expected to have reached a reasonable level of general education, for example A-Level or SCE Higher and possess reasonable ICT skills, such as PC Passport or ECDL. 


=== What is the content? ===


The '''Diploma in Applications of ICT in Libraries''' consists of five single-credit units (each roughly equivalent to 40 hours of study), as follows: 

*Unit 1: Locating information on behalf of clients
*Unit 2: Supporting reader development
*Unit 3: Supporting users to ensure effective learning
*Unit 4: Using ICT in professional practice
*Unit 5: Supporting clients in the safe and legal use of ICT


The '''Advanced Diploma in Applications of ICT''' in Libraries includes all of the above units, plus the following double-credit units, each roughly equivalent to 80 hours of study: 

*Unit 6: Net Navigator	
*Unit 7: Educator 
(candidates must choose one of these)

*Unit 8: Graded Unit – Project


Summaries of the '''unit content''' can be found later in this document.


=== What support material is available? ===

A wide range of support material is available, including top-up learning material, assessment tools and electronic log-books to record assignments for authentication in the workplace. The top-up learning material is available in Wikibook format and also in an interactive web-based format at http://www.ictl.org.uk.

The top-up material includes activities, prompts and refresher learning. More than 600 pages of material have already been written and this is being expanded all the time. The top-up learning can be integrated with People's Network, cascade or new training and work-based practice.


=== How are they assessed? ===


Almost all of the assessment is of a practical nature and involves the completion of logbooks relating to workplace activities, essays and reports. Most assessments can be submitted online.


=== How do they relate to professional qualifications? ===


The qualifications support the '''CILIP Framework of Qualifications''' and can be used as evidence towards Certification, Chartership and Revalidation submissions. The Diplomas are based on reflective practice, and electronic logbooks make it easy to build portfolios. 


=== What are the benefits? ===


There are a number of benefits for individual and employers in supporting this development. Staff will have the chance to have their People’s Network learning accredited, improve their qualifications, gain academic credits for transfer into other courses or improve their promotion prospects. From the employer's perspective, the qualifications will contribute towards workforce development and meeting corporate quality agendas such as Investors in People and Charter Mark.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Implement [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Reference/API5.2.2/com/webobjects/appserver/WOComponent.html#isStateless() isStateless] in your WOComponent and you will be able to manage the state yourself:

  public boolean isStateless() {
    return true;
  } 

==== Chuck Hill ====
There is some fairly OK information on stateless and nonsynchronizing components in Practical WebObjects.  In a nutshell you need to use valueForBinding/setValueForBinding to access bound values and implement a public void reset() method that nulls all instance variables.  This often requires design changes to your component.

==== Jean-François Veillette ====
Sometimes for stateless component, you need to keep variables values between the 3 phases, from takeValueFromRequest all the way to appendToResponse.  Since ivars in a stateless component can't handle this case (reset() will be called after each phase), you have to store the information somewhere.  Just use context.userInfo dictionary, and put whatever value in there.  As the name imply, the value will only be good for this request only.

      <comment>/* Using the Caret */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Keyboard ==

When a key is pressed on the keyboard, the signal travels into the computer, where the kernel gets it. These signals, or &quot;keycodes&quot; as they are called, are raw data that needs to be translated into ASCII characters. The kernel performs this conversion, as well as obtaining other information about the keystroke. The necessary information is encoded into a message, and is sent to the currently active window. Simultaneously, the message is sent to the currently active '''caret'''. 

=== Cursor Vs Caret ===

Inside Windows, there is a large terminology problem. So many different things all need to get their own names, so we can program with them, and keep everything straight. A perfect example of this is the difference between the '''cursor''' and the '''caret'''. The cursor is the graphical image that represents the mouse. It can either be an arrow for pointing, a hand, an hourglass, or an I-shaped text selector. The '''caret''', on the other hand, is the blinking object that is used to enter text. When you type, the letter appears at the caret, and the caret moves forward by 1 space. It is important to keep these terms straight, because if you confuse them inside your program, you could have a lot of debugging to do.

=== Keypress Messages ===

There are a few keypress messages that the program can choose to handle. It is important to note that not all of these messages need to be handled in a program, and in fact it is usually a good idea to not handle many of them.

;WM_KEYDOWN:The WM_KEYDOWN message indicates that a key has been pressed, or that it has been pressed and held down. If the key is held down, the keyboard goes into &quot;Type-Matic&quot; mode and generates keypress events repeatedly at a certain frequency. The kernel will generate a WM_KEYDOWN message for each of these, with the LPARAM message component containing the number of messages sent by the Kernel in succession, so that your program can choose to ignore some of the messages and not miss any of the information. In addition to the Key count, the LPARAM will contain the following information:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
  |-
  ! Bits of LPARAM !! Purpose
  |-
  | 0-15 || Key Count
  |-
  | 16-23 || Scan Code
  |-
  | 29 || Context Code 
  |- 
  | 30 || Previous State 
  |-
  | 31 || Key Transition
  |}
:The scan code is the raw binary signal from the keyboard, which may not correspond to the ASCII value of the character. Notice that all buttons on a keyboard generate a scan code, including action buttons (Shift, ALT, CTRL). Unless you are trying to interact with the keyboard in a special way, you want to ignore the scan code. The Context Code determines if the ALT key is pressed at the same time. If the ALT key is pressed at the same time, the Context code is 1. The Previous State is the state of the button before the message was generated. The Key Transition determines whether the key is being pressed, or if it is being released. Most of the fields in the WM_KEYDOWN message can be safely ignored by most programs, unless you are trying to use Type-Matic functionality, or are trying to interface on a low level with the keyboard.
;WM_KEYUP:This message is sent when a key that was being pressed has been released. Every key press will generate at least two messages: a Key down (when the button is pressed) and a Key Up (when the button is released). In general for most text-processing applications, the Key Up message can be ignored. The WPARAM is the value of the virtual character code, and the LPARAM is the same as for the WM_KEYDOWN message.

=== Accelerators ===

Windows users will no doubt be familiar with some of the common key combinations that are used with large windows programs. CTRL+C copies an object to the clipboard. CTRL+P prints the current document. CTRL+S saves the current document. There are dozens more, and it seems like each program has its own specific key combinations.

These key combinations are known in the Windows world as &quot;Accelerators&quot;. A program that uses accelerators will define an '''accelerator table'''. This table will contain all the different key combinations, and the command identifier that they each map to. When an accelerator is pressed on the keyboard, the program doesn't receive the keypress messages, it instead receives a WM_COMMAND message, with the command identifier in the WPARAM field.

To translate the accelerator keypress combinations into WM_COMMAND messages, the function TranslateAccelerator needs to be used in conjunction with the message loop, as such:

 while(GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0))
 {
    if(!TranslateAccelerator(&amp;msg))
    {
       TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
       DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
    }
 }

The TranslateAccelerator function will automatically dispatch the WM_COMMAND message to the appropriate window.

=== Using the Caret ===

Each program may only have 1 active caret, and worse than that, the entire system may only have 1 active caret on the screen at a time. When using a caret, the programmer needs to take special care to destroy the caret when it is not in use, and to recreate the caret when needed. This can be accomplished relatively easily by creating the caret on the WM_SETFOCUS message (when the window is made active), and by destroying the caret on the WM_KILLFOCUS and WM_DESTROY messages.

== The Mouse ==

The mouse has more messages associated, because the mouse is capable of more unique tasks than the keyboard is. For instance, the mouse has at least 2 buttons (frequently 3 or more), it often has a trackball, and it can be hovered over objects on the screen. Each of these functions of the mouse can be handled via messages, so we are going to need several messages

=== Mouse Messages ===

There are a number of mouse messages that may be handled by the program.

;WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK: The user double-clicked the left mouse button. 
;WM_LBUTTONDOWN: The user pressed the left mouse button. 
;WM_LBUTTONUP: The user released the left mouse button. 
;WM_MBUTTONDOWN: The user pressed the middle mouse button. 
;WM_MBUTTONUP: The user released the middle mouse button. 
;WM_MOUSEMOVE: The user moved the mouse cursor within the client area of the window. 
;WM_MOUSEWHEEL: The user rotated or pressed the mouse wheel. 
;WM_RBUTTONDOWN: The user pressed the right mouse button. 
;WM_RBUTTONUP: The user released the right mouse button. 

In addition, the LPARAM field will contain information about the cursor location, in X-Y coordinates, and the WPARAM field will contain information about the state of the shift and CTRL keys. 

The system will handle the graphical mouse movements, so you don't need to worry that your program is going to lock up the mouse. However, the program is capable of changing the mouse cursor, and sending mouse messages to other windows, if needed.

== The Timer ==

Timers are used to space the flow of a program via pauses, so that a group of actions can be allowed to process before another group interacts with the result. In a strict sense, the Windows Timer is not a user input device, although the timer can send input messages to the window, so it is generally covered in the same manner as the mouse and the keyboard. Specifically, Charles Petzold's famous book, &quot;Programming Windows&quot;, treated the timer as an input device. 

A common use of a timer is to notify the program of the end of a pause so that it can erase an image previously painted on the screen, such as in screensavers that display various images from one folder. The native timer function, however, is not considered accurate for games or time-critical responses. The DirectX API is preferred for games.


Each time the specified time interval assigned to the Timer elapses, the system sends a WM_TIMER message to the window associated to the Timer.

The new Timer starts timing the interval as soon as it is created by the '''SetTimer''' function. When you create a Timer you retrieve a unique identifier that can be used by the '''KillTimer''' function to destroy the Timer. This identifier is also present in the first parameter of WM_TIMER message.

Let's see the functions syntax.

&lt;pre&gt;
UINT_PTR SetTimer(      
    HWND hWnd,              //Handle of the window associated  to the timer 
    UINT nIDEvent,          //an identifier for the timer
    UINT uElapse,           //the time-out value, in ms
    TIMERPROC lpTimerFunc   //the address of the time procedure (see below)
);

BOOL KillTimer(      
    HWND hWnd,              // Handle of the window associated to the timer
    UINT_PTR uIDEvent       // the identifier of the timer to destroy
);
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to reset an existing timer you have to set the first argument to NULL, and the second to an existing timer ID.

You can process WM_TIMER message in two different ways:

'''-''' by processing the WM_TIMER message in the window procedure of the window passed as first argument.

'''-''' by defining a TimerProc callback function (fourth argument) that process the message instead of a window procedure.

Let's see the first one.

&lt;pre&gt;
#define IDT_TIMER1 1001
#define IDT_TIMER2 1002

...

SetTimer(hwnd,                 //handle of the window associated to the timer
         IDT_TIMER1,           //timer identifier
         5000,                 // 5 seconds timeout
         (TIMERPROC)NULL);     //no timer procedure, process WM_TIMER in the window procedure

SetTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER2, 10000, (TIMERPROC)NULL);

...

LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc (HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam){
  
    ...
   case WM_TIMER:
    switch(wParam)
    {
     case IDT_TIMER1:
       //process the 5 seconds timer
     break;

     case IDT_TIMER2:
       //process the 10 seconds timer
     break;
    }
   ...


/* to destroy the timers */
KillTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER1);
KillTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER2);

&lt;/pre&gt;


Now using a '''TimerProc'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
VOID CALLBACK TimerProc(

    HWND hwnd,	// handle of window for timer messages 
    UINT uMsg,	// WM_TIMER message
    UINT idEvent,	// timer identifier
    DWORD dwTime 	// current system time
   );
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is called by the system to process an associated Timer's WM_TIMER message.
Let's see some code.

&lt;pre&gt;
#define IDT_TIMER1 1001
...

/* The Timer Procedure */
VOID CALLBACK TimerProc(HWND hwnd,	 
                    UINT uMsg,	
                    UINT idEvent,	
                    DWORD dwTime)
   {
          MessageBox(NULL, &quot;One second is passed, the timer procedure is called, killing the timer&quot;, &quot;Timer Procedure&quot;, MB_OK);

          KillTimer(hwnd, idEvent);
   }

...

/* Creating the timer */
SetTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER1, 1000, (TIMERPROC)TimerProc);

...

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Timer Messages ===

The timer only comes with a single message, WM_TIMER, and the WPARAM field will contain the timer ID number.

=== Timer Modes ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) ==
In essence, MFC is a [[w:Software development kit|SDK]] interface, a library consisting in a set of classes that act as wrappers around portions of the [[w:Windows API|Windows API]], so that C++ programmers may program Windows using some concepts of the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and the C++ language (the Win32 API is based on C, as seen in [[Windows Programming/C and Win32 API|C and Win32 API Section]] of the book). One should learn the Win32 API or at least have some ideas since some functions are absent from the MFC and would help you to better understand the SDK.

Some tools, such as [[w:Microsoft Visual Studio|Microsoft Visual Studio]], are capable of automatically generating large amounts of MFC skeleton code for use in a project. Because of this, most MFC tutorials or reference materials will teach the subject using the automated Visual Studio tools, and leave out some of the gritty details. In this book where possible we try to be neutral.

MFC was first oriented mostly for enterprise-level programming projects, created in an age most code was done in C and Object Oriented Programming was only in the realm of Smalltalk. 

Since the release of Visual Studio 6.0 and the MFC 6.0 little was known of the future support to the MFC since the company was favoring the .NET Framework. Version 7.0, 7.1 and 8.0 were mostly extensions to support the new OSs and to aid developers in migrating to the new framework. Since then information on the future of the MFC could be only extracted from Steve Teixeira, Microsoft Corporation, June 2005 paper - '''MFC: Visual Studio 2005 and Beyond''', on the release of Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1, Microsoft seems to once again be actively supporting the MFC.

Many users today find it acceptable for a low complexity program to have a memory footprint of 30-80Mb (this is common in Java or .Net applications), low response times or &quot;outside of your control&quot; applications like the internet now provides. It is therefore debatable if the impact of  use of MFC in small applications outweighs the benefits the libraries provides. Most of the software made specifically for Windows today uses MFC.

You should prefer the Win32 API SDK, or an alternative wrapper for it, if you do not intend to:

#'''Make use of a complex GUI, use the document/view architecture or complex controls.'''&lt;br&gt;  This will increase the use of system resources (memory use, exe and install size).
#'''Use other libraries that depend on the MFC.'''
#'''Have a complex install for your application.'''&lt;br&gt;To distribute MFC-Based project you must build it with static MFC libraries or distribute your project with the needed MFC dlls. There is no guarantee that your customer has the required dlls for your program. Old MFC-Based programs must work with new MFC versions. They should but don't do it always. Your customer will not be very happy if after installing your project some of his old software products begin hanging.

=== MFC and C++ ===
The MFC design principle is an attempt for simplification. The wrapper classes were designed so to simplify some tasks and automates others. Because of those facts, however, a certain amount of fine-tunable control was lost from the raw Win32 API or excessive automation was archived. The MFC has been recognized as having serious design flaws and inconsistencies and has not been actively maintained. The C++ language and best practices have evolved and today this constitutes a barrier for the utilization of the framework.

As MFC predates the STL standardization in to the C++ language, it implements its own versions of the STL containers, not as complete and even inconsistent, this simplistic solutions the MFC implementations tend to be faster, however you should prefers to use the STL when ever you can, it will make the code more C++ standard and permit easier portability in converting the code to multi-platform.

;Multiple Inheritance
The MFC class library does not use and Multiple Inheritance and was not designed with full support for Multiple Inheritance.

Since most MFC classes derive from CObject using Multiple Inheritance will be cause problems of ambiguity (any reference to CObject member functions will have to be disambiguated). Static member functions, including &lt;tt&gt;operator new&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;operator delete&lt;/tt&gt; must also be disambiguated.

The best option is to avoid the use of Multiple Inheritance with MFC but take a look at [http://web.archive.org/web/20090911094049/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/62x3wzxy(VS.71).aspx Using C++ Multiple Inheritance with MFC] (msdn.microsoft.com) for the needed information on how to bypass the limitations.

=== MFC Conventions ===
The MFC uses the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions#Hungarian Notation|Hungarian notation]]. It uses prefixes, like &quot;m_&quot; to indicate a member variable or &quot;p&quot; to indicate a pointer, and the rest of the name is normally written out in CamelCase (the first letter of each word is capitalized).

;CObject as the Root for most MFC Classes
All the significant classes in MFC derive from the CObject class. The CObject does not have any member data, but does have some default functionality.

== Using MFC ==

MFC requires header files that are separate from the standard &lt;windows.h&gt; header file. The core of the MFC system requires the inclusion of '''&lt;afxwin.h&gt;'''. Other header files that are of some use are '''&lt;afxext.h&gt;''' (for MFC extensions), and '''&lt;afxcmn.h&gt;''' (for the MFC common dialog boxes).

Simply changing the header files, unfortunately, is still not enough. The MFC DLL libraries must be linked to by the project, because the DLL files contain the class definitions that will be used throughout every program. To use MFC, you must link to the MFC libraries

=== stdafx.h ===
'''stdafx.h''' is the standard include for MFC projects - that is, if you create a new MFC project, a stdafx.h will automatically be created for you. It will include all the rest of the necessary MFC header files.

=== theApp ===

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
extern CYourAppClass theApp;
&lt;/source&gt;

Use in the header file of your application class and then include it wherever you need to use '''theApp'''.

You could try the ''AfxGetApp'' function to get a pointer to '''theApp''', an efficient method of accessing members of your application is to make a pointer to '''theApp''' a member variable of the class which needs it -- for example: 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class CMyDialog : public CDialog 
{ 

  // other class stuff here... 
  
  // Attributes 
  public: 
    CMdiApp* m_pApp; 
}; 
&lt;/source&gt;

and make sure you initialize ''m_pApp'' in the constructor or else will be 
accessing a '''NULL''' pointer. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
CMyDialog::CMyDialog(CWnd* pParent /*=NULL*/): CDialog(CMyDialog::IDD, pParent) 
{ 
           //{{AFX_DATA_INIT(CMyDialog) 
           //}} AFX_DATA_INIT 
           // Outside the special-format comments above... 
           m_pApp = (CMdiApp*)AfxGetApp( ); 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

and voila!  Now any time you need access to your application, you got it!

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
m_pApp-&gt;m_nMemberVar; 
m_pApp-&gt;MemberFunction(nParam1, strParam2);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Getting Started ==

First and foremost, it must be mentioned, that MFC is not the brand of C++ programming that &quot;looks like C&quot;. MFC makes heavy use of the object-oriented features of C++, which can seem &quot;dense&quot; or even unreadable to a new C++ programmer. It is highly recommended that the reader become very familiar with C++ concepts such as classes and hierarchies now, if they are not familiar concepts yet.

The root class for MFC is the '''CObject''' class. CObject itself does not support multiple inheritance, but derivative classes do. Each application begins in a class derived from '''CWinApp'''. Every program must have a CWinApp class, and each application may only have one. CWinApp contains a number of functions for initializing an application, and controlling the instance handle (similar to the HINSTANCE member of the WinMain function). Programs that want to display a window must utilize a derivative of the '''CWnd''' class.

== Basic MFC Program ==
We will outline here a basic MFC program that will create a simple window, but won't handle any user input. From this basic outline, we will be able to tackle more difficult subjects.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;afxwin.h&gt;  //basic MFC include
 
//class derived from CFrameWnd, which is derived from CWnd
class Basic_Window:public CFrameWnd
{
   public:
       Basic_Window()
       {
            Create(NULL, &quot;Basic MFC Window&quot;);
            // In some cases you might want to use
            // Create(NULL, _T(&quot;:Basic MFC Window&quot;));
       }
};
 
//class derived from CWinApp, which is the main instance of our application
class MyProgram:public CWinApp
{
      //a pointer to our window class object
      Basic_Window *bwnd; 
   public:
 
      //this is essentially our &quot;entry point&quot;
      BOOL InitInstance()
      {
           bwnd = new Basic_Window();
           m_pMainWnd = bwnd;
           m_pMainWnd-&gt;ShowWindow(1);
           return 1;
      }
};
  
//the program class instance pointer
MyProgram theApp;
&lt;/source&gt;

As we see here, we are immediately relying on class definitions and inheritance, so it is a good idea for readers who are not completely familiar with these topics to brush up on them before continuing.

== Global Variables ==
MFC provides a number of global variables, that are instantiated and then utilized in the underlying MFC framework to compile your program. We can see this in our basic example code when we use the variable '''m_pMainWnd'''.

== Cleanly closing an MFC application ==
The generic solution is &lt;tt&gt;PostQuitMessage([exit code]);&lt;/tt&gt;, but take care to cleanup any lingering resources (closing documents, deallocating memory and resources, destroying any additional windows created etc), on the other hand using &lt;tt&gt;AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;PostMessage( WM_CLOSE );&lt;/tt&gt; can be a better method in some situations, since it triggers the correct shutdown sequence. This is especially important on MDI/SDI applications because it gives a chance for documents to prompt for save before exit or for the user to cancel the exit.

== Wait mouse cursor ==
To display a busy/wait mouse cursor the MFC as added a simple helper class. Instantiate a CWaitCursor class inside a function and a wait cursor is then displayed for the duration of that function, auto destruction of the class will restore the cursor state.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
CWaitCursor aWaitCursor;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Threads ==
As it should be expected the MFC also wraps the Win32 thread primitives in special classes and functions of its own. For generic information of threads and C++ see the [[C++ Programming/Threading|C++ Programming Wikibook section on Multitasking]]. The MFC devised threads in worker threads and GUI threads.

=== Worker threads ===
Worker threads are especially useful to perform background tasks, or any asynchronous work that doesn't require user intervention, a print job, calculations, waiting for an event, etc. To create a worker thread, the simplest way is to implement a function that will perform the desisted work, and then create the thread with &lt;code&gt;AfxBeginThread()&lt;/code&gt; that will use that specific function.

=== Communication ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Exit strategy ===
Never use &lt;code&gt;TerminateThread()&lt;/code&gt; unless you have no other choice to guarantee a thread termination. It is poor practice and dangerous.

A proper thread exit can be archived by a normal return from the thread (completion) or by signaling it to return prematurely. Since we are working on Windows and on a 32 bit bound CPUs (making 32 bits accesses atomic), it is considered safe (but not portable) to use a shared &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; variable to indicate to a thread to exit, any other synchronization methods can be used if available. 

Since the only issue regarding thread termination is on aborting a job or exiting the program without having threads running, when dealing with worker threads, in the class that created the thread on the destructor you should signal the thread to abort and then use &lt;code&gt;WaitForSingleObject()&lt;/code&gt; to wait for the thread to terminate.

      <comment>/* Introduction to COM */ Remove erroneous descrition of COM  and extraneous treatment of OLE.  Replace by wiki-COM</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">People familiar with Windows have doubtless heard a number of different terms used, such as COM, DCOM, COM+, ActiveX, OLE, etc. What precisely are all these things, and how are they related?

== Introduction to COM ==

Component Object Model (COM) is a binary-interface standard for software componentry introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It is used to enable interprocess communication and dynamic object creation in a large range of programming languages. The term COM is often used in the Microsoft software development industry as an umbrella term that encompasses the OLE, OLE Automation, ActiveX, COM+ and DCOM technologies. COM essentially lays a framework for classes to be created in any language, and to be instantiated into any other languages. A class may be written in C++, and called from VisualBasic, et cetera. Essentially, COM defines an interface that all languages must follow, if they want to participate in COM programs.

== COM Libraries ==

COM classes, written in a compileable language (such as C++ or VisualBasic) may be compiled into DLL libraries. DLL libraries that contain COM classes are not compatible with DLL libraries written in C that contain regular C functions. However, DLL files may be compiled such that they contain both standard C functions, and COM classes.

Files that contain COM classes are refered to as &quot;COM modules&quot;, or &quot;COM Components&quot;. Just like with other dynamic linking applications, Windows will manage the COM interface between components automatically, so long as all the modules properly use the COM specifications.

== UUID ==

The COM system relies on numerical identifiers known as '''Universally Unique Identifiers''' (UUID). A UUID is a 128 bit number that is essentially guaranteed to be unique COM identifier throughout the entire world. The UUID number is a hash value based on the MAC address of your primary network card (if your computer has one) and the real-time clock value of your processor. This means that the only way to generate 2 UUIDs that are identical would be to generate both at exactly the same time on exactly the same computer. Thankfully, this is impossible to do. 

COM components are given a UUID number, so that they can be differentiated from all other COM components, and any given COM module can be identified by a single numeric identifier.

== COM Complaints ==

After the original versions of COM were introduced, there became a clear need to expand the functionality of the COM model, and to make some changes to the general framework. Later versions of COM were given various names, such as DCOM and COM+.

== DCOM ==

DCOM stands for &quot;Distributed COM&quot;, and is a protocol for linking COM components from across a local area network (LAN). DCOM allows COM components to be stored on external &quot;COM servers&quot;, and used from other computers in the network.

== MTS ==

== COM+ ==

COM plus = COM + MTS

== .NET ==

When the COM design team tried to create a framework that was more easy to use then COM, more portable, and more universal, they created the .NET framework. Originally, .NET was supposed to be introduced as the next version of COM, but instead Microsoft made it into its own entity. COM development has essentially stopped, to focus more attention on the .NET platform.

Because .NET has its roots in COM, it shares many of the guiding principals of COM. First, many different OO languages can be compiled into a single intermediate language. This allows software written in C++, C#, VB.NET, and other .NET languages to be easily interfaced together to create mixed-language programs quickly. In addition, .NET has strong support for distributed computing (a la DCOM). The .NET platform is quickly being standardized, and is available on several different platforms. Therefore, .NET is not strictly a Windows-programming topic, and will likely not be covered much throughout the rest of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to HTML Help ==

The HTML Help Workshop is a tool for creating compiled HTML help applets, that are common on many platforms. The compiled Help modules may then be used as stand-alone information sources, or as help-modules from inside a program. HTML help modules are relatively easy to create, and only require a knowledge of basic HTML to get started. 

HTML Help modules can be separated by topic, and the HTML Help Workshop will automatically compile a table of contents, and create an option to search, if specified.

== Obtaining the HTML Help Workshop ==

The HTML Help Workshop can be obtained from Microsoft as a free download. The HTML Help SDK should contain all the header files, library files, and object files that are needed to link help files into existing applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types of Drivers ==

Windows device drivers generally come in 2 flavors: '''Virtual Device Drivers''' (VXD) and '''Windows Driver Model''' (WDM). VXD style drivers are older, and are less compatible, while WDM drivers are supposed to be fully code-compatible all the way back to Windows 95.

== Driver History ==

In the old days of DOS, the computer was free land where anything goes. To that end, developers wrote their own hardware drivers, conforming to no specific specification or interface, using real-mode assembly code. With the advent of Windows 3.0, the operating system began to take a more hands-on approach to application management, by creating and maintaining a variety of virtual machines, to execute different programs in different processor contexts. Drivers could no longer exist as non-conformist real-mode DOS drivers, but instead had to mitigate access between multiple programs, running more or less in parallel with each other. Windows 3.0 changed the &quot;real devices&quot; into managed resources known as &quot;virtual devices&quot;, and replaced the real-mode drivers with new '''virtual device drivers''' (VDD).

The Windows NT product line existed as a separate entity from the &quot;regular&quot; windows brand. These two operating systems were completely different in almost every imaginable way, except perhaps that the shells looked similar. Windows NT was a fully-managed operating system, and unauthorized resource accesses were blocked by the NT kernel. This meant that in Windows NT, device drivers needed to interface with the computer through specific methods, while standard windows drivers (Windows 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, Me) could access hardware directly, without any sort of management. The drivers for both systems at this point, were generally written in assembly language, as well.

Realizing that the market was split between Windows and Windows NT, Microsoft saw a need to introduce a single driver model, so that device drivers could be portable between Windows and Windows NT. In addition, Microsoft knew that drivers had to be writable in a higher-level language, like C, in order to be code-compatible for different hardware systems. To meet these needs, Microsoft created the '''Windows Driver Model''' (WDM). WDM drivers are compiled using the DDK, they are written in C, and they follow exacting specifications that ensure they can be executed on any windows system. This book will attempt to focus on WDM drivers, but will include notes on writing DOS TSR drivers, and VDDs as well.

== Driver Issues ==

Device Drivers operate in kernel mode so writing, testing, and debugging drivers can be a tricky task. Drivers should always be well tested before they are installed.

Since device drivers do not operate in user mode, the user mode libraries (kernel32.dll, user32.dll, wingdi.dll, msvcrt.dll) are not available to a device driver. Instead, a device driver must link directly to ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll which provide Native API and executive services.

== Writing a Driver ==

Device drivers are typically written in C, using the '''Driver Development Kit''' ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Programming/Device_Driver_Introduction#External_Links DDK]). There are functional and object-oriented ways to program drivers, depending on the language chosen to write in. It is generally not possible to program a driver in Visual Basic or other high-level languages.

Because drivers operate in kernel mode, there are no restrictions on the actions that a driver may take. A driver may read and write to protected areas of memory, it may access I/O ports directly, and can generally do all sorts of very powerful things. This power makes drivers exceptionally capable of crashing an otherwise stable system.

The Windows platform DDK comes with header files, library files, and a command-line compiler that can be used to write device drivers in C or C++. There is no graphical interface to the DDK compiler.

== Device Driver Stack ==

Windows implements device drivers in a highly-modular fashion, and it is important that we discuss some vocabulary before we continue the discussion of driver programming any further. The drivers necessary for any particular device are arranged in a driver stack, and are connected together internally by a singly-linked list, that starts at the bottom of the stack (the '''root driver'''), and terminates at the highest level driver. Each driver ''must'' contain at least 2 modules, a root driver, and a '''function driver'''. This combination, with some optional additions, constitute the whole of what people generally call a complete &quot;device driver&quot;. Function Drivers will be the most common type of driver to be written, and will be of a primary focus in this wikibook. 

Microsoft realized that certain classes of devices all behave similarly, and it would be a gigantic waste of time for every hardware manufacturer to have to write the entire driver code from scratch. To this end, Windows allows for a type of driver known as a '''class driver'''. Class drivers are themselves not complete function drivers, but class drivers can be dynamically linked to a regular function driver, and can simplify the development process quite a bit. It is possible to write your own class driver, but 3rd party programmers generally don't worry about it. In general, Microsoft will supply the class drivers, and driver developers will tap into those class drivers. This ensures that class drivers are fully microsoft tested and certified, and that they are very versatile. 

Another classification of driver is the '''filter driver'''. There are two general types of filter driver, an '''upper filter driver''', and a '''lower filter driver'''. Upper filter drivers exist in the stack above the function driver, and--as their name implies--they filter the incoming I/O requests. Lower filter drivers are placed in the stack between the function driver and the root driver. Filter drivers are generally implemented as bug fixes, or as quick hack extensions for preexisting drivers.

Here is a general diagram of a driver stack:

 Upper filter driver
      |
      |
   Function Driver &lt;-------&gt; Class Driver
      |
      |
 Lower Filter Driver
      |
      |
   Root driver
      |
      |
    Hardware

== Buses and Physical Devices ==

For simplification, let us use the term &quot;bus&quot; to refer to any place on your computer where information can travel from one place to another. This is a very broad definition, and rightfully so: the term &quot;bus&quot; needs to account for everything from USB, Serial ports, PCI cards, Video outputs, etc. Each bus is controlled by its own root driver. There is a USB root driver, a PCI root driver, and so on. 

Let's now consider a mythical construct known as the '''root bus''', a structure that all other buses connect into. A root bus object doesn't actually physically exist in your computer, but it is handy to think about it. Plus, the root bus has its own driver. The root bus driver object is responsible for keeping track of the devices connected on any bus in your entire computer, and ensuring that the data gets to where it is all going.

== PnP ==

Plug-n-Play (PnP) is a technology that allows for the hardware on the computer to be changed dynamically, and the PnP software will automatically detect changes, and allocate important system resources. PnP gets its own root driver, that communicates closely with the Root bus driver, to keep track of the devices in your system.

== Device Namespace, and Named Devices ==

== &quot;Arbitrary Context&quot; ==

Drivers execute in the context of whatever thread was running when windows accessed the driver. To this end, we say that drivers execute in an &quot;arbitrary context&quot;. Therefore, it is not good practice for a driver programmer to make any assumptions about the state of the processor at the entry point to a driver. There are a few issues that arise with this, so we will discuss them here.

=== Floating Point Arithmetic ===

Drivers that want to use MMX or floating point arithmetic may find they are in for some undue difficulty. Because a driver may be entered in any context, at any time, the floating point unit may contain partial results and unhandled exceptions from the user mode program that was interrupted to call the driver. It is not enough to simply save the context and then to restore it, because any unhandled exceptions may become &quot;unhandleable&quot;, and raise a system error or a bug check. There are only certain times when microsoft recommends using floating point arithmetic, and we will discuss them later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What it is ==

The Windows DDK comes on CD with a number of different options. Specifically, the DDK is capable of writing device drivers for a number of different platforms (Win9x, WinNT, WinServer), and is capable of targeting several different processors (IA-32, IA-64, and Itanium). Installing the necessary components for every platform on every processor can take up allot of harddisk space. In addition, the DDK comes with many examples of how to write everything from parallel port controllers to file system drivers, display drivers, and ethernet drivers. Installing all the examples can also take up a large amount of disk space.

See also: [[Windows Programming/Obtaining the DDK|Obtaining the DDK]]

== Checked and Free Environments ==

The DDK comes with a number of different batch files, that will create a suitable driver programming environment. The different batch files will create an environment to program for a specific OS/Processor combination. Each different environment will set a number of global variables that the compiler and linker will read to make decisions about the code generation. Compiling a driver using the wrong environment will lead to a driver that may not be compatible with your system (and may destabilize your computer). 

For each target platform, there are two environments available: '''checked''' and '''free'''. The Checked environment is essentially a debug environment, that will add additional debugging bloat to your compiled drivers, and will perform additional error checking and warnings. The Free environment, however, does not contain any debugging information, and should only be used to compile a fully-debugged device driver.

== The Tools ==

The DDK comes with the compiler: '''cl.exe''', the linker: '''link.exe''', and an assembler: '''ml.exe'''. When writing device drivers, it is recommended that you only use these particular files, and that you do not use any other versions of these programs that you may have on your computer (either from the SDK or Visual Studio). The DDK will also come with a number of header files. Some of the header files you may be familiar with, but some of them will contain function prototypes for kernel-mode libraries, that most programmers are unfamiliar with.

== Opaque Members ==

The DDK defines a number of different data structures for use in device drivers. However, because drivers operate at kernel mode, it is important to realize that many of the fields of these structures are for use only internally to the kernel, and your driver should not alter them. These data fields are known as &quot;Opaque&quot; members of the structure, and should be treated as if they were a &quot;protected&quot; or &quot;private&quot; member of a C++ class. Data fields that are not explicitly mentioned in this Wikibook should be considered suspect, and if there are any outstanding questions about the availability and use of a particular data field, consult MSDN or the DDK documentation.

== Warning ==

Device drivers should always be thoroughly debugged before installing on a system. If a faulty device driver is installed in the system, it could compromise the kernel at boot, making the entire system unstable, if not completely unusable. Uninstalling a faulty driver can be difficult, especially if you need to perform a rescue boot operation on your computer. Device drivers should be written with care, and fully debugged before installing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Windows Shell consists primarily of explorer.exe, the graphical user interface that displays folders, icons, and the desktop. Explorer.exe is written primarily in C++, so to write extension modules is going to require OO programming. However, there are several functions, in &lt;windows.h&gt; that a C program can use to interact with the shell to perform some basic tasks. First, we will describe some of the basic areas of your shell.

== The Shell ==

'''explorer.exe''', the Windows shell program, has a number of different functions that can be used to cause your program to perform tasks like the shell would. We will run over a few of them here:

=== ShellExecute ===

The ShellExecute function takes a file and a pathname as arguments, and essentially performs whatever task the shell would perform if the file in question was double-clicked. For instance, calling a ShellExecute on &quot;MyFile.txt&quot; would open notepad, and would display MyFile.txt. Similarly, calling ShellExecute on a hyperlink will automatically open Internet Explorer (or your default browser) and will open the specified URL.

 HINSTANCE ShellExecute(HWND hwnd,
                        LPCTSTR lpOperation,
                        LPCTSTR lpFile,
                        LPCTSTR lpParameters,
                        LPCTSTR lpDirectory,
                        INT nShowCmd);

;hwnd: The handle to the parent window of the operation
;lpOperation: The text name of the operation. These are the strings that appear in the menu when you right-click an icon. Some common values are &quot;edit&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, or &quot;execute&quot;. 
;lpFile: the name of the target file
;lpParameters: If lpFile specifies an executable file, the lpParameters field contains the commandline arguments to the executable, if any
;lpDirectory: specifies what directory to perform the operation in
;nShowCmd

== The Desktop ==

== The Taskbar ==

== The System Tray ==

The system tray is the area in the lower-right hand side of the screen that contains the clock and a number of different icons. Icons can be added to the system tray by using a simple API call. The function call to be used is the '''Shell_NotifyIcon''' function, and we will explain it here.

 WINSHELLAPI BOOL WINAPI Shell_NotifyIcon(DWORD dwMessage, PNOTIFYICONDATA pnid);

This function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is a message, and the second argument contains more information on the message. There are 3 messages possible:

 NIM_ADD    Add a new icon to the system tray
 NIM_DELETE Delete an icon from the system tray
 NIM_MODIFY Modify an existing icon in the system tray

We can see that the second argument is a pointer to the NOTIFYICONDATA structure. This structure contains fields as such:

 typedef struct _NOTIFYICONDATA { 
  DWORD cbSize;
  HWND hWnd; 
  UINT uID; 
  UINT uFlags; 
  UINT uCallbackMessage; 
  HICON hIcon; 
  WCHAR szTip[64]; 
 } NOTIFYICONDATA, *PNOTIFYICONDATA;

;cbSize: This should reflect the size of the NOTIFYICON structure. If we have a structure called &quot;nid&quot;, we usually assign this member as follows:

 nid.cbSize = sizeof(NOTIFYICONDATA);

;hWnd: This field contains the handle of the parent window. When the notify icon is clicked, a corresponding message will be sent to this window.
;uID: This is a numerical identifier for the icon in question. A program can have up to 12 different icons at once.
;uCallbackMessage: This is the message that will be sent to your window. This message should be WM_USER or greater. The WPARAM field of the message will contain the uID of the icon in question.
;uFlags: This member tells the shell which fields are valid fields. If a field does not contain any information, or if you don't want to use a particular field to set or modify a value, do not list them in the uFlags member. The possible values are NIF_ICON, NIF_MESSAGE, and NIF_TIP.
;hIcon: a handle to the icon to be displayed in the system tray. must be a 16x16 icon.
;szTip: A short string that contains a &quot;tooltip&quot; for the icon. When the mouse is hovered over the icon, the tooltip will be displayed. leave this blank, if you do not want to have a tool tip displayed.

== The Recycle Bin ==

Similarly to explorer.exe, the Microsoft Internet Explorer, iexplore.exe, can also be extended by creating a '''Browser Helper Object''' (BHO). A BHO may be a single toolbar button, an entire toolbar, or even any number of other objects in the browser. BHOs are generally programmed using C++.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comparison of the two religions==
===Hinduism===
*Hinduism is one of the oldest religions of the world, renowned for its outlook of the philosophy and higher thinking. While the origins of Hinduism, normally called as Sanatana Dharma or Vedic dharma, are unknown ,it is more clearly marked for its inclusiveness- it appropriates all streams of deities and thoughts including those of atheism and Tantric nature. But it has been largely accepted that Hinduism thrives on monotheism.The  distinguishing features of Hinduism from other religions of the world are its deep philosophical thought(it has as many as six main divisions of philosophy grown over the last several thousands of years), a well developed ritualistic tradition along with huge families of hymns, specific social order,  beliefs in Karma theory and rebirth and finally, the belief that the ultimate purpose of man being here is to realize the Self .  The God pictured by Hinduism is a Parabrahman on one hand who is  highly apersonal and merely abides by the cosmological laws and order he himself had ordained and a personal God, sweet, compassionate and nursing and caring on the other hand. Worshiping the Parabrahman in the form of your personal God  can not only secure you good life in this world but also, can take you forward in your spiritual sojourn towards your ultimate goal of realizing the Self. Practiced by almost a billion people worldwide, it has been often a target of invaders, who kept up their attacks in the name of religion. The evolution of Hinduism can be traced from Ritualistic Vedism to philosophy to  much more later date's Bhakti Movement (the movement of Devotion to your personal God.    

===Christianity===
* Christianity is belief in the Creator God corroborated by testimony, plus signs and marvels and various mighty works by his self-proclaimed Son, confirming this declaration with his resurrection from the dead, Jesus of Nazareth, over 2000 years ago with the resultant world wide church guided by gifts (Hebrews 2: 4) of the Holy Spirit distributed in accordance with the will of God.
*Love in Christianity is the first fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5: 22) to include joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness and faith, all to inherit the kingdom of God and by love especially to serve one another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Screensavers are graphical programs that will exercise the computer's screen while the computer is not in use, to prevent damage to the screen. Screensavers can also be very aesthetic, interesting, and entertaining however.

== Requirements ==

Screensaver programs are essentially normal executable programs, with a few small differences:

#They have a .scr extension, instead of a .exe
#They have a ScreenSaverProc, instead of a WindowProc.
#They call DefScreenSaverProc, instead of DefWindowProc.

Also, screensavers must contain a configuration dialog box, that the shell can call when you click on the screensaver and select &quot;properties&quot;. The last requirement is that a screensaver must have a string resource, at resource 1, with a description of the screensaver. 

== How they Work ==

Windows will send a number of different arguments to a screensaver, on the commandline, depending on what mode of operation the screensaver must take. Here are some of them:

*/a &lt;hwnd&gt;
*/s
*/c &lt;hwnd&gt;
*/p &lt;hwnd&gt;

The -a option tells the screensaver program to set the associated password, if the screensaver is selected to be password protected. The -s option tells the screensaver to run the graphics, and start saving the screen. The -c option tells the screensaver to display the configuration dialog, and the -p option tells the screensaver to run in preview mode. 

The WinMain function should decode the command line, and obtain both the switch (a, s, p, c) and the handle, if specified. The Handle value will be in an ascii string, so that will need to be converted to an integer, and stored into an appropriate HWND variable. The handle provided is the handle to the parent window of the screensaver, which is usually the screensaver tab in the Windows Display dialog box. The screensaver doesn't have a parent window if it is in screensaving mode. 

If WinMain has received a -s or a -p, the WinMain should call the ScreenSaverProc. If it has received the -c option, WinMain should call the Dialog box procedure function. If the screensaver receives the -a option, it should bring up a dialog to change the password.

== Starting a Screensaver ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">More step by step instructions?  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

== No Cream ==

I very strongly disaggree that cream should be added to tea. Adding cream gives it a strange taste somewhat similar to the taste of canned condensed milk. When I was young in England the milk sold then was not homogenised. The cream used to float to the top. Most people would pour  off the cream and use the underlying milk to add to the tea. In my opinion Cream should NEVER be added to  the tea. It spoils the taste. Even  regular homogenised milk is a bit too creamy. Tea is NOT like coffee where of course cream is prefered.
I do aggree with most of the rest of your description including the preference for loose tea over tea bags. It  is not only the flow of the water over the tea that is significant but also that in the course of manufacture of the tea bag product the tea leaves  are more finely chopped up, often almost into a powder. 

My  mother  would not have Lipton tea in the house and I am often puzzled to  to understand why so many people in the U.S. seem to  think that Earl Grey is the quintesential English Tea. Earl Grey is a tea the flavour of which has been modified by the addition of a strong spice. I personally drink tea regularly and almost never drink coffee. I find the spice in Earl Grey  over powers the tea and I do not like it.     Frank C. Jones

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Supporting Client Learning''' is a core unit in both the Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.

Further information can be obtained from '''angela.lees@sqa.org.uk'''


== ICT competence and learning goals ==


=== Establishing client competence in use of hardware and software ===


The client’s '''ICT competence''' clearly affects their ability to use any learning packages available.  If ICT skills are lacking, the client may have to undertake some '''ICT skills development''' before moving onto their selected learning package.  You should determine the client’s ICT competence in relation to both '''hardware''' and '''software'''. 


Your initial task is to find out what sorts of '''previous experience''' and '''competence''' the client has had with ICT.  Typically you might want to explore four areas:


*	'''hardware''' 

*	'''operating system environment (normally Windows)'''

*	'''using the Internet'''

*	'''using applications packages''' 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1'''

Before proceeding:	


*  List the hardware items you would enquire about.
*  Note down what you would want to know about each of these items.

----

 

==== Client competence in using hardware ====


The main items of hardware which the client is likely to have to use are the:


*	'''mouse'''
*	'''keyboard''' 
*	'''printer'''
*	'''scanner'''
*	'''removable media'''


We look at each of these in turn, giving some specific pointers about what you should ask the client.

 

==== The mouse ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Has the client used a mouse?

*	Is the client aware of the use of the '''left and right buttons'''?

*	Is the client aware of '''hovering''' over items?

*	(For left handed clients) is the client aware of how to change a mouse from right- to '''left-handed''' operation?

*	If the computers in your library use '''another type of pointing device''', such as a tracker ball or touch pad, can the client use this proficiently?


 
==== Keyboard ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*  Has the client used a keyboard?  

*  Does the client know how to use:
**	'''space and return keys'''
**	'''shift and caps lock keys'''
**	'''delete and backspace keys'''
**	'''cursor (arrow) keys '''
**	'''ctrl, tab, esc and insert keys'''
**	'''function keys'''

 

==== Printer ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Has the client used a printer?

*	Is the client aware of any printer processes which are '''specific to your library''?

*	Can the client '''load the printer with paper'''?

*	Is the client aware of the '''cost per page''' of printing (monochrome and colour)?

 

==== Scanner ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Has the client used a scanner?

*	Is the client aware of the routine of pre-scan, select area and scan?

*	Is the client aware of the importance of selecting an appropriate scanning resolution?

 

==== Removable media ====


Use of removable media, such as floppy disks, CD-ROMs and USB storage (also known as Flash Drives or Pen Drives) will be governed by library rules.  If these are allowed you might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Can the client '''insert a disk''' (or other media) properly?

*	Is the client aware of when it is appropriate to '''remove''' it?

*	Can the client access media in '''different drives'''?

*	Can the client save to '''writable media'''?


 

==== Operating systems ====

We use the term '''operating system''' to describe the basic software, such as '''Microsoft Windows''', which makes the computer work.  When a computer is switched on, the operating system starts running before any application package such as Word will run.  The operating system involves '''managing applications and data'''. 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2'''

Before proceeding:

*	List the aspects of the operating system you would enquire about.
*	Note down what would you want to know about each aspect.

----

 

==== Previous experience ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Is the client '''familiar with the operating system''' on the computers in your library? 


Note that, even within the same library, different computers may have different operating systems. Most of the common operating systems are supplied by Microsoft:


*	Windows 98
*	Windows NT
*	Windows 2000
*	Windows Millennium
*	Windows XP


There are some significant differences in the practical operation of these, so you should determine whether the client can carry out the tasks we outline below for the operating system on the computer which will be used to work through the chosen learning packages.


 
==== Operating system tasks ====

You might want to start by finding out the following information:

'''Finding applications:'''

*	Does the client know '''where to look''' for the applications or packages?

*	Does the client know the '''names and icons''' for the applications required?


'''Opening and closing applications:'''


*	Can the client '''open''' an application?

*	Can the client '''close''' an application correctly? (This often involves saving information.)


'''Using a file manager to locate files and data: '''


*	Can the client use '''My Documents/Windows Explorer''' to navigate around the file system?

*	Is the client aware of the concept of a '''hierarchy''' or tree structure of folders (directories)?


'''Creating folders and saving data in specific folders:'''


*	Can the client '''create a new folder''' to save application data?


 

==== Using the Internet ====


A great deal of information to support learning as well as complete learning packages can be accessed via the Internet. It is therefore important to gauge the client’s competence in Internet use.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVTY 1.3'''

Before proceeding:

*	List the aspects of Internet use you would enquire about.
*	Note down what would you want to know about each aspect.

----


 

==== Common Internet tasks ====


Here are the main aspects of '''basic Internet use''' which you should ask about:


'''Browsing the Internet:'''


*	Has the client experience of '''using a browser'''? (e.g.: Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox)

*	Has the client experience of '''using a search engine'''? (e.g.: Google, Ask Jeeves)

*	Is the client aware of the variable quality of websites found on the Internet?


'''E-mail:'''


*	Has the client used '''e-mail'''?

*	Does the client have an '''e-mail address'''?


'''Chat:'''


*	Has the client used '''chat'''?

*	Is the client aware of '''possible dangers''' in its use?


'''Groups:'''


*	Has the client used any '''(news)groups'''?


 

==== Using applications packages ====


You need to know about the client’s existing experience with common applications packages.  This will help to confirm the information gleaned so far.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.4'''

Before proceeding, list some applications packages you might want to ask about.

----


 
==== Applications packages ====


Word processing is the most likely example of an applications package.  Almost all computer users will have done some word processing.  But many will have used other packages as well.


'''Word processing packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''word processor'''? (e.g.: Word, Write)


'''Spreadsheet packages'''


* Has the client used a '''spreadsheet application'''? (e.g.: Excel) 


'''Photo/Graphics packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''photo/graphics package'''? (e.g.: Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop)


'''Database packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''database application'''? (e.g.: Access, dBASE)


'''Financial packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''financial package'''? (e.g.: Quicken, Quick Books)


'''Other'''


*	Has the client used any other, '''more specialised packages''' which do not fit into the above categories? If so, what are these packages and what do they do?


In each case you should try to get an idea of the '''level''' at which the packages have been used.  The best way of finding this out is to ask the client to give some '''examples''' of how they used the package.

==== Using learning packages ====


One important question to ask is whether the client wishes to use the chosen learning package '''in the library''', using the library’s equipment, or whether they would prefer to take the package away for '''home''' use. 

If the latter, it is vital that you establish the '''specification''' of their home computer.  While many home users possess high specification equipment, others may have older, slower models which will not support the latest packages.  This can be a particular problem where '''graphics or audio''' is involved.  

All learning packages will state clearly the '''minimum specification''' on which the application will run and you should ask the client to confirm that their home equipment meets or exceeds this.

It is good practice to make a '''written record''' of what you have established about the client’s ICT competence.  Some libraries have checklists for this purpose. 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.5'''

Find out if your library service has checklists of this nature.  If not, why not create one for yourself and your colleagues to use?

----

 

==== Establishing learning goals ====


You need to '''establish the learning goals''' for the client before you can think about possible learning approaches.  The client may have learning goals related to their '''work''' or to their '''personal life'''.  You should attempt to establish exactly what the client wishes to learn and if possible get an idea of the reasons why the client is undertaking the learning. 

Some clients may come to the public library seeking learning packages which are '''complete in themselves'''.  You may be able to provide such packages “off the shelf” in your library or you may have to source them from elsewhere.

Other clients may be seeking additional learning to support training or education being '''undertaken elsewhere'''.  The most obvious example of the latter is school pupils or college/university students wishing assistance with assignments or desiring materials which will help them revise for examinations.  

Clients engaged in more '''informal learning''' may also require top-up materials.  For example, an adult working through a self-help book on word processing might ask for additional exercises in keyboarding.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.6'''

Before proceeding outline the different areas you would need to ask about to find out the client’s learning goals.  There are quite a few of them!

----

==== Determining learning goals ====


Here are some possible areas to look at with the client to determine the learning goals:


'''General subject area:'''

What is the '''general subject area''' in which the client wishes to undertake the learning? 
E.g.: the Spanish language.


'''Slant or specialism:'''

Is there a '''particular specialism''' to this learning? E.g.: Spanish for business.


'''Existing competence of client:'''

Does the client possess any existing relevant competence in the subject? E.g.: the client has picked up a basic knowledge while living in Spain for six months last year.


'''Future competence as a result of the learning undertaken:'''

What '''level''' does the client wish to be able to reach as a result of the learning? E.g.: the client wishes to write business letters to Spanish clients of their company.


'''Reasons for learning:'''

Is there a particular work or social '''reason''' the client has for wishing to undertake the learning? E.g.: the client is soon to take responsibility for their company’s Spanish clients


==== Additional factors ====


You may need to consider the following additional factors:


'''Timeframe: '''

Over what '''time period''' does the client wish the learning to take place?  E.g.: the next six months. 


'''Time available:'''

'''How much time''' in the week does the client have for learning? E.g.: up to four hours per week.


'''Importance of certification:'''

Does the client particularly want to undertake learning which will result in a '''qualification?'''  E.g.: the client is interested in gaining a City &amp; Guilds qualification in Business Spanish on completion of the learning.


'''Finance:'''

Many of the learning materials available through public libraries will have no costs attached. However some may involve '''enrollment or certification fees'''. In these cases, you must tactfully investigate if the client would have the financial resources for a course of study with a fee associated? E.g.: is the client able and/or willing to pay for an end of course examination fee?


It is good practice to make a '''written record''' of what you have established about the client’s learning goals. Some libraries have checklists for this purpose. 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.7'''

Find out if your library service has checklists of this nature.  If not, why not create some for yourself and your colleagues to use?

----

=== The UK education and training system ===


In order to help your clients, you need to have a broad-based understanding of the '''UK education and training system '''as a whole - '''pre-school, primary, secondary, tertiary, workplace''' and '''informal'''. Naturally you are not expected to be an expert on education and training (although in some instances you may need to consult such experts).  However you should be familiar with the basics of the system and know how to find out more detail on any aspect, if this is required. 

Remember that we live in an age of '''lifelong learning''' and that much learning takes place outside the traditional academic system.  So you should make sure that you know not just the local schools, colleges and universities, but also private training providers, adult learning agencies, voluntary groups etc.

In particular, it is essential that you appreciate the ways in which the education and training systems of the four UK nations differ from one another (the Scottish system displays the largest divergences from the others) and the implications of this for the client. 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.8 '''

Here are the official government websites for the education departments in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales:


*England:		http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/
*Northern Ireland:	http://www.deni.gov.uk/  and http://www.delni.gov.uk/
*Scotland:		http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/
*Wales:			http://www.learning.wales.gov.uk/


Familiarize yourself with the information provided on these sites, especially that related to the country in which you are resident. Note that much of the information on the English site applies also to Wales and some is also applicable to Northern Ireland.Each of these sites provides links to sites giving information on more specialised aspects of education.  Note the addresses of such sites which are particularly relevant to yourself and summarise the sort of information which you can gain from them.

=== Ascertaining special needs ===


You should establish any special needs (in the widest sense) of the client which will have a bearing on the learning they are proposing to undertake. 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.9'''

Before proceeding:

*	Make a list of the different types of special needs which could have a bearing on the learning.
*	For each case note the steps you can take to enable the learning.

----

 

==== Types of special needs ====


It is difficult to compile a comprehensive list of special needs.  Here are some of the most common with some suggestions as to how the library can facilitate learning for such clients.


*	'''Motor disabilities'''

*	'''Visual impairment'''

*	'''Hearing impairment'''

*	'''Special learning needs''' (including literacy, numeracy and English as a second language)

 

==== Motor disabilities ====


This can cover a wide range of disabilities, ranging from a paraplegic learner in a wheelchair to someone with mild Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).  Some common examples of library facilities for this group are:


*	a '''flexible computer desk''' at a height which can be adjusted to suit varying dimensions of wheelchairs

*	a '''joystick or specially adapted mouse''' for clients who cannot operate a standard mouse

*	a '''specialised “big keys” keyboard''' etc. for clients who cannot operate a standard keyboard

*	a '''mouse tray''' so that clients can use the mouse on their lap

*	'''touch screens'''

*	'''programmable keypads''' to reduce the number of keystrokes required for common inputs

 

==== Visual impairment ====


Many manufacturers produce software specifically to enable use by '''visually impaired users'''.  It is possible for the '''users''' to hear what appears on the screen.  Some software produces output in '''Braille'''.

Sometimes '''simple measures''' can be effective in facilitating use by visually impaired clients, such as:


*	changing the '''text size''' on the screen

*	altering the '''colour settings''' (It is usually easiest for clients with visual impairments to read black text on a white background)

*	using '''“text only”''' versions where graphics are removed.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.10'''

Make sure that you can carry out the three “simple measures” listed above.

Useful information can be found on the website of the '''Royal National Institution for the Blind'''. Go to http://www.rnib.org.uk/ and search for “internet”.

----

 

==== Hearing impairment ====


Again much '''specialist software''' is available.  Libraries can install systems which pick up sound from the computer through an amplifier and radio microphone which is then transmitted by infrared around the room.  The hearing impaired person hears this amplified sound through a lightweight headset. There is no need for users to wear their hearing aids. 


http://www.deafclub.co.uk is a useful site with a search engine, which is specifically designed to help deaf people find information.  It can also lists sites giving advice on ICT adaptations for clients with hearing impairment.  


http://www.rnid.org.uk/  is the site of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People.


 
==== Special learning needs ====


Public libraries have always played an important role in assisting clients in these groups and recent '''disability and discrimination legislation''' has laid even more emphasis on this role.  

Research has shown that libraries are often viewed by such clients as '''friendly, non-judgmental environment'''s.  In consequence they may be more likely to undertake learning in the library than in the more formal setting of a school or college.

Your library service will have staff who specialise in assisting these user groups.  These colleagues can advise you of how best to provide for individual clients. 

You should be aware that nowadays, there are many '''holistic learning packages''' which provide upskilling for young people or adults in literacy, numeracy and ICT. 

Remember that, although the word processor’s '''spell checking facility''' is designed primarily to check for typing errors, it is an invaluable aid to anyone with problems in coping with the English language’s idiosyncratic spelling.



=== Sources of careers information ===


In order to match the client’s learning desires with work goals, it may be necessary to have information about which '''workplace qualifications and competences''' are useful in a particular job role or career.  You are not expected to know this information but you should to be able to access it efficiently, most probably by use of the Internet.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.11'''

Before proceeding, find websites which will give you information on the following careers:

*	nursing
*	clockmaking
*	actuarial work
*	farriery

----
 

==== Careers information sites ====


There are several different sites which will produce the required information. There is usually a dedicated site for each '''sector of employment'''.

Here are some examples for the jobs we asked about:


'''Nursing'''

An NHS site  http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/careers/nursing/ 


'''Clockmaking'''

The British Horological Institute   http://www.bhi.co.uk/ 


'''Actuarial work'''

=== Selection criteria ===


You must take all the information obtained from the client into account so that you can '''identify learning packages''' which will meet the criteria.  You will match learning packages against such criteria as:


*	Does the '''subject matter''' match the client’s desired study topic?

*	Is '''certification''' available if the client desires this?

*	Does the '''length''' of the learning package fit with the time available for the client to learn?

*	Can the client afford any '''costs''' associated with the learning?

*	Does the learning package address any '''special needs''' of the client?

*	Is the level of the learning suitable in terms of both '''starting competence''' (i.e.: neither too easy nor too difficult) and '''final competence''' achieved at the end of learning?

*	Can the client undertake this learning without enhancement of their existing ICT skills? If not, can the library supply additional support for '''ICT skills development''' in order to enable the client to undertake the chosen learning package?


 
=== Learning packages available within own organisation ===


You need to be aware of the range of learning packages which are available within your own library service.  Some of these will be at your own service point.  Others will be held elsewhere within the service.

The library catalogue will give information about the learning packages, both in your own library and elsewhere.  Some libraries produce '''specific catalogues''' or lists of ICT learning packages, giving more details than might be found in the general catalogue.  For packages at your own service point, it is also useful to examine the packages themselves and, if time permits, you can actually test them out.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1'''

Familiarise yourself with all the catalogues and lists of ICT learning packages in your library service.  Note what sort of information they provide for each item.

----
 


==== Restrictions on the use of learning packages ====


You must be able to determine any restrictions on the use of ICT learning packages, e.g.:


*	Must the package be used on '''library premises''' or is it available for '''home use'''?

*	Is there a limit to the '''number of hours''' a client may book to use the package in the library or on the length of time a package can be borrowed? 

*	If the packages are to be used in the client’s home it is vital for you to establish the details of the '''client’s own computer''' in order to be sure that the specification is high enough to support the chosen learning package.


When working in this area you will pick up useful information through the experience and comments of clients.  If several clients recommend a particular package on keyboarding techniques, for instance, you can feel confident in recommending it to other clients with similar learning goals.  Additionally you can gain information and advice through discussions with experienced colleagues.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2'''

Here is an exercise to familiarise yourself with some learning packages available within your own library service.For each subject area given below, find two packages and note the differences between them:


*	Business studies
*	French language
*	Basic mathematics
*	Word processing

----

 

=== Sourcing learning packages outside own organisation ===


Your library cannot duplicate all the learning packages which will exist locally outside your library service.  You must have an awareness of what is available out there.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3'''

Before proceeding make a list of the types of organisation in your locality which produce and/or deliver learning packages.

----

 

==== Sources of learning packages ====


Here are some examples of where learning might be found in the locality:

*	'''Schools'''

*	'''Further education colleges'''

*	'''Universities'''

*	'''Private trainers'''

*	'''Local learning partnerships'''

*	'''Community learning'''

*	'''Voluntary organisations''', e.g.: Workers’ Educational Association


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''


Here is an exercise to increase your familiarity with local sources of learning material outside the library service.  


Choose four of the types of provider given in the preceding list.  For each type, find the website of a named organisation in this category and choose two different study packages offered. Note the differences between the packages at each organisation and the differences between the organisations.

----


 
==== Differences between sources ====


We expect that you will find the following points of difference:


*	'''Cost of package (if any)'''

*	'''Flexibility of study times'''

*	'''Availability of certification'''

*	'''Level of studies'''

*	'''Range of content'''
 
 
In fact, you should come up with the very points which might be criteria gleaned from a client seeking learning.


With e-learning it is not necessary for the provider to be local.  Much excellent learning content can be sourced free of charge from the Internet e.g.: http://www.studyspanish.com   offers free tuition in basic Spanish.  In other cases e-learning may be delivered via the Internet for a fee.  In these cases a '''log in''' and '''password''' will be required after registration.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.5'''

Before proceeding, find and note down five websites where learning is available on the Internet.

----

=== Learning on the Internet ===


Learning can be found on the Web at many, many sites.  There is no way that you will be able to remember even a fraction of these.  So it is extremely important that you should be familiar with sites which are commonly used to '''find learning resources'''.  Check these sites frequently for news and developments, as their content is regularly updated. 


It is important to be aware of the scope of any such site.  It is often the case that learning sites which appear to be '''UK-wide''' are not in fact applicable to one or more of the four nations.  Frequently, learning sites apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland (e.g.: http://www.learndirect.co.uk) and there is a separate site for Scotland (e.g.: http://www.myworldofwork.co.uk) 
 

The scope is not always obvious from the title of the site. Be especially careful when the word &quot;national&quot; is used. This can mean UK or a single one of the four UK nations. For example, the content of the National Learning Network (http://www.nln.ac.uk) applies only to England.  In contrast, the content of the '''National Learning Network''' (http://www.nln.ac.uk) applies only to England. 


 
==== BBC learning materials ====


The BBC (http://www.bbc.co.uk) offers excellent learning materials most of which are applicable in all four UK nations.  This site also provides links to '''other providers''' of on-line learning.


There are many websites which are specifically designed to provide '''curriculum related resources and revision aids'''.  Once again it is vital to check that these are appropriate for the school or college curriculum of the UK nation where the client is studying.  The BBC’s site (http://www.bbc.co.uk) has educational and revision material for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 


You should be familiar with websites applicable to your own home nation’s educational curriculum, such as Learning and Teaching Scotland (http://www.ltscotland.org.uk).  However, do not consider that support learning should be confined to these educational web sites.  Rather be prepared to assist clients to find appropriate support material for their learning from any suitable Internet source.  This applies especially when the client is seeking information to '''enhance a course''' of study undertaken elsewhere.  They may come to the library looking for company financial performance data to include in a presentation on marketing, literary criticism of T S Eliot for a university essay or information on the breeding habits of dolphins for A level biology.  


This sort of information in support of learning will probably be found on websites which are not specifically educational.  So be prepared to assist your client to find information in support of their learning from '''any appropriate Internet''' source.

=== Devising a learning plan ===


You can give the client additional help in the form of a motivational learning plan to guide the learner through the package(s) you have sourced.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.6'''
 	

Before proceeding, make a list of points which you might include in the plan.

----

 

==== Contents of a learning plan ====


A suitable set of features to be included in the learning plan is:


*	the overall learning goal

*	specific learning objectives which contribute to the learning goal

*	a deadline for completion of the learning

*	a schedule for learning

*	any support which the library staff have agreed to provide for the client

*	a specification of the responsibilities and involvement of any outside provider


The learning plan is best expressed in SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timebound) objectives.  It need not be a complex piece of documentation.  Often it can simply be a checklist.

This plan should be created with and agreed by the client.  Usually it will be signed by both the client and a member of library staff.

The use of such a learning plan avoids confusion and can also be motivating to the learner. Where the client is returning to learning after a gap, or has had prior negative learning experiences, it can be helpful to break the learning into “bite sized chunks” and produce a series of shorter learning plans.  Thus the client has a positive experience of successfully completing a small amount of learning which engenders a sense of achievement and spurs them on to further efforts.


 
==== Example of a learning plan ====

[[Image:2Learning Plan.png|500px]]

=== Progression opportunities ===

An important role of the public library is to be a key player in lifelong learning.  A '''positive learning experience''' provided by the library can lead to further successful progression for the client, in some cases into formal tertiary or workplace vocational education.  The library user who enquires about opportunities to study Spanish language to further her career in retail sales may eventually undertake a university course in business and retail management. 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.7'''


Before proceeding note down how you might explore progression opportunities for a client.

----

 

==== Exploring progression opportunities ====


You could explore the following possibilities:


*	What has been the '''client’s experience''' with the learning undertaken so far?  Have they enjoyed it?  What was particularly enjoyable or useful and what was less so? 

*	Revisit the client’s '''original reasons''' for undertaking the learning.  Are these motivations still the same or has the experience of learning awakened the client’s ambition to broader horizons?  It is not uncommon, for example, for a learner who has embarked on a short language package, with a view to being able to order food and ask directions on holiday, to be seized with enthusiasm and wish to carry on to GCSE or Standard Grade qualifications in the language.  Based on this discussion you can consider any or all or the following:

**	Is there a '''more advanced package''' on this topic available?

**	Are there packages on '''related topics''' to that being undertaken by the client?

**	Has the client come to the end of the possible informal learning on the topic and might now proceed to '''formal education'''?

**	Which further learning will further '''enhance the client’s job prospects''' after the present studies?


Of course, all of the previously mentioned sources of information on learning provision are useful to you not only in '''sourcing learning''' which is appropriate for the client’s immediate learning goals but also to '''suggest further learning options''' to the client, on completion of the initial learning. In other words, at its simplest, when you are sourcing learning material, you should always have your eye on the level above, to see how your client might further progress.



==== Concluding the learning experience ====


Hopefully the learning has been a '''positive experience''' for the client and they are interested in taking things further.  But do not be discouraged if the client does not want to sign up for further learning immediately.  It may be that the learning just completed has achieved all the client’s current goals and they wish to pause at this point meantime.  This is a '''satisfactory outcome''' because you can be sure that a satisfied client who has found the package stimulating and relevant is likely to return to the library in future looking for advice and guidance on other learning.



== Provide appropriate ICT support to the client ==


=== Using in-house learning packs to develop ICT skills ===


Most public library services have a wealth of '''in-house learning packs''' whose aim is to develop ICT skills, ranging from beginner to advanced level.  You should examine the packages in your library so that you are completely familiar with their '''content''' and '''level'''.  This enables you to make the most informed choice when recommending a package to a client and to be absolutely confident that the client will benefit from it.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1''' 	

Select three in-house packages which develop basic ICT skills such as:


*	Using PC hardware
*	Using files and folders (directories)
*	Using the Internet
*	Keyboarding skills


Try out each of the three packages to evaluate:


*	Level (absolute beginner to expert user)
*	Duration (how many hours to work through whole package)
*	Approach (friendly to overly formal)
*	Ease of use
*	Presentation (is it attractive and encouraging for the learner?)

----



=== Front-line client support ===


When a client is using any ICT based learning package in the library, whether to develop ICT skills or for other learning, it is likely that from time to time some '''technical snags''' will arise.


You must be able to assist with straightforward trouble shooting e.g.: printing problems.  We stress the word “straightforward”.  There is no suggestion that you should possess sophisticated trouble shooting skills: this is the responsibility of ICT technical staff.  Rather you should be acquainted with typical, straightforward difficulties which can arise and be able to suggest how these can be overcome. 


Do be clear about the '''boundary''' between your responsibilities regarding trouble-shooting and when to call on the services of a technical professional.


You probably have had experience of this already.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Before proceeding, note down a few possible problems which may be encountered by clients using computers. (If this is outside your own experience ask colleagues to suggest computer problems they have solved for clients.)

----



=== Typical problems ===


Here are some of the problems you are most likely to encounter.  


*	The monitor '''appears blank'''

*	After using the computer for some time, it '''‘hangs’''', neither keyboard nor mouse appear to operate

*	A client has difficulty reading off the monitor because the '''print is too small'''

*	'''Nothing''' comes out of the printer

*	The printer does not seem to use the whole of the sheet of paper and the '''layout''' is not the same as on the monitor

*	When saving data from an Office application like Word, the message comes up that the '''disk is full'''

*	The printer '''jams'''

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3'''

Before proceeding, jot down any ideas you have about the help you would be able to give in each of the above cases. You can compare this with our suggestions on the following screens.

You will find that with experience and in discussion with your colleagues you will build up a fund of solutions for these types of problem.

Once again, as in Outcome 2, you must take full cognisance of any special needs of the client and offer appropriate technical support to address these.

----

  

==== Resolving problems ====


Some of our solutions are based on your ability to '''change computer settings'''.  It may be that you do not have access rights to these and would need to contact an ICT professional.

Note that with the first two faults (monitor blank, computer hanging), if they require forcing an application to end or indeed resetting or restarting the computer, it will always mean '''any data not saved will probably be lost'''.  It is important to explain this to the client. 

It is even more important to explain before any incident occurs that '''data should be saved at regular and frequent intervals''' just in case something goes wrong!

 

==== The monitor appears blank ====


*	Check to see if the computer has '''gone to sleep''' by pressing the space bar on the keyboard.
*	Check that the monitor is '''switched on and connected''' to the mains, i.e.: is the power light illuminated?
*	Check that the monitor is correctly '''connected to the computer'''.
*	Check to see if the system works after the computer is '''reset''' or switched off at the mains and on again.


==== The computer hangs ====


Sometimes, after using the computer for some time, it '''hangs''', and neither keyboard nor mouse appears to operate. If this happens you can try the following


*	Wait a while to see if the computer is performing some '''intensive task''' and recovers.
*	Try ''Ctrl-Alt-Del''.  If you are lucky it will bring up a '''Task Manager''' window which will show you which application is not responding and allow you to close down only that application.
*	Use the '''reset button''' to restart the computer.
*	'''Switch the computer off''' at the mains and then on again.

 

==== A client has difficulty reading off the monitor because the print is too small ====


*	If this is confined to a '''particular application''', it is usually possible to adjust the '''zoom setting'''.  If this does not appear in a box near the top of the window, it will be found in the menu system under View: ''Zoom'' or ''View: Text size''.

*	If this applies to '''everything on the monitor''', then, if you have access rights, you can change the '''monitor settings'''.  Right click with the mouse on the desktop, choose ''Properties'' from the resulting menu, choose the ''Settings'' tab from the dialogue box, reduce the ''Screen resolution'' setting and ''OK''.  Unfortunately, the lower the screen resolution, the less can be displayed on the monitor.  This often results in an uneasy compromise for people with problems with their sight.



==== Nothing comes out of the printer ====


*	Check that the printer is '''switched on and connected to the mains''', i.e.: is the power light illuminated?
*	Check that the printer is correctly '''connected to the computer'''.
*	Check that the printer has '''paper''' in it.
*	Check the '''ink supply'''.
*	Try printing a '''test page'''.
*	Check the print settings in both the '''operating system''' and the '''application''' to see that the computer is looking for the correct printer and that the correct size of paper has been selected and that manual/auto (as appropriate) is chosen.


 
==== Print layout is incorrect ====


Sometimes the printer does not seem to use the whole of the sheet of paper or the layout is not the same as on the monitor.

*	When using a word processor like Word, it is possible to set the paper size in the '''application'''.  However there is also a setting for the printer itself.  If these two settings are different, then the output will not appear correctly on the page.  The driver for a newly connected '''printer''' may default to US legal for the paper size.  It is normal to use A4 in this country and applications will use this as default.  Go to the printer properties and check the paper size.  ''Start: Settings: Printers'': right click on the printer concerned, choose ''Properties'' and select the ''Device settings'' tab.



==== The disk appears to be full ====


Sometimes, when saving data from an Office application like Word, a message comes up that the disk is full.

*	It may be that the client’s '''floppy disk or pen drive is full'''.  This is quite likely for any sizable word-processed document especially if it contains graphics or other embedded items.

*	A fault condition can arise concerning interaction between the application and the operating system which results in a '''false reporting''' of the disk full error.  This is irretrievable and requires the computer to be rebooted.  If the client will lose a fair amount of unsaved data, it is worth opening a new document and copy and pasting from the original to the new document and then trying to save that.  You may be lucky!

*	A similar problem can occur regarding the computer '''running out of memory'''.  Again only rebooting the computer will correct the situation.

 

==== The printer jams ====


*	There is no universal solution for this problem as each printer has its own unique mechanism.  The best you can do is to familiarise yourself with the various types of printer in your library and how to un-jam each.


 
=== Referring clients to sources of support external to library ===


Where no suitable in-house packages are available, you will need to refer the client to '''external sources'''.  These are likely to be hands on, practical courses from local providers.  The knowledge of local provision outlined under Outcome 2 will enable you to suggest appropriate referral agencies.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4''' 	


Before proceeding, make a list of the types of packages which are not available from your library service and would need to be sourced from outside.

----

 

==== External sources of support ====


As in Outcome 2 you will find ICT skills packages in the locality from:


*	'''Schools'''

*	'''Colleges'''

*	'''Universities'''

*	'''Private trainers'''

*	'''Local learning partnerships'''

*	'''Community learning'''

*	'''Voluntary organisations, e.g.: Workers’ Educational Association'''

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.5''' 	

Here is an exercise to increase your familiarity with sources of ICT skills materials outside the library service.  

Choose four of the types of provider given in the preceding list.  For each, find the organisation’s website.  Locate at each two different ICT skills packages being offered. Note any differences between the packages at the different organisations.

You should repeat this exercise for ICT learning packages available over the Internet from providers outside your own locality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Level 7 PDA''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Level 8 PDA''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Using ICT in Professional Practice''' is a core unit in both the Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the '''Level 7''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Level 8''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.

You will have received '''on-site training''' allowing you to develop specific operational knowledge of your library management system. This might have been provided by the '''supplier''', the '''systems manager''' or other library staff.

In some cases your job role may not allow you to get practice in all of the operations we describe in this Outcome.  If this is the case, you must at least understand what is going on and see '''demonstrations''' of the operation.  As an example, relatively few staff may actively add new items to the catalogue but it will help your understanding of the operation of the system as a whole if you can observe new items being added. 

You should know where to find information or instructions on '''procedures''' relating to the use of the library management system.  If necessary you can create some “crib guides”.


---- 	

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1''' 

You should have a good knowledge and understanding of the system and its workflows.   As an exercise, taking a typical item, such as a work of fiction, draw up a flow chart which lists what happens at each stage from stock selection, through the ordering and acquisitions process, to the point when the item is made publicly available and is visible on the catalogue.

----
 


==== Borrower information ====


The two main elements in an automated system are the '''borrowers''' and the '''stock items'''.  The basic information held on the borrower, apart from name, is address and contact details.  There are usually several classes of borrower.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2''' 

Before proceeding, jot down the different classes of borrower you are aware of, and what the key differences are between them as far as the automated system is concerned.

----

 

==== Types of borrower ====


The '''main categories of borrower''', common to most public libraries, are: 


*adult
*teen
*junior
*concession (e.g.: senior citizen, person in receipt of benefits)
*disability (e.g.: visually or hearing impaired)
*housebound
*temporary (e.g.: transient worker)


You may have noted others.  


The key differences are likely to be:


*limits on the '''type of items allowed''', e.g.: junior borrowers may not borrow adult stock without a parent’s permission
*different '''loan periods''' for different categories of borrower, e.g.: no limit on length of loan period for borrowers with disabilities
*the '''scale of fines''' may vary with the different classes of borrower, e.g.: no fines for concessionary borrowers.


 
==== Registering and removing borrowers ====


The precise details of '''registering and removing borrowers''' can vary significantly depending on the system in use at your location.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.3''' 

Note down the steps you need to go through to:

*register a borrower with the system.
*remove a borrower from the system.

----

In addition to the borrower details which are permanently on the system, it may be necessary from time to time to add a '''temporary message''' to alert members of staff to something connected with a particular borrower. Some of these messages may be added automatically by the system. Typical would be information about money owed by or due to the borrower.


Staff will also be able to add specific messages. 

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down some examples of messages which you might wish to add about borrowers.

----

 

==== Messages about borrowers ====


You might want to ask for some of the '''borrower data''' to be verified, e.g.: if you have tried unsuccessfully to contact the borrower by telephone, you could add a note asking for the telephone number to be checked. Other data which sometimes changes (and borrowers neglect to inform the library) are home address and e-mail address.


Messages could be of a more '''personal''' nature “Mrs Jones left her umbrella in the library on her last visit. It is in the lost property cupboard.” Or “Tell Mr O’Neill that we have got some good new stock in about the Atkins diet.”  With these sorts of messages, do be careful to keep them factual. Data protection legislation means that borrowers are entitled to read any information stored in a computer about themselves. 


Remember to '''delete''' these messages once they are no longer applicable. Mr O’Neill will be pleased to be told once about the Atkins diet books but he will not appreciate being reminded of them on every visit to the library!

=== The circulation module ===


'''Issuing''' and '''discharging''' items of library stock using an automated system is usually quick and straightforward. Sometimes the system will indicate a complexity in the transaction, e.g.: you are prevented from issuing an item to a borrower. Although in almost all cases the system will supply you with correct information regarding the status of the borrower and their borrowing activities, the underlying reasons may not be displayed on the screen.  


However, you have to be able to explain the actions of the system to the borrower.  This requires both an excellent understanding of the library authority rules (which guide the system) and the ability to access quickly the required screens of the system to find the reasons for the system’s decisions.


You should have a good '''understanding''' and have had '''practice''' in the main operations of the circulation module of the system.  


'''Issuing items'''


This is the basic action of entering the issuing details, i.e.: borrower and item barcodes on to the system.  

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down problems that may occur with this task.

----



==== Problems with issuing ====


We can think of several problems, such as:


*With '''self-issuing systems''', where the borrower is able to carry out self-issue over the Internet, borrowers, especially if they are inexperienced in doing this, can easily make a mistake.
*The system indicates that the borrower’s '''lending limit''' has been reached.
*The borrower would like at this point to know '''which other items''' they have out on loan.
*Different classes of items may have different '''loan periods''', e.g.: DVDs may need to be returned within three days. Certain types of book may be lent for only one week instead of the general three weeks.  The system may prompt you about this but you have to remember use the correct date stamp on the item.


You must be able to deal with these situations and be aware of relevant '''library policies''' so that you can communicate quickly with the borrower and explain the reason for any problems.

 

==== Discharging items ====


Most automated systems allow items to be discharged by entering only the '''item barcode'''. They do not require borrower information to be entered. This makes discharging items a simple and fast operation. However, '''additional steps''' are sometimes required.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down problems that may occur when discharging items.

----

 

==== Problems with discharging items ====


We can think of several potential problems, such as:


*The returned item is '''damaged'''. This must be shown on the system and the book sent for repair or disposal.
*The returned item is subject to a '''request by another borrower''' or an inter-library loan. The system will prompt on this and you must follow reservation or ILL procedures.

 

==== Other circulation tasks ====


*'''Renewing items:''' this is a variation on the issuing procedure.  However, it may be a renewal over the telephone.  This requires you to manually input the details into the system.
*'''Reserving Items:''' make sure that you are familiar with the steps you must carry out on the system to input a reservation.
*'''Overdues:''' most automated systems generate overdue notices automatically and the screen will show any fine incurred by the borrower at the point of return of the item.
*'''Charges and Fines:''' reservations often require charges to be made to the borrower.  Charges may also be made for interlibrary loans.  The other common financial transaction is related to fines for late return of items.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.4''' 

Make a list of the charges your library make to borrowers which must be administered via the library's automated system.

----


Data provided by the circulation control module of the automated management system can make a significant contribution to the successful management of stock. Used properly, the system can provide data on usage for managers to support their decisions in areas such as stock selection policy, opening hours, staffing levels, distribution of stock and information for statutory and local performance indicators. A particular use of the library management system is in monitoring the performance (levels of issuing of resources) of existing stock.


=== The acquisitions module ===


Once new stock to be purchased for the library has been selected (the selection process is covered in outcome two of this unit) the automated system plays a prominent part. Although details will differ, there are three clear steps - '''ordering, receipting''' and '''invoicing'''. The system then will allow the acquisitions process to run, using its Reporting Systems and Order Transmission.
 
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.5''' 

Find out the procedures for placing and receiving stock orders on your automated library system and how this interfaces with the system’s monetary reporting facility.

----


The above are the procedural steps. However, the automated system is equally powerful in aiding the acquisition process when it comes to '''financial control'''.  


The acquisition of new items for your library stock is governed principally by an '''acquisitions policy'''. Different library authorities will have different methods but the following is the basis of the process:


*The '''total level of resources''' available for the library service as a whole is set.
*'''Priorities''' for spending are agreed.
*The total budget is then broken down across the various '''budget headings''', e.g.: fiction, non-fiction, DVDs, allocations to different branches etc.
*Budget holders are informed of their '''budget allocation''' and acquisitions may proceed.


It is important that you clearly understand the '''boundaries''' of your personal authority within the ordering of any stock selection process. You may be permitted to place orders or this may only be done by a more senior member of staff. Know what responsibility you have and your accountability for actions within your remit.


Clearly the whole process of acquisitions is based on the '''availability of funds''' to enable the purchase of new stock items.  Thus, there is always a very clearly defined method of deciding how much money can be spent on the various types of new stock item.


The joy of an automated system is that it can give really hard data to inform the acquisition process.  It will give the '''spending situation''' under the various budget headings.  This includes both the projected and the actual spending to date.  Although you may not need to access this management information, it is important for you to realise that you have a vital part in this.  You must always enter order information accurately to ensure the system has the correct data for its calculations.


Of course there is also '''non-financial information''' in the data.  For instance, it can also give information on the performance of the various suppliers used by the library. This allows the library managers to select the best performing suppliers for future orders.


=== The cataloguing and stock management modules ===


A library catalogue has two main functions:


#it is a '''record''' of the items which comprise the library stock 
#it allows people to '''seek out''' suitable items they wish to use


The first appearance of automated systems in libraries related to automation of the library catalogue.  In the late 1960s computers became powerful and available enough to allow libraries, particularly '''academic libraries''', to embark on ‘computerising’ their catalogues.  It is easy to see why this was more attractive than going for the circulation system first.  Users could use searching techniques to find book titles by keywords.  Networks were beginning to appear so that it became possible to search for titles in '''other libraries''' remotely.  You must compare this with the position up till this point of using paper or card indexes to find a book only by its author or subject.  


From the user’s point of view the cataloguing module of the automated library system is the most powerful and useful part of it.  Of course the user has to learn how to use it to advantage, as indeed do those who work in the library.


 
==== The advantages of automated catalogues ====


The advantages of automated catalogues are twofold:


#They permit sophisticated '''searching''' of the library stock.
#They link to the circulation control system so that not only can a borrower ascertain that the library service holds a particular item, they can also see its '''loan status''' at the time.


The search facility of the catalogue module is very flexible.  It will allow searching for items on author, title, accession number as well as classification.  However its greatest power for users is to search on '''subject keyword''' or '''word in title'''.  You will no doubt have to demonstrate this feature to keen users of your library.


In your administrative work related to the catalogue, i.e.: stock management, you are most likely to be locating items whose details are known.  You will be searching on author, title or accession number.  Having found the item, you may need to withdraw it, thus deleting its entry in the catalogue.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.6''' 

Note down the procedure to withdraw an item from the catalogue module of the automated library system.

----
 


==== Withdrawing items ====


Although the '''basic deletion process''' is very simple, there may be complications.  The system may require a special procedure if it is the last remaining copy of a book, or if it is an item forming part of a special collection.  Clearly your library will have its unique rules for this type of matter.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.7''' 

Ascertain the policy in your library if an item being withdrawn is shown to be the last copy of this title held within the library service.

----

==== Adding items ====


You also need to understand how resources are added to the catalogue.  In some library services, library staff undertake much of the work related to cataloguing and classifying items to be added to stock. In many other services this is done '''automatically''' using records from the supplier or downloaded from elsewhere during the order process.  However, even here, with certain items, such as donations to the library, it may be necessary to create a new record and enter all its data manually. 

---- 	

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.8''' 

Note down the procedure to manually add an item to the catalogue module of the automated library system.

----


Of course, having found the item after successfully searching the catalogue depends on knowing the layout and organisation of the particular library.  The catalogue entry will include a shelf mark.  


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down how fiction items are arranged in your library.

----

 

==== Shelving items ====


Fiction is usually arranged by author surname in alphabetical order.  Then, within any one author, by title.  Where no author exists, the editor’s surname or title is used alphabetically.


A popular method of shelving fiction is by the use of '''genres'''.  Essentially a set of genres are decided upon, e.g.: crime, fantasy, science fiction, romance and the books are labelled correspondingly and placed on the shelves in their appropriate genre.  The catalogue entry will indicate this.


Non-fiction is usually shelved by '''subject''' according to the local classification system. Here too genres may be used, e.g.: libraries frequently group all biographies together. 


Whichever methods are used, stock items are always organised according to agreed principles by libraries in order to aid the swift retrieval of resources either physically from the shelved collection or virtually from the library catalogue.

=== Inter Library Loan module ===


You should be familiar with the steps associated with the ILL process.


It may be that the borrower has a specific item in mind, in which case you must get a precise description of the item.


What information about a book would you ideally wish to have before placing an ILL request?


To satisfy the British Library ILL form, a considerable amount of information is required, indeed the full bibliographic details. In the case of a book, these are the following:


*	Author
*	Title
*	Year of publication 
*	Edition 
*	ISBN
*	Publisher &amp; place of publication 
*	The source of the reference


And remember you also need to record the name and contact details of the borrower.


If, as is likely, the borrower cannot supply you with full bibliographic details of the item being requested, you will need to ascertain these using appropriate bibliographic tools.


It may be that from the nature of the borrower request (they cannot find an item to satisfy their quest) you may need to follow the reference interview process, described in Unit 1 so that you have a clear definition of the subject area required by the borrower.    

 
==== Inter Library Loan procedures ====


Before embarking on the ILL procedure, it is always worth '''double-checking''' your own library catalogue to verify that the requested item is not actually in your stock. If it is not, your library service will have '''procurement procedures''' and appropriate ways of securing the item.  For example, this might be purchasing the item, instigating an internal ILL or carrying out an external ILL.

 	
----


[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.9''' 

Check out your library authority’s procurement procedures for securing an item which might be subject to an ILL.

----


Let us assume that an ILL will be required. The automated library system will allow the following steps to be carried out:


*	The initiation of an ILL request
*	Tracking the progress of an ILL request
*	Informing the borrower of the arrival of an inter-loaned item
*	Issuing the inter-loaned item
*	Discharging the inter-loaned item
*	Recalling an inter-loaned item
*	Recording the return of an inter-loaned item to its home library


 

==== Using Inter Library Loans ====


You should be familiar with all aspects of the Inter Library Loan system in use at your own location.

 	
----


[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.10''' 

Make yourself familiar with the Inter Library Loan module of your automated library management system for:

*Initiating an ILL request
*Monitoring progress of an ILL request 
*Carrying out internal ILL procedures for issue, discharge, recall of ILL items to client
*Carrying out procedures for receipt of and return of ILL item from/to home library.

----


You will find that the rules governing the use of ILL items will vary from those for stock items found in your own library.  It is important to be aware of these conditions and to be able to explain them to the borrower.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down some points which you think might be different for ILL items.

----

 

==== Rules governing Inter Library Loans ====


Three important points are as follows:


'''Costs:''' your library may make a charge, thus passing on some of the ILL cost to the borrower, e.g.: fines for late return - there are additional penalties for non-return of British Library items within loan period.


'''Timescales:''' you will need to give as accurate as possible an estimate of the time taken to secure the item.  Also the period of time that the borrower can hold the item may be different from the loan period for similar items in your own library stock.


'''Restrictions on use''': it may be that the item may only be consulted within your library and not borrowed.  There may be photocopying restrictions on the item.


== Use ICT sources in stock selection ==


=== Criteria for stock selection ===


Although you may not be responsible for the '''selection''' and '''acquisition''' of materials for your library, you may contribute to the identification of appropriate materials for the service.  You certainly need to understand the '''principles''' of stock selection for public libraries.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down the information you think you would need to make decisions on which stock to purchase.

----



==== Selecting stock ====


The two main drivers in stock selection are the '''current demands of the borrowers''' and the '''current stock available'''.


The current demand has to be '''audited'''.  This is relatively simple when an automated library system is being used.  In fact, it is possible to be overwhelmed by the available statistics from an automated system.  So a careful approach is required in deciding which categories, fiction genres and authors to run statistics on.


This information on borrowing can be compared with the current stock provision.  Broadly speaking there should be a match between the two.  Thus looking at the detective genre, if the books by two popular authors show a great disparity such that the books by author X are on loan five times as much as author Y, there may be a good case for purchasing more copies of the books by author X.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of circumstances where this may not be valid

----

==== Factors affecting demand ====


It would be important to take into account any '''reading promotions''' carried out by the library on author X. Another factor might be that author Y’s books are shelved in an inaccessible place. Perhaps X’s books are paperback and Y’s are hardback and your borrowers prefer the paperback format.


The conclusions on the previous page are made under the assumption that the '''stock levels, display methods''' and '''format''' are roughly the same for both authors


You also need to be aware of reading promotions external to your library which might drive a boom in borrowing books by author X.  Although it may still be valid to increase your stock because there is a genuine and sustainable increase in interest in reading author X as a result of rave reviews on a television arts programme, you do need to question the '''sustainability'''. You do not want to be left six months later with a shelf full of author X’s books which are no longer being borrowed.

 	
----


[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of other reasons for choosing items for stock apart from balancing stock and demand.

----
 


==== Additional criteria for stock selection ====


Apart from this '''balancing of stock and demand''', we think that the following points will drive stock choice. 

'''Gaps in stock''' which need to be filled.  Obvious examples are new novels by favourite authors, or earlier novels which have never been in the stock of the library. There will also be a need for '''replacement copies''' due to poor condition or because material is out of date in the case of reference items for instance.


There will also be some form of '''stock development plan''' for your library.  This may cover the need for more diverse formats, including non-book resources, as well as new directions of book materials.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1'''
 
Note down the stock development plans for your library.   If necessary ask other library colleagues.

----


All the above points go to making up the '''stock selection policy''' for your library. From this policy, it is possible to identify criteria for selection of new stock items.


It is now possible to use '''online selection tools''' to find possible new items and assess them against the agreed stock selection criteria.

 

=== Online library catalogues ===


Of the possible ways of finding suitable material for stock selection, the use of online library catalogues of other libraries has the advantage that the materials ought to be properly catalogued and so easy to find using keywords.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Online library catalogues


This ability to search other library’s catalogues is increasingly possible because it is becoming commonplace for libraries to have catalogues which can be searched via the Internet. The '''UK Public Libraries Page''' is a useful resource, linking to the web-available catalogues.

http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/ac940/weblibs.html  


Some services '''combine''' together the catalogues of several libraries. A single-search interface is used to cross-search multiple catalogues in a single search action. In Wales there is [http://library.wales.org/catcymru/ CatCymru] which enables the searching of library catalogues across all public, FE and HE libraries in Wales 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2'''
 
Go to the UK Public Libraries Page and find examples of public library services with combined catalogues. (There are several examples of this.)

----

 

==== Combined catalogues ====


Some websites combine catalogues of collections with a common theme. Here are some more examples of catalogues to explore:


*'''British Library'''		http://catalogue.bl.uk 
*'''Northern Ireland'''		http://www.ni-libraries.net/library-card/library-catalogue/
*'''CatCymru'''	                http://library.wales.org/catcymru/
*'''Birmingham'''		http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/libcat

==== Differences between catalogues ====


The catalogues we looked at on the previous page vary in the details they provide and in the range of functions which can be performed. They do however offer the opportunity to trace resources.  Here you are using the existing systems for inter-library loan as a helpful way of allowing library staff to view each other’s collections.

 
Some services may have automatic links to bibliographic service providers such as '''Talis''' or subscriptions to services such as '''Whittaker’s Books in Print'''.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3'''
 
Go to the Northern Ireland catalogue https://opac.librariesni.org.uk/ and search under author for Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code”. Look through the list and select the correct author. Follow the links and note that you can clearly see format, availability and reserve the item online. Compare this to the information available for the same book from your service.

----


QUESTION TextEntry1:

=== Publishers’ and booksellers’ websites ===


The most obvious place on the Internet to look for new stock items is of course the library booksellers’ and publishers’ websites.  These companies aim to sell the items and so one would expect that they contain the most '''up to date information''' on things like prices and publication dates for the items.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of other more negative points about the use of such websites.

----
 


==== Negative aspects to commercial sites ====


Well, you have to bear in mind that publishers and booksellers have a '''commercial imperative''' and thus the content may be biased or might not provide full information. 


You must exercise '''caution''' when using these websites to select material and you must therefore ensure that any selected materials do properly match the agreed selection criteria. 


 
==== Example sites ====


Here is a small selection of useful sites:


*'''Askews'''				http://www.askews.co.uk/site/default_askews.asp
*'''Bertram Library services'''		http://libraryservices.bertrams.com/BertramLibraryServices/
*'''Amazon'''				http://www.amazon.co.uk
*'''Booksellers Association'''		http://www.booksellers.org.uk/
*'''Scottish Bibliographies Online'''	http://www.scotlandsculture.org/sbo/sbo.htm
*'''Welsh Books Council'''		http://www.cllc.org.uk/
*'''Books from Scotland'''		http://www.booksfromscotland.com 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''

Go to the Harper Collins website (http://www.harpercollins.com) and follow links from the home page to New Releases, Forthcoming Titles and Best Sellers. Look for a favourite author in these sections and note the information you can find about the author, forthcoming events, full list of titles in print, range of formats titles are available in and links to author’s websites. NB: You can also register for an author tracker facility and to find out about new writing.

----

==== Services offered ====


Some of the websites offer a range of sophisticated services – pre-publication ordering facilities, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) information, download facilities of MARC (Machine Reading Catalogue) records and tracking systems for current orders.
	
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''

Choose one of your own library suppliers, view their website and make a note of the services apart from straight forward sale of items which they provide.  Find out how well they integrate with your automated library management system. You may find it useful to ask your colleagues about this.

----

 

=== Online reviews and personal evaluations ===


The Internet provides a great potential for reviewing potential new stock items.  There are many websites which will provide this sort of service.  An obvious choice is the bookseller Amazon  http://www.amazon.co.uk 


However there are many others’ including sites linked to newspapers. Here are some examples:


*'''The Guardian book review site'''  	http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/ 
*'''The Independent book review site'''	http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/  

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of more negative points about the use of such websites.

----
 


==== Negative aspects of online reviews ====


You have to treat reviews which have been posted on the Internet with some caution. They often include only part of the entire review and the views of the individual reviewer are unlikely to have been through a '''rigorous editorial process''', unlike print journals.


It is also possible to review extracts of audio/visual materials using the Internet, again candidates should return to the stock selection policy for guidance prior to purchase.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''

Go to the Guardian’s website http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/  and compare one of the reviews with the book blurb on the publisher’s website or another review on the same title. Look at style, content, detail and overall conclusion of the reviews with a view to their helpfulness within stock selection.

----

== Use ICT in continuing library practice and professional development ==


=== Discussion lists ===


Online discussion lists (sometimes called groups, newsgroups or forums) are the Internet version of electronic '''bulletin boards''', popular among computer users long before Internet. A user can post comments on a topic and other users can respond. Messages are visible to all members of the group and some services provide extensions such as file storage and calendaring. The original newsgroup service, '''Usenet''', is now available via Google Groups (http://groups.google.co.uk). Other services include  '''Jiglu''' (http://www.jiglu.com/) and '''Yahoo Groups''' (http://groups.yahoo.com).


Discussion lists are a useful tool for both individual professional development and solving specific problems. Lists work in the following way. You have to sign up as a member, giving your e-mail address. Any of the members can send in an e-mail with information of interest to the group or a question. All these e-mails are forwarded automatically to all list members. This usually generates a flurry of helpful responses.


Some lists are '''moderated''' so that the e-mails are only posted after they have been vetted.  For the lists you use, you should be aware which are vetted and which allow e-mails to be sent instantaneously.  


We can classify discussion lists into three broad categories: 


*	professional discussion lists run by or for the professional library bodies

*	government or local government sponsored lists 

*	ad hoc lists run by interested people or groups. 

 

==== Professional discussion lists ====


JISC mail (the service provided by the Joint Information Systems Committee) is one of the key providers of discussion lists and has a number of '''public library, special interest''' and '''library profession groups'''. The home page is http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/. You can search for different lists based on topic and there are many related to libraries.


You can see a list of library categories on this page: 

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists/category/Library.html 


Three specific examples of lists which can be used for professional matters by library staff are:



*	'''LIS-PUB-LIBS:''' is a forum for discussion of issues relating to UK public libraries.  See the joining page at: http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=lis-pub-libs 

*	'''LIS-SCOTLAND:''' is a forum for discussion of issues relating to Scotland.  See the joining page at: http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?SUBED1=lis-scotland&amp;A=1 

*	'''LIS-Wales:''' is a forum for discussion of issues relating to Wales.  See the joining page at: https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=lis-wales


CILIP has a range of professional discussion lists which are targeted at supporting members of library staff who share particular professional interests or working environments. Visit http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists/category/Library.html  to browse the library dicussion lists (you can search for the CILIP sponsored discussion lists using 'LIS-CILIP').

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''
 
Select an appropriate online discussion group on a subject that interests you e.g. information literacy, youth library work or mentoring. Join a group (you will find more at http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists) and read some of the recent discussions. 

----

==== Government sponsored lists ====


Non-library-specific discussion groups, such as those run on local authority websites or the websites of other agencies may also be useful. An example is the '''Welsh Assembly Government''' which offers a range of consultation and discussion forums (you have to register to access the forums):

http://wales.gov.uk/?lang=en 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2''' 

Search the Internet for a discussion list for your geographic area, perhaps run by your local authority.

----

==== Ad hoc groups and lists ====


There is a range of commercial service providers such as:


 
*'''Yahoo Groups'''	http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/
*'''Jiglu'''            http://www.jiglu.com/
*'''Freeboards'''       http://www.freeboards.net/main.htm


They provide discussion groups (lists) free of charge.  These offer simple, alternative ways to start discussion lists for groups, e.g. Community Services Group (Scotland) at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/csgscotland/  Of course this also means that you can also easily set up a group to discuss any topic you choose.  This approach can allow you to share ideas in the professional field.

Social networking websites have a huge potential for useful exchanges of news, information and ideas. Many of them have established areas for library interests. The main problems are the quality of the content and access from within local authority firewalls. Here are some sites to look at, if you can access them.


*'''CILIPS'''		https://twitter.com/CILIPScotland
*'''CILIP South East Branch Flickr'''	http://www.flickr.com/photos/cilip-se/
*'''CILIP Career Development Group Facebook''' 	http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2421438148
*'''Welsh libraries blog'''		http://libalyson.wordpress.com/
*'''Del-i-cious'''
*'''Scottish libraries blog'''		http://scottishlibraries.wordpress.com/ 
*'''Scottish Library and Information Council'''		http://www.scottishlibraries.org/ which incorporates a range of web 2.0 tools. Guidance on using web 2.0 in a library and information service context have been published and are interesting reading.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3''' 

Taking any one of the three group providers mentioned above, explore how to set up a group for your own use.For all three use the group index or search system to find groups related to library work.

----

=== Professional websites ===


You should be familiar with and able to access a range of key professional websites to support you in your professional practice.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down any websites you can think of which fall into the above category.

----
 


==== Types of professional website ====


The websites you have listed are likely to fall into one of three categories: 


*	Websites of the '''strategic agencies'''

*	Websites of '''professional associations''' and '''special interest groups'''

*	Websites of '''local agencies'''


 
==== Websites of the strategic agencies ====


Each of the 4 UK home nations has its own strategic agency for libraries. These are:


*'''Arts Council England'''	http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-libraries/
*'''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''	http://www.scottishlibraries.org/
*'''Museums Archives and Libraries Wales (CyMAL)'''	http://www.cymal.wales.gov.uk/
*'''Library and Information Services Council (Northern Ireland) LISC(NI)'''	http://www.liscni.co.uk/


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4''' 
 	
Look at each of these 4 websites and compare the information given.

----

==== Websites of professional associations and special interest groups ====


All '''professional associations''' have websites. These usually comprise pages which can be accessed by anyone plus further sections which are '''available only to members''' who use a password to access them. The main professional association in the library field is the '''Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP)''' at: http://www.cilip.org.uk/


Many relevant special interest groups have websites.  These can be particularly useful as they often act as portal sites, collecting links to other websites based on the same or similar topics. Examples are:


*'''CILIP Multimedia Information and Technology Group'''	http://mmitblog.wordpress.com/ 
*'''The Historic Libraries Forum'''	http://www.historiclibrariesforum.org.uk/
*'''International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres''' http://www.iaml-uk-irl.org/

==== Websites of local agencies ====


You should also be aware of the importance of the contents and functions of your own '''local authority website''' and '''local intranet'''. 


Simple client enquiries made at the library counter or over the telephone can often be answered from these sources and it is useful to be well informed regarding content and layout so that site navigation takes the minimum amount of time.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.5''' 

Spend some time making yourself familiar with the website run by your own local authority.

----
 


=== Online professional journals ===


'''Online journals''' offer a readily accessible and searchable source of professional information. Some are freely available but others operate on a subscription basis. Examples are:


*'''CILIP Update'''	http://www.cilip.org.uk/publications/updatemagazine
*'''CILIP in Scotland'''	http://www.cilips.org.uk/
*'''Journal of Information Literacy'''  http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL


CILIP members enjoy free online access to the '''Journal of Information Science''' and J'''ournal of Librarianship and Information Science''' from the CILIP website.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.6''' 
  
Look at the latest issue of CILIP Update at http://www.cilip.org.uk/publications/updatemagazine  Familiarise yourself with the layout and content. Is there anything in this issue which is of interest to you in your current job role?

----


You should get into the habit of regularly checking on-line journals to gather information and ideas which are relevant to your own continuing professional development.

== Safe practice relating to the use of ICT for communication ==


=== Using ICT for communication ===


This section relates to supporting clients in '''using ICT safely''' for communication purposes, within the constraints of current legislation. Clients should already possess basic ICT skills, such as simple word processing and the ability to navigate the Internet using a web browser. You should also establish the client’s communication needs, e.g. do they need e-mail for personal or work-related correspondence, in order to assist in the selection of a suitable e-mail service.


The use of e-mail exploded some years ago, encouraged by the fall in prices of home PCs and the introduction of free Internet access in libraries and schools. Since then despite the rise of social media email use has continued to increase and is predicted to continue. Email is an essential method of communication both socially, commercially and professionally.

There are many advantages:


*	the speed of delivery 
*	the ability to send to multiple recipients
*	the flexibility of using web-based e-mail accounts for sending e-mails for various locations 
*	the ability to attach other types of files, such as images. 
*       the low cost involved in sending mail in bulk.


 
==== Electronic mail ====


You should have an in-depth knowledge of electronic mail including:


*	local e-mail software, systems and protocols 
*	the structure of e-mail addresses
*	tracking e-mail messages - delivered, read etc.
*	using importance flags
*	changing setting for preferred presentation


Yo may be asked to set up e-mail accounts for clients …

==== Setting up e-mail accounts ====


A web-based e-mail account is one where the user accesses his or her e-mail by means of a '''web-browser''', such as '''Internet Explorer''' or '''Firefox''', rather than by using a specialist e-mail client program, such as '''Outlook, Outlook Express''' or '''Thunderbird'''.


You should be able to '''set up web based e-mail accounts''' and to show clients how to do this. This includes opening and closing the account. 

 

==== Free e-mail services ====


Popular free e-mail services include the following:


*'''Gmail'''	http://www.gmail.com
*'''Hotmail'''	http://www.hotmail.co.uk
*'''Lycos'''		http://mail.lycos.com/lycos/Index.lycos
*'''Yahoo'''	http://mail.yahoo.com/
*'''Mail2web'''	http://mail2web.com/

'''ACTIVITY 1.1''' 	

If you are not already familiar with the process, log on to one of the e-mail services above and follow the instructions to create an account for yourself, e.g.: joe_bloggs@hotmail.co.uk. As you do this, note down any points which you would wish to make to clients when demonstrating how to set up an email account. 

You will use this account or one of your own existing ones in subsequent activities. 

----

==== Sending and receiving e-mails ====


Using e-mail is a big step for the uninitiated and assumptions should not be made about how quickly clients can absorb technical details and instructions.


If you are in any doubt, you can find out how to send and receive mail from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll usually find a link to this on the opening page of any web based e-mail service.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2''' 	

Select one of the web-based e-mail services listed above and show a client how to carry out the following tasks: 

1. create a new e-mail

2. add content to an e-mail

3. send an e-mail to a recipient

4. check for new e-mails sent to them

5. open received  e-mails 

6. reply to e-mails received

7. forward a received e-mail to another recipient. 


If you send e-mails to one of the accounts you created earlier, you’ll be able to check that they’ve been received correctly and demonstrate this to the client.

----


Once your clients have mastered the basics of e-mail, they’ll probably want to move on to more complex tasks. Let’s start by looking at sending, receiving and saving attached files …

==== Using attached files ====


One of the particularly useful things about e-mail is the ability to '''attach files''' and thus send, say, copies of photographs to the recipient.  This is particularly useful for older clients staying in touch with their family when they stay at a distance.  Any sort of file can be attached and sent with an e-mail.  Another common file type attached to e-mails is a word processed document

You should be able to show clients '''how to attach files'''. The client may create the file in the library, e.g.: by typing a Word document or scanning in a photograph.  Clients may also wish to attach previously created files brought to the library on floppy disks, CDs or USB flash drives.  Not all library authorities allow the use of removable data, so you should check this for your own library service.

One area where clients may run into difficulties involves the size of attached files
 


==== Size of attached files ====


You should make the clients aware of '''possible limits to the size''' of files attached to e-mails.  There are two points.  Firstly some web-based free e-mail services do not allow particularly large attachments.  The second point is that, if the recipient is on a dial-up connection, large attachments may be almost impossible to download.  This is a particular problem with photographs which can often be several megabytes in size.  


You should explain the idea of possibly '''resizing''' photographs and definitely compressing them.  A rough guide might be that unless there is a special reason, attached photographs should be no more than say 100K in size.


To resize a photograph, the client needs access to image processing software.  A free example may be found in [http://www.irfanview.com Irfan View]On the other hand many e-mail programs offer automatic compression of photographs.



----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.3''' 	

Using one of the e-mail programs listed above, demonstrate to a client how to send both a word-processed document and a photograph as attached files. If you send e-mails to one of the accounts you created earlier, you’ll be able to check that they’ve been received correctly and demonstrate this to the client.

----

==== Using zipped files ====


With e-mail attachments such as large graphics or word processed documents a reduction in size is achieved by '''compressing''' or “zipping” the file.  


If you are using certain operating systems, for example most versions of Linux and Windows ME/2000, file zipping is built in to the operating system. If you are using an earlier version of your operating system, you may need to install a third-party program such as WinZip. You can download an evaluation copy from http://www.winzip.com 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.4''' 	

Using one of the e-mail programs listed above, demonstrate to a client how to compress or “zip” documents and attach them to an e-mail. If you send e-mails to one of the accounts you created earlier, you’ll be able to check that they’ve been received correctly and demonstrate this to the client. You should also show the client how to decompress or “unzip” files and save or print them.

----


Another area your clients will need to know about is virus checking

==== Virus checking ====


'''Viruses in e-mail attachments''' may cause serious problems for users. Local authorities have anti-virus software in place but you should be aware that this can be a serious problem for home users. Clients can inadvertently pick up viruses and then transfer them between machines when they use files on public access PCs. Automatic checking should be in place but you should still advise clients not to open unrecognised e-mail messages or attachments.


Anti virus facilities, and the degree to which they can be automated, vary between e-mail service providers. You can find out how to configure anti-virus facilities from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services, which you can access from the opening pages.

It might be worth noting that several providers limit sending or receiving of certain attachments (such as .exe, .bat or .com which are all Windows executables) - this can be useful in preventing the spread of viruses but it might hinder you should you wish to send such files legitimately over the system.

==== Implementing virus checking ====


Now try some activities relating to implementing anti-virus software.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.5''' 	

Go to the Lycos web-mail site at http://mail.lycos.com/lycos/Index.lycos and find out which type of virus protection is implemented.


Alternatively, try searching for any email providers anti virus protection. e.g. type gmail virus protection into Google.

----


In order to show clients how to check that the virus checking is turned on in their web-based e-mail service, you must be familiar with this facility in the commonly used services.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.6''' 	

Log on to any of the new e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and make sure that automatic virus checking is turned on, as far as permitted by the e-mail service provider.

----

==== Anti-virus software ====


It is also worth informing clients about general antivirus software, which will protect against viruses from any source not just e-mails e.g. files brought in by a client on a floppy disk. AVG is a free anti-virus program which can be downloaded from http://www.grisoft.com


Evaluation versions of subscription anti-virus programs can often be found on computer magazine cover CDs or they can be downloaded from:


*'''McAfee'''	http://download.mcafee.com/us/eval/evaluate2.asp
*'''Norton'''	http://www.symantecstore.com
*'''Panda'''	http://www.pandasoftware.com/download/


Once clients start to build up a collection of sent and received e-mails, they may need to learn how to manage them so that they can be located easily when required, so let’s have a look at Managing e-mails …

 

==== Managing e-mails ====


The key to '''effective management of e-mails''' is always to have an almost empty in-box.  In other words, when you receive e-mails you should be able to deal with them promptly and either delete them afterwards or store them in other folders which you have prepared in your e-mail program.

You have to show your clients how to do this with their web-based e-mail account. We suggest that you spend a little time with the client, getting an idea of the likely categories for their e-mails, setting up one folder for them and then allowing the client to do this for themselves for the other categories.

Google mail (Gmail) utilises Labels rather than folders. Labels work in a similar way but can take some getting used to especially as emails can be given more than one label.
 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of a typical client and  jot down a list of folder names which might accommodate the majority of their e-mails.

----

==== E-mail folders ====


We can think of the following:


*	Family members
*	Friends
*	On-line shopping
*	Holidays


You may also have thought of others.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.7''' 

Using one of your web-based e-mail accounts, set up folders for the four categories we have listed above.  Note down any specific points you would want to alert a client to when demonstrating this procedure to them.

----


As well as trying to prevent viruses, clients will also need to take steps to protect themselves against other online threats and nuisances. Let’s take a look at Combating spam …

 

==== Combating Spam ====


All e-mail accounts are bombarded to a greater or lesser extent by '''unsolicited e-mails''' sent out by hoaxers or commercial interests. These e-mails are known as “spam”.  In some cases clients will find the spam e-mail subject as well as the content offensive. Most software systems and web based providers offer processes which can block a large percentage of unsolicited mail. 
You should make clients aware that accessing some websites and responding to messages where they are required to type in their e-mail address may aggravate the problem by signing them up to more junk mail.  This is a particular problem with unsolicited e-mails which have a link purporting to remove you from the mailing list but in fact confirms that the account is active and will result in more spam.


The '''spam filtering systems''' used by web based e-mail providers suffer from the same flaw that all spam filtering exhibits – sometimes, genuine wanted e-mail gets classified as spam and does not appear in the in-box.  You can find out how to manage combat spam from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll usually find a link to this on the opening page of the service.


A good suggestion is to have two email accounts, one for personal emailing and another for use when purchasing online. Online shopping is a common way for spammers to find email addresses to pester!
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.8''' 

Log on to each of the new e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and make sure that the spam filters are turned on.    

----

==== E-mail etiquette ====


The term “netiquette” is used to describe the rules that govern polite use of the Internet when interacting with other users.  Clearly, a large part of this centres round the use of e-mails.  


----


[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down any points you can think of relating to courteous and effective use of e-mail.

----


 
==== Netiquette ====


Simple points of e-mail netiquette are:


*	properly describing the purpose of the e-mail in the subject field
*	using spell checking
*	avoid using solely capital letters.  Using capital letters in an e-mail is seen as the equivalent of shouting at someone.  


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.9'''

Look at the exhaustive set of e-mail etiquette rules at http://www.emailreplies.com and make a list of the most obvious ones which you can then demonstrate to clients using e-mail in the library.

----


Clients may also want so send e-mail to news groups, so we’ll look briefly at Using news groups

==== Using news groups ====


When using news groups there is a protocol in replying to the various discussions/threads:


*	make sure that you are using the '''correct news group'''
*	make sure that you really mean to reply to the '''whole group''' and not just send a personal message to an individual member
*	always reply to the '''correct thread'''
*	sending the same message to several groups '''(cross posting)''' is frowned upon.


Clients should be warned that they should always think '''very''' carefully before posting a message to a public newsgroup. There are group archives (e.g.: http://groups.google.com) which store every message ever posted, so a message can have a potential lifespan of many years and could be seen by millions of people! Once a message is posted there is no way of retracting it.


Sometimes clients will want to send an e-mail to several people at the same time, so we’ll look next at Sending e-mail to multiple recipients… 
 


==== E-mailing multiple recipients ====


One of the time-saving features of using e-mail is to be able to send the same information to several people with little more effort that sending to only one recipient.  This, of course, is the reason for the existence of spam.

You should be able to show clients how send e-mail to multiple recipients, including replying to all, adding additional recipients and forwarding files. They should know how to send e-mails to multiple recipients without displaying the e-mail addresses of all recipients, a facility often known as '''blind carbon copies''' (Bcc:).   This last point is important netiquette as it is very impolite to broadcast the e-mail addresses of others without their permission.


You can find out how to send e-mail to multiple recipients from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll find a link to this on the opening page of the service.


A more efficient way of emailing multiple recipients is to create groups. The benefit of using groups is that once created you just type the group name and the email will go to everyone in the group AND you will never miss anyone (as long as you created the group correctly in the first plaace!)

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.10'''

Log on to one of the new e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and send an e-mail message to multiple recipients, i.e.: send the message to Account No 2, copy it to Account 3 and blind copy it to Account 4. Log on to the three recipient accounts and check that the messages have been received correctly.


----


Sometimes clients will reach the stage where an e-mail account is no longer required, so we’ll take a look now at Closing an e-mail account

==== Closing an e-mail account ====


You should warn clients that most web-based free e-mail accounts '''expire''' if not accessed by the user for a specified period of time, sometimes as short as 30 days.  In this way the e-mail account will close itself.  However, it is netiquette that e-mail accounts should be closed when they are no longer required. This avoids the problem of people sending e-mails to what appears to be a valid address, when no-one is checking the account.


You can find out how to close an e-mail account from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll find a link to this on the opening page of the service.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.11'''

Log on to each of the four e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and close each of them. (Assuming you no longer want to use them).

----


Clients will often want to use Internet facilities other than e-mail, so we’ll look next at Using chat rooms

 

==== Using chat rooms ====


Chat rooms are '''virtual social spaces''' on the Internet, where users can communicate with each other. Chat rooms are extremely popular because of their unedited and instantaneous nature. Some chat rooms are used simply for entertainment purposes, perhaps based around a topic such as discussing a daily television soap opera.  Others may be used for more serious discussions.  

As with most of the Internet, younger clients are often very savvy with the technology and are keen on using chat rooms to communicate with others of the same age and with similar interests.  It is easy to see the attraction for young people of being able to access this ‘secret’ world of anonymous communication where their parents cannot see what they are doing and in principle no holds are barred regarding ‘bad’ language. 

You should be able to inform clients about Acceptable practice in chat rooms

Chat rooms have largely been superceded by other social networking services (Facebook, Twitter and Google hangouts etc) but they are still a feature of many peoples online lives.

==== Acceptable practice in chat rooms ====


There has been increasing concern about the use of chat rooms for “grooming”. “Grooming” is the term given to interaction between an adult and a child with an end view of sexualising that relationship. “Grooming” is illegal. You need to advise '''younger clients''' as to how they can keep themselves safe by keeping personal information to themselves and never agreeing to meet alone in person anyone they have a chat room-friendship with. They should report any unwanted attention to their parents and / or the chatroom owners.


You must make adult users of chat rooms aware of what is acceptable when they are using computers in the library – this may be more restrictive than when using home PCs.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.12'''

Find out your library authority’s policy and procedures regarding acceptable use of chat rooms and safeguarding young clients.

----

==== More about chat rooms ====


You can find useful information on this, and other topics at:


http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/sametime/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.help_80/c_stadv_uim_whatis_chatrooms.html


You can find Chat services at:

*'''Lycos Chat'''	http://chat.lycos.co.uk/

*'''Social networking websites'''
Social networking websites and Chat rooms share similar concerns about safety and vulnerable groups. Social networking websites are very popular because they bring together friends and friends of friends who share a common interest. The illusion that it is a community of friends sometimes means that natural  caution is abandoned and private details are shared. In many local authorities and organizations access to social networking websites are blocked by firewalls. These website can offer valuable professional tools and there are some examples of these in Unit 4.

Examples of social networking websites include 
*'''Bebo'''	www.bebo.com
*'''Facebook''' 	www.facebook.com
*'''Flickr''' 	www.flickr.com
*'''LinkedIn'''	www.linkedin.com
*'''MySpace'''	www.myspace.com
*'''Tumblr''' 	www.tumblr.com
*'''Twitter'''	http://twitter.com
*'''WindowsLive'''	www.home.live.com

The ICTL units Digital Culture: Online Communication and Digital Culture: Online Collaboration cover social networking in far greater depth.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.13'''

Log on to the Lycos chat service listed above and see if you can find a chat room where readers discuss books they have read. Check the Help pages for full details of how to use the service. OR try using a search engine and type &quot;book reading chat room&quot; one example is https://bookclubreading.com/chat-rooms/


Clients may experience difficulties in carrying out certain tasks due to security restrictions placed on servers, so let’s take a look at Secure servers
 
----

==== Secure servers ====


Local authorities normally have '''secure servers''' to protect the local authority and public from potentially hostile breaches. This means that desktops are often “locked-down” and you cannot make changes to the settings on PCs in your library. This can be frustrating – especially when simple changes to the resolution of display, for example, would be useful for visually impaired clients. 


Secure servers also have restrictions on adding new software or on downloading executable files.

It may also be worth pointing out to library clients the importance of checking the security of the sites they use when making purchases online. Vendors should always use secure servers for the parts of their systems where customers will be typing in personal and financial details, such as credit card numbers. There are two ways a client can check whether their details are secure:


⋅They should look for a closed padlock symbol, normally in the address window of the web site.

⋅They should check that the web address starts HTTPS. The S is the bit which tells them the server is secure.
 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.14'''

Check your authority’s policy on secure servers and prepare a brief explanatory note for clients.

----


Clients may wish to convert paper-based materials, such as photographs, to digital images so they can be sent as e-mail attachments, so let’s have a look at Scanning images and saving to disk…

==== Scanning and saving images ====


Scanning of images and saving these to disk has increased with the proliferation of '''inexpensive''' scanning devices. Many clients will wish to send copies of photographs to their family via e-mail. 

You should be able to demonstrate to a client how to scan an image – either of text or pictures - and save it to disk.

(Note that the scanned files will often be large and may need to be reduced in size if they are to be attachments to e-mails.)

Since there is such a range of types of scanner and associated software, we cannot realistically give instructions for use here.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.15'''

Practice using your locally-available scanner and software to scan and save both text and images.  Find out how to reduce the resulting file by compressing it so that it will be acceptable as an e-mail attachment. Note down any points which you will want to make your clients aware of.

----

== Using ICT to support clients with special needs or specific language requirements ==


=== Introduction ===


This section relates to the ways in which ICT can support clients with special needs or those with specific language requirements. For example, this client group might include those '''visually impaired''', those whose '''first language is not English''', those '''disabled''', those with '''literacy difficulties''', and those with '''dyslexia''' or '''learning disabilities'''. 


Many of the clients in this group will be '''mature and capable''' with the same information needs as everyone else and could benefit from some of the assistive technologies to enable them to access the wide range of resources. 


'''Sensitivity''' is required in assessing the ability and aptitude of the client. It is important to remember that disabilities may not affect the reading level of clients or their interests. It may be useful to use pictograms instead of text in signage for some clients in this group.

 

==== Websites for those with special needs or specific language requirements ====


When dealing with clients having special needs or specific language requirements, special care should be given to the '''appropriateness''' of recommended websites. As well as the criteria applied to assessing the appropriateness of websites in general, you should exercise care to ensure that clients are directed towards accessible sites with appropriate content and format. For example, visually impaired people may be unable to access websites which are incompatible with software which they rely on. 


'''Clients with Impaired Vision'''


Clients with impaired vision may be able to use a normal monitor screen if the settings are adjusted to give '''large font size''' and '''high contrast'''. However, others will need to use a software package which will read out the text on the web page – a screen reader.


Some web sites will not work well with a screen reader.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you think of features on a website page which would cause difficulties for a client with impaired vision using a screen reader?

----



==== Problems for clients with impaired vision ====


The main problems are caused by screens which have no text. If it is not possible to read meaningfully only the text on the website page, then the screen reader will not be successful.

So the following are the problem areas:


*	Web pages which '''overly rely''' on graphics
*	Web pages which have graphics or photographs with '''no alternative text''' explanation
*	Web pages with text which is '''presented within a graphic'''
*	Web pages which use '''explanatory animations'''


The worst offenders can be sites that start in Flash with '''no text option''', so that the user gets no information from the screen reader and doesn’t know if the site is open or not.




==== Screen readers ====


Some problems have been reported in using screen readers with early version of Adobe Acrobat, but these have been overcome in later versions. You can find more information about this at:

http://www.adobe.com (type screen readers in the search window)


A good example of a screen reader which is well liked by users is JAWS for Windows. You can find more information about it at: http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/JAWS_HQ.asp 


Many libraries use '''Supernova''', which incorporates a screen reader called '''HAL'''. Supernova also incorporates a very good monitor screen magnification element - so it can help partially sighted clients. You can get further information (and download an evaluation copy) from: http://www.synapseadaptive.com/dolphin/  


The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) site gives a useful list of access software at:
http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/softwareandtechnology/softwareaccesscentre/Pages/software_access_centre.aspx

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1''' 

To get a better feel for screen reader software and especially to assist those clients with visual impairment, visit the RNIB site mentioned above and follow the links to some of the sites listed. Download evaluation copies of a few of the software packages and try them out. 

----

==== Colour blindness ====


Colour blindness is another factor which can affect a client’s ability to use a website. There are software packages which:


a)	permit a person who is not colour blind to view a web page '''as it would appear to a colour blind person'''. This can be a useful check for library staff before recommending a website.

b)	Use '''image processing techniques''' to make web pages clearer for those with colour blindness.

 	

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2''' 

Go to http://colorfilter.wickline.org/ and try the procedure on some webpages which you commonly use. How readable would they be to a client with colour blindness?

An alternative colour blindness simulator just for images is http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/

The SLIC website (http://www.slainte.org.uk/accessandequity/webdesign.htm) provides information on webpage design support and PC accessibility issues.

----

==== Clients with specific language requirements ====


When assisting clients with specific language requirements, it is worth turning to the Google search engine.  This provides a useful set of '''language tools''' for finding information and/or websites in specific languages and for translating between a range of languages.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3''' 

Use the Google language tools to: 

a) translate a favourite web page into another language; 

b) translate a foreign-language web page into English.

Another site which offers translation facilities for text and web pages is: http://www.babelfish.com/ 

c) Try the two tasks above using Babelfish as well. Which site do you think gives the best translations?

d) It's important to note that the translation might be a little rough around the edges. Try translating a simple phrase to another language, and then back into English. You might notice quite a change in the meaning of the phrase!

----

=== Evaluating websites against best practice guidance ===


Websites which can help assess the suitability of website material include:


*'''World Wide Web 3 Consortium'''	http://www.w3.org/WAI/
*'''WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool'''	http://wave.webaim.org/
*'''SLIC'''	http://www.slainte.org.uk/accessandequity/equityindex.htm


Look at the World Wide Web 3 Consortium pages and find out exactly what Best Practice in terms of web accessibility means.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4''' 

Follow the link to WAVE given above and use the tool to check the accessibility of a few of your favourite websites.
 
----

=== Assistive technologies ===


Technology can help to balance the difficulties encountered by some client groups. For example, those with motor impairment can access PCs with the aid of a large t'''rack ball mouse, touch screens, adapted keyboards''' and '''special software'''. 


You can find a number of companies which specialise in supplying assistive technology equipment.  An example is Inclusive Technology at:  http://www.inclusive.co.uk/. 
They have an online catalogue which groups the various items in broad headings.  

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.5''' 

Browse the Inclusive Technology catalogue. This will give you a good overview of what is available in hardware assistance. 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.6''' 

Find out what is available within your own library and library service which would support clients requiring assistive technology. Make a note on each item for future use.

----

 

==== Assistive technologies for clients whose first language is not English ====


You should also be able to use software or keyboard adaptations for people whose first language is not English. It is important for you to know about both what is available locally and organisations to whom clients can be referred. 


'''Adaptive furniture''' can be of great use to help clients. You can see an on-line catalogue on the website of Synapse Adaptive here: http://www.synapseadaptive.com/ 

They cover many adaptive technologies but if you look for hardware and then ergonomics, you will find a number of desk and chair items.

 

=== Changing software and keyboard settings ===


Although assistive technologies are widely available, sometimes all that is required to improve access for a client is to change the keyboard or software settings. This can allow the enlargement of text, icons and the speed of a mouse click to the client’s comfort.


'''Windows XP''' offers a huge range of '''accessibility features''', including adjusting Display Options, adjusting Mouse Options, adjusting Keyboard Options, adjusting Internet Options, adjusting Sounds and Audio Options, adjusting Taskbar and Menu Options, adjusting User Accounts Options, adjusting Speech Options, Utility Manager, On-Screen Keyboard, Narrator and Magnifier.


The Microsoft website has details of these at: http://www.microsoft.com/enable/


Windows XP has an accessibility wizard which can take the client through the various PC settings.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.7'''
 
If you have access to Windows XP you can use the '''Accessibility Wizard''' to explore the Accessibility features. You can start it by clicking on: '''Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Wizard''' OR '''Start &gt; Run''' type accwiz in the Open window.

If you are using an earlier version of Windows, or another Operating System, check your local help files to find out what options are available.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.8'''

From the information sources above, or additionally from the '''AbilityNet MyWay''' site at: http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/search/node/myway  make a note of the accessibility features you are likely to require to show to clients.  Jot down the steps you have to carry out to implement them.

----

=== Voice synthesis and voice recognition ===


Voice synthesis software can be used as an alternative to keying in and outputting in text format. 
There are two types of software required for this.  


'''Voice recognition software''' allows a client via microphone to give spoken commands to the computer, to allow PC use without a keyboard.  


'''Voice output''' from the PC is achieved by software which reads out what is displayed on the screen.  This is of great use to clients with vision problems.

== Legislation relating to the use of ICT for storage, manipulation and access of information ==


=== Introduction ===


This section relates to legislation concerning the use of ICT for '''storage, manipulation''' and '''access''' of information. Government legislation has a significant impact on ICT in libraries and staff require a sound working knowledge to ensure that clients can use ICT safely and legally.

=== Data Protection Act ===


The '''Data Protection Act 1998''' applies across the UK and gives legal rights to individuals in respect of their '''personal data''' held by others. Libraries must ensure that the ways they process personal data of clients and staff, whether manually recorded or computerised, comply with the provisions of the Act. This is particularly relevant to client data stored in an automatic library management system. Such ICT based systems facilitate analysis of client data which would not be possible with manual systems.


The following information is extracted from the '''Data Protection Act Fact Sheet''', which can be downloaded from the Information Commissioner’s website at: http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/.


The Data Protection Act 1998 seeks to strike a balance between the rights of individuals and the sometimes competing interests of those with legitimate reasons for using personal information. 
We will look at the following useful sections:


*	The eight principles of good practice
*	The six conditions for fair data processing
*	Sensitive data 
*	Rights under the Act
*	Criminal offences created by the Act	
*	Unsolicited electronic communications
*	The role of the Information Commissioner’s Office 

 

==== The eight principles of good practice ====


Anyone processing personal information must comply with eight '''enforceable principles''' of good information handling practice. These say that data must be:


**1. 	fairly and lawfully processed
**2. 	processed for limited purposes
**3. 	adequate, relevant and not excessive
**4. 	accurate and up to date
**5. 	not kept longer than necessary
**6. 	processed in accordance with the individual’s rights
**7. 	secure
**8. 	not transferred to countries outside European Economic area unless country has adequate protection for the individual

==== The six conditions for fair data processing ====


At least one of the following conditions must be met for personal information to be considered fairly processed:


**1.	the individual has consented to the processing
**2.	processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual
**3.	processing is required under a legal obligation (other than one imposed by the contract)
**4.	processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the individual
**5.	processing is necessary to carry out public functions, e.g. administration of justice
**6.	processing is necessary in order to pursue the legitimate interests of the data controller or third parties (unless it could unjustifiably prejudice the interests of the individual)

 

==== Sensitive data ====


Specific provision is made under the Act for processing '''sensitive personal information'''. This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health condition, sex life, criminal proceedings or convictions.


For personal information to be considered fairly processed, at least one of several extra conditions must be met.  These include:


*	Having the explicit consent of the individual
*	Being required by law to process the information for employment purposes
*	Needing to process the information in order to protect the vital interests of the individual or another person
*	Dealing with the administration of justice or legal proceedings

 

==== Rights under the Act ====



There are seven rights under the Data Protection Act.


*1.	'''The right to subject access:''' This allows people to find out what information is held about them on computer and within some manual records.

*2.	'''The right to prevent processing:''' Anyone can ask a data controller not to process information relating to him or her that causes substantial unwarranted damage or distress to them or anyone else.

*3.	'''The right to prevent processing for direct marketing:''' Anyone can ask a data controller not to process information relating to him or her for direct marketing purposes.

*4.	'''Rights in relation to automated decision-taking:''' Individuals have a right to object to decisions made only by automatic means e.g. there is no human involvement.

*5.	'''The right to compensation:''' An individual can claim compensation from a data controller for damage and distress caused by any breach of the act. Compensation for distress alone can only be claimed in limited circumstances.

*6.	'''The right to rectification, blocking, erasure and destruction:''' Individuals can apply to the court to order a data controller to rectify, block or destroy personal details if they are inaccurate or contain expressions of opinion based on inaccurate information.

*7.	'''The right to ask the Commissioner to assess whether the Act has been contravened:''' If someone believes their personal information has not been processed in accordance with the DPA, they can ask the Commissioner to make an assessment. If the Act is found to have been breached and the matter cannot be settled informally, then an enforcement notice may be served on the data controller in question.

==== Criminal offences created by the Act ====


A number of '''criminal offences''' are created by the Act and include:


'''Notification offences:''' This is where processing is being undertaken by a data controller who has not notified the Commissioner either of the processing being undertaken or of any changes that have been made to that processing.


'''Procuring and selling offences:''' It is an offence to knowingly or recklessly obtain, disclose or procure the disclosure of personal information without the consent of the data controller.  There are some exceptions to this – for example, where such obtaining or disclosure was necessary for crime prevention/detection.  If a person has obtained personal information illegally it is an offence to offer or to sell personal information.

 

==== Unsolicited electronic communications ====


The '''Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003''' cover, amongst other things, unsolicited electronic marketing communications.


*'''Unsolicited marketing calls''' should not be made to individual subscribers who have opted out either directly or by registering with the central stoplist, the '''Telephone Preference Service''' (TPS), or to corporate subscribers (e.g. companies) who have objected either directly or by registering on the Corporate TPS.


*'''Unsolicited marketing faxes''' should not be sent to individuals without their prior consent or to any subscriber who has objected, either directly or by registering on the Fax Preference Service (FPS).


*'''Unsolicited marketing emails or SMS''' should not be sent to any individual subscriber who has not consented unless the email address or phone number was collected in the context of a commercial relationship.


*'''Wholly automated marketing calls''', i.e. where a recorded message is played and the recipient does not speak to a human being, can only be made where the subscriber concerned (whether individual or corporate) has consented.


==== The role of the Information Commissioner’s Office ====


The ICO has specific responsibilities for the promotion and enforcement of the DPA.
Under the Data Protection Act, the Information Commissioner may:


*	serve information notices requiring data controllers to supply him with the information he needs to assess compliance.

*	where there has been a breach, serve an enforcement notice (which requires data controllers to take specified steps or to stop taking steps in order to comply with the law). Appeals to these notices may be made to the Information Tribunal.


==== Other Useful DPA websites ====


There are several websites which give more details and explanations.  We have listed some below:


*The '''Data Protection Act''' itself can be found at: http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980029.htm 


*The website of the '''Information Commissioner''' is at: http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/ 


*The website of the '''Scottish Information Commissioner''' is at: http://www.itspublicknowledge.info 


Useful information on this topic can also be found on the CILIP website.

'''ACTIVITY 3.1''' 	

Search the CILIP website at: http://www.cilip.org.uk  for ‘data protection act’. Make a note of any aspects of data protection which are particularly relevant to your own work.

----


Another aspect of data protection is that related to '''Government initiatives''' on privacy and data sharing led by the Ministry of Justice, which aim to increase the data which can be shared by public bodies.  You can find information on the website of the Ministry of Justice at: http://www.justice.gov.uk/information-access-rights/

=== Copyright legislation ===


Copyright legislation is UK-wide and a number of Statutory Instruments have been put in place to ensure that '''European Copyright Directives''' are enacted in the UK. The key Act is the '''Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988''' which determines what is illegal and what is permissible. '


The purpose of copyright is to ensure that the creator (person who holds the intellectual property right) or owner of the copyright can:


*	derive any financial benefit relating to their material  

*	have control over the way in which their material is used. 


Regular revisions of copyright legislation take place so information professionals must keep their knowledge up to date. 


Copyright law is very complex but it is important that you have a sound knowledge of what is permissible and the role of library staff in enforcing copyright.


The '''Intellectual Property Office''' website at: http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ has a good summary of copyright issues. The information on the following pages is extracted from there and summarises the principal points.

 
==== Ownership and duration of copyright ====


The author is the first owner of copyright in a '''literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work'''. In the case of films, the principal director and the film producer are joint authors and first owners of copyright. The main exception is where a work or film is made in the '''course of employment''', in which case the employer owns the copyright. The copyright in sound recordings, broadcasts and published editions generally belongs to the record producer, broadcaster or publisher.


Copyright protection in the UK is '''automatic''' and there is '''no registration system''' - so there are no forms to fill in and no fees to pay.


Copyright is a form of '''intellectual property''' and, like physical property, can be '''bought and sold, inherited''' or '''otherwise transferred'''. A transfer of ownership may cover all or only some of the rights to which a copyright owner is entitled. First or subsequent copyright owners can choose to '''license''' others to use their works whilst retaining ownership themselves.


Copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work (including a photograph) lasts until '''70 years after the death of the author'''. The duration of copyright in a film is 70 years after the death of the last to survive of the principal director, the authors of the screenplay and dialogue, and the composer of any music specially created for the film. '''Sound recordings''' are generally protected for '''50 years from the year of publication. Broadcasts''' are protected for '''50 years and published editions''' are protected for '''25 years'''.


The following are useful websites providing information on copyright:


*'''Intellectual Property Office'''		http://www.ipo.gov.uk/
*'''Copyright Licensing Agency'''	http://www.cla.co.uk/
*'''Copyright, Designs and  Patents Act 1988'''	http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm

==== Copyright and the Internet ====


With the proliferation of electronic communications via the Internet, there has been a massive opportunity created for the '''infringement''' of copyright.  


The Internet provides text and illustrations in electronic format, making it easy for the unscrupulous user to '''cut and paste''' web material into their own documents. You will already be familiar with copyright law restrictions on copying material from books and journals. Similar provisions apply to material from the Internet. It is important to make clients aware that they should check the legality of making multiple copies of textual material from Internet sites.


The greatest areas of commercial concern have been copyright infringements involving '''music files''' and '''still and moving images'''.  It is clear to see that a digital file can be very easily and at virtually no cost copied and distributed anywhere in the World via the Internet.  The creator of the original work is excluded from the process and thus receives no financial reward.  Not surprisingly the media companies have been in the vanguard of creating means of prevention.
A number of '''defensive methods''' have been created to counter copyright infringement in the digital domain.

 

==== Digital Rights Management (DRM) ====


This is a large area but the greatest and most visible use is (and will be even more so in the future) the '''prevention of copying of films''' (movies) from DVDs.  This requires mechanisms to be active in one or both of the DVD disk itself and the DVD player or computer used.  Examples are:


*	the need to keep a Satellite Television receiver box connected to the public telephone network
*	certain high definition film disks can only be played back on a computer which is connected to the Internet
*	the very latest large screen television displays will need a special module to display the coming high definition DVD films.  Absence of the module disables the output from the DVD player.  The existence of the module guarantees that the incoming digital signal is not being copied.
*	the regional coding of DVDs which does not allow a DVD disk purchased in the USA to be played on a European region DVD player.


You can find additional information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management
and at: http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-other/c-protect.htm

==== Digital watermarking ====


This is a computer encryption which is inserted into the image. It is of particular use with images which are placed on websites and thus easily copied.  It is invisible to the casual user but provides a '''tracking mechanism''' for owners. It is a digital code, which can be unique to the image or shared across the owner’s other images. You can find additional information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking and http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/digital_watermark.html

'''Digital fingerprints''' are unique labels inserted into different copies of the same content (e.g.: an e-book, video or music file) prior to distribution. Each digital fingerprint is assigned to a specific recipient, and thus provides the capability to trace the culprits who use their content for unintended purposes. Fingerprints should be closely associated with the content and difficult to remove.

=== Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) ===


The growth of Internet use and ease with which files and ideas can be transferred across continents has led to tighter regulation of and concern for '''intellectual property rights'''. Intellectual property refers to the rights of the thought process and intellectual creativity which developed the work. Information professionals should be aware of the Intellectual Property Rights issues. You should be aware that intellectual property is the '''legally enforceable''' right of the owner.


Most countries have laws regulating the copying of inventions, identifying symbols and creative expressions. The UK laws cover four main types of intangible property: '''patents, trademarks, copyrights''' and '''trade secrets''', referred to collectively as “intellectual property.” 


Intellectual property has many of the same characteristics as tangible property. It is an asset which can be bought, sold, licensed, exchanged or given away. The intellectual property owner has the right to prevent unauthorised '''use''' or '''sale''' of the property. 


Clients should be aware that they should not use library computers (or any others) to do anything which infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights, e.g.: by copying content from someone else’s website into their own document, or illegally copying music files.


You can find lots of additional information at The Intellectual Property Office http://www.ipo.gov.uk/

== Freedom of Information legislation and information access issues ==


=== Freedom of Information legislation ===


Freedom of Information legislation was introduced across the United Kingdom at the beginning of 2005. The Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation is different for '''Scotland''' from that in the rest of the UK, but the information given here is generally applicable throughout the UK. However you should always check the precise details against the relevant website for your own country. 


You can find a comprehensive description of the act and its implications at the website of the Information Commissioner at: http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/freedom_of_information and for Scotland at the websites of the Scottish Information Commissioner at: www.itspublicknowledge.info 


The FOI legislation provides a right of access to the information of public bodies by individuals. Information can be in print, electronic, video or audio format. 


Working in a library you need to be aware of the procedures so that you can assist a client to make an information request on the basis of FOI legislation.  You should also be aware of the position regarding your own local authority and its requirements to disclose information.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''
 	
A client approaches you with a request involving the FOI legislation.  He wishes to find out how much money is spent by the local authority on traffic calming measures.Go to the website appropriate to your geographical location and make notes on the process of requesting information which will be useful for clients in the future.

----


 

==== Freedom of Information Act ====


The following details on the FOI legislation is based on information from the '''Information Commissioner’s''' website:


The '''Freedom of Information Act''' enables people to gain access to information held by public authorities in two ways:


'''Publication Schemes'''

Every public authority must make some information available as a matter routine through a '''publication scheme'''. Information that is included in such a scheme must be made available to the public. A publication scheme is both a public commitment to make certain information available and a guide to how that information can be obtained. 


'''General right of access'''

Any person has the right to make a request for '''information held by a public authority'''. The authority must usually respond to this request within 20 working days. This right came into force on the 1 January 2005.


'''Exemptions'''

The Act recognises that there are grounds for '''withholding information''' and provides a number of '''exemptions''' from the right to know, some of which are subject to a public interest test. The Act also sets out procedures for dealing with requests, such as '''time limits''' for compliance and '''fees''' that must be charged.


'''Making complaints'''

The Information Commissioner is the '''independent regulator''' of the Act, with responsibilities to promote the legislation and enforce compliance with its provisions. This includes making decisions as to whether a public authority has dealt with requests properly.

=== Acceptable Use Policies ===


For legal reasons each library must have an '''Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)''' covering client access to ICT equipment and the Internet. Each authority will have an individual AUP policy reflecting the local circumstances. Each client using the library facilities is required to indicate acceptance of the policy. It is important that the AUP is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it complies with current legislation. 


The AUP must state that Internet access is monitored using '''manual and electronic resources''' and that '''records of Internet access''' are kept. The AUP should also specify the actions and '''penalties''' which could result from contravention of the AUP. This includes providing the police with information where it is suspected that a criminal act has taken place.



If you select the People's Network Internet Acceptable Use Toolkit  there are several examples of local authority AUPs.

----

'''ACTIVITY 4.3''' 	

Obtain a copy of the AUP for your own library.  Read it over and make a set of notes to enable you to explain the various points to a client new to the library computer facilities.

----

=== Content filtering ===


Internet filtering systems used in libraries are designed to '''prevent clients accessing unsuitable material'''. When the filtering system is turned on, users cannot open or link to web sites that the filtering system recognises as unsuitable. 


The filtering system is a software package which can be installed on a PC or a server (to regulate multiple machines).  The software can use one or both of two principles. 

 
*1.	When a site is requested, it will check the URL of the site against a list of '''proscribed sites'''.  If the site is on the list, the software will block access.  The list is updated at periodic intervals by the software supplier.

*2.	When a site is requested, the software will check over the site and attempt to recognise '''key words''' which would indicate an unsuitable site and then block access. 


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of a disadvantage for each of the above methods.

----



==== Approaches to content filtering ====


Although a useful tool, Internet filtering systems are not foolproof.


The first method depends on the list of proscribed sites being complete.  It would be impossibly expensive for every website on the Internet to be rated using a human observer.  There will also be a '''delay''' in a new unsuitable site appearing and being added to the list.


The second method suffers from the difficulty of '''placing keywords into context'''.  An example being, it has difficulty in distinguishing between the names of body parts used in a pornographical or medical context. Another example is that access may be blocked to sites containing innocuous words, one component of which may be of a sexual or profane nature e.g. Essex (though more complex filters are now sometimes able to recognise such cases).  Also, this method checks only for unaccepatble text, not unacceptable images or speech.


Any blocking system can be potentially over-ridden by users with technical knowledge, or by using one of the many proxy sites which allow you to circumnavigate blocks by browsing through a proxy server.



reporting websites is another way of controlling what is available, see http://www.iwf.org.uk/

==== The Family Online Safety Institute (formerly The Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA)) ====


FOSI provide a set of categories and levels within each category:


*	The presence or absence of nudity 
*	The presence or absence of sexual content 
*	The depiction of violence 
*	The language used 
*	The presence or absence of user-generated content and whether this is moderated 
*	The depiction of other potentially harmful content such as gambling, drugs and alcohol


The user’s browser has to be configured to use the system. Clearly there are obvious weaknesses here in that website developers are not required to use the ratings, and they may be misused.  However, similar to the '''age ratings' associated with films and computer games, this may in the long run be the best possibility for filtering.


Since there are weaknesses in each approach, filtering can not replace vigilance or simple common sense from library staff. 


For more information visit http://www.fosi.org/icra/

'''ACTIVITY 4.4'''
 
Find out the filtering policies in place in your local authority and what your own responsibility is. 

----

==== Walled Gardens ====


The walled garden approach is often used for young clients. Here, instead of trying to block access to possible unsuitable sites and allowing access to all other sites, the “walled garden” only offers access to '''pre-selected websites'''. This is a much simpler approach.  Instead of trying to cope with rating or searching through the 25,270,000,000 websites catalogued by Google today, a small number of hand picked sites are allowed to be browsed.  Of course the quality of this service relies upon the nature of the vetting before access is allowed.


The disadvantage is of course the '''exclusion of many potentially useful''' sites.  There have also been issues with e-mail and search engines allowing a hole to be made in the wall.


Social networking websites, such as http://www.facebook.com and http://www.flickr.com, can also be regarded as walled gardens. This is because the owner can control the range of people who view their messages and updates. Another aspect of walled gardens is the barriers which prevent the free flow of information and this is also true of social networking sites with their custom language and proprietary nature. This means that information can’t be transferred or access from one platform to another.

==== Suppliers of filtering software ====


The following sites are suppliers of '''filtering software''', mainly aimed at young clients, which also provide lots of useful information on internet safety:


*'''SafeSurf'''	http://www.safesurf.com
*'''CyberPatrol'''	http://www.cyberpatrol.com
*'''NetNanny'''	http://www.netnanny.com


Trial versions of several of these can be downloaded from the relevant website.

'''ACTIVITY 4.5''' 
 	
Download an evaluation copy of CyberPatrol and try it out.

----

=== Internet safety with younger clients ===


Clearly the previous section covering content filtering is particularly applicable to young clients.  It may be appropriate to '''reserve particular machines''' for particular user groups with regard to the type of material which may be accessed.  This can also be managed by user ID login procedures.  

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.7''' 

Find out what is the situation in your own library with regard to the reserving of particular PC’s for restricted access to Internet materials.

Undoubtedly, the younger clients will have the most restricted access. There are serious risks to younger clients with the possibility of someone being hurt, exploited or abused as a result of personal information being posted online or falling victim to “grooming” (covered in Outcome One of this unit).

There are many useful websites which promote safe use of the Internet to younger clients, their parents and teachers.  Here are three we would recommend you look at:

*'''ClickThinking'''	at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/09154928/1  
*'''Kidsmart''' at http://www.kidsmart.org.uk/ 
*'''UK Government  Internet Safety Advice''' at https://www.gov.uk/search?q=internet+safety
*'''DirectGov  Internet Safety''' at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Yourchildshealthandsafety/Internetsafety/index.htm
----



==== Illegal material ====


Much material exists on the Internet which it is a criminal offence to access. The catchphrase is ‘If it is illegal off-line - it is illegal on-line’. Three types of Internet content are generally regarded as illegal in the UK:


*	images of child abuse hosted anywhere in the world 
*	criminally obscene images hosted in the UK  
*	criminally racist content hosted in the UK


Even though '''filtering''' and '''acceptable use policies''' are in place in local authorities, breaches can very easily happen. It is important that you are aware of the local procedures for dealing with such situations.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.8''' 

Here are two scenarios involving a client accessing illegal materials. Consult your library service’s Acceptable Use Policy and/or staff manual and make notes of what action you would take in each case.

1. An adult client is observed systematically accessing criminally racist content on a public access PC.

2. An adult client accidentally accesses images of child abuse whilst carrying out a genuine information search on another topic.

== Define the detail of a complex enquiry in conjunction with the client ==



=== Reference interview techniques for complex enquiries ===



In this outcome we will explore how you should tease out the details of a complex enquiry posed by a library client.  We define a complex enquiry as one where:


*	the sources to be searched for information are '''not obvious''' at the outset of the inquiry
*	the precise nature of the topic requires to be '''teased''' out in some detail with the client
*	a minimum of 3 '''variables''' are linked in a Boolean search.


From this we can see that the typical client for such complex enquiries is likely (but not always) to be a person with some '''knowledge or expertise''' in the subject area.  Where this is so, you should capitalise on this at the initial stage and gain as much specific information as possible from the client.


 
==== Defining the nature of the enquiry ====


Defining the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client is often referred to as the '''reference interview'''.  However, you may not be able to carry this out face to face.  Instead you may carry out the interview over the telephone.  Whether communicating face-to-face or by phone, do remember that the reference interview is a '''two-way interaction''' or dialogue and you must take responsibility for the efficiency of the communication process.


You may use e-mails as part of the process, but we would recommend that, with complex enquiries, the bulk of the reference interview is oral.  With a detailed and complex enquiry, you would find it difficult to gather from the client the level of detail which you require from the client through e-mails alone.


By the end of the reference interview you should be confident that the nature of the complex enquiry has been '''fully explored''' and that the information required by the client has been specifically defined.


The reference interview also provides the opportunity to '''establish any special needs''' of the client e.g.: visual or auditory impairment.  This requires a '''tactful''' and '''sympathetic''' approach. You may need to ask for '''assistance''' from a colleague with specialist knowledge on disability issues.


And finally, do remember to record '''contact details''' for the client.  In the excitement of exploring the enquiry and establishing the client’s precise needs, it is all too easy to forget this important information.  So check at the end of every reference interview that you have a record of the client’s name, address, telephone, fax and e-mail details, as appropriate.  If you will be phoning the client, it is also polite to note '''when''' it is convenient for the client to receive your call.

 

==== Communication skills ====


Good communication skills are key to the reference interview.  This unit outcome provides a good opportunity for '''practising''' and '''refining''' your communication skills. These include: 


*	Appropriate spoken language
*	Appropriate body language
*	Good feedback, especially on the telephone
*	Note taking 
*	Clear and grammatical e-mails 


We will briefly examine each of these.


==== Spoken language ====


You should use language which is '''appropriate to the client''', avoiding talking down to the client or, at the other extreme, baffling the client with '''specialist jargon'''.  If you do have to use a term which the client may not understand, e.g. “search engine syntax”, be sure to explain it.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Explain Dark Internet


Conversely a client with expertise in the field they are enquiring about is likely to use '''specialist or technical vocabulary''' when describing the search topic.  Such vocabulary can be useful for you when you are deciding on your search terms (see Outcomes 2 and 3) but make sure that you fully understand the meaning of any such specialist terms.  The client should be able to explain them to you.


 
==== Body language ====


In face-to-face situations, use appropriate body language designed to set the client at ease and promote effective communication.  Smile and greet the client by name if possible.  Lean forward slightly and use eye contact to show your interest in the conversation.  Try to carry out the interview in a place where both you and the client are sitting comfortably and at the same level, preferably side by side.

 

==== Feedback  ====


You should use appropriate '''feedback techniques''' to ensure understanding of the client’s responses. For instance, you might:


*	'''Rephrase''' what the client has said and repeat this back to them
*	Read out a '''summary''' of the enquiry based on the notes you have made.


With telephone communications you will have to be careful in order to make sure that you fully understand what the client says because you will get no clues from their '''body language'''.  See if you can pick up clues from the tone of the client’s voice.  Conversely, make sure that your tone is positive and encouraging.  Smiling as you speak into the phone generates a '''pleasant tone of voice''' which encourages helpful responses.



==== Note taking ====


In both face to face and telephone interactions, it is essential to take '''written notes''' of the main points of the conversation.  These notes are your reference for checking that you have fully understood the details of the client’s enquiry.  Full notes are also useful if you have to put the query on one side for actioning later or pass it on to a colleague to deal with.  The more complex the enquiry, the more comprehensive your notes should be.

 

==== Writing e-mails ====


If you are using e-mails to communicate with the client, it is important to establish a '''cordial tone''' while remaining concise and to the point.  Writing '''clearly and grammatically''' is key to this, as is structuring your e-mail well so that the client can follow it easily and respond appropriately.  Saving e-mails, both those you send and those you receive, provides a record of your communication with the client.

 

==== Open and Closed Questions ====


In the reference interview, you will use both '''open''' and '''closed''' questions.  These have different uses.  It is important to be able to distinguish between the two types of question and to use them appropriately.


Closed questions prompt yes/no or '''short factual answers''', such as:


*Q. What is the deadline for my getting this information for you? 
*A. Next Tuesday


*Q. Have you checked this reference already? 
*A. Yes


Open questions encourage '''longer answers''', such as:


*Q. Can you explain briefly what my colleague did last time? 
*A. She started with Yahoo and then tried a couple of other search engines as well.  I think she was looking it up under something like pagan religions in Wales.  We got quite a lot of useful stuff.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, explain at what points during the reference interview and for what purposes you are likely to use:

*a) closed questions
*b) open questions.

----

==== Using open and closed questions ====


Closed questions prompting yes/no or short factual answers are mainly used in the reference interview context to:


*	elicit '''specific pieces of information''' from the client  
*	gain '''confirmation''' that your understanding of what the client has said is correct - an important feedback tool.


You are likely to use closed questions 


*	at the '''start of the interview''' when you are taking basic personal details of the client
*	at intervals '''throughout the discussion''' when you want to check you have your facts right
*	at the '''end of the interview''' to sum up and agree on future action.


Open questions encourage longer answers and their main uses in the reference interview context are to:


*	establish '''rapport''' with the client, especially in the initial stages of the interview and with clients who are not already known to you
*	set the scene for the enquiry and gain '''background information''' at the beginning of the discussion
*	encourage '''input''' from the client as the interview progresses. 


So you will use both open and closed questions at appropriate times.  When framing a question, always think of the type of response you hope to generate and word the question so as to encourage either a '''brief''' or an '''extended''' answer.

 

=== Eliciting information and advice from knowledgeable clients ====


The interview is likely to begin with the client asking you a question.  Your task is to probe further until you are fully satisfied that you are clear '''exactly what the client wishes to find out'''.  Remember to ask for clarification from the client about the topic e.g. ask them to spell uncommon words, expand on the topic under investigation etc.  This is particularly important with clients who may be subject experts.


While recognising that some clients may be unwilling to give this information, it is helpful if you can establish in some detail the '''reasons''' why the client wishes the information requested. One important point to establish is whether they require the information for themselves or whether they are enquiring on behalf of someone else.

 


==== Determining the starting point  ====


It is important to ascertain the “starting point” of the enquiry in order to avoid wasting time on finding information which the client already knows.  This is particularly important with '''complex enquiries''' for knowledgeable clients, where it may be relatively easy to access information at a simple level, when the client actually requires more sophisticated results.


In a complex enquiry from a specialist enquirer, it is likely that the enquirer has already undertaken some basic searching on their own behalf.  Equally a well-informed enquirer may well be familiar with some or all of the '''sources of information''' in their field.  You should therefore try to determine what research the client has already undertaken on the topic and what results were obtained.  It is often helpful to ask the client’s opinion on the usefulness or otherwise of particular sources. 


A knowledgeable client may also be able to give you some guidance on successful and unsuccessful information searching approaches.  However, do not make the assumption that, because the client is knowledgeable about the topic to be investigated, they are well informed about information sources and search techniques.  Remember that you are the '''information-searching specialist''' (while the client is the subject specialist) and so you should critically evaluate any advice on sources and information searching techniques provided by the client.

=== Determining the nature of detailed information to be provided ===


Apart from the actual topic of investigation, there are other factors which need to be taken into account before a member of library staff will embark on the information search, e.g.: the quantity, level and format of the required information.

 

==== Quantity  ====


We tend to think that our problem in information searching will be an inability to find '''enough information'''.  This can indeed sometimes be the case.  But using the Internet often results in the reverse situation – an overabundance of results.  Providing too much information is just as unhelpful as providing too little.  You must clarify the scale of information required by the client in order to fully satisfy their needs.  


If the search produces a large amount of information, you should determine whether the client wishes you to undertake any '''filtering''' on their behalf before presenting the information or whether they wish to see the full search results.  If filtering is requested, you must establish with the client the criteria which are to be applied.  Conversely, if the search results are meagre, you should seek guidance from the client as to the possibility of broadening out the search.

 

==== Level ====


It is essential that the information provided is at a '''level of complexity''' which enables the client’s full comprehension but does not patronise the client or tell them what they already know.  


The following points give you some guidance as to the likely level of complexity of information required:


*	the client’s age (But remember age does not automatically bring wisdom! Remember too that some young people can display astonishing knowledge and expertise in subjects which interest them.)
*	the client’s educational attainment
*	the client’s display of specialist knowledge
*	the client’s linguistic ability


Tactful questioning can be used to make an estimation of the points listed above.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, outline a situation where you know all of the above but this knowledge does not tell you the level of complexity of information required.

----
 


==== Other factors affecting level ====


The most obvious example is where the client is making the enquiry on behalf of someone else. Typical examples would include:


*	a '''teacher or lecturer''' looking for material which could be used by school or college students
*	'''parents''' seeking information for use by their child
*	a '''specialist''' in one field who is a beginner in another e.g.: a consultant surgeon investigating horticulture
*	a '''therapist or social worker''' searching for information for one of their clients


Linguistic ability can be misleading.  An overseas visitor with a limited grasp of English or someone with a speech impediment may have '''extensive knowledge''' of the topic under investigation.


You have probably thought of other similar examples.

 

==== Format ====


The results may include information in various formats. There are many formats available, including several as a result of the introduction of ICT.  


*	Your search may direct the client to items of library stock, to be used in the library or borrowed for home use.  This could include:

**	Printed reference sources or information CD-ROMs
**	Books, audio or video material for home borrowing
**	Magazines and journals
**	Pamphlets or leaflets


*	The search results may be bibliographies or lists of website references for the client to follow up.
*	The results may be viewed on screen by client, in the form of text, audio or video.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
If the client wishes to view the results on screen on a computer outside the library, what must you ascertain before directing the client to websites with audio or video content?

----

 

==== Other factors affecting format ====


It will be important to check the '''specification of the client’s computer''' in order to be sure that it will support audio or video applications.  Another point to ask about is whether the client had a broadband connection.  Downloading photographs, movies or sound on a dial-up connection can take considerable lengths of time (It may not even be possible with dial-up technology.) and is costly in terms of telephone charges.


If the search is not carried out with the client present, you must ascertain if the client can '''visit the library''' at a later time to access the search results or if the information must be in a format which can be e-mailed or posted to the client.


Difficulties may arise if the client has expressed an initial preference for a format in which the information is not actually available.  If the information is only available in a '''limited number of formats''', you must alert the client to this and ascertain if any of these formats are acceptable.

=== Constraints ===


There may be a number of constrains on the material required. These include:  


*	deadlines for completion

*	currency of information 

*	language

*	special needs


 
==== Deadlines for completion ====


It is important for you to gauge the '''urgency''' of the enquiry.  This can range from enquiries where information is required immediately through to those where the results may be presented after some time has elapsed.  You should agree with the client on the deadline for completion of the enquiry and also on the action to be taken should this deadline fail to be met for any reason.


If you cannot meet the deadline for completion of the enquiry, clearly it is important to explain to the client the '''reasons''' for this.  Perhaps the enquiry has turned out to be much more complex than was originally envisaged. A specialist member of staff who would normally have handled the enquiry may be absent through sickness. Technical problems resulting in Internet access being temporarily unavailable can also throw your enquiry off schedule. 

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
You have explained to the client the reasons for not meeting the deadline.  What else should you discuss with the client?

----

 

==== Difficulties in meeting deadlines ====


Although the client may well feel more accepting of the situation if you explain the reasons for your failure to meet the agreed deadline, to some extent this is water under the bridge.   More important to the client is the action you propose to take in order to '''rectify''' the situation. With this in mind you should raise the issue with the client at the earliest possible stage i.e. as soon as you realise that it is unlikely that the original deadline will be achieved.  This gets the client on side and enables you and the client to jointly work out how to make the best of the situation.  It could be that it is possible to complete part of the enquiry within the deadline, in which case you must agree with the client which aspects should be prioritised.  Or perhaps you could arrange for some or all of the information to be provided by another organisation. 


The key to '''client satisfaction''' is to prevent such a situation happening.  Be realistic when agreeing deadlines with the client.  If you are unsure of how long the enquiry will take, say so.  It is better to overestimate than underestimate the time required.  That way the client gets a pleasant surprise when the search results are ready earlier than promised.


 
==== Currency of information  ====



In your search you will be dealing with two kinds of information:

*	'''Dynamic information''' changes frequently (e.g.: current information on news, weather, government policy, share prices) and it is important for you to locate the most up-to-date data or, in a historical enquiry, the information as it was at the time being investigated.

*	'''Static information''' is always the same (e.g.: historical dates, chemical formulae). 


You must also ensure that the client is aware of the need to use '''recently updated sources''' for dynamic information and the implications which this may have in terms of the timescale and cost of the search.  Updating websites to take account of constantly changing information is costly and it may be that there is a charge or a subscription cost to accessing such sites.  This is especially true of sites giving financial and performance information about commercial companies or research results.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Static and dynamic information

 

==== Language ====


Some information may only be available in languages other than English.  You should be certain of the client’s '''fluency''' in these languages before embarking on the search. 


Some websites have a facility which permits you to '''choose the language'''.  This is usually very simple to do.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1'''

Go to http://www.easyjet.com/en/book/index.asp and view the site in Italian.Look at http://www.artis.nl/ and change the site from Dutch to English.

----


Some search engines permit you to specify the language of the websites.  Some also have a '''translation facility''' from a foreign language into English and from English into a foreign language.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2'''

Try this out in Google. Go to http://www.google.co.uk/ and click the “Search the web” option, then click on “language tools”.Search for websites about '''“días de fiesta”''' (this means holidays) which are written in Spanish and located in Mexico.Choose some Spanish text from one of these websites, copy and paste it into the Translate Box and ask Google to translate it into English for you.

----

 

==== Special needs ====


The reference interview provides the opportunity to establish any special needs of the client.
Some of the most common examples are:


'''Learning difficulty'''

For clients with learning difficulties you might have to look for material of a simpler nature, perhaps with more visual or audio content


'''English as a second language'''

These clients may prefer material which is not in English.  This might mean having the enquirer at your side while you carry out the search so that they can provide assistance with vocabulary.  Alternatively, you may be able to pass the enquiry over to a colleague with language skills. (See earlier guidance on language)


'''Physical impairment'''

Any material found must be accessible to the client e.g.: websites must be accessible to a visually impaired client. (See Outcome 4 for more details of this.)


If you wish to find out more about the skills and knowledge required for this outcome, the following website may prove helpful.


*http://www.hals.lib.tx.us/ref123/2interview.htm

== Demonstrate knowledge of search logic, search engines and features of the Internet ==


=== Introduction ===


This outcome looks at a number of aspects relating to web searches, including the following:


*	Boolean logic
*	Truncation and wildcards
*	Non-obvious search terms
*	Grammar of the Internet
*	Search engine operation
*	Search terms
*	How ranking works
*	Ownership of the web
*	Dark internet and invisible web



==== Boolean logic ====


Boolean operators are used to '''combine search terms''' in order to make the search results more specific. 

----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you name the three Boolean operators?

----

 

==== The Boolean operators ====


There are three Boolean operators -  '''AND, NOT''' and '''OR'''.  We will explore how each of these is used.


'''AND''' is used to link search terms. 


Entering an expression such as '''beans AND toast''' means that results will be returned only where both words appear. Using the '''AND''' operator narrows your search and gives a smaller number of results.


'''OR''' is used to indicate that any of the terms may be present.


Entering an expression such as '''punk OR hair''' means that results with either one or the other (or possibly both) will be returned. Using the '''OR''' operator widens your search and gives a larger number of results.


The '''OR''' operator is particularly useful where a topic might involve synonyms or near synonyms.  A search for '''illness AND felines OR cats''' will be more wide ranging than '''illness AND cats'''.


'''NOT''' is used to exclude terms.


Entering an expression such as '''pop music NOT beatles''' might be devised to return results about pop music but excluding results about the Beatles. Using the '''NOT''' operator narrows your search and gives a smaller number of results.


The '''NOT''' operator is particularly useful when one of your search terms had more than one meaning.  '''Telegraph''' might refer to electronic communication methods but it is also a common name for newspapers.  A search for '''telegraph development NOT newspaper''' will eliminate press information.


In fact the expressions are pretty close to what you would say in natural speech:


*I am looking for references to both beans '''AND''' toast.
*I am looking for sites on either punk '''OR''' hair
*I am looking for information on pop music but '''NOT''' including the Beatles.


Sometimes this is easier to understand in diagrams, so let's have a look at Logic diagrams …
 


==== Logic diagrams: the AND operator ====


Imagine that we have a number of websites which give information about children’s clothes.  Some of these have information only on girls’ clothes, some have information only on boys’ clothes and some have information on both boys’ and girls’ clothes.  In the diagrams the left hand circle represents all records including the word '''girls''' and the right hand circle represents all the records including the word '''boys'''


'''AND'''
[[Image:Venn-and.svg|left]]
 






'''girls AND boys'''

The shaded area represents the records which have information on both girls’ clothing and boys’ clothing.

==== Logic Diagrams: the OR operator ====


'''OR'''
[[Image:Venn-or.svg|left]]
 






'''girls OR boys'''

The shaded area represents the records which have information on only girls’ clothing, only boys’ clothing or on clothing for both boys and girls.

==== Logic Diagrams: the NOT operator ====


'''NOT'''
[[Image:Venn-not.svg|left]] 






'''girls NOT boys'''

The NOT operator excludes all records with information on boys’ clothing, and the shaded area represents the records which have with information about girls’ clothing only.

==== Using multiple Boolean operators ====


It is possible to use multiple Boolean operators.  For example, '''security AND internet AND banking ''' narrows down a search on Internet security issues to records which relate only to bank security on the Internet.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Boolean Search

QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Boolean Search 2


You can see how the use of Boolean operators allows a very precise search statement to be constructed.  This should produce a smaller number but a better focused set of hits from a search engine.


Boolean search logic underlies the operation of all search engines but the various search engines have different systems of entering a Boolean expression.  Some allow straightforward search statements using capital letters for '''AND, OR''' and '''NOT'''.  However many do not explicitly allow this, the much used Google being one of them.

 

==== Constructing precise Boolean searches ====


It is important to consult the search engine help pages to understand how you can create a precise Boolean search.


There are three approaches:


*1.	Boolean expressions can be '''entered directly''' into the search box.


We have already covered this. Altavista (http://www.altavista.com/) is a search engine which permits this.


*2.	The search engine '''makes assumptions''' about what you mean when you enter search terms.

*3.	There is an Advanced search facility.

 

==== Search engine assumptions  ====


If the search engine makes certain assumptions about what you mean when you enter search terms in a particular way. You must understand the implications of these assumptions.


Basically when you enter more than one term in the search box, the search engine turns this into a Boolean search. The two possibilities are that the engine defaults to an AND or an OR.  


Most of the common search engines default to AND.  So putting in '''carriage clock''' should return results with both words included.  Of course the words may appear in any order and not necessarily next to one another. 

 
Google allows the use of a minus sign (-) to use the NOT operator.  Thus to create the Boolean search expression '''sixties pop NOT beatles''', you would enter '''sixties pop –beatles''' (Note: You must not leave a space between the minus and the search term which you wish to exclude.)


Google assumes that some common words and numbers are never included in the search.  Thus if such a word is particularly required, it must be prefaced by a plus (+) sign.  This is essentially the Boolean '''AND''' operator. 


Using + and – in this way is not as predictable as you might expect in many search situations.  We recommend that they should be used only when there is no alternative.  You can find out more here http://www.google.co.uk/help/basics.html 



==== Advanced search facility ====


Many search engines have an advanced search facility.  This allows many refinements, such as specifying the language, format and age of the sites returned.  Most advanced search facilities however have a set of choices which allow a Boolean search to be created.  

----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, take a look at the advanced search facility on Yahoo:  http://search.yahoo.com/search/options?fr=fp-top&amp;p  

What expressions are used instead of the Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT?

----

==== Advanced searching on Yahoo ====


Yahoo uses


''With all of the words = AND''


''With at least one of the words = OR''


''Without the words = NOT''


By placing search terms in one or more of these categories, you can set up most Boolean statements you will need in your searching.


Note that it is not only search engines which provide these advanced search facilities. They may also be found within a site.  The Houses of Parliament site is an example:

http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/

==== Other points on Boolean searching ====


A good website covering Boolean searching can be found at: http://searchenginewatch.com/2155991

A final point about the grouping of terms is that if you want to find results which include an exact phrase, most search engines let you do this by placing the phrase in quotes.  e.g. 
'''“knitting for children”'''.  In the advanced search facility, you are offered a box title '''“With the exact phrase”'''.


This is particularly useful when searching for names where the forename and surname may not be kept together and in order by a search engine.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1'''

Try two searches with '''land act''' and '''“land act”''' as search terms. You will see that the first search produces results relating to Acts of Parliament which relate in some way to land e.g. we found one about stopping dog fouling on public land. The second search leads us to the various Land Acts.

----

=== Truncation and wildcards ===


Traditionally on-line database searching allowed the use of truncation of search terms. This used a symbol such as ~ to represent one or more letters at the beginning or end of a word. For example, ~fuse could lead to refuse, defuse or infuse and refus~ could lead to refuse, refuses, refused or refusing.


In Internet searching this symbol would be called a Wildcard. Two types of Wildcard exist, commonly represented by ? and *.


* ?  indicates the replacement of one character 

* * indicates the replacement of any number of characters.


Wildcard symbols can be used in the middle of a word, not just at the beginning and end, e.g.: ''familiari?e'' for ''familiarise'' and familiarize''.


You must keep in mind the pitfalls of over-enthusiastic use of wildcards or truncation. For instance, '''men*''' would encompass both '''men’s''' and '''menstruate''', the latter term being unlikely to be relevant to a search on a male-related topic.


Of course the search engines have their own rules.  Google for instance does not have this feature. It carries out its own version of using extensions of words automatically.  Many search engines use complex algorithms to produce their results which makes the use of wildcards or truncation inappropriate.    


Most sites which permit wildcard searching will indicate in their Help section which symbols are to be used for these. One search engine which does allow this is Exalead at http://www.exalead.com/search/ 
 

==== Non-obvious search terms ====


A non-obvious search term is a term from some area other than the main search subject which may lead to useful information.  This is different from a '''related term''', say using a particular country instead of its continent.  A non-obvious search term comes from some sort of parallel area which is at first sight not clear.


For example, when looking for information about a particular disease, the name of a '''researcher''' in a similar field would be a non-obvious search term.  It is likely that you would have to be guided by the enquirer about the appropriateness of non-obvious search terms because background knowledge of the topic would be needed in order to think of them.


Another means of finding non-obvious search terms is to browse in directories and portals and see what terms appear in associated sites.


You might like to ask your experienced colleagues to give examples of non-obvious search terms which they have used in the past.

=== Grammar of the Internet ===


The official name for what we commonly refer to as a website address is URL.  '''URL''' stands for '''Uniform Resource Locator'''.  Certain conventions apply to the construction of URLs which can give pointers on their usefulness.  (This is also relevant to the validation of website results – see Outcome 4).  Alan November has called this the Grammar of the Internet.
(see http://novemberlearning.com/educational-resources-for-educators/information-literacy-resources/)


'''http''' stands for '''Hyper Text Transfer Protocol'''.  This simply means your browser is looking for a Hyper Text document.  Hyper Text is the basic coding used to construct web pages


'''www''', as we all know, stands for World Wide Web.


The interesting parts are after http and www.  The next part is called the '''domain name'''.  So for instance in http://www.amazon.co.uk the domain name is '''amazon.co.uk''' 


The first part of the domain name may yield useful clues.  Is it a well-known name?  If you come up with a page on the site http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ it has the authority of being on the BBC website.  Is it a ‘personal’ site giving the opinion of only one person?  The name of the person may be explicit in the domain name e.g. http://www.jamieoliver.com/ 


BUT be terribly careful here.  An individual may set up a website to promote their own ideas and then a rival may set up a website with an equally convincing domain name.  Remember anyone can set up a domain name of their choice and load any sort of rubbish onto the website.

 

==== Using WHOIS ====


It is often possible to find the owner/publisher of a website by doing a WHOIS search on the domain name. An easy route to this can be found as a facility on many website providers sites e.g.: http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/whois/index.jhtml 


You can enter the US domain name e.g.: '''un.org''' will yield the United Nations Organisation.
Any site with a similar name attempting to fool users into thinking it is the UNO can be checked out in this way.


The UK site for WHOIS searches is: http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/about-domain-names/domain-lookup-whois/whois-tool

or go to www.nominet.org

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2'''

Use WHOIS to decide which of the following is the official site of Glasgow Celtic football club.

*http://www.celticfc.co.uk 
*http://www.celtic-mad.co.uk/

----

==== URL extensions ====

The final parts of the URL (separated by dots) are called '''extensions'''.  A well-known example, say for Amazon (http://www.amazon.co.uk) is '''.uk''' which indicates that the website has been registered as of UK nationality.  All domain names carry a national identifier as the last extension, except for those registered as being of USA nationality.


Taking Amazon as an example:


*http://www.amazon.com No national identifier signifies the United States

*http://www.amazon.co.uk/  .uk signifies the United Kingdom

*http://www.amazon.de/ .de signifies Germany

*http://www.amazon.fr/ .fr signifies France

*http://www.amazon.co.jp/ .jp signifies Japan


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3'''

There are many websites which list these geographical extensions. One of these ishttp://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm Use this or any other appropriate site to find the geographic extensions for the following countries:Indonesia, India, Netherlands, Latvia, South Africa

----


Let us look further into www.amazon.co.uk   The extension between the company name and the geographical extension describes the type of organisation involved. “co” is for UK commercial companies.


Each country has its own method for the domain name extensions.  Most of the sites you will be dealing with will be UK or USA based, so let us look at the most common extensions for these countries.

==== United Kingdom extensions ====


'''.gov.uk''' is a national or local government site e.g. www.opsi.gov.uk the Office of Public Sector Information


'''.co.uk''' is a company site e.g. http://www.slc.co.uk/ the student loans company


'''.ac.uk''' is an academic site e.g. http://www.soton.ac.uk/ the University of Southampton


'''.org.uk''' is an organisation, often a charity e.g. http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ the National Trust


'''.ltd.uk''' is a registered company e.g. http://www.evans.ltd.uk/ the women’s fashion outlet


There will be other domain extensions produced in the future.  A recent introduction is .me.uk which is presumably meant for individuals.


However you must note that only some of these extensions can be relied upon.  Only .gov, .ac and .ltd are strictly controlled.  Anyone can set up a website with a .co or .org extension.   In summary, you can use the domain name extensions as good CLUES (which are watertight for .ac.uk and .gov.uk) but be very careful.


 
==== United States extensions ====


Remember sites registered in the US have no geographical extensions.


'''.edu''' is an educational institution e.g.: http://www.wisc.edu/ Wisconsin university


'''.com''' is any company e.g.: http://www.amazon.com/ Amazon the Internet company
 

'''.org''' is an organisation (perhaps non-profit) e.g.: http://www.openoffice.org/  the organisation developing Open Office, the free office software suite.


'''.gov''' is a Government agency e.g.: http://www.irs.gov/ Internal Revenue Service


'''.mil''' is a military institution e.g.: http://www.navy.mil/ the US Navy


'''.net''' is used by network providers e.g.: http://www.discountasp.net/ an Internet hosting company


There are several others and some in the pipeline such as '''.info''' and '''.biz''' which will be used for commercial purposes.
 

Not all countries use these descriptive extensions.  Germany and France, for example, only have the country extension. Thus we saw: 


http://www.amazon.de/ for Germany and http://www.amazon.fr/ for France.


Another point to remember is that there is no requirement to register your site under its country of origin. Some British organisations use the US extensions of .com or .org:


www.debenhams.com/ - the well-known retailer


www.rsc.org/ - the Royal Society of Chemistry


are just two examples.

=== Search engine operation ===


There are essentially three stages involved in search engine operation.  


*1.	Before you come to type in the search terms, there has to have been an enormous '''gathering of data''' about websites carried out by the search engine company.  
*2.	The search engine uses your '''search terms''' to select candidate sites for the results. 
*3.	The search engine returns the '''results''' ranked in some order.


The Internet is continually being scanned by software set up by the search engine company.  This software called a spider or web bot looks for websites and key words to associate with them.  The key words can either be '''metadata''' (descriptive keywords supplied by the site designer) or words in the text. The result is an enormous data bank of website addresses and their corresponding key words.

 

==== Search terms ====


When the user enters the chosen search terms, the search engine uses complex and proprietary methods to select resulting websites which should satisfy the search - basically the engine is trying to match your search terms against its keywords. 


Each search engine has its own ‘secret’ methods, giving weight to particular words, including extensions to search terms such as plurals and so on.  These algorithms may change with time and so different results for the same search terms may be obtained if the search is repeated at a later date.

 

==== How ranking works  ====


Finally before presentation of the resulting websites, ranking occurs.  Ranking is the process by which a search engine '''orders the results''' of a search. You would hope that ranking presents the websites most likely to have the most useful information first.  


However you should be aware that in some cases, commercial sites can '''buy''' a place near the top of a list of websites in a search engine’s results. The implications of this are that the “best” sites do not necessarily appear at the top of the list.  Also the results may appear in a different order at a different date due to ranking changes

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''


A useful exercise is to look at the information pages of search engines to understand how they work.  There is usually a section on how to notify the search engine about your website which will have interesting clues as to how the search engine treats new websites.

For each of:

*	Google http://www.google.co.uk/ 
*	Teoma http://www.teoma.com/ 
*	Yahoo http://www.yahoo.com/ 


look for the “about” pages and find out how the engine works and how you submit a website to it.

----

It is important to remember that a search carried out by a particular search engine will return only a sub-set of all the possible results.  This is because, due to practical constraints, the engine cannot index all the pages available in the web.  An issue here is also how quickly the engine reacts to new or altered web pages.  Thus it is always worth using several different search engines for any particular reference enquiry.  Of course, there are sites returned in a search, which when clicked upon do not appear at all because the website has been rearranged or removed since the last indexing.  

 

=== Ownership of the web ===


The questions ‘Who owns the Web?’ or ‘Who owns the Internet?’ come up from time to time.  The implications of the answers are crucial to a good understanding of the nature of information on the Web.


First, let’s get the nomenclature correct.  The Internet is the physical network over which information can flow.  The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of sites where we can access information via the Internet.


So the question is now in two parts.  Who owns the Internet? (i.e.: the physical network) and Who owns the Web? (i.e.: the collection of information we can access)?

 

==== Who owns the Internet? ====


The Internet is an enormous network which has spread throughout the world.  One could say that it is owned by many, many organisations but that is not quite correct.  It would be more accurate to say that many, many organisations own their particular part of it.  


Consider how the Internet evolved.  There were a number of scientific '''research organisations''' each with a network of computers and terminals.  It was agreed to connect these together.  Each organisation owned its own network.  Gradually more and more commercial and organisation networks were created and joined together.  The idea can be likened to the road network on the European Continent.  Each country builds and pays for its own roads but it is possible to drive between any two points on the continent because the road network of each country is connected to the next country.


Luckily it is worthwhile for each part of the Internet to pay its own way to get the benefit of being connected to the whole network.

 

=== Who owns the Web ===


The other part of the question, who owns the websites, is similarly answered.  Each website is owned and financed by an '''organisation or person'''.  They alone have the rights to place their own information on the website.  


So Governments will want to have websites to put up information for their citizens to be able to access.  Commercial organisations will want to put up websites with information about their products to encourage sales.  Other information providers will similarly create sites to distribute knowledge.  Then there are millions of websites which are paid for and run by individuals who want to present information about their hobbies, favourite pop stars, family history etc.


So there is no one person or body responsible for what exists on the web.  It is really quite difficult then to enforce laws proscribing offensive matter because there is no overall control and the offensive site can be situated anywhere in the World.

Tim Berners-Lee was the originator of the web and he saw it as a cooperative space for the sharing of information among researchers.  He was working at CERN.  It still can perform that purpose but the main driving force is now by '''commercial interests'''.  On-line shopping is a very valuable sector nowadays and in the future there will be more and more commercial uses.


However you should be aware of the very different forces influencing what is seen in the search results.  There are individuals, organisations and companies attempting to present their own version of the truth, often in an even-handed way, but occasionally in an insidious and very dangerous manner.  


You must hone your validation techniques so that you can recommend websites which really are what they purport.  The concepts of the ‘grammar of the internet’ can be put into practice here.  Note that there are some truly shocking websites which lurk under the most inoffensive names. We are not going to supply any examples of these!

 

=== Dark internet and the invisible web ===


Search engines have become the main means of accessing information on the Internet.  In the early days directories were used but these have now relinquished first place to the search engines.  This is due to the enormous number of websites.  Their number has grown exponentially and Google tells us that today there are over eight billion of them.  There is no way that all these sites could be viewed by a human reviewer and placed in a directory.  Our ability to find information on the Internet is now very much dependent on the qualities of the chosen search engine.  


This does mean is that, if there are websites which contain information which cannot properly be accessed by the search engine spider, then we will never see it listed in the results.  Indeed there are areas of the web which are never found at all by the searching spiders.  A current problem is with search engines being unable to index '''databases''' and other websites which generate '''dynamic content'''.  In other words, the content is not set out on the pages of the website but is generated each time in response to a user accessing the site via a browser.  Websites with some content not in HTML also cause difficulties.  Examples are proprietary text formats or multimedia. PDF files have also been problematic.


If the search engines are not able to find the information then the only hope of finding its existence is by using a Directory.  There are specialised portals to ‘invisible’ websites. One example is www.invisible-web.net which includes a directory of some of the best resources the Invisible Web has to offer. 


You can read more about the Invisible Web here:

== Create and implement a complex search strategy ==


=== Designing a complex search strategy ===


In Outcome 2 we looked at the theory of search logic – Boolean logic, wildcards, non-obvious search terms, grammar of the Internet, search engine operation and syntax, ranking, ownership of the web, the Dark Internet and invisible web. In Outcome 3 we consider how to apply all of this knowledge in order to design the best strategy for any inquiry.  If you are not confident of your knowledge and understanding of the Outcome 2 topics, you will find in beneficial to revise that section before proceeding further with Outcome 3.  You can return to the ICTL home page by clicking on the ICTL logo at the top left of the page and navigate to Outcome 2 from there.


Complex searches fall into two broad categories:


*1. You may want to locate a '''single piece''' of specific information.

*2. You may be asked by the enquirer to retrieve '''everything you can''' on the topic.



==== Locating a piece of specific information ====


What makes the search complex is that this information is not easy to find. For this type of search, you are likely to use one or more search engines.  The skill lies in '''choosing your search terms''' and combining these into a search statement which will yield the required results.


Alternatively, you may know of an '''authoritative site''' on which this information will definitely be found.  In this case, you will use the URL of the site and then carry out a search within that site for the required information.  You should bookmark sites which you find especially useful.  You can arrange these in your “Favourites” in topic related folders.

 

==== Retrieving everything on a topic ====


You may be asked by the enquirer to retrieve everything you can on the topic. In many cases, to carry out this instruction to the letter would mean presenting the enquirer with an '''overwhelming''' mass of material.  


The skill lies in designing your search so that it results in a number of the most useful and representative sites, which present sufficient, but not too much, information in the format and style best suited to your enquirer.


For this type of search, in addition to search engines, you may need to use '''directories, portals and databases'''.  With practice you will learn which to use first in specific types of enquiries.

 

==== Useful Search Techniques ====


The key to efficient searching is to construct an appropriate search statement by choosing and combining search terms. You will develop your skills in this with practice. Here are some tips from experienced Internet searchers.


1.	Enter what you consider to be the most important search terms first. For example, '''rover cars''' rather than '''cars rover'''

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''

Enter '''rover cars''' and '''cars rover''' into a search engine and compare the first 20 sites listed. You will find the results differ, although some sites appear in the top 20 listed in both searches. '''rover cars''' is more likely to lead to sites which deal solely with Rovers.

----


2.	Enter phrases in quotes (or the equivalent syntax as specific by the search engine). 
Quotes instigate a search for the exact phrase e.g.: '''“internet search techniques”''' will search only for these three words next to each other and in this order. Without quotes, your search will also look for all three words but they could be anywhere in the document e.g.: '''internet search techniques''' could lead to sites discussing police '''search techniques''' for suspected '''internet''' crime. 


3.	If you are specifically seeking UK information, either ask to search UK sites only (if the search engine permits this) or add '''uk''' as a search term


4.	Do not limit yourself to what we, as library staff, think of as indexing terms. Searching the Internet is different from consulting a printed index. So enter as search terms words that you would expect to find in the text. For example, in a search on teenage health problems, you might use search terms such as '''bulimia, anorexia''', or '''eating disorder'''.

 

==== More useful search techniques ====


5.	Look for distinctive, specific words or phrases which apply to your search topic. This is the best way of narrowing the search to relevant sites. '''agoraphobia, English madrigals''' and '''peregrine falcon''' are examples.


6.	Remember synonyms and variant spellings. As much of the Internet content originates from the United States, it is particularly important to remember Americanisms e.g.: '''trunk''' instead of '''boot''' of a car; '''checking account''' instead of '''current account'''. 


7.	When searching on names of individuals or organisations, put these in quotes so that they are a phrase – '''“Melvyn Bragg”;  “Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals”'''


8.	When searching for information on an organisation, especially commercial companies, using the organisation’s name as a search term often does not lead to the organisation’s own web-site but to other sites in which the company is mentioned. (This is a result of the ranking methods used by search engines.)  You may be more successful by using the organisation’s '''postcode''' and/or '''telephone number''' as search terms.


9.	Use '''nouns''' rather than verbs as search terms, wherever possible. The reason underlying this is that nouns are frequently more specific than verbs.


10.	If you are aware that one of your search terms is ambiguous, add additional terms which define the area in which you are interested. You will find that '''“michael jackson” “wine critic” uk''' leads to sites which are less likely to have a connection with the well-known pop singer.



=== Reviewing search terms in the light of results – broader/narrower/related terms ===


It is important to keep reviewing your search strategy and, in particular your search statement, as the search is underway.  Ask yourself: Am I finding too much or too little information?


*	Is the search generating a number of sites which are unconnected, or only loosely related, to the topic?
*	Is there a slant to the topic which my search does not appear to be including?


In order to refine your search, you must be able to use terms which are broader or narrower than or related to your original search term.  The words broader, narrower and related are self-explanatory.  A good example which clearly illustrates the concept is:


initial search term - '''Great Britain'''


broader term - '''United Kingdom''' (The United Kingdom includes Great Britain)


narrower terms – '''England, Scotland, Wales''' (Great Britain includes these three nations)


related term - '''Northern Ireland''' (Northern Ireland is related to Great Britain in that GB and NI make up the United Kingdom)


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Search term terriers


At each stage you should review the search statement, considering if it is appropriate to change the search terms. 

 

==== Changing search terms ====


Where the key terms selected initially are yielding too much information, you should move to the use of narrower terms.  A knowledgeable client might be able to advise you here.  


Where the key terms selected initially are not yielding sufficient information, you should move to the use of broader or related terms. 


Using a directory may help you identify broader, narrower and related terms within its structure.

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Enter aeroplanes into the search box on Surfwax. When the next screen appears which summarises the search results, click on '''Focus''' and this will show you a selection of Similar, Narrower and Broader terms for '''aeroplanes'''.

----

=== Collection and presentation of results ===


The results of your search should be presented in a structured way which facilitates understanding by the client. 


This may require you to extract or summarise information from one or more sites.  If you do this, it is important for the client to be informed of the source(s) of the information found so that the client may explore the information further if they wish. 


The result of the search might be a '''bibliography''' of web references or references to information sources in print, audio or video formats.  You must quote any such references using a recognised format, for example, as in ISO 690.  ISO 690-2 specifies the elements to be included in bibliographic references to electronic documents.  It sets out a prescribed order for the elements of the reference and establishes conventions for the transcription and presentation of information derived from the source electronic document.  


Here is an example of an electronic citation.

Monibot, George (2014) &quot;How we ended up paying farmers to flood our homes&quot;.

Accessed via http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/17/farmers-uk-flood-maize-soil-protection (19 February 2014).


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, state what you think the elements in this citation mean:

Monibot

George

2014

How we ended up paying farmers to flood our homes

http://www.theguardian.com 

19 February 2014

----

 

==== Electronic citations ====


The elements of the citation are as follows: 


Monibot - Author’s surname

George - Author’s forename 

2014 - Date of publication of item

How we ended up paying farmers to flood our homes - Title of item

http://www.theguardian.com - URL for website on which item was found. 

19 February 2014 - Date this site was accessed 


Note that because web pages change constantly and can disappear it is important to give the date on which the site was accessed.

 

==== Presenting information to the client  ====


You should devise a '''logical structure''' for presenting the information to the client. The most commonly used structures are based on these arrangements:


*	Alphabetical
*	Chronological
*	Geographical (grouped by country, region or town)
*	Topical (grouped by sub-topics)
*	Categories (e.g.: type of organisation – public, private, voluntary)
*	Accepted hierarchies (e.g.: biological taxonomy)
*	Sites presenting one point of view, followed by sites presenting the opposing arguments


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Traffic Congestion Search

== Evaluate websites located in a complex search ==


=== Evaluating websites ===


Information on the Internet presents greater '''problems''' regarding reliability than information found in reference books and other materials in public libraries which have undergone a rigorous selection process.  So ALL information found on websites must be '''critically evaluated'''. The more complex the search, the more necessary it is to apply sophisticated evaluation techniques.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, make a list of criteria you might apply to assess the suitability of a website found as a result of carrying out a complex information search

----

 

==== Evaluation criteria ====


We have noted the following nine criteria:


*	Authority
*	Credibility
*	Accuracy
*	Bias
*	Emphasis
*	Currency
*	Clarity of presentation
*	Use of multimedia 
*	Ease of use for visually impaired clients


We shall now look at each of these in more detail.

 

==== Authority ====


Here you need to consider the '''expertise and reputation''' of the organisations or individuals connected with the website.  When the information is explicitly attributed to an author, you can assess their reputation.  Thus information supplied by an acknowledged expert in a field or found on the website of a well-known and respected organisation carries a lot of weight.


Of course a website may give no direct clues as to '''authorship''' and hence authority.  In this case you can try to find out who owns the site.  In Outcome 2 of this unit, we covered examining the URL of the website and carrying out a WHOIS search to find out this type of information.  


In searching for information about horse breeds you might come across this site:
http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/ 

Remembering Outcome 2, what type of organisation does this URL suggest?

.edu tells us that this site belongs to an educational institution in the Unites States. In fact, the site is that of the Department of Animal Science of Oklahoma State University and therefore you can expect an amount of authority. Note that some colleges and universities allow their students to create home pages which are not authoritative in the least.  You can usually spot this by the name of the student in the URL.



==== Tracing website ownership ====


If you were obtaining information about travelling in South Africa, you might come across this site http://www.springbokatlas.co.za/


From the two domain name extensions you can see that it should be a commercial site (.co) and it is registered as a South African site (.za)  You need to access the '''whois''' for South Africa.  You can do this by searching for it.  You can find it here: http://co.za/whois.shtml

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''

Carry out this whois search.You can see that http://www.springbokatlas.co.za/  is registered by the travel company and at the same address as the travel site in Cape Town.  That gives a bit of confidence that it is a real company and not a fraudulent ‘front’.

----


Of course it is pretty rare that a respected organisation’s website would not very explicitly feature its own name.


You may have to either omit the information found on a non-attributable website or give a strong '''health warning''' to the client regarding its usefulness.



==== Credibility ====


If the author or organisation is unknown to you, you have to check out their credibility.  Regarding a named but unknown author:


*a)	there may be a section on the '''author’s credentials''', giving qualifications etc. – you can check out these details.
*b)	if no credentials are supplied you can simply carry out a search on the '''authors’ name'''.


What would you look for in the search results?


You might be convinced by such things as:

*	positive references to their names in other articles on respected sites
*	biographical information showing that they have relevant qualifications or work experience


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.2'''

When carrying out a search on the history of nuclear physics, you have found a site which quotes extensively from the research of someone called '''Norman Feather'''. Carry out a search to determine who this person was and whether or not he was a respected scientist of his time.

----


A mark of credibility is in the '''citing of sources''' for the information.  If the unknown author cites only her/his own sources then you have no clue.


==== Evaluating credibility ====


You can evaluate a site to some extent by looking for '''references''' to it on other reputable websites.  You can check which sites link to or reference the website being validated simply by searching on its URL.  Enter the URL into a search engine and it should return a list of websites where the URL is found.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.3'''

Try this out by searching on www.qca.org.uk  which is the URL for Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency www.qcda.gov.uk. You will find links to many respectable curriculum related sites, including government departments.

----


We have now covered a '''variety of methods''' which can be used to establish the authority and/or credibility of websites. With experience you will know which method(s) are best in any instance. The next activity provides an opportunity to practice using different methods.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.4'''

Check reliability of each of the following web pages for authority and credibility:


*http://www.nasa.gov 
*http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/dcb/?anchor=rocket_science_open_standards
*http://www.apogeerockets.com/
*http://www.bbg.org/gar2/pestalerts/
*http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/plant_info/pests_diseases
*http://www.care2.com/channels/solutions/outdoors/444
*http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060711093022/http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm

----

==== Accuracy ====


Verifying the accuracy on information in a complex search has particular problems for the information professional who cannot be a subject specialist for every search area.  
The accuracy of factual information can usually be assumed to apply to reputable sites but even then you need to cross check using more than one site wherever possible.
You certainly cannot supply information from sites with dubious authority/credibility without a caveat.


You must of course use your '''common sense'''.  You can detect obvious mistakes e.g. a road-based car is not going to travel at 2000 miles per hour although it might in exceptional circumstances reach 200 mph.  With more specialised data, you may still be able to get a feel for the numbers and simple mistakes will stick out.

 

==== Bias ====


Here you are looking to see if only one side of an argument is given.  Many websites by their very nature present information from only one viewpoint and are thus biased.  It is worth examining the URL and whois information.   A commercial site is not going to criticise its products negatively.  If the site is a personal one, you may be looking at the one-sided views of a ‘crank’.  If the site is sponsored by a dubious organisation, you may only be able to find this out by looking at the whois data. Of course even well known experts can be biased in their opinions.  


While such information need not necessarily be excluded from the results presented to the client, you must '''indicate any identified bias''' and, if possible, provide information from another sources which present opposing points of view.  This is particularly important when the client is seeking information on potentially contentious matters such as politics, religion, race or issues related to pressure groups.


One of the most obvious areas where bias is shown is '''health information'''.  Some sites are simply promoting dubious or unproven therapies with a view to selling their own “medicinal” products. You must make doubly sure that any sites found as a result of a search on a medical topic are reputable.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.5'''

As an exercise in looking for bias in websites, search for a pair of websites giving opposing points of view on the following topics:


*	Cats make better pets than dogs
*	HRT is the only way to go
*	Why wind farms are bad
*	Petrol is greener than diesel


Have a close look at the arguments.  Note how convincing some of these one-sided views can be.


You may be lucky when searching for information in a contentious area in that your initial search results in several sites giving the different viewpoints.  However, if not, you must be prepared to actively seek out websites giving alternative views.

----



==== Emphasis ====


This differs from bias in that it is the omission of information rather than deliberate over-emphasis of one point of view.  For example, US sites may devote little space to British developments.  Another pertinent example is that sites for UK government departments may include information only for England on devolved issues. 


You should be aware that emphasis can be more difficult to detect than bias.  A solution is to apply the technique of cross checking with other sites on the same topic.


Health topics are an excellent example of where emphasis can creep in because of the differing approaches to medicine in different countries.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.6'''

Insert the search term '''“chronic fatigue syndrome”''' into a search engine. Note how the majority of sites which appear are from the United States. Examine the sort of information on these sites. How useful would it be to an enquirer from the UK?

Now repeat the search using '''“chronic fatigue syndrome” uk'''.  Examine the sites listed. We are sure that you will find them more useful sources of information for a client in your library.

----

 

==== Currency ====


In using the Internet you often come across websites which are seriously '''out of date'''.  In fact some of them are actually abandoned and will never be updated again.  When you use websites in your information searching, you must make sure that the information is current.  Of course with a reference book you can look at the publication date.  However for websites it is not just so easy.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down some points you could look for on a website to establish its currency.

---- 



==== Establishing currency ====


We can think of a few possible ways of establishing the currency of a website.  Obviously they depend on finding date information.  This can be explicit:


*	You can check the '''“Last revised”''' date on a website.  Remember though that this may only indicate the last time a change was made to a particular part of the website and that it does not imply that all the content was updated on that date. 
*	You can look to see how recent are the '''publication dates''' of the documents referred to on the site
*	You can look out for '''dates quoted''' within text and make an estimate of currency


If there are no actual dates mentioned, you will need to look for implications of dates.


*	You can look for '''regulations or laws''' mentioned in the site and find their dates of introduction.
*	You can look for the names of '''institutions''' or Government departments.  These do change name and can be used to give a date range.
*	You can look for the names of '''personalities''' involved in the topic which can show currency.
*	Finally you can simply look for reference to '''recent news items''' which will date the site’s information.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.7'''

Look at the following websites which all provide dynamic information and note the evidence which indicates that each has been recently updated.


*http://www.bankofengland.co.uk 
*http://mascotsuk.com/ 
*http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/ 
*http://easyjet.com/en/book/index.asp 
*http://www.blenheimpalace.com/ 

----

==== Currency indicators ====


We noted the following points:


'''Bank of England''' – lists recent working papers, conference reports etc.


'''Mascot''' – states on home page “Site last updated [date]”


'''This is Money''' – states on home page “latest news on [date]”


'''Easyjet''' – the earliest date for booking is today’s date


'''Blenheim Palace''' – the list of events is completely current.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you think of a flaw with the method we used to check the currency of the Blenheim Palace site?

----

 

==== Problems in establishing currency ====


In our Blenheim Palace example, we have established that their events calendar is current.  This site also has a section on Properties to Rent.  We cannot assume from the fact that the Events information is up-to-date that this section too has been updated (although clearly it would make good commercial sense for Blenheim Palace to make sure that this is done!)

 

Previous versions of a Website

The '''wayback machine''' at http://www.archive.org allows previous versions of websites to be browsed so that the history of a site may be viewed.  This can allow you to get a feeling for how it has developed.  It also allows or will allow changes in thought or policy to be observed by looking at a website at different points in time.  You should, however, be aware that this site is by no means comprehensive.  It is possible for website publishers to opt not to be archived.  Also there is a limit to the amount of storage for the past websites.


In a complex search, it is likely that the results of the reference enquiry will consist of a '''list of websites'''.  This differs from a simpler search which might only consist of information which you extract from a website.


Since the client will have to browse the resulting sites, some further points have to be considered as to the suitability of the websites.

 

==== Clarity of presentation ====


You need to choose sites where the information is clearly presented.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list the factors you would consider when assessing whether a site presents information clearly.

----

 

==== Presenting information clearly ====


You will want to make sure that the following points are satisfied:


*	Is it easy to '''glean specific information''' from the site? 
*	Is the site easy to '''navigate''' around?  
*	Does the site '''avoid gimmicks''' such as unnecessary and obscuring graphics?


Unless you are in the position that very few websites provide the required information, you can select the best, which satisfy the above points.

'''ACTIVITY 4.8'''

Look at http://www.eca.ac.uk/ It is difficult to find information on the site because of its emphasis on visual gimmicks and use of multiple drop-down menus. Unfortunately a client seeking information on this institution will have little choice but to persevere in using the site.

----

 

==== Use of multimedia ====


The appropriate use of '''multimedia''' can enhance understanding and indeed provide additional information.  However, some sites include multimedia such as Flash introductions, which at best are annoying and at worst put off the client due to the delays caused.  If the connection to the Internet is not fast broadband, then the delays can be intolerable.  


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.9'''

Here is an example of a site from a firm offering web design services 

http://www.transcena.co.uk 

We think its Flash introduction is unnecessary and does not add anything to the information provided. See if you agree with us.

----


Some sites offer the option of a Flash and non-Flash version. Look at http://web.archive.org/web/20050113090553/http://www.blackburn.ac.uk/  and compare the operation of both versions. Which do you prefer?


For some searches, information in multi-media format is useful or even essential.  You can make this one of your selection criteria.  Often just typing video as one of your search terms will lead to sites which have video clips (It can, of course, also lead to sites which are selling videos).  We tried jfk, assassination, and video which led amongst others to
http://www.courttv.com/onair/shows/kennedy/vintage_video.html where video clips can be played.


If sound files or sound tracks of movie clips are used, these may require loudspeakers to be available or, more likely in libraries, headsets to be used.  Clearly sites where essential information is presented audibly are not appropriate for the hearing impaired.

==== Ease of use for visually impaired clients ====


There are two main areas which should be considered for the visually impaired client.  


It may be that a client can use text on the monitor screen if it is very clear and perhaps large size.  Here it is necessary to check that the website text is not partly obscured by background graphics such as a '''watermark effect'''.  Other considerations are whether the text size can be increased by the user and if there is a text only version of the website. 


The colour of the text and the background can also influence visibility. It is generally accepted that bright orange, yellow and red backgrounds make text difficult to read. 
http://web.archive.org/web/20040710220451/http://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/courses/details.php?s=3 is an example.


Another practice to be avoided is white or pastel coloured text on a dark background.
In a previous version http://web.archive.org/web/20040101101704/http://battle1066.com/ the banner headline above the coat of arms in this site is difficult for even those with perfect vision. You can compare this with the latest version at http://www.battle1066.com/
http://www.abelard.org/technology/net-searching.php Much of the text here is almost illegible.


At the level where the client is unable to read text from a monitor screen a '''text to speech''' accessory must be used.  For this to be a successful experience, the website must be clearly laid out.  Also it is important that all graphics have text descriptions.  This is vital when it comes to the use of graphics in navigation through the website.


There are '''guidelines for accessibility''' and although you cannot be an expert in this area, you will find useful information on the following websites:


Two sites covering all accessibility issues:
http://www.coi.gov.uk
and
http://www.becta.org.uk/


A commercial site explains its approach
http://www.santander.co.uk


The RNIB site
http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_rnib008789.hcsp


Recent research by the '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council''' tested websites in the museums, libraries and archives sector and found that only 3% of these met the accessibility criteria set for government websites. You can read more about this research at:
http://www.egovmonitor.com/reports/rep11278.pdf

== Reviewing the Effectiveness of a Search Strategy ==


=== Estimating the effectiveness of a search strategy ===


The '''client’s requirements''' should have been clearly specified during the reference interview. The first stage in evaluation is to revisit that initial interview and consider if you did indeed fully explore with the client all the aspects of the query.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 5.1'''

Think of any complex information searches which you have recently carried out.  Look back to your initial reference interviews with the clients.  Could these have been improved in any way?  Note down what you could do better next time.

----


Next you must '''review the results of the search''' against the client’s requirements and consider the success of the search in these terms. 


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, outline the criteria which you would use to judge whether your search strategy has been successful.

---- 



==== Criteria for success ====


We suggest that you would consider:


*	Did the search produce results which were '''relevant''' to the client’s needs?
*	Did the search produce '''comprehensive information'''? i.e.: enough for the client’s needs?
*	And conversely, were the search results '''sifted''' in order to avoid deluging the client with information?
*	Did the search produce information which was '''reliable, up-to-date''' and '''covered all aspects''' of the topic?
*	Did you constantly have to '''modify the search strategy''' during the course of the search? And were these modifications a result of '''deficiencies''' in your original strategy?
*	Did you meet the client’s '''deadlines''' for producing the results? 
*	Did your search strategy mean that the search was carried out as '''quickly and efficiently''' as possible?


You should have no difficulty in applying the majority of the above criteria when considering the '''effectiveness''' of your search. The final criteria relating to time and speed may be less familiar to you. 

 

==== Time spent searching ====


Time spent on a search is a '''key evaluation criterion'''.  Given enough time an unskilled searcher could probably produce the required results, but an information professional should be able to produce the requested information much more quickly.  


You should consider if your search strategy produced the results in the minimum possible time or whether any modifications of the search strategy would have yielded speedier results. Key to this is the choice of search engines, directories, search terms and logic.


Finally, do remember that '''it may not be possible''' in all cases to fully satisfy the client’s requirements. (If this is the case, you will have explained the reasons for this to the client, e.g. information does not exist in the format specified, and proposed some alternatives if this is possible.)  


Failing to fully satisfy the client’s requirements is not in itself a criticism of your search strategy. If the information does not exist, the best search strategy you can devise will not uncover it.  It does, however, give you a pointer for the next time you are asked to carry out a similar information search.  If you have doubts as to the '''existence''' of the information requested, share this with the client right at the start so that they are not disappointed later.



=== Measuring the cost of a search ===


The cost of an information search arises from two components.  The '''cost of staff time''' (yourself and colleagues) dedicated to the search and '''direct costs''', i.e.: anything which has actually to be paid for.


An effective search strategy should mean that staff time input is '''minimised''', thus keeping down the cost of the search.  It can be easy to overlook the cost to the library service of staff time because public libraries do not normally charge for this.  Commercial libraries often ask library and information staff to log the time spent on information searches and the enquirer’s department is then billed for this.  


We are not suggesting that you formally log time spent – merely that you keep aware of roughly how much time you are devoting to any information search and whether this is justified.  If you find yourself devoting an '''inordinate amount of time''' to any search, ask yourself whether you should:
 

*	modify your search strategy
*	ask advice from a more experienced colleague 
*	ask a more experienced colleague to take over the search for you
*	abandon the search at this point, explaining the reasons for this to the client.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down any direct costs which you think could be associated with an information search on the Internet?

----

 

==== Direct costs ====


Direct costs could include:


*	Telecommunications charges
*	Fees for subscription sites
*	Charges to download particular documents
*	“Pay-per-view” costs for commercial sites


Telecommunications charges will have been paid by your library service. They represent a '''fixed overhead''' and so you do not need to try to calculate them for any search.


Where a library service, has decided to subscribe to a particular information source, there will be good reasons for this. A knowledgeable person has decided that the subscription site provides better information than is available on free sites. Indeed the subscription service may provide the only information available. You should therefore familiarise yourself with the '''content of subscription sites''' and their '''charging structures'''.


'''Downloading''' and '''pay-per-view''' charges can mount up.  Before using such information, always consider if there is an appropriate alternative source which is free of charge. An interesting article on the development of &quot;pay for content&quot; Internet provision is found at
http://web.archive.org/web/20040206000441/http://www.demonatthus.net/news/n-a030407a.html


Another cost which can be considerable relates to '''printing''' and/or copying the search results. This can be minimised if you supply the results to the client in electronic format wherever possible.

== Use ICT to set up current awareness and alerting services ==


=== Determining current awareness requirements of clients ===


You should begin by establishing an '''information profile''' for the client. This will provide information about what information the client needs and the quantity, level and format of the required information. It will also specify any constraints, such as deadlines for completion, currency of information and language and note any special needs that the client might have:


'''Example Information Profile'''


The following information profile might suit a client who wants to be kept up to date on happenings in the Scottish Parliament:


'''Client name:'''		Joseph Grant

'''Email address:'''		jgrant@btinternet.com

'''Age:'''			35

'''Education:'''		Completed six years secondary school

'''Information Required:'''	Regular updates re Scottish Parliament

'''Quantity:'''		Brief summary with links to full stories

'''Level:'''			Literate adult

'''Format:'''			Daily digest

'''Deadlines:'''		Wants to start ASAP

'''Currency:'''		Updated daily

'''Language:'''		English

'''Special Needs:'''		None
 

You can find an example of online profile form at:


http://web.archive.org/web/20060705204606/http://sciweb.lib.umn.edu/general/profile.phtml 

 

==== Establishing an information profile ====


Establishing an information profile uses essentially the same skills and techniques as the first part of this unit, i.e.:


*	Reference interview techniques 
*	Eliciting information and advice from clients
*	Determining the nature of detailed information to be provided– quantity, level, format
*	Constraints – deadlines for completion, currency of information and language
*	Special needs of the client


If you want to review these topics, you can click the ICTL logo at the top left of the page to return to the Unit 6 home page and navigate from there to Outcome 1 of this unit.


In addition to establishing the nature of information required, what else would you need to agree with the client in order to provide a satisfactory current awareness service?

It is also essential that you should agree the update frequency with the client. e.g.: weekly, monthly, whenever a change occurs, on-demand etc.

 

==== Costs  ====


You should take into account the '''costs''' (in staff time or subscriptions to commercial services) of providing updates and should be realistic about their frequency. Remember that your time costs money and it is unrealistic to spend disproportionate amounts of it in meeting the needs of a small number of clients.
 

Also, commercial services can be '''expensive to use''': if you do not already subscribe to a service, it may be uneconomical to do so to meet the needs of a small number of clients. Some commercial services also incur a usage charge, in which case you must ensure that this is not excessive.

=== News services ===


A news service is one which provides regular updates on topics commonly regarded as news, i.e.: those topics covered in newspapers and television or radio news broadcasts, such as current events, politics, sport etc.


News is a distinct category for current awareness because of the need for '''immediate notification''' of breaking events as well as '''regular summaries'''.  There are a wide variety of news sites to choose from. 


Three '''methods of delivery''' may be distinguished:  


*	'''daily digest''' via e-mail. This gives the subscriber a brief daily summary of newsworthy events, usually with links to more detailed stories.

*	'''breaking news events''' by e-mail. This lets you receive instant details of new stories, more or less as they break

*	'''online news ticker''' permanently visible on the computer monitor. This scrolls news headlines continuously across the bottom of the screen and is updated with new stories as they happen. It often provides hotlinks to more detailed coverage.


All three have their own advantages and disadvantages. The daily digest is non-intrusive and allows you to follow up such stories as you choose, but you only receive updates once a day. The breaking events coverage lets you know as soon as something happens, but you have to check your email to see it. The online news ticker lets you know about new stories instantly, but some people find it an annoyance having it on the screen all the time.


Some e-mail delivery services allow the use of filters, which give an element of choice of news topics delivered. If you are setting up a news delivery service for a client, it is vital that you use this filtering in order to tailor the service to the client’s needs.



==== Daily digests ====


You can obtain a daily digest from the following sources:


*'''BBC:'''			http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/email/news 

*'''Google:'''		http://www.google.com/alerts?hl=en 

*'''The Scotsman:'''	http://auth.jpress.co.uk/login.aspx?ReturnURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.scotsman.com%2ftemplate%2fEmailPreferences.aspx&amp;SiteRef=SCOT

----

==== Breaking news ====


You can obtain breaking news alerts from the following sources:


*'''BBC:'''			http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3533099.stm 

*'''Google:'''		http://www.google.com/alerts?hl=en

'''ACTIVITY 6.2'''

Choose one of the above services and sign up to receive breaking news stories. Remember, you can always cancel it later if you don’t like it.

---- 


==== Online tickers ====


Online tickers are available from the following sources:


*'''Reuters:'''	http://www.microsite.reuters.co.uk/ticker/uk/godownload.htm?src=marketing 

*'''BBC:'''		Currently being upgraded, but check at http://news.bbc.co.uk  


You can find a list of news tickers at: http://www.journalismnet.com/choose/newstickers.htm 


It’s unlikely that you could install these on library machines due to security restrictions, but you might have to explain to clients how to put tickers on their own PCs.


---- 	

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.3'''

Go to http://www.journalismnet.com/choose/newstickers.htm and look at the tickers. Which ones look as if they might be useful to you and why?

----

 

==== News aggregators ====


One relatively recent development is the use of '''news aggregators''', using an XML format such as RSS, to receive relevant news headlines. 


'''XML''' stands for '''eXtensible Markup Language''' and is a standard format for computer-readable documents which makes it straightforward to process them automatically. 


'''RSS''' stands for '''Really Simple Syndication'''. It's a method of describing news or other Web content that is available for syndicating (i.e.: feeding or distributing) from an online publisher to Web users. The term “syndication” derives from the newspaper industry practice of sharing content between different papers. A column or a cartoon (such as Peanuts) which appears in numerous different papers is described as “syndicated”.


There is a useful introductory article at:


http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/w-rss.html?dwzone=web 


and another at:


http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm 


A '''news aggregator''' is a software application that collects syndicated content from a variety of sources and displays it as a single web page. A website may incorporate aggregator features by republishing syndicated content on one or more of its pages. Aggregator features also can be added to other client software, such as Web browsers, e-mail clients, weblog creation programs, or media player programs, to allow these programs to display syndicated content.


You can get more information from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator 

 

==== News providers ====


Another way to make the topic choice more focused is by the choice of provider.  The FT ticker would be a good choice for stock market data.  If you carry out a simple search on Google, an array of sites providing specialised news will be found, e.g.: www.bunkerworld.com  offers both an e-mail delivery service and a news ticker devoted to the happenings in the world of bunker fuel.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.4'''

Use Google to find specialised news providers on the following topics:


*	The Middle East
*	ComputingTake a note of the two most interesting ones in each category.


The ones we found included the following:


'''The Middle East'''


*Globalvision News Network:	http://www.gvnews.net/html/index.shtml 
*AME Info:			http://www.ameinfo.com/45876.html 
*Gulf in the Media: 		http://www.gulfinthemedia.com 


'''Computing'''

=== Website updating services ===


Some commercial websites offer an alerting service detailing new products.  Of particular interest to library professionals are the alerting services of journal and book publishers.  For journals, it is possible to get the table of contents and sometimes abstracts of the articles. One example is the content alerting feature in http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/  for Oxford University Press Journals.  


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.5'''

Go to  http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/  and sign up for alerts for one or more of the OUP journals.

----


For book publisher alerting services it is possible to include filters to receive information on particular types of books. An example is the Mailing List feature on www.heinemann.com  Booksellers also offer alerting services, with www.amazon.co.uk  being an obvious example.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.6'''

Go to www.amazon.co.uk  and subscribe to their alerting service by clicking on the New for You link in the left-hand column.

----


You can find links to the website alerting services of many major publishers and vendors at: http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/information/publisher.htm 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.7'''

Go to http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/information/publisher.htm and sign up for one or two alerting services which look useful to you.

----


Alerting services are not confined to books and journals. For example, Stay Smart Online (http://www.ssoalertservice.net.au/view/80956e10461f4446acbcab5cae348a0c) is a Australian Government service, designed to provide small businesses with accurate, plain English advice to help protect computers, mobile phones and other devices from malicious attack. 




==== Monitoring websites ====


The contents of websites change and often do so at unpredictable intervals.  If you want to be notified when the contents of a website change, without having to connect to it frequently to check, you can set up an '''alert''' to notify you of any changes. If an alert can be set up it can solve two problems.  Firstly if there is a substantial change to an often-recommended site, you can check up to see if must be re-evaluated for recommendation.  Secondly, if data contained in a site is updated at say annual intervals, it is useful to know when the new data becomes available.  This is similar to knowing that a new edition of a reference work has been published and needs to be purchased.


Some websites offer to notify subscribers automatically if changes are made, but there are a number of tools available which allow you to monitor changes on any website, e.g.:


*Website Watcher 	http://www.aignes.com/features.htm 

*Check and Get:		http://activeurls.com/en/ 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.8'''

----

Download an evaluation version of the software from one of the sites given above and use this to set up alerts fro two or three websites you visit frequently.

=== Creating a current awareness system for your own organisation ===


A '''current awareness service''' is a service or publication designed to alert scholars, researchers, readers, customers, or employees to recently published literature in their specialist field(s). Current awareness systems are usually available in special libraries serving companies, organizations, and institutions in which access to current information is essential. Such services can be tailored to fit the interest profile of a specific individual or group. Some online catalogues and bibliographic databases include a &quot;preferred searches&quot; option that allows the library user to archive search statements and re-execute them as needed. Current awareness services are sometimes referred to as '''selective dissemination of information (SDI)'''.


Internal '''current awareness systems''' have traditionally involved the physical circulation of print materials to clients. These have now been replaced by electronic versions. This includes identification of relevant materials which match the client’s information profile. The materials might include internal documents in electronic or print format.
 

You should be able to identify relevant print or non-print materials from journals, reports etc. Where such are available only in print format, you should give a reference and a brief description. You should be able to operate a system for e-mailing information to clients within the organisation at agreed intervals and set up web-sourced current awareness services for internal clients.


You can find lots of links relating to current awareness services for librarians at the following sites:


http://www.city.academic.gr/special/libproject/LIBRARY_SITE/information_services/LIBRARY_SERVICES/alerting_services.htm 


http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/dis/disresearch/ascas.html


Although these are university library sites, much of the content is applicable to public libraries.


You can find a long list of available current awareness and alerting services at the following location:


http://www.tru.ca/library/guides/current_awareness/current_awareness_a-z.html 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.9'''

Draw up information profiles for one or two of your colleagues and set up current awareness services for them by using some of the resources mentioned in the sites listed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Acoustics}}

An important issue for the aeronautical industry is the reduction of aircraft noise. The characteristics of the turbomachinery noise are to be studied. The rotor/stator interaction is a predominant part of the noise emission.
We will present an introduction to these interaction theory, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotor/Stator_Interaction&amp;action=edit
Edit this page

== Noise emission of a Rotor-Stator mechanism ==


A Rotor wake induces on the downstream Stator blades a fluctuating vane loading, which is directly linked to the noise emission.

We consider a B blades Rotor (at a rotation speed of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) and a V blades stator, in a unique Rotor/Stator configuration. The source frequencies are multiples of &lt;math&gt;B \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For the moment we don’t have access to the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. The noise frequencies are also &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, not depending on the number of blades of the stator. Nevertheless, this number V has a predominant role in the noise levels (&lt;math&gt;P_{m}&lt;/math&gt;) and directivity, as it will be discussed later.



''Example''

''For an airplane air-conditioning ventilator, reasonable data are :''

''&lt;math&gt;B=13&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 12000&lt;/math&gt; rnd/min''

''The blade passing frequency is 2600 Hz, so we only have to include the first two multiples (2600 Hz and 5200 Hz), because of the human ear high-sensibility limit. We have to study the frequencies m=1 and m=2.''





== Optimization of the number of blades ==


As the source levels can't be easily modified, we have to focuse on the interaction between those levels and the noise levels.

The transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; contains the following part :


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{s =  - \infty }^{s =  + \infty } {e^{ - {{i(mB - sV)\pi } \over 2}} J_{mB - sV} } (mBM)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



Where m is the Mach number and &lt;math&gt;J_{mB - sV}&lt;/math&gt; the Bessel function of mB-sV order. In order to minimize the influence of the transfer function, the goal is to reduce the value of this Bessel function. To do so, the argument must be smaller than the order of the Bessel function.



''Back to the example :''

''For m=1, with a Mach number M=0.3, the argument of the Bessel function is about 4. We have to avoid having mB-sV inferior than 4. If V=10, we have 13-1x10=3, so there will be a noisy mode. If V=19, the minimum of mB-sV is 6, and the noise emission will be limited.''


''Remark :''

''The case that is to be strictly avoided is when mB-sV can be nul, which causes the order of the Bessel function to be 0. As a consequence, we have to take care having B and V prime numbers.''




== Determination of source levels ==


The minimization of the transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; is a great step in the process of reducing the noise emission. Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, we also have to predict the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significative values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, we will not consider the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV.
The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory,which will not be explicited here.




== Directivity ==


All this study was made for a privilegiate direction : the axis of the Rotor/Stator. All the results are acceptable when the noise reduction is ought to be in this direction. In the case where the noise to reduce is perpendicular to the axis, the results are very different, as those figures shown :


For B=13 and V=13, which is the worst case, we see that the sound level is very high on the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:1313bis.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


For B=13 and V=19, the sound level is very low on the axis but high perpendicularly to the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = Pi/2&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:1319bis.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Tutorial 1:  Creating a Windows program in Dev – C++==

This chapter will cover programming with the Win32 API.

===Setting up Dev – C++===

First open up Dev – C++.  When it opens up, click on the top menu bar File, New, Project.  Make sure the Basic tab is selected and click on Windows Application.  Then give it a name and press OK.  Then in the next dialog, choose a location on your computer to save and then press Save:

After you do that, your project loads up and you get a default source file with windows code already in it.  Right – click the tab main.cpp above the source file and click Close.  When it asks you to save changes, click on No.

To add a new source file to the project, go to the top menu bar and click on File, New, Source File.  It will ask you if you want to add the source file to the project.  Click Yes.  Now you will have a blank source file to edit.  Before we start coding, click on File, Save.  It will ask you where you  want to save your source file.  Make sure you save it in the same place you put your Dev – C++ project.  Name it something like ”winmain” and click Save.  Now that we got a blank source file ready, we can start coding our window.

The first line of the source file should have the windows header “windows.h” included:

 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

This header includes all the functions and structures we need so far to program in Windows.

Before we go on, there are some things we need to discuss about Window events.

Unlike a standard command – line program, a Windows program has many events happening at once.  One example would be the fact that a Window has to constantly repaint the background of itself.  This we won’t worry about right now.  But there are other events such as a user pressing a button on the window, a user right – clicking with the mouse, etc…  The event that we are going to worry about in this lesson is when the user hits the X button on the top – right of the window to exit the program.  We have to tell the Operating System (Windows) that when the user does that, the program should quit.  The function in Windows that handles these types of events is called a Window Procedure.  We are going to define this function next.  Also note that Windows doesn’t call these actions “events”, but rather they call them messages.  Messages are events.  We will be using the term “messages” throughout the lessons.  Now let’s start coding the Window Procedure.

The return value of the Window Procedure is the result of the processing of the messages which is returned to the WinMain() function (more on this later):

 LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(
 
     HWND hwnd,	// handle of window
     UINT uMsg,	// message identifier
     WPARAM wParam,	// first message parameter
     LPARAM lParam 	// second message parameter
    );

I will explain these parameters in a minute.  But this is how you declare the Window Procedure.  So right underneath the inclusion of the Windows header, put this in:

 LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc(HWND hWnd,
                          UINT msg,
                          WPARAM wParam,
                          LPARAM lParam)
 {

Notice that you can name the function whatever you want.  Here we named it “WinProc”.  Easy to remember right?  We need this name when we create the actual window.  Now let me explain the different parameters there:

HWND hWnd is short for a “handle to a window”.  Basically this is the actual window object itself.  This handle stores the window in it.

UINT msg is the actual message we will be processing.  There are tons and tons of messages we can process, but we will only worry about one in this lesson.

WPARAM wParam and LPARAM lParam are different types of message information.  We won’t be using these variables in this lesson.  I will explain them some other time.

Now within the Message Procedure we need some way of defining what to do for a certain message.  We will use the switch command to sort out these messages:

      switch(msg)
      {

Now we will put in a case statement for the one message we want to handle, which is when the user exits the program.  This message has an ID value of WM_DESTROY.  When we are in its case statement, we put in a function to quit the program.  We will use the PostQuitMessage() function which takes as a single parameter the exit code, which is 0:

           case WM_DESTROY:
                PostQuitMessage(0);
                break;
           
           default: break;
      }

Above we put the quitting message and then ended the switch statement.  Now that we took care of that message, we are done with the Window Procedure.  One last thing we have to do though is return the results of our message processing to the WinMain function.  For this we return the DefWindowProc() function:

 LRESULT DefWindowProc(
 
     HWND hWnd,	// handle to window
     UINT Msg,	// message identifier
     WPARAM wParam,	// first message parameter
     LPARAM lParam 	// second message parameter
    );

As you can see this function takes the same parameters as the window procedure itself.  So all you have to do is fill it in with the same parameters you did in the Window Procedure declaration:

 return DefWindowProc(hWnd,msg,wParam,lParam);
 }

Now this finally completes our Window Procedure.  Now lets move on to the WinMain() function.


WinMain

The WinMain() function is sort of like the main() function in a regular C or C++ program.  It is the entry point for all Windows programs.  But it is a bit more complex to set up.  Here is its prototype:

 int WINAPI WinMain(
 
     HINSTANCE hInstance,	// handle to current instance
     HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,	// handle to previous instance
     LPSTR lpCmdLine,	// pointer to command line
     int nCmdShow 	// show state of window
    );

Let me explain the parameters:

HINSTANCE hInstance keeps track of the window.  Let me explain this better.  It keeps track of the instance, or the appearance, of the window.  This is a very hard concept to explain.  We will go over this some more later.

HINSTANCE hPrevInstance is not really used.

LPSTR lpCmdLine specifies command – line arguments for the program.  We won’t need to worry about this.

int nCmdShow is the way that the window is to be shown.  We won’t mess with this yet.

After the message procedure type in the initialization for the WinMain() function:

 int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance,
                    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                    LPSTR lpCmdLine,
                    int nShowCmd)
 {

Now within the WinMain() function we have to declare three very important variables.  Put this in right after the WinMain() initialization:

      HWND hWnd;
      WNDCLASSEX wcex;
      MSG msg;

Let me explain these variables:

HWND hWnd we already explained in the message procedure.  It is the handle that stores the window itself.

WNDCLASSEX wcex is the actual window structure.  This structure, which you define, sets certain properties of the window.  We will be filling in this structure in a minute.

MSG msg is the message structure like the one in the message procedure.  This particular structure contains fields such as the actual message itself.  We will be using this later in the WinMain() function.

Now that we got those variables, lets define that WNDCLASSEX structure.  Here is the prototype of the WNDCLASSEX structure:

 typedef struct _WNDCLASSEX {    // wc  
     UINT    cbSize; 
     UINT    style; 
     WNDPROC lpfnWndProc; 
     int     cbClsExtra; 
     int     cbWndExtra; 
     HANDLE  hInstance; 
     HICON   hIcon; 
     HCURSOR hCursor; 
     HBRUSH  hbrBackground; 
     LPCTSTR lpszMenuName; 
     LPCTSTR lpszClassName; 
     HICON   hIconSm; 
 } WNDCLASSEX;

Let me show you what to fill in these properties with:

-	UINT cbSize is the size of the structure itself.
-	UINT style is the window styles.  There are quite a few options for this.  We will use the CS_HREDRAW and CS_VREDRAW to allow the window to be resized horizontally and vertically.
-	WNDPROC lpfnWndProc is the name of the message procedure you want to link to.  We already created this in the beginning so put the name of it (WinProc) in here.
-	int cbClsExtra and int cbWndExtra will not be used so it will be set to 0 for both of them.
-	HANDLE hInstance is the instance handle we created in the declaration of WinMain.  Just put in the name we gave it (hInstance) in this property.
-	HICON hIcon is the big icon we want to use for the program.  For this we will load a standard icon using the LoadIcon() function which takes as parameters: the HINSTANCE of the icon (we set this to NULL) and the Icon name (set to IDI_APPLICATION for a standard windows icon)
-	HCURSOR hCursor is the mouse cursor we want to use.  For this we use the LoadCursor() function which takes as parameters:  HINSTANCE of Cursor (set to NULL) and the name of the Cursor ( IDC_ARROW for a standard Windows arrow)
-	HBRUSH hbrBackground is the color we want for the background.  We get this color by using the GetStockObject() function which takes as parameter the name of the brush (we set this to GRAY_BRUSH) and type cast it to HBRUSH type.
-	LPCTSTR lpszMenuName identifies the menu we want to use in our program.  Since we don’t have one, we set this to NULL.
-	LPCTSTR lpszClassName is a string for the name of the Windows class that identifies the window.  We will need this name later when we create the window.  Set it to “WinClass”.
-	HICON hIconSm is the small icon to use for the program.  Set this to NULL for a default Icon.

So here is the whole structure defined and ready to be typed:

      wcex.cbSize = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
      wcex.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW;
      wcex.lpfnWndProc = WinProc;
      wcex.cbClsExtra = 0;
      wcex.cbWndExtra = 0;
      wcex.hInstance = hInstance;
      wcex.hIcon = LoadIcon(NULL,IDI_APPLICATION);
      wcex.hCursor = LoadCursor(NULL,IDC_ARROW);
      wcex.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH) GetStockObject(GRAY_BRUSH);
      wcex.lpszMenuName = NULL;
      wcex.lpszClassName = &quot;WinClass&quot;;
      wcex.hIconSm = NULL;

After the defining of the WNDCLASSEX structure, we have to register it with the RegisterClassEx() function, which takes as a single parameter a pointer to the WNDCLASSEX structure we want to register:

      RegisterClassEx(&amp;wcex);

Now we go on to actually create the window.  Remember that HWND (handle to window) that we created at the beginning of the WinMain() function?  Well, we are going to set that equal to the window we are about to create using the CreateWindow() function:

 HWND CreateWindow(
 
     LPCTSTR lpClassName,	// pointer to registered class name
     LPCTSTR lpWindowName,	// pointer to window name
     DWORD dwStyle,	// window style
     int x,	// horizontal position of window
     int y,	// vertical position of window
     int nWidth,	// window width
     int nHeight,	// window height
     HWND hWndParent,	// handle to parent or owner window
     HMENU hMenu,	// handle to menu or child-window identifier
     HANDLE hInstance,	// handle to application instance
     LPVOID lpParam 	// pointer to window-creation data
    );

Let me explain these parameters:

-	LPCTSTR lpClassName is the name of the window class we defined in the definition of the WNDCLASSEX structure (“WinClass”)
-	LPCTSTR lpWindowName is the string that appears on the title bar of the window.  For now, set it to “Window”
-	DWORD dwStyle is specifies certain window styles.  There are a bunch of these, but for now we will set it to WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW for the window to appear with a border and a minimize,maximize, and close button just like a standard windows application.
-	int x and int y are the X and Y locations starting from the top – left corner of the screen of the window.  For now we set it to 0 and 0.
-	int nWidth and int nHeight are the height and width in pixels of the window.  For now set it to 400 and 400.
-	HWND hWndParent is a window handle to a parent window.  Since we are only creating a single window, set it to NULL to indicate there is no parent window.
-	HMENU hMenu identifies a menu to use.  Since we have none, set it to NULL.
-	HANDLE hInstance is the instance handle that we set to the WNDCLASSEX structure (hInstance).
-	LPVOID lpParam is not needed, so set it to NULL.

Here is the whole function with the right parameters passed:

      hWnd = CreateWindow(&quot;WinClass&quot;,&quot;My Window&quot;,
             WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,0,0,400,400,NULL,NULL,
             hInstance,NULL);

Just to be on the safe side, lets make sure that the window was created successfully.  If the CreateWindow() function was successful, the window handle (hWnd) would have a window attached to it.  If CreateWindow() wasn’t successful, then the window handle would have a value of NULL in it.  So first, check for a value of NULL in the window handle with an IF statement:

      if(hWnd == NULL)
      {

Now if the window handle was NULL, we need to tell the user about the error and close the program down.  First to inform the user of the problem, we can use a popup message box.  For that we use the MessageBox() function:

 int MessageBox(
 
     HWND hWnd,	// handle of owner window
     LPCTSTR lpText,	// address of text in message box
     LPCTSTR lpCaption,	// address of title of message box  
     UINT uType 	// style of message box
    );

The first parameter is the window handle of the window the message box is coming from.  Since if the window handle is NULL, which we are checking for, put in NULL for this value.  The second parameter, lpText, is the main text in the message box dialog.  For this put in “Error:  Couldn’t create window”.  The third parameter, lpCaption, is the title caption on the top of the message box.  Set this to “ERROR”.  The final parameter, uType, is the message box style.  Here you can identify the types of buttons for the user to press on the message box and an icon to appear on the message box.  For now, set this to MB_OK for just an OK button on there.
After we create the message box, we have to quit the program.  Just like a standard C++ main() function, when an error occurs we put ”return -1” instead of “return 0” to tell the Operating System we are quitting the program with an error.  So after the message box put “return 0”:

              MessageBox(NULL,&quot;Error: Unable to create Window&quot;,&quot;ERROR&quot;,MB_OK);
              return -1;
      }

Now, assuming the window was created successfully, we need to actually show it.  We use the ShowWindow() function for that:

 BOOL ShowWindow(
 
     HWND hWnd,	// handle of window
     int nCmdShow 	// show state of window
    );

The first parameter is the handle to the window we want to show (hWnd).  The second parameter is the variable we created at the initialization of the WinMain() function (nShowCmd):

      ShowWindow(hWnd,nShowCmd);

Right after this, we should handle any updates to the window by using the UpdateWindow() function which takes as a single parameter the handle of the window to update(hWnd):

      UpdateWindow(hWnd);

Now that our window is shown, we need to prevent the program from exiting so our window stays on the screen.  To do that we create a main loop.  The way I am going to do the loop is create a while loop with a condition of 1 so that the loop is infinite:

      while(1)
      {

Now while the loop is going, we need some way to check for if a user quit the program.  To do that we have to check the messages being sent to see if one was a quit message.  For that we use the PeekMessage() function:

 BOOL PeekMessage(
 
     LPMSG lpMsg,	// pointer to structure for message
     HWND hWnd,	// handle to window
     UINT wMsgFilterMin,	// first message
     UINT wMsgFilterMax,	// last message
     UINT wRemoveMsg 	// removal flags
    );
-	LPMSG lpMsg is a pointer to the message structure that we created at the beginning of the WinMain() function (msg)
-	HWND hWnd is the window that we want the messages from processed.  You can put NULL in here to select the default window
-	UINT wMsgFilterMin and UINT wMsgFilterMax specify the minimum and maximum ranges for the messages to be processed.  Since we want to process all messages, put 0 in for both of these parameters
-	UINT wRemoveMsg determines how messages are handled after they are processed.  We will use the value PM_REMOVE telling it to remove messages after they are processed.

Since the PeekMessage() function returns a Boolean value determining if it was successful or not, lets put it in an IF Statement to assure that it ran successfully:

              if(PeekMessage(&amp;msg,NULL,0,0,PM_REMOVE))
              {

If a message was processed, we need to only check to see if that message was a Quit message.  We can do that by checking the message property of the MSG structure we created earlier (msg).  The message we are checking for is the WM_QUIT message.  If it is, then we have to break out of the loop that the program is currently in:

                  if(msg.message == WM_QUIT) break;

If a quit message was not processed, we still have to have the other messages processed.  For that we use the TranslateMessage() function to interpret the message.  Then after that we use the DispatchMessage() function to execute the message.  Both functions take as a single parameter a pointer to the MSG structure:

                  TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
                  DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
              }
      }

Those two curly brackets end our main loop.  The last thing we do before we finish up the WinMain() function is return a value to the Operating System.  We return 0 as the value since by this time the program has run successfully:

      return 0;
}

Now compile and run the program, and you should get this nice result:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interesting point, Heres something to think about.

I think all Genetic research of the actively trying to create new
Genes, or new Genetic codes variety should absolutely be haulted
until we actually know the syntax laws of the code flawlessly.

No amount of genetic research in the &quot;lets play with genetics splicing and see what we get variety&quot; can ever really give us those
answers, and, more importantly, there may be genetic instabilities
that arrive by bad splicing; We have no idea which laws of the syntax
we are breaking when we splice.

What we need to do is make a very public super database
(Which is by the way endgame, finished article definition, in the
works if you look at wikimedias other sister project.)
What we need to do is comprehensively catalogue in total exquisite
detail all of the diversity of biology on planet earth, and then use
computer simulations and programming to infer the syntax by cross
comparing the assorted genetic codes to the assorted holomorphic forms.

Until that is done, Genetic toying might have extremely hazardous
results; for instance, ambiguated genetic structures could end up
hopping species, either through accidental apeal by means of the splice intermarriage, or by chaos identification and thus slurpage
for some happy exotic virus.

Genetic tinkering in the current era is sloppy and thus dangerous.
We now have finally built computers with enough processing power,
and we are sharing information in enough of a transparent and thus
geometrically increasing way on the internet;
What is currently known about genetics could probably solve the
mjor genetic problems; the problem is that there are thousands of seperated repositories for that knowledge and theres no way for those
Databases to be linked.

The intellectual labor that was impossible until probably 1995 is now
probably even more feasable now than it was probably around then.
Genetic research of the gambling with random chance, chaos, and fate
style should be suspended immediately, along with stem cell research.
Not because stem Cell research, or Genetic Engineering aren't promising technologies, but because we are fooling ourselves to beleive that we know enough yet to be responsible with those technologies.

Once we know what we are doing, then swing the doors back open....

Anyways, thats a lot for a discussion...lol.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">From meta-purpose, to universal purpose, to a universal religion: what a train of thought!
-------------
i agree, but self congratulatory remarks might be better suited for a
chat or discussion environment than the actual article itself.
------------

Our meta-purpose remains just an undefined vision of what Life might eventually become. “Supporting Life’s journey to become oB” may well be an emotionally appealing activity worth adopting when considering behavioural alternatives. However, it will not serve as the guiding purpose the world needs to craft legislation of use in international courts of law. For that a well-defined “universal purpose” is needed.
----------------

I think there are a whole host of good motivations and reasons that
could be listed which would have a more compelling nature to me personally.
I haven't honestly followed the whole train through, I'm still
just pulling the most interesting thing i spot and making comment
on it.

I think what we are doing here is making the argument PRO &quot;Universal&quot;
If thats true, then you and I are definitely living in paralell universes, because my POV is &quot;Educated Integrative Eclectic.&quot;

The reasons I think that a &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;Eclectic&quot; Approach should be adopted are;
1. The assorted religions don't operate at the functional level for most Users. Whatever else may be said for Christianity or Islam, The current result of participating is suspiciously similar to a neocortical lobotomy. Why? Because the Religions have invariably been
kidnapped and held hostage by politically motivated propagandists.
Those people invariably want to use information to CONTROL people,
NOT Liberate their minds, or faciliate a Genuine Spiritual Life.

2. In MOST cases, the assorted flaws of any given religious dogma
are forced to resolve when that dogmas core axioms are compared to
similar core axioms in other religions. ie The problems can be flushed out and the entire set of paradigms can be scrubbed clean most easilly by using alternate dirty paradigms as co-scrubbers.

3. This makes the game of doing this lucidly about single paradigm
discussions, with stated up front POV Strubs for all of the denominations likely to register a blip or an opinion one way or the other.

4. Most important in the POV sets are the meta sets. These are.

1. Casual Eclectic; Persons who aren't educated, but can see a pattern with two different religions having two similar core axioms.

2. Educated Lazy Eclectic; Anybody highly educated, but in less than
three paradigms

3. Educated Integral Eclectic; Anybody highly educated whos whole
POV hinges on bringing in as many different details from as many different paradigms as is possible; IE the &quot;Hard Core&quot; Eclectic.
Or, A person highly educated in probably at least two or more
paradigms, and at least slightly educated in at least 3 or more others.

4. Universal; The intuitive approach at a high level of functionality.

5. Macro Axiom; A schematized and ordered list of Axioms (pro POV only) Which then links into the POV per axiom pages.

6. Macro Flaw; Logical fallacies, Propaganda tricks, The Psychology
of being accidentally wrong and evangelical, etc.

7. Historical Footnotes

8. Annoted Integrative Eclectic Bible

9. Annotated Integrative other religious Text

10. Link outs to Ethics, Sociology, Civil Engineering,
Psychonautics Solutions.

-------------------

A universal purpose is also required if a nation-guiding moral code is to be developed. Such a code would provide the moral authority international bodies need if they are to serve humanity well as we move into a very uncertain future.

---------------------
Yeah, let me say some things as a Politico and a Social Scientist
with the equivalent of a doctorate degree in Political Science and
the equivalnet of a Bachelors degree in &quot;War&quot; or &quot;Game&quot; Theory.

We cannot win the war on Terrror. Its a futile venture, because there
will be a country with Islamic Radicals running it which also has Nukes within our Lifetimes. The Clock is ticking for us to solve this problem in a real way, or, End the human species due to pack
psychologies idiot program.

The real solution to the problem is to resolve the social and civil
issues well enough that we can end poverty and strife for everybody
on the planet. Whatever kneejerk responses that may elicit, the truth of the matter is that for the same price as the IRAQ war, we could have fed, sheltered, and clothed Every person on this planet.

In the modern era, it is less costly to turn your enemies into your dependants than it is to bother to fight them.

And only THAT wisdom will deliver us from Armageddon.
------------------


This chapter suggests steps that might be taken to build a universal religion from the yet-to-be-developed universal purpose. Some might consider that a powerfully worded and valued purpose should suffice to guide collective global decision making, but this is not how I contend the mind operates. 
------------------
My opinion, and what I am trying to drive home to you, is that while
your overall concept is a noble and high aspiration, you are making a chronicly naive set of assumptions about how much process is going
to be needed to arrive at an end product rather than an eventually deleted POV and Propaganda experiment.

Global decision making will need to arise from the blueprint that we as Authors set down. For instance,
take the single topic of &quot;Christianity.&quot;

What you need is a few new bullets under that main topic;
*Pro POV
* Con POV
*POV Disambiguation; Please State your Denomination and POV.
* List Of Standard Axioms
* List of Esoteric Axioms
* List of Ethical Errors, and Solutions
* List of Cognitive Errors, and Solutions
* List Of Logical Errors, and Solutions
* List of Social Engineering Errors, and Solutions
*List and Exploration of Derived Gems
* Eclectic Integrative Analysis
*Eclectic Integration

That, in my opinion, could serve as a template for each of the religions.
----------------------
*


As we saw in Part Two, the mental Construct that a belief develops can preclude alternative ways of thinking, thus all true believers of any doctrine will always claim that the commandments of their faith override any national or international law. Something labelled a “universal religion” may come to be regarded as worthy of being equally obeyed. My hope is that some day members of all religions might take the time to consider what was being said, if it were being expressed by a sufficient number of well-respected and influential people all claiming to follow a “universal religion.”
-----------------

The ultimate pay off for this is that it is the ultimate tool for
diplomacy. If there is an axiom map generated between religions, then people of different religions can use their own religious principles to explore similar ideas in other religions. This makes
talking to an Islamic Extremist a whole lot easier, if you have printed out our text to ride along with you in say Palestine.
--------------------
Again, the “universal religion” being proposed here is not something to be force fed to anyone. It should be seen as a companion to other religions, concerned about and dealing with the welfare of community and life, but having nothing to say about any individual after-life beliefs. Eventually, however, I do think that the rationality of the proposed universal religion will lead it to replace the less objective religions that we have inherited, because humankind is itself becoming more rational. Perhaps this transition will occur sometime in the future, however, not in this century, I suspect.
--------------------------
I am more optomistic. THIS that we are doingright now, has tremendous
causal potential, and the potential for geometric progression in terms of participation. We are in the earliest part of THIS century,
so unless you wrote that prior to 2000, I think its very realistic to think that we could create something here which would become the new dominant Religious reference text.

From there, its only a matter of time till the old opinionated non-internet using old foagies start to die off. Evolution and paradigmal
theory have been held at bay as forces by the propaganda establishment; but thats slowly creating a tidal surge in knowlege and information. Sooner or later that Tide has to come in somewhere,
and when its full impact hits, there is going to be rapid paradigmal
evolution, because nobody will be able to take the old paradigms seriously any more.

-------------------------
Elements of this chapter trouble me. Section two seems to be promoting disorder, 
--------------------
You have to break eggs to make omellettes.
-----------------

 there are many who know much more than I 
-----------------
possibly, but I think you are still the best lead Author.
----------------
about promoting a cause in a sensible manner; they would be the ones to consult when action is sought, not me.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
Acoustics (from Greek ακουστικός pronounced akoustikos meaning &quot;of or for hearing, ready to hear&quot;) is the science that studies sound, in particular its production, transmission, and effects. The science of acoustics has many applications which are dependent upon the nature of the sound that is to be produced, transmitted or controlled.  In the case of a desirable sound, such as music,  the main application of acoustics is to make the music sound as good as possible.  In the case of an undesirable sound, such as traffic noise, the main application of acoustics is in noise reduction.  Another major area of acoustics is in the field of ultrasound which has applications in detection, such as sonar systems or non-destructive material testing. The articles in this Wikibook describe the fundamentals of acoustics and some of the major applications.

== Introduction ==

Sound is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a gas, liquid, or solid in the form of a traveling [[w:wave|wave]], and can be generated by any localized pressure variation in a medium. An easy way to understand how sound propagates is to consider that space can be divided into thin layers. The vibration (the successive compression and relaxation) of these layers, at a certain velocity, enables the sound to propagate, hence producing a wave. The speed of sound depends on the compressibility and density of the medium.

In this chapter, we will only consider the propagation of sound waves in an area without any acoustic source, in a [[w:homogeneous|homogeneous]] fluid.

== Equation of waves ==

Sound waves consist in the propagation of a scalar quantity, acoustic over-pressure. The propagation of sound waves in a stationary medium (e.g. still air or water) is governed by the following equation (see [[w:wave equation|wave equation]]): 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 p - \frac{1}{{c_0 ^2 }}\frac{{\partial ^2 p}}{{\partial t^2 }} = 0&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;

This equation is obtained using the conservation equations (mass, momentum and energy) and the thermodynamic equations of state of an ideal gas (or of an ideally compressible solid or liquid), supposing that the pressure variations are small, and neglecting viscosity and thermal conduction, which would give other terms, accounting for sound attenuation.

In the propagation equation of sound waves, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation velocity of the sound wave (which has nothing to do with the vibration velocity of the air layers). This propagation velocity has the following expression:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;c_0  = \frac{1}{{\sqrt {\rho _0 \chi _s } }}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho _0&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;\chi _S&lt;/math&gt; is the compressibility coefficient of the propagation medium.

== Helmholtz equation ==

Since the velocity field &lt;math&gt;\underline v&lt;/math&gt; for acoustic waves is irrotational we can define an acoustic potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi &lt;/math&gt; by: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline v  = \text{grad }\Phi &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Using the propagation equation of the previous paragraph, it is easy to obtain the new equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \Phi  - \frac{1}{{c_0 ^2 }}\frac{{\partial ^2 \Phi }}{{\partial t^2 }} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Applying the Fourier Transform, we get the widely used Helmholtz equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \hat \Phi  + k^2 \hat \Phi  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the wave number associated with &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Using this equation is often the easiest way to solve acoustical problems.

== Acoustic intensity and decibel ==

The acoustic intensity represents the acoustic energy flux associated with the wave propagation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline i (t) = p\underline v 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 
 	
We can then define the average intensity:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline I  =  &lt; \underline i  &gt; 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 
However, acoustic intensity does not give a good idea of the sound level, since the sensitivity of our ears is logarithmic. Therefore we define decibels, either using acoustic over-pressure or acoustic average intensity:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p^{dB}  = 20\log \left(\frac{p}{{p_\mathrm{ref} }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;  ;  &lt;math&gt;L_I  = 10\log \left(\frac{I}{{I_\mathrm{ref} }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 	 
where &lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{ref}  = 2.10^{ - 5} Pa&lt;/math&gt; for air, or &lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{ref}  = 10^{ - 6} Pa&lt;/math&gt;  for any other media, and &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{ref} = 10^{ - 12}&lt;/math&gt; W/m².

== Solving the wave equation ==

=== Plane waves ===

If we study the propagation of a sound wave, far from the acoustic source, it can be considered as a plane 1D wave. If the direction of propagation is along the x axis, the solution is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi (x,t) = f\left(t - \frac{x}{{c_0 }}\right) + g\left(t + \frac{x}{{c_0 }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 
where f and g can be any function. f describes the wave motion toward increasing x, whereas g describes the motion toward decreasing x.

The momentum equation provides a relation between &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underline v&lt;/math&gt; which leads to the expression of the specific impedance, defined as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{v} = Z =  \pm \rho _0 c_0 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

And still in the case of a plane wave, we get the following expression for the acoustic intensity:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline i  =  \pm \frac{{p^2 }}{{\rho _0 c_0 }}\underline {e_x } 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Spherical waves ===

More generally, the waves propagate in any direction and are spherical waves. In these cases, the solution for the acoustic potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi (r,t) = \frac{1}{r}f\left(t - \frac{r}{{c_0 }}\right) + \frac{1}{r}g\left(t + \frac{r}{{c_0 }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 
The fact that the potential decreases linearly while the distance to the source rises is just a consequence of the conservation of energy.
For spherical waves, we can also easily calculate the specific impedance as well as the acoustic intensity.

== Boundary conditions ==

Concerning the boundary conditions which are used for solving the wave equation, we can distinguish two situations. If the medium is not absorptive, the boundary conditions are established using the usual equations for mechanics. But in the situation of an absorptive material, it is simpler to use the concept of acoustic impedance.

=== Non-absorptive material ===

In that case, we get explicit boundary conditions either on stresses and on velocities at the interface. These conditions depend on whether the media are solids, inviscid or viscous fluids.

=== Absorptive material ===

Here, we use the acoustic impedance as the boundary condition. This impedance, which is often given by experimental measurements depends on the material, the fluid and the frequency of the sound wave.

An important issue for the aeronautical industry is the reduction of aircraft noise. The characteristics of the turbomachinery noise are to be studied. The rotor/stator interaction is a predominant part of the noise emission.
We will present an introduction to these interaction theory, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction.

== Noise emission of a Rotor-Stator mechanism ==

A Rotor wake induces on the downstream Stator blades a fluctuating vane loading, which is directly linked to the noise emission.

We consider a B blades Rotor (at a rotation speed of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) and a V blades stator, in a unique Rotor/Stator configuration. The source frequencies are multiples of &lt;math&gt;B \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For the moment we don’t have access to the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. The noise frequencies are also &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, not depending on the number of blades of the stator. Nevertheless, this number V has a predominant role in the noise levels (&lt;math&gt;P_{m}&lt;/math&gt;) and directivity, as it will be discussed later.

''Example''

''For an airplane air-conditioning ventilator, reasonable data are :''

''&lt;math&gt;B=13&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 12000&lt;/math&gt; rnd/min''

''The blade passing frequency is 2600 Hz, so we only have to include the first two multiples (2600 Hz and 5200 Hz), because of the human ear high-sensibility limit. We have to study the frequencies m=1 and m=2.''

== Optimization of the number of blades ==

As the source levels can't be easily modified, we have to focus on the interaction between those levels and the noise levels.

The transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; contains the following part :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{s =  - \infty }^{s =  + \infty } {e^{ - {{i(mB - sV)\pi } \over 2}} J_{mB - sV} } (mBM)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where m is the Mach number and &lt;math&gt;J_{mB - sV}&lt;/math&gt; the Bessel function of mB-sV order. In order to minimize the influence of the transfer function, the goal is to reduce the value of this Bessel function. To do so, the argument must be smaller than the order of the Bessel function.

''Back to the example :''

''For m=1, with a Mach number M=0.3, the argument of the Bessel function is about 4. We have to avoid having mB-sV inferior than 4. If V=10, we have 13-1x10=3, so there will be a noisy mode. If V=19, the minimum of mB-sV is 6, and the noise emission will be limited.''

''Remark :''

''The case that is to be strictly avoided is when mB-sV can be nul, which causes the order of the Bessel function to be 0. As a consequence, we have to take care having B and V prime numbers.''

== Determination of source levels ==

The minimization of the transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; is a great step in the process of reducing the noise emission. Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, we also have to predict the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significant values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, we will not consider the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV.
The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory, which will not be discussed here.

== Directivity ==

All this study was made for a specific direction : the axis of the Rotor/Stator. All the results are acceptable when the noise reduction is ought to be in this direction. In the case where the noise to reduce is perpendicular to the axis, the results are very different, as those figures shown :

For B=13 and V=13, which is the worst case, we see that the sound level is very high on the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Acoustics 1313.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt;

For B=13 and V=19, the sound level is very low on the axis but high perpendicularly to the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = Pi/2&lt;/math&gt;)

== Kowey's notes ==

I'm using this section to note my thoughts down as I struggle to understand monad transformers.  Perhaps these bits and pieces can then be used to build a tutorial.  Don't pay it any heed.  I'll clean it up as things become clearer to me and share them with the wikibooks community.

Perhaps one useful trick to understanding this is not to think in terms of embedding one monad instead another, but of combining two monads into a third super-monad with functionality from both.

Or another way to look at is that that monad transformers are devious creatures: we talk about them as if we're running a monad inside of another, but what we're &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doing is threading the so-called outer-monad through in so-called inner monad.

* http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html



=== lift (or liftM for monads) ===

Ok, so you use &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; to lift non-monadic functions into a monad.  Similarly, monad transformers are monads which provide a function &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; to lift functions from one monad into another.  So, &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; isn't anything fancy; it's just the same thing as &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; for monads. 

 class MonadTrans t where
  lift :: Monad m =&gt; m a -&gt; t m a

Wait a sec: why is it that all of a sudden, our lift function only takes one argument and not two?

:It looks to me like lift is now lifting ''any'' monadic value, not just functions. Let's see here:

 liftM :: Monad m                 =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
 lift  :: (Monad m, MonadTrans t) =&gt; m a      -&gt; t m a

:I'm not sure how well these unify, but hopefully this answers your question. --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 17:10, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

::Whoops! Sorry, I didn't mean to leave these old notes lying around.  I think I'm ok with &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; now (see the module page).  If you want to help me understand arrows, though, see [[Talk:Programming:Haskell arrows/Kowey]] :-D -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:27, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Squeee! ==

Nothing serious, but today I figured out how to use the State monad (hurray for me), and I wrote a silly program using a state-monad transformer! I think I'm finally getting this stuff :-)

 bottle :: StateT Int IO Int
 bottle = do
   t &lt;- get
   liftIO $ putStrLn $ show t ++ &quot; bottles of beer on the wall!&quot;
   put (t - 1)
   return (t - 1)
 
 countBottles :: StateT Int IO ()
 countBottles = do
   n &lt;- bottle
   if n == 0 then liftIO $ return () else countBottles
 
 bottles :: Int -&gt; IO ((), Int)
 bottles = runStateT (countBottles)

Thank you, wikibooks folks!

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Same for List.

::::: Eep! You're quite right... hmm... maybe worth taking a second look at that MaybeT... Sorry, I wasn't reading carefully enough.  Thought you were talking about the other way around  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:29, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

=== StateT definition ===
I don't see the point of the extra return and (&lt;-) operator in the implementation of the bind operator of StateT:
&lt;pre&gt;
(StateT x) &gt;&gt;= f =
 StateT $ \s -&gt; do -- get new value, state
 (v,s') &lt;- x s
 -- apply bound function to get new state transformation fn
 (StateT x') &lt;- return $ f v
 -- apply the state transformation fn to the new state
 x' s'
&lt;/pre&gt;
Couldn't we use let instead?:
&lt;pre&gt;
(StateT x) &gt;&gt;= f =
 StateT $ \s -&gt; do -- get new value, state
 (v,s') &lt;- x s
 -- apply bound function to get new state transformation fn
 let (StateT x') = f v
 -- apply the state transformation fn to the new state
 x' s'
&lt;/pre&gt;
-- [[User:Auders|Auders]] ([[User talk:Auders|talk]]) 20:28, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:Yes, the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is bad style here. Changed to &lt;code&gt;runStateT&lt;/code&gt; to mimic the use of &lt;code&gt;runState&lt;/code&gt;.-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 10:16, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

# Could a motivating example be put near the beginning of this article, e.g. something that shows exactly why you would use a transformer and how you'd use it to combine actions from two different monads.
# The table of transformers in the &quot;cousins&quot; section should include a row for MaybeT since MaybeT is explained in detail further down.  MaybeT is probably a good candidate for the motivating example above as well, since Maybe is such a simple monad.  So you'd have an example of using MaybeT near the top, then go on to the implementation explanation further down.  Any other transformers mentioned in the article should also be put in the table, if they're not already there.
# I'm a bit fuzzy about this but &quot;The type constructor Reader r is an instance of the Monad class&quot; looks a little odd to me; I thought that types (not type constructors) were instances of type classes.  Am I missing something?  If there's a distinction, is it just a pedantic one?  
:Thanks.

:# Yes. The chapters about monads are currently undergoing a rewrite, starting with [[Haskell/Understanding monads]]. So, this chapter will be rewritten too and get motivation, but I can't say when :-)  
:# Yes. Someone please do so.
:# Type constructors (i.e. things of kind &lt;code&gt;* -&gt; *&lt;/code&gt;) can indeed be instances of classes two. In fact, this feature was added to Haskell exactly to make the monad class possible. So, the the constructor &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; is the monad, not the &quot;concrete&quot; type &lt;code&gt;Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; (of kind &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). [[Haskell/Understanding monads]] already contains a bit of info on this.

: I'm not sure I want to be tinkering with the article text, but here's a motivating example I emailed a friend once. I think it's right. It may be of some use:

:: Concrete example: Suppose I was writing a server. Each client thread must be of type IO () (that's because forkIO :: IO () -&gt; IO ThreadID)).

:: Suppose also that this server has some configuration that (in an imperative program) would be global that the clients all need to query.

:: &gt; data Config = Config Foo Bar Baz

:: One way of doing this is to use currying and making all the client threads of type Config -&gt; IO (). Not too nice because any functions they call have to be passed the Config parameter manually. The Reader monad solves this problem but we've already got one monad. We need to wrap IO in a ReaderT. The type constructor for ReaderT is ReaderT r m a, with r the shared environment to read from, m the inner monad and a the return type. Our client_func becomes:

:: &gt; client_func :: ReaderT Config IO ()

:: We can then use the ask, asks and local functions as if Reader was the only Monad:

:: (these examples are inside do blocks)

:: &gt; p &lt;- asks port

:: (Assuming some function port :: Config -&gt; Int or similar.)

:: To do stuff in IO (or in the general case any inner monad) the liftIO function is used to make an IO function work in this wrapped space:

:: (given h :: Handle, the client's handle)

:: &gt; liftIO $ hPutStrLn h &quot;You lose&quot;
:: &gt; liftIO $ hFlush h

:: IO is once again special. For other inner monads, the lift function does the same thing. Note also that IO has no transformer and must therefore always be the innermost monad.

:: This is all well and good, but the client_func now has type ReaderT Config IO () and forkIO needs a function of type IO (). The escape function for Reader is runReader :: Reader r a -&gt; r -&gt; a and similarly for ReaderT the escape function is runReaderT :: ReaderT r m a -&gt; r -&gt; m a:

:: (Given some c :: Config that's been assembled from config files or the like)

:: &gt; forkIO (runReaderT client_func c)

:: Will do the trick.

:: Monad transformers are like onions. They make you cry but you learn to appreciate them. Like onions, they're also made of layers. Each layer is the functionality of a new monad, you lift monadic functions to get into the inner monads and you have transformerised functions to unwrap each layer. They're also like a present in that regard: in this example we unwrapped the outer wrapping paper to get to the present: an object of type IO (), which let us make haskell do something.

== Dead links. ==

Please fix up the ghc documentation links. Thanks for the great tutorial.

== 2012-05-06 reorganization ==

I have just performed a major reorganization in the article. The getPassword example, which introduces transformers though MaybeT, was made slightly more detailed to work better as an introduction. The corresponding section about MaybeT further in the page was removed, along with most references to the sandwich analogy (though I left a body note about it near the beginning). The dissection of ListT was grouped at the end with the StateT discussion; the lift section now precedes it. The older introduction is mostly gone, with only the All About Monads derived part (the one with the table) remaining, and even that was completely reworked to fit the surrounding context (a later addition to it, which tried to generalize the non-generalizable was summarily removed). Hopefully you will find the text much more readable now. There are still improvements to be made - IMO, the key one is adding better practical exercises (I have a few ideas about that) and providing solutions to the existing ones. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 13:22, 6 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Monads}}

By this point you should have grasped the concept of monad, and what different monads are used for: &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; for impure functions, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; for values that can be there or not, and so on.
With monads providing such useful general-purpose functionalities, it is very natural that sometimes we would like to use the capabilities of ''several'' monads at once - for instance, a function which uses both I/O and &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; exception handling. Sure, we can use a type like &lt;code&gt;IO (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt;, but that forces us to do pattern matching within the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks to extract the values you want: the point of monads was also to get rid of that.

Enter '''monad transformers''': special types that allow us to roll two monads into a single one that shares the behaviour of both. We will begin with an example to illustrate why transformers are useful and show a simple example of how they work. 

== Password validation ==

Consider a common real-life problem for IT staff worldwide: to get their users to select passwords that are not easy to guess.
A typical strategy is to force the user to enter a password with a minimum length, and at least one letter, one number and similar irritating requirements.

A Haskell function to acquire a password from a user could look like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getPassword :: IO (Maybe String)
getPassword = do s &lt;- getLine
                 if isValid s then return $ Just s
                              else return Nothing

-- The validation test could be anything we want it to be.
isValid :: String -&gt; Bool
isValid s = length s &gt;= 8 &amp;&amp; any isAlpha s &amp;&amp; any isNumber s &amp;&amp; any isPunctuation s
&lt;/source&gt;

First and foremost, &lt;code&gt;getPassword&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; function, as it needs to get input from the user, and so it will not always return. We also use &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, as we intend to return &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; in case the password does not pass the &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt;. Note, however, that we aren't actually using &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; as a monad here: the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block is in the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, and we just happen to &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; value into it.

The true motivation for monad transformers is not only to make it easier to write &lt;code&gt;getPassword&lt;/code&gt; (which it nevertheless does), but rather to simplify all the code instances in which we use it. Our password acquisition program could continue like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
askPassword :: IO ()
askPassword = do putStrLn &quot;Insert your new password:&quot;
                 maybe_value &lt;- getPassword
                 if isJust maybe_value 
                     then do putStrLn &quot;Storing in database...&quot;
                     -- ... other stuff, including 'else'
&lt;/source&gt;
We need one line to generate the &lt;code&gt;maybe_value&lt;/code&gt; variable, and then we have to do some further checking to figure out whether our password is OK or not.

With monad transformers, we will be able to extract the password in one go, without any pattern matching or equivalent bureaucracy like &lt;code&gt;isJust&lt;/code&gt;. The gains for our simple example might seem small, but will scale up for more complex situations.

== A simple monad transformer: &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; ==

To simplify &lt;code&gt;getPassword&lt;/code&gt; function and all the code that uses it, we will define a ''monad transformer'' that gives the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad some characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad; we will call it &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, following the convention that monad transformers have a &quot;&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;&quot; appended to the name of the monad whose characteristics they provide.

&lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper around &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; can be any monad (in our example, we are interested in &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) }
&lt;/source&gt;
This data type definition specifies a &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; type constructor, parametrized over &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, with a term constructor, also called &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, and a convenient accessor function &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, with which we can access the underlying representation.

The whole point of monad transformers is that ''they are monads themselves''; and so we need to make &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt; an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad m =&gt; Monad (MaybeT m) where
    return  = MaybeT . return . Just
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;, which injects into the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad, a generic &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; that injects into &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; (whatever it is), and the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; constructor.
It would also have been possible (though arguably less readable) to write &lt;code&gt;return  = MaybeT . return . return&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    x &gt;&gt;= f = MaybeT $ do maybe_value &lt;- runMaybeT x
                          case maybe_value of
                               Nothing    -&gt; return Nothing
                               Just value -&gt; runMaybeT $ f value
&lt;/source&gt;
Like for all monads, the bind operator is the heart of the transformer, and the most important snippet for understanding how it works. As always, it is useful to keep the type signature in mind. The type of the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; bind is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- The signature of (&gt;&gt;=), specialized to MaybeT m
(&gt;&gt;=) :: MaybeT m a -&gt; (a -&gt; MaybeT m b) -&gt; MaybeT m b 
&lt;/source&gt;
Now, let us consider what it does, step by step, starting from the first line of the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block.
* First, it uses the &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; accessor to unwrap &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt; computation. That gives away the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block is in &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;.
* Still in the first line, &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; extracts a &lt;code&gt;Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; value from the unwrapped computation.
* The &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement tests &lt;code&gt;maybe_value&lt;/code&gt;:
** if it is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, it returns &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;;
** if it is a &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;, it applies &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; inside it. Since &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m b&lt;/code&gt; as result type, we need an extra &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; to put the result back into the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; monad.
* Finally, the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block as a whole has &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe b)&lt;/code&gt; type; so it is wrapped with the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; constructor. 
It may look a bit complicated; but other than for the copious amounts of wrapping and unwrapping, the implementation does the same as the familiar bind operator of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;:  

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- (&gt;&gt;=) for the Maybe monad
    maybe_value &gt;&gt;= f = case maybe_value of
                            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                            Just value -&gt; f value
&lt;/source&gt;

You may wonder why we are using the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; constructor before the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block, when inside it we use the accessor &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt;: however, the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block must be in the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; monad, not in &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt;, since for the latter we have not yet defined the bind operator.

{{body note|The chained functions in the definition of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; suggest an analogy, which you may find either useful or confusing, between the combined monad and a ''sandwich''. In this example, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, the &quot;base&quot; monad, would be the bottom layer; the inner monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, the filling; and the transformer &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, the top layer. There is some danger in the analogy in that it might suggest there are three layers of monads in action, while in fact there are only two: the inner monad and the combined monad (there are no binds or returns done in the base monad; it only appears as part of the implementation of the transformer). A better way of interpreting the analogy is thinking of the transformer and the base monad as two parts of the same thing - the ''bread'' - which wraps the inner monad.}}

Technically, this is all we need; however, it is convenient to make &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; an instance of a few other classes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad m =&gt; MonadPlus (MaybeT m) where
    mzero     = MaybeT $ return Nothing
    mplus x y = MaybeT $ do maybe_value &lt;- runMaybeT x
                            case maybe_value of
                                 Nothing    -&gt; runMaybeT y
                                 Just _     -&gt; return maybe_value

instance MonadTrans MaybeT where
    lift = MaybeT . (liftM Just)
&lt;/source&gt;

The latter class, &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt;, implements the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function, which is very useful to take functions from the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; monad and bring them into the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt; monad, so that we can use them in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks inside the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt; monad. As for &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of that class it makes sense to make the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; an instance too.

=== Application to the password example ===

With all this done, here is what the previous example of password management looks like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getValidPassword :: MaybeT IO String
getValidPassword = do s &lt;- lift getLine
                      guard (isValid s) -- MonadPlus provides guard.
                      return s

askPassword :: MaybeT IO ()
askPassword = do lift $ putStrLn &quot;Insert your new password:&quot;
                 value &lt;- getValidPassword
                 lift $ putStrLn &quot;Storing in database...&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
The code is now simpler, especially in the user function &lt;code&gt;askPassword&lt;/code&gt;. Most importantly, we do not have to manually check whether the result is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;: the bind operator takes care of that for us.

Note how we use &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; to bring the functions &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT IO&lt;/code&gt; monad. Also, since &lt;code&gt;MaybeT IO&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, checking for password validity can be taken care of by a &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; statement, which will return &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;IO Nothing&lt;/code&gt;) in case of a bad password.

Incidentally, with the help of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; it also becomes very easy to ask the user ''ad infinitum'' for a valid password:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
askPassword :: MaybeT IO ()
askPassword = do lift $ putStrLn &quot;Insert your new password:&quot;
                 value &lt;- msum $ repeat getValidPassword
                 lift $ putStrLn &quot;Storing in database...&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== A plethora of transformers ==

The modules of the &lt;tt&gt;transformers&lt;/tt&gt; package provide transformers for many common monads (&lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, can be found in {{Haskell lib|p=transformers|v=latest|Control|Monad|Trans|Maybe}}). They are defined consistently with their non-transformer versions; that is, the implementation is basically the same, only with the extra wrapping and unwrapping needed to thread the other monad. From this point on, we will refer to the non-transformer monad on which the transformer is based as the '''base monad''', and to the other monad, on which the transformer is applied, as the '''inner monad'''. 

To pick an arbitrary example, &lt;code&gt;ReaderT Env IO String&lt;code&gt; is a computation which involves reading values from some environment of type &lt;code&gt;Env&lt;/code&gt; (the semantics of &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt;, the base monad) and performing some &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in order to give a value of type &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. Since the bind operator and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; for the transformer mirror the semantics of the base monad, a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block of type &lt;code&gt;ReaderT Env IO String&lt;/code&gt; will, from the outside, look a lot like a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block of the &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; monad; the main difference being that &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; actions become trivial to embed by using &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Type juggling ===

We have seen that the type constructor for &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper for a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; value in the inner monad, and so the corresponding accessor &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; gives us a value of type &lt;code&gt;m&amp;nbsp;(Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt; - that is, a value of the base monad returned in the inner monad. In a similar fashion, we have
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runListT :: ListT m a -&gt; m [a]
&lt;/source&gt;
and
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runErrorT :: ErrorT e m a -&gt; m (Either e a)
&lt;/source&gt;
for the list and error transformers.

Not all transformers are related to their base monads in this way, however. The &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monads have in common that, unlike the base monads in the examples above, they have neither multiple constructors nor constructors with multiple arguments. For that reason, they have &lt;tt&gt;run...&lt;/tt&gt; functions, which act as simple unwrappers analogous to the &lt;tt&gt;run...T&lt;/tt&gt; of the transformer versions. The table below shows the result types of the &lt;tt&gt;run...&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;run...T&lt;/tt&gt; functions in each case, which may be thought of as the types wrapped by the base and transformed monads respectively.&lt;ref&gt;The wrapping interpretation is only literally true for versions of the &lt;tt&gt;mtl&lt;/tt&gt; package older than 2.0.0.0 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- bgcolor=&quot;#cc9999&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;

!|Combined Type&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;(&quot;wrapped&quot; by transformed)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||Writer ||WriterT || &lt;code&gt;(a, w)&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;m (a, w)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||Reader || ReaderT || &lt;code&gt;r -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; ||&lt;code&gt;r -&gt; m a&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||State || StateT || &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; (a, s)&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; m (a, s)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||Cont || ContT ||&lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; r) -&gt; r&lt;/code&gt; ||&lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; m r) -&gt; m r&lt;/code&gt;
|}

The first thing to notice is the base monad is nowhere to be seen in the combined types. That is very natural, as without interesting constructors (like the ones for &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; or lists) there is no reason to retain the base monad type after unwrapping the transformed monad. Besides that, in the three latter cases we have function types being wrapped. &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, turns state-transforming functions of the form &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; (a, s)&lt;/code&gt; into state-transforming functions of the form &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; m (a, s)&lt;/code&gt;; so that only the result type of the wrapped function goes into the inner monad. &lt;code&gt;ReaderT&lt;/code&gt; is analogous, but not &lt;code&gt;ContT&lt;/code&gt;: due to the semantics of &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; (the ''continuation'' monad) the result types of both the wrapped function and its functional argument must be the same, and so the transformer puts both into the inner monad. What these examples show is that in general there is no magic formula to create a transformer version of a monad&amp;mdash;the form of each transformer depends on what makes sense in the context of its non-transformer type.

== Lifting ==

The &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function, which we have first presented in the introduction, is very important in day-to-day usage of transformers; and so we will dedicate a few more words to it. 

=== liftM ===

Let us begin by considering the more familiar &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; function. It has the following type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
liftM :: Monad m =&gt; (a1 -&gt; r) -&gt; m a1 -&gt; m r
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; applies a function &lt;code&gt;(a1 -&gt; r)&lt;/code&gt; to a value within a monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;. If you prefer the point-free interpretation, it converts a regular function into one that acts within &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; - and ''that'' is what is meant by lifting. 

To recapitulate, here is a simple example of &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; usage. The following pieces of code all mean the same thing.

{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!|do notation
!|liftM
!|liftM as an operator
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
do x &lt;- monadicValue
   return (f x)
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
liftM f monadicValue
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f `liftM` monadicValue
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The third example, in which we use &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; as an operator, suggests an interesting way of viewing &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt;: it is a monadic analogue of &lt;code&gt;($)&lt;/code&gt;!

{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!|non monadic
!|monadic
|-
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f $ value
&lt;/source&gt;
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f `liftM` monadicValue
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

=== lift ===

When using combined monads created with monad transformers, we avoid having to manage the inner monad types explicitly, resulting in clearer, simpler code. Instead of creating additional do-blocks within the computation to manipulate values in the inner monad type, we can use lifting operations to bring functions from the inner monad into the combined monad.

With &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; we have seen how the essence of lifting is, to paraphrase the documentation, promoting something into a monad. The &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function, available for all monad transformers, performs a different kind of lifting: it promotes a computation from the inner monad into the combined monad. &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; is defined as the single method of the &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt; class in {{Haskell lib|p=transformers|v=latest|Control|Monad|Trans|Class}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class MonadTrans t where
    lift :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; t m a
&lt;/source&gt;

There is a variant of &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; specific to &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; operations called &lt;code&gt;liftIO&lt;/code&gt;, which is the single method of the &lt;code&gt;MonadIO&lt;/code&gt; class in {{Haskell lib|p=transformers|v=latest|Control|Monad|IO|Class}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class (Monad m) =&gt; MonadIO m where
   liftIO :: IO a -&gt; m a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;liftIO&lt;/code&gt; can be convenient when having multiple transformers stacked into a single combined monad. In such cases, &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is always the innermost monad, and so more than one lift would be typically needed to bring &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; values to the top of the stack. &lt;code&gt;liftIO&lt;/code&gt;, however, is defined for the instances in a way that allows us to bring n &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; value from any depth while writing the function a single time.

=== Implementing &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; ===

Implementing &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; is usually pretty straightforward. Consider the transformer &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance MonadTrans MaybeT where
    lift m = MaybeT (m &gt;&gt;= return . Just)
&lt;/source&gt;

We begin with a monadic value of the inner monad - the middle layer, if you prefer the monadic sandwich analogy. Using the bind operator and a type constructor for the base monad, we slip the bottom slice (the base monad) under the middle layer. Finally we place the top slice of our sandwich by using the constructor &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;. So using the lift function, we have transformed a lowly piece of sandwich filling into a bona-fide three-layer monadic sandwich. Note that, just as in the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; class, both the bind operator and the generic &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; are working within the confines of the inner monad.

{{Exercises|1=
# Why is it that the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function has to be defined separately for each monad, where as &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; can be defined in a universal way?
# Implement the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function for the &lt;code&gt;ListT&lt;/code&gt; transformer.
# How would you lift a regular function into a monad transformer? Hint: very easily.
}}

== Implementing transformers ==

In order to develop a better feel for the workings of transformers, we will discuss two more implementations in the standard libraries.

===The List transformer===

Just as with the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; transformer, we start by creating a datatype with a constructor that takes one argument:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype ListT m a = ListT { runListT :: m [a] }
&lt;/source&gt;

The implementation of the &lt;code&gt;ListT m&lt;/code&gt; monad is also strikingly similar to its &quot;cousin&quot;, the list monad. We do the same operations done for &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but with a little extra support to operate within the inner monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, and to pack and unpack the monadic sandwich.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!| List
!| ListT
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad [] where
    return x = [x]
    xs &gt;&gt;= f =
        let yss = map f xs
        in concat yss
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance (Monad m) =&gt; Monad (ListT m) where
    return x = ListT $ return [x]
    tm &gt;&gt;= f = ListT $ runListT tm
               &gt;&gt;= \xs -&gt; mapM (runListT . f) xs
               &gt;&gt;= \yss -&gt; return (concat yss)
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

{{Exercises|1=
# Dissect the bind operator for the (ListT m) monad.  For example, why do we now have &lt;code&gt;mapM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;?
# &lt;code&gt;Identity&lt;/code&gt; is a trivial monad defined, in &lt;code&gt;Data.Functor.Identity&lt;/code&gt;, as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;newtype Identity a = Identity { runIdentity :: a }&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;instance Monad Identity where&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return a = Identity a&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;m &gt;&gt;= k  = k (runIdentity m)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Write a monad transformer &lt;code&gt;IdentityT&lt;/code&gt;, which would be the transforming cousin of the &lt;code&gt;Identity&lt;/code&gt; monad.
# Would &lt;code&gt;IdentityT SomeMonad&lt;/code&gt; be equivalent to &lt;code&gt;SomeMonadT Identity&lt;/code&gt; for a given monad and its transformer cousin?
}}

===The State transformer===

Previously, we have pored over the implementation of one simple monad transformer, &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, and reviewed the implementation of another, &lt;code&gt;ListT&lt;/code&gt;, taking a detour along the way to talk about lifting from a monad into its transformer variant. Here, we will bring the two ideas together by taking a detailed look at the implementation of one of the more interesting transformers in the standard library, &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt;. Studying this transformer will build insight into the transformer mechanism that you can call upon when using monad transformers in your code. You might want to review the section on the [[Haskell/Understanding monads/State|State monad]] before continuing.

Just as the State monad might have been built upon the definition &lt;code&gt;newtype State s a = State { runState :: (s -&gt; (a,s)) }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mtl&lt;/code&gt; packages, &lt;code&gt;State s&lt;/code&gt; is implemented as a type synonym for &lt;code&gt;StateT s Identity&lt;/code&gt;. Incidentally, that explains why there was a &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; function instead of the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; constructor [[Haskell/Understanding_monads/State#Before_You_Ask...|back in the chapter about &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;]], and why we had to defer the explanation until now.&lt;/ref&gt; the StateT transformer is built upon the definition 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype StateT s m a = StateT { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (a,s)) }&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;State&amp;nbsp;s&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of both the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; class and the &lt;code&gt;MonadState&amp;nbsp;s&lt;/code&gt; class (which provides &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt;), so &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/code&gt; should also be members of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MonadState&amp;nbsp;s&lt;/code&gt; classes. Furthermore, if &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/code&gt; should also be a member of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;.

To define &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance:

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|State
!|StateT
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
||&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype State s a =
  State { runState :: (s -&gt; (a,s)) }

instance Monad (State s) where
  return a        = State $ \s -&gt; (a,s)
  (State x) &gt;&gt;= f = State $ \s -&gt;
    let (v,s') = x s
    in runState (f v) s'
&lt;/source&gt;
||&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype StateT s m a =
  StateT { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (a,s)) }

instance (Monad m) =&gt; Monad (StateT s m) where
  return a         = StateT $ \s -&gt; return (a,s)
  (StateT x) &gt;&gt;= f = StateT $ \s -&gt; do
    (v,s') &lt;- x s          -- get new value and state
    runStateT (f v) s'     -- pass them to f
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Our definition of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; makes use of the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function of the inner monad, and the binding operator uses a do-block to perform a computation in the inner monad.

We also want to declare all combined monads that use the &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; transformer to be instances of the &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; class, so we will have to give definitions for &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt;: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance (Monad m) =&gt; MonadState s (StateT s m) where
  get   = StateT $ \s -&gt; return (s,s)
  put s = StateT $ \_ -&gt; return ((),s)
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, we want to declare all combined monads in which &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; is used with an instance of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; to be instances of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance (MonadPlus m) =&gt; MonadPlus (StateT s m) where
  mzero = StateT $ \s -&gt; mzero
  (StateT x1) `mplus` (StateT x2) = StateT $ \s -&gt; (x1 s) `mplus` (x2 s)
&lt;/source&gt;

The final step to make our monad transformer fully integrated with Haskell's monad classes is to make &lt;code&gt;StateT s&lt;/code&gt; an instance of the &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt; class by providing a &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance MonadTrans (StateT s) where
  lift c = StateT $ \s -&gt; c &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return (x,s))
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function creates a &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; state transformation function that binds the computation in the inner monad to a function that packages the result with the input state. The result is that, if for instance we apply StateT to the List monad, a function that returns a list (i.e., a computation in the List monad) can be lifted
into &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;[]&lt;/code&gt;, where it becomes a function that returns a &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;(s&amp;nbsp;-&gt;&amp;nbsp;[(a,s)])&lt;/code&gt;. That is, the lifted computation produces ''multiple'' (value,state) pairs from its input state. The effect of this is to &quot;fork&quot; the computation in StateT, creating a different branch of the computation for each value in the list returned by the lifted function. Of course, applying &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; to a different monad will produce different semantics for the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Men who support the philosophy of feminism are often referred to as &quot;male ''profeminists''&quot;. Some men (and women) would rather simply be referred to as egalitarians, without using the word &quot;feminism&quot; or any of its derivatives. Egalitarianism is said by some to differ from feminism in that feminism is specific advocacy for the rights or status of women, whereas egalitarianism is a belief in the &quot;gender equity principle&quot; without particular focus on either sex. In femanist literature Egalitarianism was formerly called &quot;equity feminism&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics Sound Speed.jpg|center]]

The '''speed of sound''' ''c'' (from Latin ''celeritas'', &quot;velocity&quot;) varies depending on the medium through which the sound waves pass. It is usually quoted in describing properties of substances (e.g. see the article on sodium). In conventional use and in scientific literature sound velocity ''v'' is the same as sound speed ''c''. Sound velocity ''c'' or velocity of sound should not be confused with sound particle velocity ''v'', which is the velocity of the individual particles.

More commonly the term refers to the speed of sound in air. The speed varies depending on atmospheric conditions; the most important factor is the temperature. The humidity has very little effect on the speed of sound, while the static sound pressure (air pressure) has none. Sound travels slower with an increased altitude (elevation if you are on solid earth), primarily as a result of temperature and humidity changes. An approximate speed (in metres per second) can be calculated from: 
:&lt;math&gt;
c_{\mathrm{air}} = (331{.}5 + (0{.}6 \cdot \theta)) \ \mathrm{m/s}\, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta\, &lt;/math&gt; (theta) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

== Details ==

A more accurate expression for the speed of sound is 
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {\kappa \cdot R\cdot T} 
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''R'' (287.05 J/(kg·K) for air) is the gas constant for air: the universal gas constant &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which units of J/(mol·K), is divided by the molar mass of air, as is common practice in aerodynamics)
*&amp;kappa; (kappa) is the adiabatic index (1.402 for air), sometimes noted ''&amp;gamma;''
* ''T'' is the absolute temperature in kelvins. 

In the standard atmosphere :

''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 273.15 K (= 0&amp;#160;°C = 32&amp;#160;°F), giving a value of 331.5 m/s (= 1087.6 ft/s = 1193 km/h = 741.5 mph = 643.9 knots).&lt;br&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; is 293.15 K (= 20&amp;#160;°C = 68&amp;#160;°F), giving a value of 343.4 m/s (= 1126.6 ft/s = 1236 km/h = 768.2 mph = 667.1 knots).&lt;br&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; is 298.15 K (= 25&amp;#160;°C = 77&amp;#160;°F), giving a value of 346.3 m/s (= 1136.2 ft/s = 1246 km/h = 774.7 mph = 672.7 knots).

In fact, assuming an ideal gas, the speed of sound ''c'' depends on temperature only, '''not on the pressure'''. Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere - ''actual conditions may vary''. Any qualification of the speed of sound being &quot;at sea level&quot; is also irrelevant. Speed of sound varies with altitude (height) only because of the changing temperature!

In a '''Non-Dispersive Medium''' &amp;#8211; Sound speed is independent of frequency, therefore the speed of energy transport and sound propagation are the same. For audio sound range air is a non-dispersive medium. We should also note that air contains CO2 which is a dispersive medium and it introduces dispersion to air at ultrasound frequencies (28kHz).&lt;br&gt;
In a '''Dispersive Medium''' &amp;#8211; Sound speed is a function of frequency. The spatial and temporal distribution of a propagating disturbance will continually change. Each frequency component
propagates at each its own phase speed, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the
group velocity. Water is an example of a dispersive medium.

In general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt{\frac{C}{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:''C'' is a coefficient of stiffness
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density

Thus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness of the material, and decreases with the density.

In a fluid the only non-zero stiffness is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces). 

Hence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {\frac{K}{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''K'' is the adiabatic bulk modulus 

For a gas, ''K'' is approximately given by
:&lt;math&gt;
K=\kappa \cdot p
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&amp;kappa; is the adiabatic index, sometimes called &amp;gamma;.
:''p'' is the pressure.

Thus, for a gas the speed of sound can be  calculated using:
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {{\kappa \cdot p}\over\rho}
&lt;/math&gt;
which using the ideal gas law is identical to: 

&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {\kappa \cdot R\cdot T} 
&lt;/math&gt;

(Newton famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of thermodynamics and so incorrectly used isothermal calculations instead of adiabatic.  His result was missing the factor of &amp;kappa; but was otherwise correct.)

In a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric and shear deformations. Hence, in a solid it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent on the deformation mode.

In a solid rod (with thickness much smaller than the wavelength) the speed of sound is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:''E'' is Young's modulus
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (rho) is density

Thus in steel the speed of sound is approximately 5100 m/s.&lt;br&gt;

In a solid with lateral dimensions much larger than the wavelength, the sound velocity is higher. It is found by replacing Young's modulus with the plane wave modulus, which can be expressed in terms of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio as:
:&lt;math&gt;
M = E \frac{1-\nu}{1-\nu-2\nu^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

For air, see density of air. 

The speed of sound in water is of interest to those mapping the ocean floor. In saltwater, sound travels at about 1500 m/s and in freshwater 1435 m/s.  These speeds vary due to pressure, depth, temperature, salinity and other factors.

For general equations of state, if classical mechanics is used, the speed of sound &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
c^2=\frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where differentiation is taken with respect to adiabatic change. 

If relativistic effects are important, the speed of sound &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
S^2=c^2 \left. \frac{\partial p}{\partial e} \right|_{\rm adiabatic}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that &lt;math&gt; e= \rho (c^2+e^C) \,&lt;/math&gt; is the relativisic internal energy density).  

This formula differs from the classical case in that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; has been replaced by &lt;math&gt;e/c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Mach number''' is the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of sound in air (medium).

== Sound in solids ==

In solids, the velocity of sound depends on ''density'' of the material, not its temperature.  Solid materials, such as steel, conduct sound much faster than air.

== Experimental methods ==

In air a range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound. 

=== Single-shot timing methods ===

The simplest concept is the measurement made using two microphones and a fast recording device such as a digital storage scope. This method uses the following idea.

If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:

# The distance between the microphones (x)
# The time delay between the signal reaching the different microphones (t)

Then v = x/t

An older method is to create a sound at one end of a field with an object that can be seen to move when it creates the sound. When the observer sees the sound-creating device act they start a stopwatch and when the observer hears the sound they stop their stopwatch. Again using v = x/t you can calculate the speed of sound. A separation of at least 200 m between the two experimental parties is required for good results with this method.

=== Other methods ===

In these methods the time measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time (frequency).

Kundt's tube is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume, it has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the nodes and antinodes visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.

A tuning fork can be held near the mouth of a long pipe which is dipping into a barrel of water, in this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ( {1+2n}/λ ) where n is an integer. As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.

Here it is the case that v = fλ

      <text xml:space="preserve">17 jewels is a magic number for a jeweled watch--That is the minimum number needed to jewel all the critical parts on a time-only watch.  Any fewer jewels on a detached lever watch is a budgetary compromise.  Note:  in horology, the terms lever and pallet are interchangeable.

 Jewel Definitions:  

A pivot jewel has a hole in the center.  The pivot from a staff will use that hole as a bearing. 

A cap jewel (also known as an endstone) covers the end of a pivot, helps hold oil in place.  When properly done, will slightly improve performance.  

The impulse jewel is the main part of the balance assembly that the pallet fork contacts. 

Pallet jewels are somewhat rectangular with angled surfaces, the parts of the pallet that touch the escape wheel. 

 The standard jewels, in order of usefulness

Balance wheel pivot jewels  (2) 
Balance wheel cap jewels  (2) (4)
Balance wheel impulse jewel  (1) (5)
Pallet jewels  (2)  (7)

This would be the logical arrangement for a 7 jewel movement. 

pallet pivot jewels (2)  (9)
Escape wheel pivot jewels (2)  (11)
4th wheel pivot jewels (2)  (13)
third wheel pivot jewels (2)  (15)

Some 15 jewel watches will include all of these jewels, while others will include the center wheel jewels but use a pin-lever mechanism in place of the jeweled lever.  

Center wheel pivot jewels (2)  The final necessary jewels.  


 Other places for jewels

Additionally, pairs of cap jewels can be added to the pivots of the fork, escape, fourth and third wheels, in order of usefulness.  Cap jewels on the fork are useful but fairly difficult, while cap jewels on the train are fairly easy.  

Complications can legitimately use jewels--Chronographs and auto-wind systems are two common uses of jewels 

The mainspring arbor may also be jeweled. This is a marginal use of jewels. 
 
 Marketing jewels  [[Image:BudgetWatchJeweledPinlever950.jpg|right|thumb|Pinlever movement with extra cap jewels--Also note the fake balance wheel screws]]

Many watches have jewels added that do not materially improve the watch, but appeal to the &quot;more jewels is better&quot; belief.   In some cases, a 15 jewel pinlever movement will have an extra set of cap jewels added to get to the magic 17.  Timex made a very odd 21 jewel watch, based on their zero-jewel pinlever designs.  In these, the balance had no cap or pivot jewels, but most of the train had cap jewels of marginal value, in addition to somewhat useful pivot jewels.   Waltham made a 75 and 100 jewel watch with a standard 17 jewel movement enhanced by the addition of jewels around the rim of the watch theoretically to prevent the rotor from wearing the movement if it was impacted.  see [[http://www.timezone.com/library/workbench/workbench0025 this article on Timezone.com]] for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Overview:  

The crown (of a manual wind) or the rotor (of an auto wind) rotates, turning gears in the keyless works which in turn rotate  the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring.  The mainspring turns the mainspring barrel, which turns the train, which supplies power to the escapement, which slows the train down to a precicesly regulated speed.  

 The Keyless works

In the winding position, turning the crown turns the winding pinion. Clockwise (as viewed from the crown) the winding pinion will turn the clutch wheel, which will turn an intermediate wheel and then a gear attached to the mainspring arbor.  Counterclockwise, the winding pinion and clutch wheel have ramped teeth that will disengage.  

In the setting position, the winding pinion moves away from the clutch wheel and towards the center of the watch where it engages an intermediate wheel that in turn engages the minute wheel.  

 The Train

The train consists of the center wheel, which turns at one revolution per hour.  The center wheel drives the third wheel and also the motion works.  The third wheel drives the fourth wheel usually at 1 revolution per minute.  In direct seconds watches, the fourth wheel directly drives the seconds hand.  

 The Motion Works
The cannon pinion is attached with a friction fit to the center wheel.  It drives thhe minute wheel, and also holds the minute hand.  The hour wheel slips over the cannon pinion, and is driven by the minute wheel, using the cannon pinion as it's axle.  

During setting, the intermediate wheel will be turned by the winding pinion, and will turn the minute wheel, which will make the cannon pinion slip on the center wheel shaft.  

 The Escapement

The escapement consists of the balance, hairspring, lever and escape wheel.  When force is applied to the escape wheel by the fourth wheel, it will begin to turn, forcing  one of the pallet jewels (referred to as jewel A) away, but bringing the other pallet jewel (B) into position to stop the movement after a 1/2 tooth rotation.  The tail end of the fork will send an impulse to the balance through the impulse jewel.  This will cause the balance to rotate in one direction until it is reversed by the tension of the hairspring.  When the balance reverses, it will push the fork in the oppoisite direction, moving jewel B out of the way, and allowing the escape wheel to rotate. As the escape rotates, it supplies an impule to jewel B, which will again send an impulse through the tail (in the opposite direction of the first one) to the balance wheel, causing it to rotate.  Additionally, jewel A will move into position to block the rotatin of the escape wheel after 1/2 tooth of rotation.  Once again the balance will be reversed by the hairspring, moving jewel A agian until it can again be pushed out of the way, repeating the cycle. 

The mass of the balance wheel and the length and stiffness of the hairspring combine to have a natural resonant frequency--generally between 5 and 8 half-cycles (or beats) per second on a wristwatch. Each beat will cause one jump of the seconds hand.  The outside of the hairspring is held to the balance cock by the hairspring stud, while the inside is held to the balance by the collet.    Generally either the stud or the collet is moveable to allow the balance to be adjusted &quot;in beat&quot;, where the motion is centered on the fork rather than turning farther in one direciton than the other. 

In most watches, the hairspring will pass through the regulator, a slot on a moveable arm.  When this arm is moved closer to the stud, the working length of the spring is longer, slowing the resonant frequencey, causing the watch to run slower.  Moving it away from the stud speeds the watch up.  A few watches have no regulator, instead relying on moveable weights on the balance to adjust the resonant frequency and rate of the watch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello.

I'm a 32-year-old tax advisor from London. I'm here to write a wikibook on [[Taxation in the United Kingdom]]. I'm starting with corporation tax, as that's my specialism. If you can contribute, either by adding content on corporation tax or other tax issues, or by asking questions or critiquing the text, please do.

I'm also writing up [[Wikijunior Kings and Queens of England]]. Again, if you're interested, please come and help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics anechoic reverberation.JPG|center]]

== Introduction ==

Acoustic experiments often require to realise measurements in rooms with special characteristics. Two types of rooms can be distinguished: anechoic rooms and reverberation rooms.

== Anechoic room ==

The principle of this room is to simulate a free field. In a free space, the acoustic waves are propagated from the source to infinity. In a room, the reflections of the sound on the walls produce a wave which is propagated in the opposite direction and comes back to the source. In anechoic rooms, the walls are very absorbent in order to eliminate these reflections. The sound seems to die down rapidly.
The materials used on the walls are rockwool, glasswool or foams, which are materials that absorb sound in relatively wide frequency bands. Cavities are dug in the wool so that the large wavelength corresponding to bass frequencies are absorbed too.
Ideally the sound pressure level of a punctual sound source decreases about 6 dB per a distance doubling.

Anechoic rooms are used in the following experiments:

&lt;center&gt;
Intensimetry: measurement of the acoustic power of a source. 
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
Study of the source directivity. 
&lt;/center&gt;

== Reverberation room ==

The walls of a reverberation room mostly consist of concrete and are covered with reflecting paint. Alternative design consist of sandwich panels with metal surface. The sound reflects a lot of time on the walls before dying down. It gives a similar impression of a sound in a cathedral. Ideally all sound energy is absorbed by air.
Because of all these reflections, a lot of plane waves with different directions of propagation interfere in each point of the room. Considering all the waves is very complicated so the acoustic field is simplified by the diffuse field hypothesis: the field is homogeneous and isotropic. Then the pressure level is uniform in the room. The truth of this thesis increases with ascending frequency, resulting in a lower limiting frequency for each reverberation room, where the density of standing waves is sufficient.

Several conditions are required for this approximation:
The absorption coefficient of the walls must be very low (α&lt;0.2)
The room must have geometrical irregularities (non-parallel walls, diffusor objects) to avoid nodes of pressure of the resonance modes.

With this hypothesis, the theory of Sabine can be applied. It deals with the reverberation time which is the time required to the sound level to decrease of 60dB. T depends on the volume of the room V, the absorption coefficient αi and the area Si of the different materials in the room :

Reverberation rooms are used in the following experiments:
&lt;center&gt;
measurement of the ability of a material to absorb a sound
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
measurement of the ability of a partition to transmit a sound
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
Intensimetry
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
measurement of sound power
&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Readers should be advised that this Wikibook summary (of the economic dislocations
and the ensuing political realignment of the United States) is the version
that survived in folk mythology and public school textbooks.   The truth
was worse than the sad facts related here.  The impact on American
life was profound and the political about-face into a federal welfare state
was long lasting.  In the form of debate about social security reform, it
haunts US electoral politics still.  As recounted here, the story demonizes
Hoover for all the wrong reasons.  There was nothing &quot;classical&quot; about Hoover's
economics, and his many interventions rather than being &quot;laissez-faire&quot; are
likely causes of the crash; culminating in the Smoot-Hawley tariff whose
progress through congress coincided with the collapsing prices almost hour
by hour.  9,000 banks failed in that era in part because banking law confined
their savings and loan portfolios to one geographic region, preventing
diversification and protecting marginal banks from competitive pressures.
Agricultural practices blamed for the Dust Bowl began during WWI, when the
Wilson administration subsidized food production so generously (&quot;Wheat at any price&quot;)
that marginal prairie land was hastily cultivated.   A mechanism for
the nationwide credit expansion of the 1920s had recently been systematized
under the (1913) Federal Reserve Board.  It was operating to soften the
bursting bubble of those wartime farm prices.  

The true picture of these flawed business practices should be balanced
against some explanation of what incentivized them or protected them from
normal market force corrections.  As many and varied as these structural
problems were, it is a further mistake to credit  FDR's opportunistic
power grab and theft of private resources with their &quot;cure&quot;.
Substantial opinion exists (and contemporary opinion existed) to the contrary.
Like most textbooks, this article practically beatifies FDR for
&quot;acting&quot; and offers scant critical judgement of his programs: just a brief
mention that several were officially certified as unconstitutional - couldn't
those conservative judges get with the program?.  

During the 1930s, Americans were urged (by propaganda and coercive codes) to
de-emphasize private entrepreneurship as a way to build common wealth and
instead to depend upon regimens of &quot;social responsibility&quot; under a
succession of schemes for wealth redistribution, labor force reallocation,
wage and price controls, banking, monetary, and commercial regulation of
numerous sorts, all planned by agencies that held no ownership stake
in the resources they were redeploying.  Although their accomplishments
included many tangible benefits to the nation, on balance the New Deal
decade drained the measurable wealth of America.  Its recovery during
WWII is impressive only relative to the ruination of the Eurasian nations
in whose cities and farms it was fought - American life was not happier,
safer, or easier in wartime, even though employment rebounded.

Although the sad lesson of the (temporary) ruin of the United States is
instructive in the hard facts of economic reality and the folly of
seeking solely political solutions, the Great Depression was not confined
to the U.S.; it affected nearly all industrialized societies.  It stressed
each of their social nets differently, but generally increased the powers
of national governments, which soon sought relief in warfare.
Indeed, the universality of the economic strain tells us that fundamental
laws of economics operated here; thus the academic challenge to explain
events and discover those laws has been pursued by every school of
economic and political thought.

A student interested in busting the many myths repeated by this article should
be wary of political and economic bias in any research materials found. 
Historical perspective does not come cheap.  I hope my contrary telling of
this story piques the reader's interest enough to read further and more critically.

If my version of events rings true in any respect, it may be because it
is rooted in an economic theory that forecasted the crash, and was then villified
by those who found they were benefitting from the bad times.

---------- There, that should seed some discussion, enjoy!   Greg Jaxon

== Need some backgrounder on economics ==

This is an economic topic, and it would be good to cover a few key issues.  Explain what a depression is, and why it's called the Great Depression, and others were named by year. Explain Keynes and classical economics. Explain speculative bubbles (also, avoid using jargon before it's defined). Explain what a &quot;run on the banks&quot; is. Treat the GD as a global phenomenon -- it happened in Europe as well, and was one reason why Hitler came to power and why protectionism was significant.

There are some different theories about &quot;the true nature of the Great Depression&quot; from different schools of thought, and these are controversial ideas that should be avoided.  Instead of getting into deeper detail about fiscal issues, it would be good to broaden the scope of understanding so it's more global, and maybe also deal with how people and families experienced the GD.</text>

I think this introduction would be confusing and information-poor for someone not familiar with the topic. IMHO, it would be better to focus on JavaScript, and give a history of it, and leave it's relationship to HTML and the DOM to the end of the introduction. Yes, the most common use of JavaScript is to script web pages, and but that is a seperate discussion to the language itself. First you learn what the languasge is and how it works, then you learn to apply it to specific applications (such as client-side web page scripting). Comments?

:Yes, it does seem a little odd.

      <comment>/* soy sauce listed in a 'gluten-free' recipe? */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This article needs work and appears to be wrong.
What is the origin of this recipe?  This is not cashew chicken as served in Springfield, Missouri where it originated.  Cashews are a garnish added at the very end along with green onions.  There are no vegetables in cashew chicken, ''that'' is a variation.  The recipe should be (as reasonably close) as the one first used at Leong's Tea House in Springfield where the dish was first invented.  Using vegetables and other methods are the variations.  I lived in Springfield, Missouri all my life and never ate this at a Chinese restaurant.[[User:Rt66lt|Rt66lt]] 18:09, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

:This was already neatly described in the &quot;variations&quot; section. Leong might know his audience, but damn that's not normal cashew chicken. See [[Cookbook:Leong's Cashew Chicken]] for the recipe. (would Midwestern Cashew Chicken be a better name?) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:18, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

I have lived in Springfield, MO for five years now.  Before that I lived in San Francisco (they have a few good Chinese restaurants there), New York City (as well), and Boston.  The cashew chicken served here in the so-called &quot;Birthplace of Cashew Chicken&quot; is nothing more than fried chicken with brown gravy, and cashews sprinkled on top.  Who let the hillbilly into the kitchen?

== soy sauce listed in a 'gluten-free' recipe? ==

I'm trying to find a gluten-free recipe, and happy to have this resource, but lo and behold, I see that soy sauce is listed here without any caveat or gluten warnings, yet wheat (i.e., gluten) appears to be a primary ingredient in soy sauce. This makes me question other recipes on the gluten free list...bummer!</text>

My name is Ralfe Poisson. I am currently a student in South Africa. I am aiming to qualify as a Forensic Psychologist, however I have many areas of interest.

That doesn't mean that overseas companies that are not trading in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment are exempt from all tax as they may still be liable to income tax, typically on UK rental income.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General Apraxia'''

Apraxia is the partial or complete loss of one's ability to perform deliberate movements. This results from cortical lesions where there is no paralysis or loss of sensory functioning. 

'''Akinetic Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterized by the inability to perform spontaneous movements.

'''Amnesic Apraxia'''

Also known as amnestic apraxia, is apraxia which is characterised by an inability to carry out sequence(s) of movement upon request. Generally, the cause for this is deteriorated memory.

'''Buccofacial Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by an inability to carry out voluntary movements involving the face, mouth and tongue.

'''Constructional Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by a deficit in the ability to draw or assemble objects. This form of apraxia is caused by lesions in the right hemisphere, usually on the right parietal lobe.

'''Ideational Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by the improper use of objects caused by an inability to identify them correctly or to conceptualize their appropriate functions.

'''Ideokinetic Apraxia'''

Apraxia which is characterised by an inability to carry out a series of ordered movements. The patient is usually able to carry out individual orders, but is confused by a sequence of orders.

'''Ideomotor Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by the inability to execute a single, complex movement properly. The patient performs inappropriate movements in the course of action.

'''Left Parietal Apraxia'''

This is apraxia caused by damage to the posterior lobe of the left hemisphere.'

'''Motor Apraxia'''

Apraxia involving the inability to carry out planned acts.

'''Ocular Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by an inability to maintain fixation. With Ocular Apraxia, the patient's eyes wander back and forth between objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Definition of Generalized Agnosia'''

A defect in recognition, where a patient can generally sense objects and forms, but is unable to consciously recognize and interpret the meaning of the sensory input.

'''Apperceptive Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterised by recognition failure caused by impairment in visual perception. Patients are unable to recognize objects despite having normal acuity.

'''Associative Agnosia'''

A visual Agnosia characterised by the lack of meaning associated with percepts despite the patient being able to normally percieve an object and draw it.

'''Auditory Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterised by the inability to recognize sounds despite the patient having normal auditory functioning. Auditory Agnosia is typically associated with nonspeech sounds. When agnosia involves speech, it is referred to as &quot;pure word deafness&quot;

'''Ideational Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterised by faulty recognition and interpretation of symbols.

'''Landmark Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize stable objects in the environment. Patients can typically describe them in detail, but are unable to describe or recognize them.

'''Tactile Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize and interpret objects by touch.

'''Visual Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize and interpret objects in the visual field. Visual Agnosia may also sometimes be referred to as &quot;Optic Agnosia&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Dementia is the loss of intellectual capacity to the extent that normal social and occupational functions can no longer be carried out.

== Alzheimer's Disease ==
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive form of dementia characterized by the grandual deterioration of intellectual abilities such as memory, judgement, capacity for abstract thought, and other higher-level cognitive functions.

The onset of presenile Alzheimer's disease is usually after the age of 40 and consists of three main phases. The first phase lasts for 2 to 3 years, and is characterized by failing memory, muddled inefficiency over mundane tasks as well as spatial disorientation. Mood disorders are prominent and take the form of perplexity, agitation and restless hyperactivity. In the second phase, there is greater intellectual and personality deterioration. Focal symptoms also appear. In the third (or terminal) stage, there is extreme apathetic dementia in which the patient becomes bedridden. Neurological disabilities may develop, such as spastic hemiparesis (hemispheric paralysis) or severe striatal rigidity (irregular streaks or patches of nerve cell loss in the cerebral cortex) and tremor.

Histologically, there is degeneratoin and loss of nerve cells which affects the outer three cortical layers and the thalamus as well as secondary glial proliferatoin (the rapid growth of the plial cells which perform support tasks such as production of the myelin sheath and nutritional support). Senile plaques and neurofibrallary tangles are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and the neurofibrillary tangles occur in grey matter, particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala. The senile plaque lie within the nerve cells and often fill the entire cell body, and may have no core and appear to consist on ly of granular or filamentous fragments. Cortical atrophy (the wasting away of the cortex) is also present and tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes. The white matter shows axonal degeneration, hyperplasia (the increase in organ size caused by an abnormal increase in number of cells) of astrocytes as well as fibrous gliosis (the replacement of neuron cells by glia cells). Other characteristic features include shrinking of the brain, flattening of the gyri, widening of the sulci and enlarging of the ventricles.

The walls of intracerebral arteries tend to thicken with advancing age. The collagen in the outer layers become more prominent which causes the wall and surrounding tissue to die and, in most cases, disintegrate. There is an interference of cerebral cirulation which is caused by blockage of the common carotid, inner carotid and venebral arteries in the neck and bony channels of the skull. With regards neuro-chemistry, there are also deficiencies in neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin and somatostatin.

there seem to be certain general triggers for Alzheirmer's diseas such as minimal brain damage from head injury, infection and surgery. However, the illness is usually already in existence, and these &quot;triggers&quot; or precipitants have merely revealed the problem.

As so far as treatment is concerned, there is no cure. However, cutting edge research in stem cell development is showing promising results for counteracting the degenerative effects of Alzheimer's Disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section sets out the general rubric of the charge to corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (1) raises the charge on profits of companies. Profits are defined in Subsection (5), [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|company]] is defined in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA)]]. This definition includes overseas companies, and it is left to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11 of ICTA]] to restrict the scope of the charge for overseas entities.&lt;br&gt;

Tax is charged, and the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Corporation Tax Acts|Corporation Tax Acts]] apply for any [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Financial year|Financial year]] for which Parliament charges corporation tax. The wording is formulated in this way because corporation tax, like income tax, is still a temporary tax which must be imposed annually, although in practice it is inconceivable that a Parliament will fail to levy the tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) provides that where a company is [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK resident]] (and so within the full charge), or overseas resident but not scoped out of the charge to corporation tax by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11 of ICTA]], the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definition/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] (and therefore the charge to income tax) do not apply. &lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) removes any charge to capital gains tax on gains on which it is charged to corporation tax or would be so chargeable but for an exemption from corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) defines &quot;profits&quot; and widens the meaning of &quot;trade&quot; for the purposes of Sections 7 to 12, 114, 115 (subject to 115(7)) and 248, and Part VIII, Chapter IV of Part X, and Part XI, except where the context requires otherwise. '''[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Profits|Profits]]''' are defined as [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income|income]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Chargeable gains|chargeable gains]]. '''Trade''' is taken to include '''vocation''', and to include an office or employment.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4A) extends the meaning of '''[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Profession|profession]]''' to include vocation in Sections 74(1), 79(1), 79A(1), 79B(1), 83A(1), 84(1), 86(1), 86A(2)(a), 87(1), (2) and (4), 88, 89, 90(1) and (3), 94(1), 100(2)(b), 101, 102, 401(1), 491(10), 577(7)(b), 579(2), 588(3), 589A(8) and 817(2), and in paragraph 5(11) of Schedule 30.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (5) notes that Part VIII contains general provisions relating to the taxation of profits of companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that no payment made by a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/company|company]] shall be treated as income tax, and also that a requirement to withhold income tax imposed by the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] stands notwithstanding that the company is not within the charge to income tax itself.

Subsection (2) provides that subject to provision for the contrary, a UK resident company that has received a payment net of withheld income tax may set that income tax off against its corporation tax liability of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/accounting period|accounting period]] in which the receipt is brought into the corporation tax charge, or would have been brought into the corporation tax charge but for an exemption from corporation tax.

Subsection (3) disapplies subsection (2) for a payment of loan interest to which [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 369 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 369 of ICTA]] applies. Section 369 deals with mortgage relief at source. As mortgage relief at source no longer applies, this subsection no longer has any practical effect.

Subsection (4) expands, for the purposes of this section, the references to payments received by a company to include references to payments received by another person on behalf of or in trust for the company. It also excludes money received by a company on behalf of or in trust for another person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that, subject to an explicit exception in the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Corporation Tax Acts|Corporation Tax Acts]], [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|companies]] are taxed on their worldwide profits.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) makes it clear that a company is taxable on all profits accruing to its benefits, including profits of trusts and partnerships, if it would be taxed on them if it received the profits direct. Except in the case where the company is being wound up (where it receives profits for the benefit of its creditors or members, as appropriate), it is not taxed on profits it receives in a fiduciary capacity. This subsection (which is well supported by case law) effectively states that for tax purposes you look at beneficial, not legal, ownership of profits.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) provides that corporation tax is computed and chargeable by reference to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting periods]], although tax is charged by reference to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Financial year|financial years]]. The profits of accounting periods are apportioned between the financial years in which the accounting period falls.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that corporation tax is charged under income tax principles, unless there is a provision to the contrary, and for these purposes the corporation tax term &quot;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting period]]&quot; is taken to be the period of reference rather than the income tax term &quot;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Year of assessment|Year of assessment]]&quot;. This provision derives from when corporation tax was first introduced in 1965 (prior to which companies were charged to income tax). Since 2003, various parts of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] have been rewritten so that the same provisions no longer apply for both income tax and corporation tax. This process is not yet complete, but by the end of the decade, corporation tax should be a completely stand-alone tax, no longer relying on income tax provisions for its base.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) makes it clear what income tax law applies for each accounting period, and also that provisions relating specifically to individuals do not apply to persons within the charge to corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2A) provides that corporation tax on income is not charged under the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (ITTOIA). Subsection (2B) goes on to provide that instead income is chargeable under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] and the Cases of Schedule D. Subsection (2C) also deems Schedules A and D to apply to income tax for the purposes of corporation tax. In essence, these subsections contain transitional provisions that apply whilst corporation tax law is being decoupled from income tax law - once the decoupling is complete, they will no longer be necessary.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) provides that total profits are assessed under and computed under the rules in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] and also under Parts 2 (employment income), 9 (pension income) and 10 (social security income) of ITEPA (which impose the charge to income) tax plus [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Chargeable gain|chargeable gains]].&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) provides that where a provision of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] apart from ITTOIA provides for an exemption from income tax, or charges a person to income tax, then unless otherwise provided, there is a similar exemption from or charge to corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (5) makes it clear that although corporation tax and income tax are distinct taxes, the same statutory provision may apply to them. This also allows certain provisions to ensure tax neutrality between persons within the charge to corporation tax and income tax by being a rule for corporation tax as far as the former is concerned, and a rule for income tax as far as the latter is concerned. A charge to corporation tax (or income tax) is a charge to the other, and an exemption from corporation tax (or income tax) is an exemption to the other, unless expressed explicitly to the contrary.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (6) states that the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] referred to in the section are to be taken as excluding Section 1 to 5, Part VII or Sections 348 to 350 of ICTA, and notes that the above rules do not refer to which period income are taxed in, except to the extent that this results from apportioning income of the whole period to different parts of a period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Events sorted chronologically ===
This section of the book lists disastrous events until the last century. We have intentionally not listed more recent events because they may be still under active dispute, badly attributed, too painful and in general still open to distinct interpretation and requiring further analysis.

=20th century=

==1980s==
*[[w:Armero tragedy|1985 Nevado del Ruiz Lahar disaster]] - The 'Volcán del Ruiz', had been for more than a century a dormant giant, which travelers in the Bogotá-Cali flights had the pleasure to observe, covered with a large snow cap.

:With 5,389 m (17,780 ft), Nevado del Ruiz is the highest of the Colombian volcanoes in the Central Range of the Colombian Andes. 

:Although this volcano had caused lahars in 1595 and 1845, causing hundreds of deaths, the rich valley of [[w:Armero|Armero]] under the peak, was excellent agricultural land. The town of Armero grew for more than a century, without anyone remembering the old disasters. 

:Late in 1984, geologists began to notice small earthquakes and steam eruptions in the volcano. Although a network of monitoring devices was setup on the summit of the volcano, nothing would predict the terrible events that followed a year later.

:In November 1985 the smoke from the summit of Nevado del Ruiz, was plainly visible, but both authorities and scientists alike didn't believe these were the preliminaries of a plynian pyroclastic eruption.

:Despite the warnings local authorities in Armero, and state officials keep saying no eruption would follow, although a risk map was in place.

:On the night of November 13, 1985, at  around 3:00 pm there was an explosion and ashes fell over the region, but even then local authorities and priests in Armero asked the people to remain calm in their houses. However at 9:30 pm. the volcano, covered with storm clouds, erupted with rock ejection and pyroclastic discharges which melted the snow cap. Melted water and pyroclastic ashes and rocks mixed and produced a series of lahars, mud and rock slides along the rivers.

:Just half an hour short of midnight on November 13, 1985 a massive Lahar caused by the eruption of the volcano, ran down the Lagunillas river, in central Colombia, and jumped in a 200 high wave of rocks, mud and debris over the town of Armero, 28,000 inhabitants. In the next 10 minutes close to 80% of Armero was destroyed. The death toll of both the lahar that hit Armero and other lahars was estimated at 21,000 deaths.

==1930s==
*[[w:Holodomor|1932 - Ukraine - Black Famine]] - A Man-Made Famine raged through Ukraine, the ethnic-Ukrainian region of northern Caucasus, and the lower Volga River region in 1932-33. Between 7 to 10 million people, mainly Ukrainians, starved to death. 

:Planned by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the main goal of this artificial famine was to break the spirit of the Ukrainian peasant farmer and to force them into collectivization. In 1932, the Soviets increased the grain procurement quota for Ukraine by 44%. Soviet law was quite clear - no grain could be given to feed the peasants until the quota was met, aware that this extraordinary high quota would result in a grain shortage leaving Ukrainian peasant unable to feed themselves. 

:When some peasants attempted to hide grain from the Soviet Government, Communist party officials with the aid of military troops and NKVD secret police units moved into the area. To insure Ukrainian peasants could not travel in search of food, an internal passport system was implemented to restrict movements. 

:While Ukrainians were starving, Ukrainian grain was collected and stored in grain elevators that were guarded by military units &amp; NKVD secret police units.
*[[/Great Depression/]]

==1910s==
*[[w:Great Lakes Storm of 1913|1913 - Great Lakes, USA &amp; Canada - Great Lakes storm]]
*1912 - Atlantic Ocean - Sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic

==1900s==
[[Image:General slocum burning.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Firefighters working to extinguish the General Slocum]]
*[[w:PS General Slocum|1904 - New York City, USA - General Slocum disaster]] - The '''''General Slocum''''' was a [[w:steamship|steamship]] launched in [[w:1891|1891]]. It caught fire and burned to the water line in [[w:New York|New York]]'s [[w:East River|East River]] on [[w:June 15|June 15]], [[w:1904|1904]]. Over 1,000 people died in the tragedy, making it New York City's worst loss-of-life disaster until the [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the World Trade Center.  The Captain, William Van Schaick, and the rest of the crew suffered no fatalities, although the Captain lost sight in one eye due to the fire. There were many acts of heroism among the passengers, witnesses, and emergency personnel.
*[[w:1900 Galveston Hurricane|1900 - Texas, USA - Galveston Hurricane]]

=19th century=
*[[w:Krakatoa|1883 - Indonesia - Krakatoa volcano's eruption]]

=18th century=
[[Image:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|340px|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of Lisbon in flames and a tsunami overwhelming the ships in the harbor.]]
*[[w:1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Lisbon, Portugal earthquake]] -  Took place on November 1, 1755, at 9:20 in the morning. It was one of the most destructive and deadly [[w:earthquakes|earthquakes]] in history, killing well over 70,000 people. The quake was followed by a [[w:tsunami|tsunami]] and fire, resulting in the near total destruction of [[w:Lisbon|Lisbon]].

:The earthquake accentuated political tensions in [[w:Portugal|Portugal]] and profoundly disrupted the country's 18th century colonial ambitions. The event was widely discussed by European Enlightenment [[philosophy|philosophers]], and inspired major developments in [[w:theodicy|theodicy]] and in the philosophy of the [[w:sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The first to be studied scientifically for its effects over a large area, the quake signaled the birth of modern [[w:seismology|seismology]]. [[w:Geologists|Geologists]] today estimate the Lisbon earthquake approached magnitude 9 on the Richter scale, with an [[w:epicenter|epicenter]] in the Atlantic Ocean about 200&amp;nbsp;km west-southwest of [[w:Cape St. Vincent|Cape St. Vincent]].

:The geological causes of this earthquake and the seismic activity in the region continue to be discussed and debated by contemporary scientists. Some geologists have suggested that the earthquake may indicate the early development of an Atlantic subduction zone, and the beginning of the closure of the Atlantic ocean.

== Welcome! ==  

I hope you found some Poly Science classes.  If not perhaps we could start some by playing with some political discussion formats either here locally or at wikireason. (Link on the front page.   We could pick some topics or current issues and invite people from a few communities such as kurohin5, slash/dot, and advogato to help discuss it.   Hope to see you around.  If you get bored or busy, please checkback.  I think we are finally nearing some effective initialization.  BTW Might run a search on wikibooks or wikpedia regarding specific political topics.  Later. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 06:12, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

P.S.  Consider adding your name to the overall participant list[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:participants] or at specific courses of interest to help others with similar interests find you.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 10: Review of reading and pronunciation, subject pronouns, and verbs

===Vowels===
Greek has five vowel sounds, all vowels are pronounced nearer the English long rather than short:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   α
| approximately as in ''ball'' (closer to ''father'' in a Boston accent)
|-
|   ε
| approximately as in ''bet'' 
|-
|   ι
| as in ''beet'' 
|-
|   ο
| approximately as in ''boat''
|-
|   ου
| as in ''boot''
|-
|}

Throughout this book, tables highlighted in this color have (or will eventually have) audio recordings to go with them.

{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1ab}}

As you can see from these examples, many letters in the Greek alphabet look like their
counterparts in English. There are multiple spellings for some of these sounds:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| ι, η, υ, οι, ει, and  υι all sound alike.
|-
| ε and  αι sound like EH as in &quot;kettle&quot;.
|-
| ο and  ω sound like OH as in &quot;over&quot;.
|}

===Consonants===
The following letters sound like the English letters they resemble:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| κ, τ
|}

''Note: If you're a native English speaker, try to pronounce a plain τ, that is '''without''' the &quot;h&quot; sound in the end.''

Reading practice:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| τα, τι, η, τη, το, του, τω, κάτω, κότα, άκου
|}

Most Greek words have a stressed syllable which in words of more than one syllable is shown with an accent over the stressed vowel.

Vocabulary: 
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  κακό
| bad 
|-
|  κατά
| against, according to, toward 
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1c}}

The following Greek consonants sound like familiar sounds from English, but look different from their
English counterparts:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
*β      vee     

*λ      elle

*π      pee

*δ      the

*μ      emm

*σ,ς    ess

*ζ      zee
 
*ν      enn

*φ      fee
 
*θ      theh

*ξ      eks

*ψ      eeps



{|The letter sigma,  σ, is written as  ς at the end of a word. Some Greek speakers pronounce the sigma sound so that it sounds half-way between s and sh.

Vocabulary and reading practice:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;

{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1d}}

The following Greek consonants have sounds not found in English:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
|  γ
| a soft, gargling g sound, except before the sounds  ε and  ι, where it sounds like y 
|-
|  ρ
| like Spanish r 
|-
|  χ
| like the ch in Scottish ''loch''
|-
|}

Vocabulary and reading practice:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;

{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1e}}

The following combinations of letters have sounds that have to be learned:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
|    ου
| oo
|-
|    αυ
| av before vowel or voiced consonant, else af 
|-
|    ευ
| ev before vowel or voiced consonant, else ef  
|-
|    ηυ
| iv before vowel or voiced consonant, else if  
|-
|    μπ
| b at the beginning of a word, mb elsewhere
|-
|    ντ
| d at the beginning of a word, nd elsewhere
|-
|    χε, χαι
| heh 
|-
|   κε, και
| keh 
|-
|}

Vocabulary and reading practice:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| και
| and
|-
|    ή
|  or 
|-
|   αυτός
| he 
|-
|   αύριο
| tomorrow 
|-
|   ευχαριστώ
| I give thanks, thank you (~&quot;Eucharist&quot;)
|-
|   γυρεύω
| I look for 
|-
|   μπορώ
| I can 
|-
|   χαίρετε
| Rejoice! (a greeting and leave-taking)
|-
|   καλοκαίρι
| summer
|-
 |}

One of the big obstacles for an English speaker trying to learn Greek is that so few common usage words are related to English ones (although an estimated 10% to 20% of the total English vocabulary has Greek roots, most of it though of scientific/technical nature). However, sometimes there is a relationship that would help you to remember the Greek word, but the relationship isn't obvious, as with ευχαριστώ and Eucharist. When this happens, we'll note it as in the example above, with ~. This may mean that the English word is derived from the Greek one, or merely that both the English word and the Greek one come from a common root.

Names of the letters:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   α
|  άλφα 
|  ι 
|  γιώτα (or ιώτα)

|   ωμέγα 
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1g}}

===Personal subject pronouns===
Greek has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Here are the personal subject pronouns:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|        εγώ
| I
|     εμείς
| we 
|-
|     εσύ
| you, singular 
|   εσείς
| you, plural 
|-
|     αυτός
| he 
|  αυτοί
| they (masculine) 
|-
|     αυτή
| she
|  αυτές
| they (feminine) 
|-
|     αυτό
| it
|  αυτά
| they (neuter)
|-
 |}
The second-person plural is also used as the formal form of address, even when speaking to a single person.

{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1h}}

===Verbs===

====First conjugation====
The subject pronouns are usually omitted, because the form of the verb indicates the subject. For example:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
|  γράφω
| I write
|-
|  γράφεις
| you (singular) write
|-
|  γράφει
| he/she/it writes
|-
|  γράφουμε
| we write
|-
|  γράφετε
| you (plural) write
|-
|  γράφουν
| they write
|-
|}
There is no infinitive in modern Greek. For naming a verb, the first-person singular of the present tense is used as a generic term. For example, we refer to the verb  γράφω, ''to write.''

To summarize the conjugation of a verb, we write it in a table like this:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  γράφω
|   γράφουμε 
|-
|   γράφεις
|  γράφετε 
|-
|  γράφει
|  γράφουν  
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i}}

Γράφω is an example of a verb belonging to the first conjugation. Verbs in this conjugation can be recognized because their accent falls before the final ω.

The following verbs belong to the first conjugation:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| δίνω
| give (~&quot;donate&quot;)
|-
| αλλάζω
| change
|-
| διαβάζω
| read
|-
| κοιτάζω
| look at
|-
| βλέπω
| see
|-
| ακούω
| hear (~&quot;acoustic&quot;)
|-
| φτάνω
| arrive
|-
| φεύγω
| leave
|-
| παίρνω
| take
|-
| αγοράζω
| buy
|-
| ξέρω
| know
|-
| νομίζω
| think
|-
| βάζω
| put
|-
| πίνω
| drink
|}

Vocabulary: {{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i2}}

Conjugations of some of these verbs: {{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i3}}

====The verbs έχω, ''to have,'' and  είμαι, ''to be''====
Two important verbs are  έχω, ''to have,'' and  είμαι, ''to be.''  The first-conjugation verb  έχω is regular
in the present tense, so it has the same endings as  γράφω.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  	 έχω
|  έχουμε 
|-
|  	 έχεις
|  έχετε 
|-
|  	 έχει
|  έχουν 
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1j}}

''To be'' in English is expressed
in the active voice, but the Greek  είμαι is passive, and doesn't have an active form.
The ending  -μαι is a typical, regular ending for passive verbs. Although we won't be
concerned with passive constructions until later,  είμαι is so important that you need
to get it under your belt right away.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  	 είμαι
|  είμαστε 
|-
|  	 είσαι
|  είστε 
|-
|  	 είναι
|  είναι
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1k}}

===Capital letters===

Now that we're ready to handle complete sentences, we need capital letters.
Most of the capital letters of the Greek alphabet are similar in form either to the lowercase letters, or
to their counterparts in the Latin alphabet:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
|   α
|  Α 
|  ι 
|  Ι 
|  ρ
|   Ρ 
|-
|  β 
|  Β 
|  κ 
|  Κ 
|  σ
|   Σ 
|-
|  γ 
|  Γ 
|   λ
|  Λ 
|  τ
|   Τ 
|-
|  δ 
|  Δ 
|   μ
|  Μ
|  υ
|   Υ 
|-
|  ε 
|  Ε 
|   ν
|  Ν
|  φ
|  Φ  
|-
|   ζ
|  Ζ 
|  ξ
|  Ξ
|  χ
|  Χ  
|-
|   η
|  Η 
|  ο
|  Ο
|  ψ
|  Ψ  
|-
|   θ
|  Θ 
| π 
|  Π
|  ω
|   Ω 
|-
|}

===Sentences===
The order of words in a Greek sentence is much more free than in English, but you can correctly construct a sentence using the familiar English syntax of subject+verb, or subject+verb+object. The subject is usually omitted when it is a pronoun.

Sentences:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   Είναι καλό.
| It is good.
|-
|   Είναι κακό.
| It is bad.
|-
 |}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1l}}

In Greek, adjectives change their endings to agree with the gender and number of the nouns
they describe (''declension''). The following vocabulary list introduces some nouns that happen to be neuter,
and some adjectives, which are given in neuter form. The word το is the definite article, like English &quot;the,&quot; used with
singular neuter nouns.

Vocabulary:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;

|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1n}}

Negatives are formed by placing ''δεν'' before the verb. The question mark in Greek is the semicolon.

Sentences:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   Το κόκκινο κρασί δεν είναι κρύο.
| The red wine is not cold
|-
|   Το νερό δεν είναι καυτό.

===Summary of the alphabet and pronunciation===
====Alphabet / Αλφάβητο====
The '''Greek Language''' was one of the first written languages in all world. The [[w:Script|script]] used had some peculiarities not observed today: for instance, the vowels were not written, and one needed to guess or to know their specific place inside the word. This alphabet has been evolving, through contact with other cultures and through the simple action of the time, until it became what it is today. Amongst the Greek alphabet, we can spot some (or even many) similarities with the [[w:Latin alphabet|Latin (or Roman) one]]. The alphabet used nowadays has 24 letters: 7 vowels and 17 consonants.

Besides the alphabet, there is also an accent ( ´ ) and a diaeresis( ¨ ). The use of these two [[w:Diacritic|diacritics]] is discussed in the [[Greek: Phonology|next section]].

====Pronunciation of the Alphabet====
Greek sounds are, in general, soft. As a major rule, each letter carries a single sound (this is not universal, but almost, as we'll see later in this page). As in the [[Greek: Alphabet|previous chapter]], we see here a table with the various letters. This time, the columns represent not the name, but the ''approximate'' sound of the letters.

'''Note''': The letter Γγ is the most difficult to pronounce for an English speaker: it is like a stronger '''h''', simultaneous with the vibration of the vocal cords;  in other words, it is the voiced counterpart of the '''χ'''. Before '''e''' and '''i''' vowels, it is pronounced as a '''y''' like in the word '''y'''es.

====Diphthongs====
''[[w:Diphthongs|Diphthongs]]'' are combinations of two vowels that function as a unique sound. Note that in Modern Greek, the word ''Diphthong'' (δίφθογγος) is also used for combination of vowels that sound like a simple vowel. There are eight diphthongs in Modern Greek. There are also some similar combinations of consonants:

|}

====Accent and Diaeresis====
Most Greek words have a ''stressed syllable'' which is the syllable said with more strength: for instance, in the English words ''comfort'' and ''peculiarity'', the stressed syllables are ''com'' and ''ar'', respectively.

Greek marks the stressed syllable with an '''accent''' mark ( ΄ ) over the vowel. In one-syllable words, the accent is usually omitted. When the stress falls on a syllable that has a diphthong, the accent is used above the last letter of this diphthong. Thus, words like Παύλος (''Paul'') ou γυναίκα (''woman''), are correctly accented. 

If the accent is put on the first vowel of a diphthong, it is not read as a diphthong but read as two independent vowels, as in the word ρολόι (''watch'' or ''clock''), which has three syllables, not two. On the other hand, if one wishes to separate the diphthong, but the accent falls on other syllable, the '''diaeresis''' ( ¨ ) is used, as in the word Εβραϊκός (''Hebrew'').

There are, however, some words that aren't stressed (usually monosyllabic grammatical words), and these don't have an accent. Words like these are read as affixes added to the main word. '''Examples''':
*'''ο (''the'' masc.)''' &quot;Ο πατέρας&quot; (''The father'') is read as a single word - ''aw-pah-TE-ras'';
*'''μου (''my'')''', &quot;Ο πατέρας μου&quot; (''My father'') is also read as a single word - ''aw-pa-TE-raz-mu''.

Every stressed word with more than one syllable carries an accent. However, there are monosyllabic words that also have accent, like ή (''or'') and πού (''where''). This accent has a double function:
*It distinguishes words that, otherwise, would be equal - η (''the'' fem.) and που (''that, which'');
*It marks words as strong, unlike their weak comparing counterparts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Writing Software to Play the Ancient Game of Go ==
{{wikipedia|Computer Go}}
[[w:Go (board game)|Go]] is a strategic, two-player game that originated in ancient China thousands of years ago. It is popular throughout East Asia, and is gaining popularity among computer programmers because of its extraordinary complexity. Whereas the top chess-playing computer programs are now better than the top human grandmasters, the best Go-playing computer programs currently in existence can be defeated even by amateur Go players.

The rules of Go are simple, but the strategies complex; the sheer number of legal moves at any point in the game make programming an effective opponent a daunting task. This book endeavors to help the novice who is beginning to write software to play the ancient game of Go, as well as to provide a useful resource to those already skilled in the art.

==The Go Community==
It is becoming very common for Go players to use the Internet to meet, discuss games, and play one another. Many strong players now regularly [[Computer Go/Playing Go Online|play Go online]]. There is also a growing community of people who write Go software programs, with regular competitions and tournaments between the various Go-playing engines. See [[Computer Go/How Do I Find Other Programs To Play Against?|How Do I Find Other Programs To Play Against?]]

==Where Do I Start?==
The best place to start is with the [http://senseis.xmp.net/?RulesOfGoIntroductory rules of Go]. Once you are comfortable with the rules, you may want to [[Computer Go/Playing Go Online|play a few games]] yourself. At that point you can begin with whichever chapter of this book you find most interesting:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Please do not blank pages ==
I noticed your recent work at [[Modern Greek/Contents]]. Everything seems good, except that while you were merging, you made three pages blank: [[Greek: Introduction]], [[Greek: Alphabet]], and [[Greek: Phonology]].

When you make a blank page, what happens is that there are still links at Wikibooks and the Internet. Some readers will use these links, and instead of finding the [[Modern Greek/Contents]] page where you did all the work, they will find useless blank pages. Thus '''please do not make blank pages''' because they will stop some readers from reading what you worked on!

The good news is that ''I was able to fix'' the blank pages by changing them into redirects. Briefly, you can redirect one page to another by replacing the page with one line like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
#redirect [[Modern Greek/Contents]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

It helped much that you had typed a &quot;summary&quot; (in the box just above the &quot;Save page&quot; button) each time that you blanked a page, explaining that you were merging. From there, I knew that you were not deleting content, and was able to make the redirects. Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks, and I hope that you continue to work at Wikibooks and provide a &quot;summary&quot; with your edits. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:25, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== Modern Greek Module ==

I am just writing to thank you for all the hard work you have put into the Modern Greek Wikibook. I have been trying to teach myself Greek on the internet and this wikibook is by far the best option available. Thankyou for building the book into what it now is, mainly without help. Cheers again!

== Replacing the Recordings ==

I also wanted to say thanks! I am also learning modern greek.  My boyfriend is Greek, and I was wondering if it would be helpful to replace the recordings with his voice?  I'm sure he could find the time to do it.  But I have never added anything to a wiki before, are there guidelines for how to do the reading, recording formats, etc?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The command shell==
Ratpoison has a built-in &quot;run&quot; dialog, a quick way to launch any program without having to start a console. Type C-t ! to get a little command box from which you can launch your program. This is most useful for launching graphical applications without tying up a console, as you won't be able to see any of the output of any purely command line programs.

From the same command prompt you can invoke the ratpoison command to tweak settings and do various actions. All these commands can be looked up in the mainpage, and they are all preceded by ratpoison -c. 

For example, to set the &quot;rudeness level&quot; to five (will be explained soon) you type ratpoison -c rudeness 5.

All these commands can of course be executed from within a console window; C-t ! is simply a more convenient variant of a command shell.

===Aliasing===
As mentioned before, ratpoison can be thought of as GNU Screen for window managing; like command line shells, it is possible to alias long commands to shorter versions. 

This can be done through the extended command ability (which resembles C-t !), which is invoked via &quot;C-t :&quot;. This opens a little box just like C-t ! does, but instead of executing shell commands, the input will be sent to ratpoison which will attempt to interpret this input as a ratpoison command; suppose one often runs Mozilla Firefox, but one grew weary of always opening a shell with C-t c and then typing in &quot;mozilla-firefox &amp;&quot; (the ampersand is necessary so you can use the terminal for other things, otherwise the terminal will simply display any error or informative messages Firefox emits), or &quot;C-t ! mozilla-firefox&quot;? 

One could decide to use a shorter name- input C-t :, and enter in &quot;alias firefox exec mozilla-firefox&quot;, which would allow one to simply C-t: firefox, and Firefox would open up; one could even go C-t: &quot;alias f exec mozilla-firefox&quot; if they were rather lazy, and used no other programs beginning with the letter &quot;f&quot;.

Aliasing is not limited to regular program names- if one drops the &quot;exec&quot;, one could alias the command &quot;quit&quot; to &quot;q&quot;: &quot;C-t : alias q quit&quot;.

As a matter of fact, all the keyboard shortcuts one has learned for ratpoison, like C-t p, they all are actually aliases for longer commands! C-t q (which quits ratpoison) is actually an alias for C-t : quit.  This is another area of borrowing from Emacs- Emacs similarly represents all keys on a keyboard and all combinations thereof, as aliases of Emacs functions.

(In these examples the command &quot;exec&quot; is necessary to have ratpoison evaluate the succeeding string as a shell command, and not another ratpoison command. Please see the [http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/doc/Other-Commands.html#index-exec-99 official documentation] on exec for more details; exec essentially does the same thing as C-t !).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Writing a Go GUI can have many different purposes. It can be a front-end to a Go engine so you can see the computer's play in a graphical manner; it can be an SGF viewer to allow a user to review games; it can be an SGF editor to allow users to create SGF files of their own; it can be used as part of a client application to allow users to play Go over the Internet.

This section primarily contains resources for widget libraries intended to make writing a Go GUI easier. However, when writing a Go GUI, even just a simple game viewer, there are other problems to take into account that are primarily detailed in other sections:
* [[Computer Go/Writing a Go Engine|Representing the Board]]
* [[Computer Go/Writing a Go Engine|Determining Legal Moves]]
* [[Computer Go/Writing a Go Engine|Clearing stones]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Structural Engineering ==
&lt;p&gt;Structural engineering is a vast subject. It concerns other branches of engineering too. Even aeronautical degree programmes do study simple statics and bending of beams, torsion, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suppose the best way to start this module is to describe in vague what structural engineering is and what is a structural engineer's duty/responsibility. And then we can move on to basic mechanics and so on...&lt;/p&gt;
:--[[User:Deostroll|deostroll]] 06:58, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== About the first edit... ==

:I left the matter refering to concrete as such. May be it should serve other people who wish edit as a reminder about what this subject ought to describe in the future versions. Concrete is only one part of structural engineering! Meanwhile anyone is welcomed to edit this module themselves or suggest how this module should actually go about this subject.
:
:I would also like people to consider following questions (because even I doubt them)
::* Can a bridge be considered as a structural system?
::* Is it correct to say that strucutral engineering activites consists of analysis and design?
::* How should this article/module touch subjects like strucutral analysis and design? Shouldn't they be separate modules?
--[[User:Deostroll|deostroll]] 08:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

It would be better if you add diagrams and drawings for clearing the subjects.  And do you consider clarifying what is &quot;statically determinate structure&quot;?

== Structual analysis and design ==

There is no design without structural analysis.  However I think they are two different subjects... I'm not sure why they have a category with both.  (see structural analysis and design)

== On the definition of structural engineering ==

The quote &quot;Structural Engineering is the art of moulding materials we do not wholly understand into shapes we cannot precisely analyze, so as to withstand forces we cannot really assess, in such a way that the community at large has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance&quot; is incorrectly attributed to James E. Amrhein. Amrhein himself has confirmed that he frequently uses the quote, but is not the original author (see January 2009 issue of STRUCTURE Magazine). This quote is a slight revision from the definition in the 1967 textbook ''Structural Analysis Volume One'' by Dr. E.H. Brown. Brown's definition was &quot;The art of moulding materials we do not really understand into shapes we cannot really analyze, so as to withstand forces we cannot really assess, in such a way that the public does not really suspect.&quot; Mr. Amrhein is not even responsible for making the modification to its longer and less repetitive form; that credit probably belongs to Dr. A.R. Dykes (see May 1978 issue of The Structural Engineer).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|non-UK resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|company]] is only within the charge to corporation tax if it carries on a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Trade|trade]] in the United Kingdom through a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Permanent establishment|permanent establishment]] in the United Kingdom. This does not necessarily mean that a non-UK resident company that is not carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment is not subject to UK taxation on its profits, as it may well fall within the charge to income tax. This is typically the case for non-UK resident companies that receive income from UK land, where income less expenses is charged to income tax at the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Basic rate|basic rate]] (22% in 2005-06). The precise meaning of &quot;non-UK resident&quot;, &quot;carrying on a trade&quot; &quot;in&quot; (the United Kingdom) and &quot;permanent establishment&quot; are all important in deciding whether a foreign company is within the charge to corporation tax, and if so, to what extent.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) provides that a non-UK resident company within the charge to corporation tax is charged to corporation tax only on its profits, wherever arising, that are attributable to the permanent establishment.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2A) provides a list of which profits are attributable to a permanent establishment, namely:
*trading income arising directly or indirectly through or from the establishment
*income from property or rights used by, or held by or for, the establishment, and;
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Chargeable gain|chargeable gains]] failing within [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 10B of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992|Section 10B of TCGA]] (i) by virtue of assets being used or held for the purposes of the trade carried on by the company through the establishment, or (ii) by virtue of assets being used or held for the purposes of the establishment or being acquired for use by or for the purposes of the establishment.

In practice, deciding what this amounts to can be difficult, particularly in the financial services industry, where funds held overseas may be supporting business arising from a UK permanent establishment. This Subsection is therefore supplemented by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11AA]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule A1 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A1]]. Life insurance companies have their own rules set out in Sections 11A to 11C of ICTA (as deemed to be inserted by Schedule 19AC to ICTA).&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) mimics the provision in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 7 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 7]] that applies to UK resident companies. It provides that where a non-UK resident company to which this Section applies has received income under deduction of income tax, and it brings that income into its corporation tax computation, the income tax suffered may be used to offset the corporation tax charge for the period in which that income is brought into the corporation tax computation.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) disapplies subsection (3) for a payment of loan interest to which [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 369 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 369 of ICTA]] applies. Section 369 deals with mortgage relief at source. As mortgage relief at source no longer applies, this subsection no longer has any practical effect. This Subsection mimics Section 7(3).

Nor does it apply where the context requires otherwise because some other definition of &quot;company&quot; applies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Section sets out Schedule A, the charge to tax arising from income on UK land.

==The charge to tax==

Subsection (1) sets out the four paragraphs of the charge.

Paragraph 1 raises the charge on &quot;the annual profits arising from a business carried on for exploitation, as a source of rents of other receipts, of any estate, interest or rights in or over land in the United Kingdom. To the extent a transaction is entered into for such exploitation it is treated as being entered into in the course of such a business. All such property businesses and transactions by a person are treated as if it is one business being carried on. There are two exceptions for this: first in respect of non-resident companies (see Subsection (1A)) below; second in respect of life [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Insurance company|insurance companies]], where there is a separate rule in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 432AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Sections 432AA]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 441B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|441B(2A)]] of ICTA.&lt;br&gt;

Paragraph 2 carves out certain items from the charge to Schedule A:

*Profits arising from the occupation of land;
*Profits charged to tax under Case I of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 53 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 53(1) of ICTA]] (farming and marketing gardening) or [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 55 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 55 of ICTA]] (mines, quarries and other concerns);
*Receipts or expenses taken into account in the taxation of tied premises (under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 98 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1998|Section 98 of ICTA]]);
*Rent taxed under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 119 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 119 of ICTA]] (rent, etc. payable in connection with mines, quarries and other concerns) or under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 120 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 120(1) of ICTA]] (certain rent, etc. payable in respect of electric line wayleaves);
*Credits and debits arising from [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/loan relationships|loan relationships]] or [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/derivative contracts|derivative contracts]].&lt;br&gt;

Paragraph 3 deems rights in static [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Caravan|caravans]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Houseboat|houseboats]] to be rights in UK land for the purposes of Schedule A.&lt;br&gt;

Paragraph 4 brings income receipts or other consideration received from the provision of furniture in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Furnished lettings|furnished lettings]] into Schedule A, unless the receipts are charged under Case I of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] as receipts of a furniture letting trade.

==Other Subsections==

Subsection (1A) provides that for [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|non-UK resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|companies]], businesses carried on and transactions entered into by it, the profits on which are within the corporation tax charge, are charged to corporation tax under Schedule A. However, a UK property business that falls to be within the charge to income tax is charged to income tax under Chapter 3 of Part 3 of ITTOIA. If a non-resident company has some property business within the charge to corporation tax, and some within the charge to income tax, it is treated as though it has two separate property businesses.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3A) provides that Subsection (1) applies for corporation tax purposes, but not for income tax purposes (except insofar as it is necessary for them to apply for income tax purposes to ensure the application of Subsection (1) for corporation tax purposes.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) Notes that Part II of ICTA contains more information on the charge to Schedule A for corporation tax purposes, and that Part II of ICTA also contains more information on the income tax charge to profits on a property business under Chapter 3 of Part 3 of ITTOIA (which doesn't apply to entities within the charge to corporation tax).

== Overview ==

== Infinitives ==

See the verbs infinitive mood.

===A short syntax===

An infinitive can be joined to every part of speech: a noun, as &quot;Obtain felicity,&quot; an adjective, as &quot;Desirous to speak,&quot; a pronoun, as &quot;What to accuse,&quot; a finite verb, as &quot;Come to seek,&quot; an infinitive, as &quot;To wait to consider,&quot; a participle, as &quot;Bent to unhoard,&quot; an adverb, as &quot;How to act,&quot; a conjunction, as &quot;More than praise it,&quot; a preposition, as &quot;About to write,&quot; and an interjection, as &quot;O to forget her!&quot;.

An infinitive may stand for the following: a supplement to verb, as &quot;Go to seek,&quot; purpose, as &quot;Labour not to be rich,&quot; an object of passion, as &quot;He loves to ride,&quot; a cause of passion, as &quot;I rejoice to hear it,&quot; the subject of proposition, as &quot;To steal is sinful,&quot; the object of proposition, as &quot;To enjoy is to obey,&quot; a coming event, as &quot;Things to come,&quot; a necessary event, as &quot;It is to be remembered,&quot; something previously suggested, as &quot;The gift to know it,&quot; and measure, as &quot;Enough to show.&quot;

== Gerunds ==

Gerunds are nouns built from a verb with an ''ing'' suffix. They can be used as the subject of a sentence, an object, or an object of preposition. They can also be used to complement a subject. Often, gerunds exist side-by-side with nouns that come from the same root but the gerund and the common noun have different shades of meaning. Examples: breath and ''breathing'', knowledge and ''knowing''. Yet, distinguishing between a gerund, and a verb can sometimes cause trouble. For example:

*&quot;''Swimming'' has to be the best sport ever.&quot; (''Swimming'' is gerund.)
*&quot;I went swimming today.&quot; (Not a Gerund, because it is not an idea.)

Examples of gerunds as the subject of a sentence are:

*&quot;''Backpacking'' is a rewarding pastime.&quot;
*&quot;''Stretching'' can loosen up muscles.&quot;
*&quot;No ''smoking''.&quot; (I.e., no smoking is allowed / you may not smoke here.)

As an object:
*&quot;We all love to go ''bowling'' on the weekend.&quot;
*&quot;He loves ''eating'' chips.&quot;

An object of preposition:

*&quot;They complained of ''hearing'' strange sounds from the next cabin.&quot;
*&quot;They sang about ''being'' eaten by bears to allay their fears.&quot;

And as a complement to a subject:

*&quot;One of the most dangerous things to do on the lake is ''ice-skating''.&quot;

== Participles ==

'''Participles''' are forms of verbs which are used as adjectives. A participle is a word derived from a verb, participating the properties of a verb, and of an adjective or a noun; and is generally formed by adding ''ing'', ''d'', or ''ed'', to the verb: thus, from the verb rule, are formed three participles, two simple and one compound; as, ''ruling, ruled, having ruled''.

English verbs, not defective, have severally three participles; which have been very variously denominated, perhaps the most accurately thus: the present, the past, and the past perfect. Or, as their order is undisputed, they may be conveniently called the first, the second, and the third.

The '''present participle''' is that which ends commonly in ''ing'', and implies a continuance of the being, action, or passion: as, ''being, acting, ruling, loving, defending, terminating''. Therefore:

*''Talk'' becomes ''talking''
*''Jump'' becomes ''jumping''
*''Open'' becomes ''opening''
*''See'' becomes ''seeing''

The present participle, when simple, is always formed by adding ''ing'', or it is formed by prefixing being to some other simple participle; as, ''being reading, being read, being completed''.

The '''past participle''' is that which ends commonly in ''ed'' or ''en'', and implies a completion of the being, action, or passion: as, ''been, acted, ruled, loved, defended, terminated''. Therefore:

*''Talk'' becomes ''talked''
*''Jump'' becomes ''jumped''
*''Open'' becomes ''opened''
*However, ''See'' becomes ''seen''

The past participle is always simple, and is regularly formed by adding ''d'' or ''ed'' to the radical verb: those verbs from which it is formed otherwise, are either irregular or redundant.

The irregular verb ''see'' also did not have a regular past participle. As with most irregular words, there is no good &quot;general rule&quot; which applies, but often ''ed'' is replaced by 'en'. More irregular verbs with irregular past participles are:

*''Be'', ''been''
*''Break'', ''broken''
*''Eat'', ''eaten''
*''Slide'', ''slid''

The '''past perfect participle''' is that which takes the sign having, and implies a previous completion of the being, action, or passion: as, ''having loved, having seen, having written; having been loved, having been writing, having been written''.

The past perfect participle is always compound, and is formed by prefixing having to the past participle, when the compound is double, and having been to the past or the present participle, when the compound is triple: as, having spoken, having been spoken, having been speaking.

===A short syntax===

Participles relate to nouns or pronouns, as &quot;Reading Plato,&quot;
except the following cases: the preceding phrase, as &quot;To leave them, appearing a duty,&quot; an abstract action or being, as &quot;To seem compelled, is disagreeable,&quot; substitute for infinitive, as &quot;Afraid of trying,&quot; and substitute for a noun, as &quot;This is talking.&quot;

==Examples==

*He is '''talking''' to her.
*They are '''jumping''' into the pool.
*We had '''eaten''' the pie.
Each of these cases has a verb acting as an adjective, describing the subject.

In case you were wondering, ''had'' plus a past participle is called a '''past perfect''', or in the United Kingdom, the '''pluperfect'''.

This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Level 8 PDA''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.scottishlibraries.org/ '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Carrying Out the Educator Role''' is an optional unit in the Level 8 PDA programme.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the '''Level 7''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Level 8''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.

== Establishing ICT training needs for individuals or groups ==
=== Training needs analysis ===

Before embarking on designing and delivering any training programme you must establish your precise objectives. This means determining:

*1.	the '''existing''' skills, knowledge and competences of each of the learners

*2.	the skills, knowledge and competences the learners '''require''' in order to operate effectively in their existing work role or to progress to a different work role

*3.	And, from 1 and 2, the '''gap''' in skills, knowledge and competence which the training is designed to address.

It will be the objective of your training that each participant learns enough to eliminate this gap.

This process is often called a '''Training Needs Analysis (TNA)''' or '''Learning Needs Analysis (LNA)'''.  For Outcome 1 you must demonstrate that you can carry out a straightforward TNA for individuals and groups of learners. 

The first step then is to make an '''accurate estimate''' of the learner’s current competence.

 	
----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, outline what may happen if you embark on delivering training without ascertaining the existing skills, knowledge and competence of your learners.

----

 

==== TNA problems ====

There are two equally damaging scenarios. 

At one extreme you may have '''overestimated''' the learners’ skills and knowledge.  You therefore pitch your training at too high a level.  If you are lucky, the learners will point this out to you and you may be able to think on your feet and do a quick redesign of the training. 

However, if you find yourself having to devote a considerable amount of time to bringing the learners’ skills and knowledge up to the point at which you thought you would be starting from, you will be unlikely to be able to achieve the final learning objectives in the original timescale.  

If you have overestimated the skills of only one or two members of a learning group, it is quite likely that they will not draw your attention to this.  Instead they will sit quietly, not wishing to appear foolish in front of their colleagues.  In this situation they will learn little and will become demotivated and disinterested.

At the other extreme you may have '''underestimated''' the learners’ skills and knowledge.  You will then find yourself delivering training which covers areas which they already know – “teaching Granny to suck eggs”.  

Your learners are likely to become quickly '''disenchanted''' and possibly aggressive.  If this applies to only one or two in a learning group, these learners are likely to switch off and may distract other group members.

From these examples, you can see the importance of really knowing your learners before you start.

 

==== Estimating ICT Competence ====

Learners may have acquired differing '''levels''' of ICT competence through:

*	'''formal training''' in the workplace
*	'''experience''' in the workplace
*	'''off-the-job training''' such as an ICT course at school or college
*	'''personal development''' and experience outside work.

Where skills and knowledge come from non-workplace environments, it is important to make sure that they are transferable into a workplace setting.  ICT skills and knowledge usually do transfer readily.  Thus your TNA should relate to competences from both work and non-work environments.

The obvious place to start is with the learners themselves. However, people are, depending on their personality, often inclined to underplay or alternatively exaggerate their ICT competence and experience.  So you will wish to '''corroborate''' the learner’s estimates of their competence through hard evidence or the views of other people.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of who else, apart from the learners themselves, might be able to provide you with useful information on a learner’s ICT competence.

----

 

==== Sources of information regarding ICT competence ====

You might usefully consult some or all of the learner’s:

*	'''line manager''' or immediate supervisor
*	'''colleagues'''
*	'''previous tutors''' or trainers from within and outside your own organisation
*	'''clients''' in the library who will have received a service from the learner which is ICT related.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down as many techniques as you can which you might use to gather information on the learner’s competence from the learner themselves or from any or all of the people listed above.

----

==== Information gathering techniques ====

You might use some or all of:

*	direct observation of the learner using ICT in the workplace
*	examination of work samples or work records belonging to the learner
*	practical tests and assessments of the learner’s use of ICT
*	questionnaires or checklists covering key ICT competences
*	the learner’s staff appraisal reports
*	interviews or focus groups with learner, manager, colleagues, tutors, clients

 

==== Direct Observation ====

This is one of the most reliable methods for you to gauge the learner’s competence.  You will see for yourself exactly what they can and cannot do.  You can supplement this by '''questioning''' to extend to situations which occur rarely or would be emergencies.  Use questions like &quot;What would you do if the system crashed at this point?” or “Can you think of an occasion when what you have just done would not be appropriate?”

There are a few '''disadvantages''' with direct observation.  The learner may feel nervous and so under-perform.  Alternatively, they may “play to the camera”, although this is usually easily spotted.  The main drawback is that observation must be done on a one-to-one basis.  It is therefore time-consuming.  Another difficulty can be that you have to arrange a time which is convenient to both you and the learner and when work conditions allow the learner to carry out the specified tasks.

 

==== Examination of Work Products ====

ICT tasks often produce '''printed materials''' or '''electronic records''' which are stored in the computer.  These demonstrate clearly what a learner has been capable of.

 

==== Practical Tests and Assessments ====

You may be able to devise a short pre-training assessment which all learners will undertake. Make sure that this assesses only the knowledge and skills which are directly relevant to the proposed training (and, it goes without saying, to the work to which this training is related). 

Devising assessment material is a skilled task.  It is always advantageous to have a dummy run with a couple of volunteers who will give you unbiased feedback and point out any ambiguities or deficiencies in the assessment.  You may be able to get assistance in devising assessment materials from your Training or HR Department. 

 
==== Questionnaires or Checklists ====

Questionnaires or checklists can be completed by the learner themselves or by other people who can give an '''informed opinion''' as to the learner’s competence.  It is important not to make these too detailed.  You should home in on the key competences only. 

Here’s an example of a checklist which might be used to establish a learner’s competence in using applications under Microsoft Windows.

Please tick the box which best describes your ability to carry out each of the tasks below:

{| style=&quot;width:50%; height:200px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:100px&quot;
| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; |Task

| &amp;nbsp;
|}

==== Staff Appraisal Reports  ====

Staff appraisal documents are, of course, '''confidential'''.  However, with the agreement of the member of staff concerned you may be shown relevant extracts relating to ICT skills.

 

==== Interviews or Focus Groups  ====

These an take place with learners, managers, colleagues tutors or clients and may be one-to-one or group interviews.  It is vital to obtain the consent of the learner before you invite opinions from others as to the learner’s ICT competence.  It is equally important to reassure others that the learner has agreed to your interview with them.  In some cases the learner may be able to suggest appropriate interviewees who could provide valuable insight into their ICT competence.

In all cases it is essential to start the interview by explaining the reasons why you are exploring the learner’s ICT competence.  It is good practice to use a checklist to ensure that you get all the required information from each interviewee.

==== Areas of competence ====

You can use these techniques to profile the learner’s '''existing ICT''' skills in the areas of:

*	hardware
*	operating system environment (e.g.: Windows)
*	packages used (e.g.: Word)
*	the library’s own ICT management system
*	the Internet

In Outcome 1 of Unit 3 we discussed in some detail the areas which you would want to explore under each of these headings.  If you want to review this material, you can click the ICTL logo near the top left of the page to return to the Unit 7 home page and navigate to the relevant Outcome from there.

 

==== Learning objectives ====

The next stage is to determine your learning objectives, i.e.: the skills and knowledge which it is intended all learners should possess at the end of the training.  These will usually be related to: 

*	improving the learners’ '''competence in their current job'''
*	preparing for planned '''new ICT devleopments''' which will impinge on the learners’ current job
*	upskilling so that the learners can move on to a different job which requires '''increased ICT competence.'''

To determine the required skills and knowledge, you can use the same or modifications of the methods for assessing existing ICT competence

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, look at this list again: 

*	direct observation of learner using ICT in the workplace
*	examination of work samples or work records belonging to the learner
*	practical tests and assessments of the learner’s use of ICT
*	questionnaires or checklists covering key ICT competences
*	the learner’s staff appraisal reports·	interviews with learner, manager, colleagues, tutors, clients

Remembering that this time you are focusing on the end product of the training, amend the list to show the methods you could employ.

----

 

==== Methods of gathering information ====

We think that this time you will lay more emphasis than previously on evidence from people other than the learner.  Of course, it is still important to consult the learner in order to gain their views on the skills which they think they require.  However, at this stage you are likely also to consider:

*	'''direct observation''' of others using ICT in the workplace, e.g.: staff already employed in a post to which the learner may aspire
*	'''examination of work samples or work records''' belonging to others, e.g.: a colleague in a similar job to the learner who demonstrates greater ICT competence
*	'''questionnaires or checklist'''s covering key ICT competences, e.g.: completed by managerial or supervisory staff
*	'''interviews''' with managers, supervisors and colleagues in similar posts or in promoted posts
*	'''literature''' provided by suppliers of new/upgraded ICT equipment which it is intended to install in the library.

And finally having gathered all your evidence as to the existing skills and knowledge of your learners and the competence which are the end result of the training, you can design an appropriate training programme to upskill the learners to the required level.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, consider what approach you might adopt if your training needs analysis establishes that the ICT skills of your small group of learners differ considerably.  

----

 

==== Dealing with differing skill levels ====

Your approach might be to design '''individual learning programmes''' for each learner which they can work through independently of their colleagues. 

However, it is probably more cost-effective to bring the skills of all group members up to a common base level and then provide group training from that point on.  You might, for instance, arrange for three of the group to work through some basic ICT learning packages in the library before you delivered some group sessions on simple Internet searching.

== Selecting a delivery approach ==
=== Learning styles ===

We all learn in a variety of ways but each of us tends to have one learning style with which we feel most comfortable.  Many educational theorists have written about learning styles and the implications of these for delivery of training.  One well-accepted approach is that of '''Honey and Mumford''' who identified four main learning styles:

*	activists
*	reflectors
*	theorists
*	pragmatists

According to Honey and Mumford, different learning activities are associated with each of the four learning styles.

 

==== Activists ====

Activists prefer '''new experiences, opportunities to tackle problems''' and '''difficult tasks'''.  They like challenges, generating new ideas, brain storming, leading others. Their philosophy is: &quot;I'll try anything once&quot;. 

They tend to act first and consider the consequences afterwards. They are gregarious and like learning in a group with other people, although they can tend to try to centre all such group activities on themselves.

 

==== Reflectors ====

Reflectors are thoughtful people who prefer to '''collect all the facts''' and data and '''consider every aspect''' of a situation before taking action. 

They will listen to others’ opinions and experiences and learn from these. They are likely to adopt a low profile in group discussions but enjoy observing other people in action. 

 

==== Theorists ====

Theorists prefer a '''clear structure, focus and purpose''' and will want to know exactly what is expected of them. They like to have time to '''think logically''' about ideas and situations and try to fit these into a pattern. 

They learn by thinking problems through in a step-by-step, logical way. They like to analyse and synthesise. They are uncomfortable with subjective judgements, lateral thinking and anything flippant. They are happy to learn alone without group support. 

 

==== Pragmatists ====

Pragmatists learn best through '''concrete activities''' which let them try out ideas, theories and techniques. They like to have the opportunity to '''practice''' what they are learning with '''feedback''' from a knowledgeable mentor. 

As they are essentially practical, down to earth people who like making practical decisions and solving problems, they tend to dislike long-winded and open-ended discussions. 

Although each learner is likely to have one preferred learning style, everyone can use a '''mixture of styles''', depending on the type of learning and the occasion.  

QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Different Learning Implications

 

==== Other approaches to learning styles ====

The approach of '''Honey and Mumford''' is just one way of looking at different learning styles. If you wish to explore this further, you will find some good summaries of other approaches at: http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/experience.htm

Another way of categorising learners is to measure their attributes in terms of:

*1.	Active vs reflective
*2.	Sensing vs intuitive
*3.	Visual vs verbal
*4.	Sequential vs global.

You can learn more about these learning styles and their implications for design and delivery of training at: http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html 

This also includes a '''short online questionnaire''' which you can be used to determine your own learning style.
 
That's the end of this section. You can review any topic by using the menu at the left-hand side of the screen, or move on to the next section: Delivery approaches …

=== Delivery approaches ===

When we explored the four different learning styles, we realised that the trainer must chose '''appropriate delivery methods''' in order to accommodate the styles of the learners. 

Another equally important dimension to consider is matching the delivery method to the nature and content of the learning.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list the most common types of delivery method which you might be able to include in a programme of workplace training.

----

 

==== Delivery methods ====

Among the most common delivery methods are:

*	“chalk and talk”
*	demonstration
*	group problem solving
*	role playing and simulations
*	practical activities, individually and in groups
*	individualised learning,  e.g. from a book or an e-learning package
*	videos and other media.

==== “Chalk and Talk” ====

This phrase is often used to describe '''traditional teaching'''. The picture it conjures up is of the trainer in front of the group of learners, giving a talk on some topic. Nowadays, the “chalk” element is more likely to be a whiteboard, flipchart or a PowerPoint computerised presentation. This method is suitable where the trainer wishes to impart theoretical knowledge to the whole group of learners. 

We absorb more information from '''what we see''' than from what we hear. So it makes sense always to include visuals, either on the board, chart or screen or through handouts or posters.  The learners’ '''attention span''' will be limited when they are required only to listen to someone talking. Good practice is to introduce a variation by asking questions of the learners, encouraging the learners to ask questions of you or by interspersing your talk with group discussions.

==== Demonstration ====

The trainer will demonstrate '''how to carry out a practical activity''' to either a group of learners or to an individual. You might be able to incorporate demonstrations from other people – experienced colleagues or one of the group who is more skilled than the others. 

When group demonstrations are involved, it is crucial that every group member can observe the demonstration clearly and has the opportunity to ask questions of the demonstrator.

==== Group Problem Solving ====

'''Team working''' is one of the most highly prized skills in the workforce of today. Any training which involves group problem solving has the multiple advantage of:

*	improving the learners team working skills
*	developing the particular competences related to the training topic
*	enhancing the core problems solving skills of the learners.

Problem solving activities need to be carefully structured by the trainer. A useful approach is to encourage the learners to adopt a process of Plan–Do–Review. This ensures that they progress to the stage of evaluating their problem solving strategy and learning from it: not just designing and implementing a strategy for solving the problem.

 

==== Role Playing and Simulations ====

These offer the opportunity for participants to practice in a safe environment and to learn about situations which occur only rarely or which involve danger and emergency action. 

However, role-playing and simulations should be used sensitively, remembering that many learners feel apprehensive in artificially constructed situations.

 

==== Practical Activities ====

'''Hands-on practical work''' has an important role to play in workplace learning. It offers the learners the opportunity to develop skills in a real situation, with the equipment they will actually use on the job. Do make sure that there is enough equipment. 

In particular, it is unwise to double learners up on terminals to undertake computer-related tasks. This usually results in one (the more confident) learner carrying out all the tasks, while their partner passively watches.

 

==== Individualised Learning ====

You may have access to commercially produced learning packages (print or electronic) which are applicable to the training you wish to deliver. The alternative is to design your own – but be warned - this requires '''considerable skill''' and '''time input''' on the part of the trainer, if a polished and professional product is to result.

 

==== Videos and other media ====

It is common to use audio or video material in learning sessions. These provide the opportunity to engage the learner by introducing experiences from beyond the training room or the library service.  And they can provide a welcome change from the trainer’s voice!

=== Motivating learners ===

Motivation is the key to all successful learning. You may have designed a wonderful training programme but if the learners are not motivated to learn, your efforts are doomed to failure.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, make a list of factors which can demotivate learners

----
 

==== Demotivating learners ====

We could demotivate you by giving a long list here! But instead here is a summary of what we think are the '''main demotivators''' for learners.

'''The training itself:'''

*	The training is at too high or low a level.

*	Learners have been compelled to attend the training without the reasons for their participation being adequately explained.

*	The topic appears irrelevant to the learners.

*	The trainer has not outlined clearly at the start of the training what the '''specific learning objectives''' are.

*	The training is '''delivered badly.'''

*	The '''learning environment''' is poor.

'''The learner:'''

*	Learners have had previous '''negative experiences''' at school, college or of workplace training.

*	Learners are '''distracted''' by problems unconnected with the learning.

==== Level of training ====

If the training is pitched at the '''wrong level''', it will result in learners who are either '''struggling to cope''' or '''bored'''. Neither category of learner will be particularly motivated to learn. If you have carried out the training needs assessment properly, this should simply not occur. 

Learners for whom the training would have been at too high a level should have received preparatory training to upskill them and extend their knowledge to the competence required. 

Learners for whom the training would be at too low a level should either simply not attend or could be slotted in part way through the programme at the point at which the learning becomes relevant to them.

 

==== Other demotivating factors ====

We will group the next three points together as they are closely linked.

*	Learners have been compelled to attend the training without the '''reasons''' for their participation being adequately explained.

*	The topic appears '''irrelevant''' to the learners.

*	The trainer has not outlined clearly at the start of the training what the '''specific learning objectives''' are.

We take it as read that the topic is relevant to the learners - otherwise there is no justification for you to deliver the training. 

Reasons for attendance should be clearly explained to the learners in advance and links between the proposed training and their work demonstrated. It is especially important to outline the benefits to the learners themselves (as opposed to the library service) which will result from the training programme. You might be able to show, for instance, how learning to use a new computer program could cut down on boring, repetitive manual tasks. As the trainer you may either discuss these issues yourself with the learners in advance of the training or, alternatively, you should ensure that another person does so, most probably their line manager. In the later case you may find it helpful to construct a briefing sheet.

At the start of the training programme you will outline your specific learning objectives and how you intend to deliver the training to achieve these. At this point you should clarify what your expectations of the learners are and, conversely, what support the learners can expect from you.

 

==== Badly delivered training ====

We hope that when you have completed this unit, this will not be the case! However, let us list a few common pitfalls which you should try to avoid.

*	Trying to pack '''too much material''' into a learning session

*	Poorly produced '''visuals'''

*	Irritating '''mannerisms''' on the part of the trainer, e.g.: jingling coins in pocket, fiddling with jewellery

*	'''Poor delivery''', e.g.: mumbling, speaking too quickly

*	'''Lack of variation''' of learning activities

*	'''Poorly structured learning programme''', e.g.: no logical flow through content (See Outcome 3)

*	Trainer does not have '''sufficient knowledge''' or skills in topic

 

==== Poor learning environment ====

We are using the term “learning environment” to encompass the '''venue''', '''the equipment''', the '''resources''' etc. You should make sure that any practical issues which might demotivate the learner are minimised. 

Examples might be too high or too low temperatures in the training room, training sessions which start late or over-run, extraneous noise or distractions, technical problems with ICT equipment, interruptions from colleagues seeking information on day-to-day work. And do make sure that all mobile phones are switched off before the training commences.

==== Previous negative experiences ====

Obviously establishing a friendly, reassuring '''relationship''' with the learner is crucial here. It may also be helpful to expand on the differences between the current training programme and any previous negative experiences which the learner has had. You could emphasise for instance that your learners will be able to work at their own pace, can practice what they are learning in the workplace with support from more experienced colleagues, will not have to sit formal examinations or test etc.

One major motivator is for the learner to see that they have achieved something. Success breeds success. The implication of this for you as the trainer is that learning programmes must be broken down into small sections and the objective and sub-objectives for each section should be clearly explained to your learners. For instance, if the training relates to word processing, a sub-objective might be for the learner to become competent in left, right and full justification of text.

 

==== Distractions ====

If a learner is worried about '''personal problems''', they will be unable to give their full attention to learning new things. This is possibly the most difficult demotivator for a trainer to tackle. After all, you can do little if one of your learners is experiencing financial difficulties, marital problems or is concerned about their health. All you can do in these circumstances is to reassure the learner that you are sympathetic to any difficulties which they have shared with you and that you will attempt to accommodate any special requests resulting from them.

You may be able to take some action about more practical problems though. An example would be if the training occurs at the venue which is not the learner’s normal workplace, resulting in childcare problems because of long journeys by public transport. By allowing such a learner to leave ten minutes earlier, you might be able to resolve the situation.

If you wish to read more about the theory of motivation and its application to training, you will find a good summary at http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/motivation.htm

== Design of learning materials and programmes on ICT related topics ==
=== Defining learning objectives ===

You should define learning objectives in '''specific terms'''. Learning objectives usually involve a statement of:

*	'''the task or knowledge''' involved, i.e.: what must the learner be able to do or know? E.g.: save data in a spreadsheet
*	'''the condition,'''  i.e.: how will it be performed? E.g.: without reference to the Help facility
*	'''the standard,''' i.e.: how well must it be performed? E.g.: correctly in 90% of cases

It is generally accepted that all learning objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timebound.) You can find more information about this at http://explearning.ucf.edu/registered-students/tips-for-success/writing-smart-learning-objectives/195 

You can find useful guides to writing learning objectives at the following locations:

==== Bloom's Taxonomy  ====

You may find it useful to investigate Bloom’s Taxonomy as a framework for writing learning objectives. In 1956 Benjamin Bloom wrote a book entitled “Taxonomy of Educational Objectives” which has been widely adopted within the educational community as the de facto way of classifying '''cognitive competence'''. An updated version of the book, edited by Anderson and Krathwohl was published in 2001. You can easily find it at www.amazon.co.uk and other online bookshops.

Bloom’s Taxonomy is a simple way of categorising cognitive skills. It has six levels:

*1.       knowledge
*2.       comprehension
*3.       application
*4.       analysis
*5.       synthesis
*6.       evaluation.

'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''

Choose a simple task, e.g.: “Using tables in Word” and write learning objectives for it.

(Try to choose a task which is of some relevance to you, or to one of your clients, as we’ll be using it for activities throughout this section.)

----

==== Structuring learning ====

In structuring learning you should take account of the learning cycle. In its simplest (3 stage) form the way in which learning takes place may be expressed as plan, do and review. See http://www.wilderdom.com/experiential/elc/ExperientialLearningCycle.htm for more detail.



or Kolb’s more sophisticated version:

http://www.businessballs.com/kolblearningstyles.htm

==== Learning sequence ====

You should be able to devise a '''logical sequence''' for the learning, taking account of which parts of the learning are a precursor for others, moving from simpler to more complex concepts and grouping related topics together. 

Any session should have a '''beginning''' (where the objectives are clearly stated and agreed by the candidate and the learners), a '''middle''' (where the learning activities are undertaken) and an '''end''' (where the learning is summarised and next steps agreed). 

The learning plan should be made clear to the learners when the learning programme commences. In structuring the learning the candidate should ensure that a variety of '''learning experiences''' are included to prevent tedium from demotivating the learner.

You can find a lot of useful information about '''structuring learning''' from the link below. Although it is specifically aimed at teachers, most of the information given is equally applicable in other learning contexts.

http://www.teachfind.com/national-strategies/foundation-subjects-strand-key-messages-about-structuring-learning

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Draw up a learning plan to allow a specific client to achieve the objectives you listed in the previous activity. Your plan should take account of the client’s preferred learning style. 

----

==== Using ICT to create learning materials ====

Your approach to the use of software to create learning materials will be dependent on the availability of software within your own organisation.  There are several '''courseware creation packages''' available, which can be used.  Although they offer many features to include multimedia etc., the vital advantage is that they provide routing (branching and looping) through the material allowing learners to take their own appropriate path.  They can also provide automated and recorded assessment. 

One easy-to-use package is '''Course Genie''', which lets you create course materials in Word and convert them automatically to HTML. This software has now been superceeded by Wimba Create:

http://www.wimba.com/products/wimba_create

This site also offers extensive demos on the use of the software.

Other examples of content creation software include '''Authorware, Director''' and '''Dreamweaver''' (http://www.macromedia.com) and products such as '''Lectora''' (http://www.lectora.co.uk).  It should be noted that these are complex products and you may require specialised training to achieve maximum benefit.

If specialised software is not available, there are other ICT routes.  Word processing software such as Microsoft Word can be used to author content.  Graphics, animations, videos and sound files can also be included in the document, as well as text.  Animations and sound files will then operate when the document is viewed on a computer.

A more polished package can be created by using presentation software such as '''Microsoft PowerPoint'''.  The greatest advantage is that this will create a page-based approach. Additionally a '''common look''' can be created throughout the whole package. Again, sound or still and moving visual effects can be incorporated.

You should have knowledge of how both specialised and general software can be used to create a learning package and have experience of authoring with either general or specialised software.

You can use a site like: http://www.jiscrsc.ac.uk/scotland which has a range of practical units on making the most of Microsoft software aimed at designing simple learning episodes.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3'''

Use the package of your choice to create a short learning episode designed to meet one of the objectives you outlined earlier.

----

==== Selecting and merging content from internal and external sources ====

You should appreciate that it is not always necessary to produce '''original content''' for learning packages. A wealth of learning material is available through the Internet and much of this is copyright free for educational purposes. You should ensure that any chosen material matches the learning objectives and style of the complete package and that the use which is made of the chosen material is fully compliant with copyright.

You can often find useful materials quickly with a search engine, but you may also like to check some of the following links:

The BBC offers a number of useful online courses on PC-related topics: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learning/onlinecourses/

You can find useful online resources for learning about Microsoft Office products at: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training-FX101782702.aspx

If your library is an SQA centre, you may be able to get access to the '''PC Passport''' materials produced by SQA. You can get more information at: http://www.sqa.org.uk/pcpassport 

If you have access to these materials you can download them in Word format, allowing you to modify them if you wish.

There are also a number of low-cost or open source courseware suppliers. For example, '''[https://moodle.org/ Moodle]''' is open source software widely used by schools, colleges and universities

'''ACTIVITY 3.4'''

See if you can use a search engine to locate any resources which would be useful for meeting the learning objectives you outlined earlier.

== Support individuals and groups in their use of learning materials ==
=== Types of support ===

We often see the terms coaching, mentoring and training used in relation to workplace learning.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you write down a short definition of each of these terms, as you understand them?

----

 

==== Support roles ====

Although there may be some argument over the precise meaning of these terms, the following definitions bring out the key differences between them.

In '''coaching''', the learner and the coach are active collaborators.  The coach observes the learner in a real, naturally occurring workplace situation as they try to complete tasks.  The coach provides hints, help, and feedback as needed. 

'''Mentoring''' involves a sustained relationship between the learner and the mentor who offers support, guidance, and assistance. 

'''Training''' is more formal learning, and more of a one-way process, where the trainer imparts skills and knowledge to the learner.

 
==== Coaching ====

Coaching was originally used in business to describe support given to people who were seen as under-performing in some way.  Now it is more usually seen as a means of supporting people on the job in order to help them '''improve their competence''' and achieve their maximum potential.  The analogy of the sports coach developing the tennis player to improve their techniques and win more matches may be helpful. 

Coaching is generally considered to be a fairly '''short-term''' activity, related to specific objectives.  It consists of a one-to-one interaction between the coach and the person being coached in a relatively informal setting.  The aim is to provide the learner with feedback in their performance together with suggestions on how to improve from a knowledgeable and skilled person. 

Skilled coaches know when to be '''directive''' and when to be '''passive'''.  They can distinguish between situations when it is appropriate to '''intervene''' to support the learner and when it is more effective to permit independent learning even though this involves the learner making mistakes. 

==== Mentoring ====

Mentoring has become very fashionable in the last few years.  Although mentoring is a relatively widespread practice there is no '''formal definition''' of what mentoring is but, generally speaking, it could be defined as a relationship between two people - the mentee (the person being mentored) and the mentor - which will positively affect the development of at least one of them.  Note the phrase “positively affect the development of at least one of them”.  This recognises the fact that most mentors will say that they too have gained from the experience of mentoring.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''

Think of people who have had a significant influence on the development, progression and direction of your career.  You may come up with several. Now identify what they did which influenced you. 

----

 

==== Significant influences ====

You will probably find that the people who have affected your career significantly:

*	Guided you
*	Supported you
*	Created opportunities for you
*	Provided a role model for you.

By doing one or more of these things they were fulfilling the role of a mentor in some way. Someone who is designated as a formal mentor will do all of the above.  The mentoring relationship will last over a period of time.  This allows mentor and mentee to get to know and trust one another.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, write down the qualities which you consider a good mentor would require.

----

 

==== Mentor qualities ====

We think that a good mentor should:

*	Provide a '''good role model'''

*	Possess excellent '''communication skills'''

*	Be able to '''empathise''' with the mentee

*	Recognise that learners have '''different motivations, skills, knowledge and needs''' and be able to capitalise on these

*	Be good at '''spotting learning opportunities''' and challenges which will assist the mentee’s development

*	Be '''well informed''' about the objectives and content of the training programme being undertaken by the mentee in order to provide maximum support

*	Provide '''meaningful feedback''' to the mentee

*	Understand that sometimes it may be necessary to '''push''' the mentee to move out of their comfort zone

*	Encourage the mentee to '''think for themselves''' and work out solutions to problems

From the above you can appreciate how useful coaches and mentors could be in supporting the learning programme which you are delivering.

To find out more about coaching and mentoring, look at:
*http://www.coachingnetwork.org.uk/ResourceCentre/WhatAreCoachingAndMentoring.htm

==== Training ====

Training is more directive than either coaching or mentoring.  It involves the learners receiving input from the trainer in the form of instruction.  Training is always specific and may be long or short term.  The trainer is your role! This unit explores the skills you require and the methods you may use to deliver direct training to the learners. 

As the trainer, you must consider the ways in which coaches and/or mentors could contribute to the progress of your learners.  You must exercise care in the choice of staff to undertake the coaching/mentoring role.  As well as having the necessary work-related knowledge and skills, they must be in a position to devote time to coaching/mentoring and should be able to develop a real rapport with your learners.

QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Coaching, Mentoring or Training

=== First line ICT support ===

You are designing and delivering training on ICT related topics.  It is therefore very likely that your learners themselves will be operating ICT equipment as part of the learning programme.  When a learner is using any type of computerised equipment, it is likely that from time to time some '''technical snags''' will arise.  

You must be able to assist the learner with straightforward trouble shooting e.g. printing problems because the page set-up is not correct; computer “hanging”; changing screen resolution.  You should also be able to assist any learner with special needs to use appropriate features of the technology. 

We are not suggesting that you should possess sophisticated trouble shooting skills: this is the responsibility of ICT technical staff.  You should simply be able to cope with typical, straightforward difficulties which can arise.

The next few pages summarise some of the most common problems you are likely to encounter, together with some tips on how to solve these.

==== The monitor appears blank ====

*	Check to see if the computer has ‘gone to sleep’ by pressing the '''space bar''' on the keyboard.

*	Check that the monitor is '''switched on''' and connected to the mains i.e. is the power light illuminated?

*	Check that the monitor is '''correctly connected''' to the computer.

*	Check to see if the system works after the computer is '''reset''' or switched off at the mains and on again.

 

==== The computer hangs ====

Sometimes, after using the computer for some time, it ‘hangs’; neither keyboard nor mouse appears to operate.

*	Wait a while to see if the computer is performing some '''intensive task''' and recovers.

*	Try '''CtrlAltDel'''.  If you are lucky it will bring up a task manager window which will show you which application is not responding and allow you to close down only that application.

*	Use the '''reset button''' to restart the computer.

*	'''Switch the computer off''' at the mains and then on again.

 
==== Monitor text is too small ====

Sometimes a client has difficulty reading off the monitor because the text is too small.

*	If this is confined to a particular application, it is usually possible to adjust the '''zoom setting'''.  If this does not appear in a box near the top of the window, it will be found in the menu system under View: Zoom or View: Text size.

*	If this applies to everything on the monitor, then, if you have access rights, you can change the '''monitor settings'''.  Right click with the mouse on the desktop, choose Properties from the resulting menu, choose the Settings tab from the dialogue box, reduce the Screen resolution setting and OK.  Unfortunately, the lower the screen resolution, the less can be displayed on the monitor.  This often results in an uneasy compromise for people with problems with their sight.

 

==== Nothing comes out of the printer ====

*	Check that the printer is switched on and connected to the mains i.e. is the power light illuminated?

*	Check that the printer is '''correctly connected''' to the computer.

*	Check that the printer has '''paper''' in it.

*	Check the '''ink supply'''.

*	Try printing a '''test page'''.

*	Check the print settings in both the operating system and the application to see that the computer is looking for the correct printer and that the correct size of paper has been selected and that manual/auto (as appropriate) is chosen.

 

==== Print layout is wrong ====

Sometimes the printer does not seem to use the whole of the sheet of paper and the layout is not the same as on the monitor.

When using a word processor like Word, it is possible to set the '''paper size''' in the application.  However there is also a setting for the printer itself.  If these two settings are different, then the output will not appear correctly on the page.  The driver for a newly connected printer may default to US legal for the paper size.  It is normal to use A4 in this country and applications will use this as default.  Go to the printer properties and check the paper size.  Start: Settings: Printers: right click on the printer concerned, choose Properties and select the Device settings tab.

 

==== Disk is full ====

Sometimes, when saving data from an Office application like Word, the message comes up that the disk is full.

*	It may be that the client’s '''floppy disk''' or '''pen drive''' is full.  This is quite likely for any sizeable word-processed document especially if it contains graphics or other embedded items.

*	A fault condition can arise concerning interaction between the application and the operating system which results in a false reporting of the disk full error.  This is irretrievable and requires the computer to be rebooted.  If the client will lose a fair amount of unsaved data, it is worth opening a new document and '''copy and pasting''' from the original to the new document and then trying to save that.  You may be lucky!

*	Note: a similar problem can occur regarding the '''computer''' running out of memory.  Again only rebooting the computer will correct the situation.

 

==== The printer jams ====

There is no universal solution for this problem as each printer has its own unique mechanism.  The best you can do is to familiarise yourself with the various types of printer in your library and how to un-jam each.

== Evaluate and revise learning materials and programmes ==
=== Assessing learner progress ===

When the learning programme is underway, you will want to '''review regularly''' how your learners are progressing towards their objectives. We should make it clear at this point that this unit is intended for library staff who find themselves in the role of educators and not for those who are required to undertake formal assessment of learners for National or Scottish Vocational Qualifications or other workplace awards. That type of assessment must be undertaken by someone who has an assessor or teacher qualification. 

In this unit we are concerned only with assessment which will give '''feedback''' to the learner on his/her progress towards the learning objectives and to you, the trainer, as to how effective the learning programme has been. (You may see this referred to as “formative” assessment.) In this context you will use methods which are as non-threatening as possible to the learner.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down any ways that you could use to assess how well your learners are progressing.

----
 

==== Methods of assessing progress ====

We can think of quite a few methods of assessing learner progress. Two of the commonest are:

*	Direct observation

*	Examination of products

 

==== Direct Observation ====

The most immediate method is to observe directly the '''activities''' being undertaken by the learners during the learning programme.  From this you will get a clear idea as to whether your learners are actually managing the tasks they have been set and how well they are coping.  

While you are not in any way ‘giving marks’, you can use this information in two ways.  Firstly you can use it to provide a little bit more assistance to any learners having difficulty. Secondly you can use it to assess the success of your own approach in delivering the learning.

Trainers benefit from '''observing the learners''' at all points in the learning programme, not just when they are involved in specific tasks. Their facial expressions and body language will give you feedback on how well the training is being received. If you notice a learner, yawning, fidgeting or gazing out of the window while you are explaining a topic, it is unlikely that they are absorbing the information fully. 

Perhaps they know this information already, perhaps the material is too advanced for them, perhaps your explanation has confused them – in all of these cases, you need to take some action in order to re-engage them in the learning process.

 

==== Examination of products ====

Many of the learning activities you will ask the learners to undertake will produce a result which can be checked.  This may be a '''printout''' or '''screen dump''' or perhaps a '''file'''.  This is an excellent method to use for feedback purposes because, if your learning is well designed, the product will not be seen as something artificial, produced solely for assessment purposes.  Also, as evidence, it should be fairly incontrovertible, either there will be a result or not. 

Examining products gives you '''feedback''' without the learner really being aware that their performance is being assessed. You can simply review the product with the learner, leading naturally into a discussion of how easy it was to produce this, how it might be improved etc.

 

==== Assessment ‘lite’ ====

You may find it useful to use some methods which veer in the direction of traditional educational assessment.  For example, you can carry out a '''quiz''' or use a simple tick box test.
You can construct these yourself or tap into ones which experts have designed.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 5.1'''

Go to http://www.learner.org/courses/neuroscience/interactives/interactive2.html and try the learning related quiz which explores whether your left of right side of the brain is dominant. This quiz is quick and fun to complete. Although it is simple it would give you some useful feedback on your learners if you asked them to complete it before embarking on the learning programme.
   
----

When making up simple tests, it is best to confine yourself to TRUE/FALSE or “fill in the blanks” (sometimes called CLOZE) questions. Compiling multiple-choice questions requires a great deal of skill and is best left to specialists.

==== Cloze Question on Word Processing ====

A text with a straight margin down the right hand side is called___________ justified.

==== Direct Feedback ====

Here you can obtain feedback from individual learners using '''verbal interaction'''.  This can best be done during or perhaps towards the end of a training session.  

You can also allow the learner to create direct feedback by issuing '''scorecards'''.  The learner can use these to record the tasks in which they consider themselves to be competent as they progress through the learning.

==== A simple scorecard ====

This illustrates a scorecard for a learner who is part way through a learning programme on training needs analysis techniques.

==== Computer Based Assessment ====

Some ICT based learning packages incorporate '''diagnostic tests''' which score and benchmark learner competence automatically as they work though the package.  It is best to use a method where the learner sees the result and not something which appears secret and is suddenly sprung on the learner at the end of the course of learning.

Alternatively you can use special software such as '''Hot Potatoes''' to create your own computer based assessment tools. If you wish to read more about this, look at:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/e-learning/tools/hot_potatoes

=== Designing feedback tools ===

The previous section dealt with '''evaluating''' the learning you have developed in terms of assessing the learners’ progress towards the learning objectives.  It is also important to evaluate the learning you have developed by getting feedback on the learning experience.  As you can imagine, the overall quality of the learning experience has a deal of effect on the rate of progress of the learner.

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down which aspects of the learning experience you would want to ask the learners about.

----

 

==== Aspects requiring feedback ====

Here is a list of issues we would expect to be included in feedback on the learning experience. You may have thought of some additional points.

*	Were the '''learning objectives''' relevant?

*	Did the '''content''' match the stated learning objectives?

*	Was the '''quality''' of the learning materials satisfactory?

*	Did the trainer provide sufficient '''support'''?

*	Was the trainer’s '''presentation''' clear?

*	Was the '''learning environment''' pleasant?

*	Were there any deficiencies or problems with the '''equipment'''?

*	Was the '''learning experience''' enjoyable?

You can see that we have included a mixture of issues relating to learning objectives and delivery/support, as well as on the learning environment and enjoyment.

 

==== Objectives related issues ====

*	Were the learning objectives relevant?

*	Did the content match the stated learning objectives?

This area is important because the learner’s '''perception''' of the relevancy of the objectives is what matters.  If you are not getting this relevancy over to the learners, then you will have great motivational problems.  Also once the learner has accepted that the objectives are relevant, they must experience the content you provide as being the correct material.  

Although trainers may sometimes dismiss '''negative feedback''' from one individual learner in this area, it is clear that a low score from a significant number of learners for this area needs a serious response on your behalf.

 

==== Delivery related issues ====

*	Was the '''quality''' of the learning materials satisfactory?

*	Did the trainer provide sufficient '''support'''?

*	Was the trainer’s '''presentation''' clear?

This are core areas for you as a trainer because they are the areas you have most control over and input into.

If the learners consider the '''quality of the learning materials''' to be unsatisfactory, you should probe this further to find the exact cause of their dissatisfaction – were the materials at the correct level, clearly expressed, professionally presented, attractive to look at etc.

Different learners will require varied '''levels of support''' from the trainer. In this instance, negative feedback from just one or two learners is significant because it can indicate that you have tailored your level of support to suit the majority of the group and ignored the needs of those who are finding the learning more difficult than average. 

Individual learners will undoubtedly have different views on the '''learning experience''' in terms of the trainer’s delivery – an element of personality is involved here.  But again, if there is not a broad positive result from your learners in this area, you will have to look very closely at what you are doing.  

 

==== Learning environment issues ====

*	Was the '''learning environment''' pleasant?

*	Were there any deficiencies or problems with the '''equipment'''?

This area is one where the trainer may have limited control.  If you are allocated a dingy windowless room in which to carry out the training, or if you are given an old slow PC to carry out your ICT demonstrations on, you will have real problems in providing a good learning experience.  Try to pre-empt complaints on the learning environment by resolving any such difficulties '''in advance''' of delivering the learning.

 

==== Enjoyable experience ====

*	Was the learning experience enjoyable?

Finally we consider an overall question as to whether the learning was enjoyable.  Is this a valid question?  Well, if the learners did not enjoy the experience, it is unlikely that they benefited fully from it or that they will ever come back willingly for more!

 

==== Feedback form design ====

There are different methods of obtaining feedback.  You can use '''paper forms''' handed out to the learners, or utilise a '''computerised approach'''.

==== Types of feedback form ====

As we saw on the previous page, you should try to create questions which are:

*	'''relevant''' to the area to be evaluated

*	expressed in '''neutral terms''' so as not to prompt a certain answer

*	'''clearly phrased''' and non ambiguous.

In order to compare feedback from different learners or groups of learners, it is best to design feedback forms in which learners can score different aspects of the learning on a scale, by ticking the box corresponding to their choice.

You might offer five choices.

{| style=&quot;width:50%; height:20px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:20px&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Very Poor'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Poor'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Acceptable'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Good'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Excellent'''
|}	

But you can apply some psychology here.  If you have an odd number of possible ratings as we have here (5), there is a tendency for learners just to choose the '''middle''' one.  You can try to force them to make a more measured evaluation by having an even number of possibilities which makes them positively choose.  

{| style=&quot;width:40%; height:20px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:20px&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Poor'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Acceptable'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Good'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Excellent'''
|}	

These four categories can be represented by numerical values, say zero to three. 

*Poor = 0
*Acceptable = 1	
*Good = 2	
*Excellent = 3

Doing this, allows you to carry out some simple statistics, such as finding the average response for the whole group of learners and to compare the overall response of different groups.

==== Feedback statistics ====

Perhaps it’s easier to see this in an example. Imagine you have a group of 10 learners. Their answers to the questions on the feedback form are:

*Poor – 0 responses
*Acceptable – 3 responses
*Good – 6 responses
*Excellent – 1 response

This converts to a total of 18  (0x0 + 3x1 + 6x2 + 1x3). Dividing 18 by the number of learners (10) gives an '''overall score''' of 1.8 for the group as a whole, equating to Good.

Another way of looking at this data is to produce a '''graph'''.

[[image:feedbackstats.png]] 

You can then make a '''visual comparison''' of the results for each question.

==== Unstructured feedback ====

Of course you should allow the learners to provide some feedback on the form which is not structured by your questions.  It is important to leave space for them to make '''comments''', either throughout the form at appropriate questions or at the end under ‘any other comments’.  

To analyse these, you should simply list the actual responses and note any duplicated points of view.

There are a couple of other points to note apart from question design if you are to motivate your learners to make a good job of completing the form

Before proceeding, note down anything else that you can think of that should be in the '''feedback form design''' if it is to be successful in its purpose.

==== Essential elements of feedback form design ====

Well, for the form to be successful, the '''instructions must be easily understood''' and it should be '''easy to fill in'''.  It should also be '''quick''' for the learner to complete.  This all suggests a '''short questionnaire''', one or two sides maximum with a limited number of questions having straightforward possible responses

==== Simple feedback form ====

You can find many examples of simple course feedback forms on the internet

==== Commercial software and websites ====

You may also like to explore using commercial software such as '''SurveyMonkey''' which facilitates design of survey forms and collation and analysis of results via the Internet.  
See it at http://www.surveymonkey.com 

There are many Internet websites offering advice on feedback form and questionnaire design.  One problem is that many of them are aimed at professional researchers and thus too detailed.  However, you may still benefit from looking at some of these sites, as the basic principles of questionnaire design are the same, regardless of the subject area being researched. Here are some suggested sites.
*http://www.sysurvey.com/tips/wording.htm

=== Assessing success of learning approaches ===

The diagram shows the training cycle.  It represents a continuous process of:

*	Identification of training needs
*	Design of the training and learning programme
*	Delivery of training and learning programme
*	Evaluation of training and learning programme

For more information on the training cycle see:

http://mournetrainingservices.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/training-cycle-explained.html

You have carried out the first three stages and are now about to carry out the fourth with the help of the feedback on the learning experience coupled with evidence on learner progress.  
In particular, the feedback will be used to assess the effectiveness of the design and delivery of the programme. This will feed into '''revision''' of those aspects of the learning programme which were judged to be less than satisfactory.  With a further check on the identification of the needs and the re-design of materials and delivery, a cycle of continuous improvement is established.

You have essentially two sources of information for your evaluation:

*	the '''evidence''' of learner progress
*	the '''feedback''' on the quality of the learning experience.

Both are important and there are definite connections between the two. For instance, there could be a general reduction in learner progress not related to content and delivery issues but due to the learning taking place in a room which is always too hot resulting in the learners experiencing discomfort.

 

==== Learner progress ====

In analysing the learner progress, in order to create improvements, you must look for '''trends'''. The first time you deliver the training to a small group, poor performance from one learner may affect your results disproportionately.  Over time and a large number of learners, this random effect diminishes.  So you are looking for the particular topics and outcomes where a significant number of learners have difficulty.  

Of course ‘a significant number’ is a matter of opinion.  But let us say that, if out of a group of fifteen learners, three had a difficulty with one topic, while excelling at all the other topics, then we would say that is significant.  So you need to look for these parts of the learning and revisit the design of those parts.

 

==== Learning experience ====

Most of the feedback will have been converted into a set of averaged numerical data representing the learner group as a whole.  You now have to '''interpret''' this data.  Broadly speaking, you are having no real problems if the scores hit a point somewhere a bit above the middle value.  You cannot expect every learner to think that everything is perfect.  On the other hand, remember that most people tend not to give low scores unless there is a real problem.  Of course different learners will have different '''expectations'''.  However, again the hope is that they will apply the same expectation level to each of the facets of the learning experience and this variable will average out over all the questions and learners.

There is one danger in using the '''average''' and getting a middling score.  That is, if out of a group of, say, twenty learners, ten score highest and the other ten score lowest.  This gives the appearance of a just acceptable result with no great worry. A score of 50% for the learning environment could be due to one side of a room being too cold. A score of 50% for relevance of course content could be due to a group of 20 where 10 thought the training was pitched at the ideal level and 10 who found most of the content already familiar. 

So remember, you have to look at both the '''average score''' and the '''spread of scores''' across the group of learners.

 

==== Looking for trends ====

Regarding ‘Any other comments’, you are again looking for '''trends'''.  If the same type of comments comes up three or four times out of a group of fifteen learners, then you need to address it.

When you are delivering training to colleagues within your own organisation, remember that you need not be completely reliant on written feedback forms. Most of the learners will be willing to provide '''informal feedback''' and suggestions for improvement orally. 

You should also consider when to gather feedback. It is useful to gather opinions immediately after the conclusion of the training, when the content and delivery are fresh in the learners’ minds. This can be supplemented by '''further feedback''' at a later date, if you wish to explore how useful the training has been to the learners in their workplace situation.

Blanking pages, while it does get our attention, it makes it difficult to determine the reasons why you wanted this content removed.  Because this is also done sometimes to vandalize pages, we (the cleanup crew here on Wikibooks) recommend that you use the editing markup &quot;tag&quot; for deletion like this:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|(state your reason here)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

This can be added at anyplace in the text of the page, and don't bother removing any content, even if it may seem offensive.  This just gives a chance for a second opinion on the page to determine if it really needs removal.  Most reasonable requests for deletion generally do happen.

BTW, thank you so much for contributing to Wikibooks, and I hope that you do continue with the development of the [[Acoustics]] Wikibook that you have started.  It looks like an interesting topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:40, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

Western Music History can be traced back to Medieval times, with the Introduction of Chanting (later termed Gregorian Chanting) into the Catholic church services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation and more focus on secular themes that occurred in the Renaissance period. We then have expansions of range and complexity as we move into the Baroque era. The Classical era gives us the emotional power associated with such composers as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Romanticism then transforms the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more individualistic stylizations.  Tonality was at its peak during this period, then Impressionist music paved the way to the use of extreme dissonances in the music of the Modern era.  This process continued into the current Contemporary period of music.

== A Note Time Periods ==
There is no clear line when the Renaissance began and the Middle Ages ended. For western art music, there is no clear dividing point - the Renaissance in music happened at different times in different places. So for convenience, we will use 1400 A.D. as the start of the Renaissance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows; notable among them were:
*The Aeoline, by German Bernhard Eschenbach (and his cousin, Caspar Schlimbach), 1810.
**Was a piano with added aeoline register.
**Aeoline Harmonika and Pysharmonika are very similar names at that time.
*** Aeoline and Aura ware first without bellows or keyboard. This originals eventually evolved in Harmonica
*The Hand Physhamonika Anton Haeckel 1818 Hand type mentioned in music newspaper 1821.
*The flutina, by Pichenot Jeune, ca. 1831
*The concertina, patented in two forms (perhaps independently):
**Carl Friedrich Uhlig, 1834.
**Sir Charles Wheatstone, examples built after 1829, but not patented until 1844

An instrument called '''accordion''' was first patented in 1829 by Cyrill Demian in Vienna.  (Interestingly, the original patent shows the name &quot;eoline&quot; crossed out and replaced with &quot;accordion&quot; in different handwriting).  Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments: It only had a left hand keyboard; the right hand simply operated the bellows.  One key feature for which Damian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key.  His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key: one for each bellows direction (press, draw); this is called a ''bisonoric'' action. 

At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with &quot;Kanzellen&quot; (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The diatonic key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough to for travellers to take with them and use to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both bass and treble sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.

The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 &quot;Schule für Accordion&quot;.
At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's flutina resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and tone colour, but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally.  The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left.  When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today. 

Further innovations followed and continue to the present: Various keyboard systems have been developed; voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves) have been developed, with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance; different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability, and so on.

''This module currently draws heavily on text from the Wikipedia [[w:Accordion|Accordion]] article.''

[[File:Accordion.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|A piano accordion]]
The '''piano accordion''' is the instrument most often indicated by the term &quot;accordion&quot;, but it is one of the most recent inventions among accordion types, appearing late in the 19th century and not accepted worldwide until the early 20th century.  It has a right-hand keyboard similar to a piano. This is great news for you if you ever took piano lessons!

The left hand keyboard is usually configured in the Stradella system, a combination of chords and single notes, arranged in a uniform series by harmonic relationship.  This is the system we'll be focusing on throughout this book. 

Occasionally, a ''free bass'' left hand is used, which has a series of single buttons in an arrangement similar to the chromatic button accordion.  The free bass system facilitates the playing of bass melodies and counterpoint over a melodic span greater than one octave.  It also allows for chord inversion and invention of chords not present in the Stradella system, although the Stradella system also allows creation of extra chords and inversions using simultaneous multiple chord buttons. 

''Converter'' bass systems allow an instrument to be readily converted from a Stradella system to a free-bass system with a switch.

== DXFortran ==

The DXFortran project has for purpose the development of a vectorial graphical library in DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) format for FORTRAN90 programmers. It's a freeware distribution. 

URL:http://www.ualg.pt/est/adec/csc/dxfortran

=== Introduction ===

''' The Purpose '''

The DXFortran project has for purpose the development of a vectorial graphical library in DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) format for FORTRAN90 programmers. It's a freeware distribution.

The intention of the creation of this graphical library is to allow to the programmers in FORTRAN90 to generate automatically graphical in vectorial format, without the necessity to know the DXF structure .

The reason of the development of this tool is related with the DXF great portability and to be able to support the development of graphical tools, where CAD systems handling is necessary.

''' The structure '''

The DXFortran will be constituted by a standard library (DXFortranStd), this library has all the basic commands in format DXF such as:

* dfLine() - LINE
* dfPline() - POLYLINE
* dfText() - TEXT
* etc...

The library will support the following properties:

* Layer;
* 3D;
* color;
* line type;
* etc...

From the DXFortran Standard will be constructed thematic librarys, for example:

* DXFortran Math - library of graphical functions for mathematical applications.
* DXFortran Engineering - library of graphical functions for engineering applications.
* etc...

''' The developmet '''

The DXFortran Standart Library will be developed by the project team (Davide Santos and Carlos Silva).

The team will continue to contribute with thematic functions and to manage the relative code of the contributions to the project.

For the users who want to contribute also a set of rules of code writing will be available in the project page , elaborated in accordance with the European normalization for the FORTRAN90 writing.

In each function (routine), it will be indicated in the header, the name and origin (work place and Country) of the authors.

''' The use of the library '''

The library will be available under source code.

Each user will have to include the module of the DXFortranStd and the module of the desired function, in the code of its program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:class}} is a Java keyword
which begins the declaration and definition of a [[Java Programming/Classes and Objects|class]].

The general syntax of a class declaration, using {{Java:EBNF}}, is

 class-declaration ::= &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Java:access-modifiers}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{Java:class}} {{Java:identifier}}
                       [''extends-clause''] [''implements-clause''] 
                       ''class-body''
 
 extends-clause ::= {{Java:extends}} ''class-name''
 implements-clause ::= {{Java:implements}} ''interface-names'' 
 interface-names ::= ''interface-name'' [&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; ''interface-names'']
 class-body ::= '''&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;''' [''member-declarations''] '''&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;'''
 member-declarations = ''member-declaration'' [''member-declarations'']
 member-declaration = ''field-declaration'' 
                      | ''initializer'' 
                      | ''constructor'' 
                      | ''method-declaration''
                      | ''class-declaration''

The {{java:extends}} word is optional. If omitted, the class extends the {{java:Object}} class, as all Java classes inherit from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Medieval period dates approximately from 476 A.D. to 1400 A.D.

During this time European society was rigidly divided into three social classes: the nobility, consisting of kings, queens, barons, princes and lords; serfs and peasants; and thirdly, the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. All segments of society felt the power of the Roman Catholic Church because Christianity had risen in western Europe to fill the power vacumn left by the demise of the Roman empire around the fourth century. Rome still exerted a powerful influence over western Europe especially after the Roman Emperor, Constantine, converted to Christianity. Rome at the beginning of the Medieval period was still a distributive base of regional information and a central hub of European learning. It was also the cumulative center of Christian liturgical musical life. Many musicians were priests or members (predominantly of minor orders) of the clergy, and as such liturgical singing played an important role in worship. It is thought that the church discouraged the use of musical instruments although we can infer from period paintings and literary descriptions that instruments were played. It is thought that instruments were used when good singers were not available. The instruments would then either replace the vocal part or help the voice stay in tune. The church discouraged instruments because it was the desire of the church leaders to keep the congregation's focus on the words that were being sung. Anything that would detract from that was considered at odds with the holy purpose of the music.

== Gregorian Chant (plainchant) ==

[[File:Francisco de Zurbarán 040.jpg|thumb|right|Pope Gregory by Francisco de Zurbarán - painted 1626-1627. Though there are no contempoary images existing, the life of Gregory has inspired generations of artists to put brush to canvas.]]

For over 1000 years, the official music of the Roman Catholic Church was the Gregorian Chant, which was named after Pope Gregory I. He began the task of organizing and codifying the chants in the 6th century used by the church.  By the era of Charlemagne in the early 9th century, Gregorian Chant was a mostly unified body of music throughout western Europe.

With Gregorian Chant, there is no definite sense of rhythm, the timing is very flexible and there is no sense of beat. This creates a floating, improvisational quality to the music. The chant essentially consists of a Melody, set to a sacred Latin text, sung unaccompanied which moves by stepwise motion within a narrow range of pitches. It  may be either Syllabic - one note for each syllable - or Melismatic - many notes to one syllable. The composers of the chants were anonymous, and the chants were based on church modes (Ionian, Dorian etc...).

== Development of Polyphony ==

Polyphony was developed during the period of 700 A.D. to 900 A.D. where the chant melody was duplicated at an interval of a 4th or a 5th. The voices moved in parallel motion with the actual chant being sung by the bottom voice. Medieval music consisting of Gregorian chant and one or more melodic lines moving in parallel motion is called Organum. 
		 
From 900 A.D. to 1200 A.D Organum became truly polyphonic, with the melodic lines becoming independent and each line had its own rhythm and own melody. Generally, the chant in the bottom voice was sung in very long, drawnout notes, while the added melody on top moved in shorter note values. Early polyphony was still quite rhythmically free.	 
		 
Then during the period of 1170 A.D. to 1200 A.D. the Notre Dame School of Composers developed rhythmic innovations. The leading composers at the school were Leonin and Perotin, who used measured rhythm with definite time values and a clearly defined meter. The newly developed notation indicated precise rhythms and pitches. However, the beat could only be subdivided into threes, which was symbolic of the Trinity. Few triads were used, resulting in Medieval polyphony sounding very hollow, thin and stark to the modern ear. The interval of a 3rd was hardly ever used as it was considered to sound dissonant...

== Secular Music ==

The first large body of decipherable, secular songs that have survived, comes from the 12th and 13th centuries. It was written by French noblemen Troubadours (coming from Southern France) and the Trauvéres (coming from Northern France). Most of the songs deal with the subject of love. There were also dance and spinning songs (spinning songs come from when the maidens would spin cloth and sing songs to pass the time). Their songs were played mainly by court minstrels. Many of the songs have been preserved because the nobility had clerics to write down the songs.

Secular songs also appear in Italy, Spain, England and Germany. They use a regular beat, unlike the Gregorian Chant. Instruments used included : Harps; Fiddles, Recorders; Lutes; Flutes; Shawms; and Bagpipes.

== Ars Nova (new art) ==

''Ars Nova'' began in the 14th century as a result of a conscious effort to write music in a new style. An essay entitled “Ars Nova”, by Phillipe de Vitry (a musical theorist), was published describing the new characteristics of style in music.

A significant development in rhythm which occurred during this period was that the beat could now be subdivided into two equal parts. Syncopation was introduced and polyphonic compositions became increasingly complex and sophisticated. One important form of music was the Mass, consisting of the PROPER and the ORDINARY. Composers set the ordinary to music which contained five sung prayers : Kyrie; Gloria; Credo; Sanctus; Agnus Dei.

== Hildegard von Bingen (1098 - 1179) ==

Hildegard was a female German composer, born the last of ten children.  She was given to the church as a tithe, as it was custom to give the Roman Catholic Church one tenth of a family's possessions.  She became known for having diverse occupations, such as composer, musician, playwright, and poet, among others.  She was a master of the Gregorian chant, a craft that began as early as the 5th century.

== Leoninus (died c. 1201) ==
Leonin, a French composer, was the first-known significant one to write in polyphonic organum.  He most likely worked at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and heralded the Notre Dame school of polyphony.  His widely known moniker is the French form of his Latin name, Leoninus. He wrote a book called Magnus liber organi, which was a great book of religious music. Later it was revised by Perotinus.

== Perotin (fl. c. 1200) ==
Perotin is arguably the most well-known figure in the Notre Dame school of polyphony.  Like Leonin, he is assumed to be French, and the name Perotin is derived from his Latin name, Perotinus.  He is often paired with Leonin as they both pioneered choral polyphony.  He expanded on the developments of Leonin, and helped create three and four-part polyphony. ''Viderunt omnes'' is an example of a Gregorian chant, written centuries before, in which Perotin inserted an organum.

== Guillaume de Machaut (1300 - 1377) ==

Guillaume de Machaut was arguably one of the most important composers of Medieval Music. He was a poet and musician born in France who wrote in the ''Ars Nova'' style. He mainly composed secular music and worked for various royal families. He travelled extensively and his output consisted mainly of love songs for two voices and instrumental accompaniment. He is most famous for his ‘Missa Notra Dame’ (Notre Dame Mass), which is one of the finest compositions of the 14th century. It was the first polyphonic setting of the Mass Ordinary and was written for four voices – possibly doubled by instruments. 

'''Agnus Dei movement'''
Arranged for four voices – one soprano, two altos and one tenor. It made use of triple meter – symbol of the Trinity - and consisted of complex rhythms and syncopation. The two upper parts are rhythmically active while the two lower parts move in longer note values and play a supportive role. The movement includes dissonances and triads which sounds fuller than previous Organum.

== Francesco Landini (c. 1325 - 1397) ==
The Italian Landini, like Hildegard, fits the characteristics of a Renaissance man.  He was a composer, singer, organist, instrument maker, and poet.  He was a master of the trecento.  Though considered a Medieval composer by most musicologists, his music paved the way for the musical quattrocento and the early Renaissance, both of which began around 1400.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Renaissance Period spans from circa 1400 A.D. to 1600 A.D. The word 'Renaissance' is of French origin and means &quot;a rebirth of interests&quot;, especially in the arts of ancient Greece and Rome (i.e. : antiquity). This renewed interests stems from the fact that a large amount of art work from antiquity was discovered during the Renaissance period. The Renaissance was predominantly a period of exploration, for example, the voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama occurred during this period.

The Renaissance was also an age of individualism and curiosity, the predominate example is seen in the life of Leonardo da Vinci. Education in the Renaissance was encyclopedic in nature. The people of the time believed in educating themselves in a vast number of fields, from art to science to history to architecture.

The Catholic Church was less powerful than it was in the Middle Ages, and no longer had the monopoly on learning.

The ‘Reformation’ movement challenged the corrupt practices of the Catholic Church, and was inaugurated by people such as John Calvin and Martin Luther. The Catholic Church answered with the ‘Counter-Reformation’ from 1562 A.D. to 1563 A.D.  A committee of Cardinals met over a period of 20 years to discuss corruption that has crept in to the church (e.g., Secular songs during church services). This committee of Cardinals was started by the Council of Trent. They complained about the complex polyphony prevalent in sacred music as it made the text too hard to hear over the overlapping voices.  There were also complaints about the secular elements in sacred music as some masses were based upon popular melodies of the time.

Aristocrats and upper middle class considered education a status symbol and hired scholars to teach their children.

== Music in the Renaissance Era ==

Around 1450 A.D. the printing press was invented. This widened the circulation of music. This helped music to play an increasingly important role in daily life. Musicians worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. However, musical activity shifted to the courts. Kings and princes competed for the finest composers.

Many leading important composers came from Holland, Belgium and Northern France, called the ‘Franco-Flemish’ composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical lives include Germany, England and Spain.

== Characteristics of Renaissance Music ==

'''WORDS and MUSIC'''

Renaissance vocal music was more important than instrumental music. Nevertheless, many songs were accompanied by instruments. These instruments were commonly members of the lute, organ, recorder, or viol families.

There was a close relationship between the words and the music. Composers wanted to enhance the meaning and emotion of the text, and did so by means of ‘word painting’ - trying to project poetic imagery through link between music and words. As vocal music was more important, most music was sung ''a cappella''.

'''TEXTURE'''

Two basic textures existed. Firstly HOMOPHONIC, where parts move in step with one another (like a hymn) – rhythms are the same. Secondly POLYPHONIC, where each voice is of equal importance and contrapuntal imitation was an important procedure. The bass register was now used for the first time, producing richer harmonies, and extending the range of the voices. There was a change from successive to simultaneous writing in music. That is, from linear, voice-by-voice to ‘cyclical’, considering all voices at once whilst writing.

NOTE : contrapuntal imitation 	
* adjective of counterpoint.
* the ability to say two things at once comprehensibly. In essence, counterpoint is the same as polyphony.

'''Rhythm and Melody'''

In Renaissance music, there is a gentle flow, moving away from sharply defined beats. Melodies are easy to sing as they move along a scale with few leaps. This is called conjunct motion. However, Melodies were still modal.

'''The &quot;Contenance Angloise&quot;'''

Humanists thought that consonance and dissonance should be determined by the human ear, not by mathematics as many older thinkers, such as Pythagoras, believed. In the middle ages, intervals of seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths were thought to be dissonant, as per mathematics. Fourths, fifths, and octaves were considered consonant. With humanism gaining influence during the Renaissance, musicians began using their intuition to determine consonance and dissonance. Fourths became considered dissonant, while thirds and sixths became considered consonant. Composers of the Renaissance began exhibiting this new classification of intervals in their works. This new style was first popular with English composers, particularly John Dunstable.  From there it moved to continental Europe. The French poet Martin le Franc dubbed this new style the &quot;Contenance Angloise&quot; meaning &quot;English Guise.&quot;

== Sacred Music ==

Two main forms of sacred music existed. Firstly, the motet; a short, polyphonic, choral work set to a sacred Latin text. The motet was performed as a short religious ritual such as the communion. Secondly the Mass; a longer work, comprised of all five movements of the Ordinary.

== The Early Renaissance ==

===Italy===
The musical Renaissance began in northern Italy around 1400.  One of the prominent groups that was very influential in shaping the early Renaissance was the Florentine School in Florence, Italy.  The quattrocento, which might have begun slightly earlier than 1400, overlaps the late Medieval and early Renaissance periods.  Nevertheless, it is generally considered to be part of the early Renaissance.  Notable composers include the following:
*Zacara da Teramo (c. 1350-c. 1413)
*Paolo da Firenze (c. 1355-c. 1436)
*Giovanni Mazzuoli (1360-1426)
*Bartolomeo da Bologna (fl. 1405-1427)
*Antonio da Cividale (fl. 1392-1421)
*Antonius Romanus (fl. 1400-1432)
*Cristoforo de Monte (1383-?)
*Nicolaus Zacharie (c. 1400 – 1466)
*Johannes de Quadris (c. 1410 – c. 1457)
*Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro (c. 1420 – 1484).

===John Dunstable (c. 1390 - 1453)===
Dunstable was an English composer, renowned during his lifetime and influential throughout Europe.  A comtemporary of Leonel Power (an English composer probably born slightly before Dunstable), his music bridges the late Medieval and early Renaissance styles.  He also helped develop the style of the early Renaissance Burgundian School.

===Guillaume Dufay (1397 - 1474)===
Dufay was a Franco-Flemish composer and the central figure of the Burgundian School.  He was ordained a priest but composed both sacred and secular music.  He learned his craft from cathedral authorities, and he spent a chunk of his life in Italy, where he stayed intermittently and met the composers Hugo and Arnold de Lantins.  One of his most famous compositions is the motet ''Nuper rosarum flores'' (1436), which incorporates both the old isorhythmic style and the new contrapuntal style.

===Gilles Binchois (1400 - 1460)===
Binchois was another Franco-Flemish composer who was influential in the Burgundian School.  He is often compared to Dufay, and there is even a contemporary portrait of them together.  Like Dufay, he is one of the earliest members of the Burgundian School.  Although often ranked behind Dufay and Dunstable by musicologists and other scholars, Binchois is debated by others as being more influential than the other two.  His melodies are easy to be sung and are familiar to those interested in early Renaissance music.

== Josquin Desprez (1450 - 1521) ==

Josquin was an important composer of Renaissance music. He was a contemporary of Christopher Columbus and Leonardo Da Vinci, and considered a master of Renaissance music. He had an international career, being born in Belgium and spending most of his life in Italy, serving Dukes and Popes. Later he worked for King Louis XII of France.

His output includes masses, motets and secular vocal pieces, and he strongly influenced other composers. He has many published volumes of music devoted exclusively to him. This was testimony to his skills as a composer as only a select few were chosen to have their works published.

== Ave Maria (by Josquin Desprez) ==

This piece was a Latin prayer to the Virgin Mary, written as a four voiced motet. It opens with strict, contrapuntal / polyphonic imitation. It is an example of true polyphonic writing, as each phrase has a different melody. There is overlapping, which creates a continuous flow. However this makes it difficult to understand text, but creates continuity in the music. There is varied texture, as he uses imitation for three and four voices, then paired imitation for two voices. This variation of texture was introduced by Josquin. Two voices sing together, then they are imitated by another two voices. In bar 31 of this piece we see a move to homophony, where the voices are singing in step with one another.  There is then a change in meter from duple to triple, with the use of third’s.

== Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525 – 1594) ==

Palestrina was a very prolific composer of the Late Renaissance period who was born in the town of Palestrina, near Rome. Though he also wrote secular madrigals, he is most famous for his masses and sacred motets. His works are known for their beauty and the relative ease for a listener to understand the texts compared to those in other polyphonic works.

== Missa: “Papae Marcelli” (by Palestrina) ==

Palestrina's most famous work was Missa Papae Marcelli, which he dedicated to Pope Marcellus II. Palestrina was concerned with a clear projection of the text, as the church was becoming concerned about the infiltration of complex polyphony, which was obscuring the text. It was written for Soprano, Alto, two Tenors, and two Basses, which makes it sounds fuller due to the six voices. For many years their was a legend that this mass was so beautiful that it convinced the Council of Trent not to ban polyphonic music from the church altogether. This story, however, is not true.
Palestrina was born just outside of Rome. He was devoted to Catholic Church music, with his career based in Rome. He spent most of his life as director of three of the most celebrated Roman Catholic churches: St. Peter’s; St. John Lateran; and Santa Maria Maggiore. His output consisted of 104 masses, and over 450 sacred works. He was influenced greatly by the Counter-Reformation and the Council of Trent.

== Secular Music ==

During Renaissance, secular vocal music became increasingly popular. Music was set to poems in various languages, including Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Dutch and English. The invention of the printing press helped to spread popular music. Thousands of song collections became available. This led to a rise in more national genres. These included the Parisian Chanson, the Italian Frottola, the Italian Madrigal, the English Madrigal, and the English Lute Song.

Music became important for leisure purposes, with every educated person being expected to play an instrument. Music was generally written for solo voices with instrumental accompaniment. However, with the rise of printing, instrumental music was becoming more important, with wide variety of instruments being used. These included recorders, viols, keyboard instruments and woodwinds.

== The Venetian School ==

As the name suggests, this school of music was based in Venice. It was the center of instrumental and vocal music. It was also a thriving commercial center, responsible for much trade between Venice and the East. The Venetian School operated out of St. Marks’  Cathedral, with Willaert and Gabrielli as its music directors. Willaert and Gabrielli directed the orchestra and choir for the church. Venetian composers wrote polychoral music (for many choirs), with the choir always accompanied by instruments. Their music tended to be more homophonic in texture.

== William Byrd (c. 1540 - 1623) ==
Byrd is one of the most famous English composers of the Renaissance.  Although he never made the transition to the new Baroque style, his keyboard music is said to have marked the beginning of the Baroque organ and harpsichord style.  Little is known about his early life.  However, he is known to have composed many masses, motets, psalmes, sonnets, and songs, in addition to his keyboard works.  Contemporary English composers include Thomas Tallis, John Bull, John Dowland, Thomas Weelkes, and Orlando Gibbons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the second lesson teaching you how to read, write and pronounce Greek. In the last lesson, you have already learned the letters alpha, iota, kappa, omicron, tau and rho. Now, we will slowly build on those, so that you can read more words. At the end of this lesson you will find the translations of the words. First try to find out the meanings on your own!

The next letter you should learn is Nu (this letter is pronounced ni in Greek):

&lt;font size=4&gt;Ν ν&lt;/font&gt;

Again the capital letter looks the same as in the Latin alphabet. The small letter looks similar to a lowercase V. It's still pronounced like a regular N (IPA [n]) though. It also appears in the following names that you should be able to read now:

'''ΝΑΤΟ''' (very difficult ;-) ) &lt;br&gt;
'''Άννα''' (a girl's name) &lt;br&gt;
'''Ιράν''' (a country in the Middle East) &lt;br&gt;
'''Κίνα''' (a country in the Far East) &lt;br&gt;
'''Τίρανα''' (capital city of Albania) &lt;br&gt;
'''Ανόι''' (capital city of Vietnam) &lt;br&gt;


Next letter is Mu:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Μ μ&lt;/font&gt;

While the capital letter is identical again, the lower letter is decidedly different from the Latin one this time. It's very commonly used as a special symbol in various academic fields though. The pronunciation is just like a regular M (IPA [m]). Here are words with Mu:

'''μαμά''' (every child's call) &lt;br&gt;
'''Μαρόκο''' (African country south of Spain) &lt;br&gt;
'''Ομάν''' (Arabic country) &lt;br&gt;
'''Αμμάν''' (capital of Jordan) &lt;br&gt;
'''Μαρκ''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Μαρία''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Μόνικα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''αρμονία''' &lt;br&gt;
'''άτομο''' &lt;br&gt;
'''μονοτονία''' &lt;br&gt;


I'd also like you to meet the letter Epsilon:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Ε ε&lt;/font&gt;

Capital letter as in the Latin alphabet, small letter a variation on the capital letter. You have probably seen it before. Epsilon is pronounced approximately as in b'''e'''t (IPA [ε]). German &quot;B'''e'''tt&quot; and French &quot;m'''è'''re&quot; are exactly the same as this Greek sound. Practise reading some more words:

'''Αρμενία''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Κορέα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Κάρμεν''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Κατερίνα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''κέικ''' &lt;br&gt;
'''κρέμα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''κάμερα''' &lt;br&gt;


Finally, here's the letter Lambda:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Λ λ&lt;/font&gt;

This is the equivalent of the letter L. It looks quite different, but you will probably be able to memorise it quickly anyway (anyone familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet will immediately notice its similarity with the letter Л). Be careful not to confuse a capital alpha with a capital lambda! Here are a few more words to practise, and of course this letter and all the others will frequently appear in the following lessons, too.

'''αλκοόλ''' &lt;br/&gt;
'''κιλό''' &lt;br/&gt;
'''Ιταλία''' &lt;br/&gt;
'''καραμέλα''' &lt;br/&gt;


That's it for this lesson! If you didn't have trouble reading the example words, you're ready to continue with [[../Lesson 3x|lesson 3]]!

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Many parts of this page are &lt;strike&gt;based highly upon&lt;/strike&gt; taken from Sean McLaughlin's ''Learn Assembly in 28 Days'', Day 3.



=Number Systems=
Necessary reading, this. Computers don't count the same way you and I do.

==Decimal==
All number systems use a particular radix. Radix is synonymous with &quot;base&quot; if it helps, although I should caution you that saying such things as &quot;All you radix are belong to us&quot; is a great way to get people to throw pointy things at you (but whether it's because of the horrid pun or the tired pop-culture reference is hard to say... :-). To understand what a radix is, consider our everyday system of numbers, which uses base ten.

Like you learned in grade school and forgot over summer, in a base ten number, each digit specifies a certain power of 10, and as a consequence you need ten different digits to denote any number. The rightmost digit specifies 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the second digit specifies 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the third 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and so on.
You can, therefore, break down a decimal number, such as 2763&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, like this (although it does wind up to be redundant):

 2763&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;  = (2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
         = (2 x 1000) + (7 x 100) + (6 x 10) + (3 x 1)
         = 2000 + 700 + 60 + 3
         = 2763&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

Computers enjoy working with two other bases: binary and hexadecimal. Octal is base-8, and seems to have died out. The only operating system to use octal was UNIX.

==Binary==
Binary is a base-2 system, so it uses only two digits (0 and 1), and each digit represents a power of 2:

 10110101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0 x 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0 x 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0 x 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
            = (1 x 128) + (0 x 64) + (1 x 32) + (1 x 16) + (0 x 8) + (1 x 4) + (0 x 2) + (1 x 1)
            = 128 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 1
            = 181&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

A single binary digit is familiarly called a bit. Eight bits are called a byte. Other combinations you could hear about:
Name 	Size
nibble 	4 bits
word 	16 bits
dword
	32 bits
quadword 	64 bits
Since the Z80 can directly manipulate only bytes and words (and nibbles in some circumstances), the majority of data handling you do will involve mostly those, so you don't have to concern yourself with the others too much (although it would still be a good idea to familiarize yourself with them).

We will find ourselves working with, or at the very least referencing the individual bits of a byte or word. The nomenclature:

* If we arranged the bits out horizontally, we call the rightmost bit &quot;bit 0&quot;, and each bit to the left is given a number one greater.
* The leftmost and rightmost bits are given special names: the leftmost bit is called the high-order bit or the most-significant bit (since it controls the highest power of two of the number, it makes the most significant contribution to the value). The rightmost bit is called the low-order bit or the least-significant bit.
* We can apply these points to nibbles in a byte, bytes in a word or dword, etc. So for example the rightmost byte in a 64-bit quantity would be termed the least-significant byte.

==Hexadecimal==
Hexadecimal is base-16, so it uses 16 digits: the regular digits 0 to 9, and the letters A to F that correspond to the decimal values 10 to 15.

 1A2F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;  = (1 x 16&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (10 x 16&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (2 x 16&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (15 x 16&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
         = (1 x 4096) + (10 x 256) + (2 x 16) + (15 x 1)
         = 4096 + 2560 + 32 + 15
         = 6703&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

Hex values have an interesting relationship with binary: take the number 11010011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In hex, this value is represented as D3&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, but consider the individual digits:

D&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = 1101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

3&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = 0011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Compare these two binary numbers with the original. You should see that one hex digit is equivalent to one nibble. This is what's so great about hexadecimal, converting binary numbers used by the computer into more manageable hex values is a snap.

==Designating Base==
To designate base above, we have adopted the notation used by many mathematicians by writing the radix as a subscript. Too bad we must write assembly code in plain text format, which has no capability for such niceties. The way to denote radix varies, but in all cases it involves attaching an extra character or characters to the number. TASM gives you a choice between a symbolic prefix or an alphabetic suffix.
 Prefix Format  Suffix Format   Base
 %10011011      10011011b       Binary
 $31D0          31D0h           Hexadecimal
 @174           174o            Octal
 12305 *        12305d          Decimal
 * no prefix
It doesn't matter which format you use, provided you don't mix them (like $4F33h). The prefix formats may be easier to read, since the letter sort of gets lost among the numbers (especially if it's upper case).

=Registers=
Registers are sections of very expensive RAM inside the CPU that are used to store numbers and rapidly operate on them. There are fourteen registers on this CPU: A B C D E F H I L R PC SP IX and IY. You don't need to concern yourself about registers I, R, PC and SP yet.

The single-letter registers are 8 bits in size, so they can store any number from 0 to 255. Since this is oftentimes inadequate, they can be combined into four register pairs: AF BC DE HL. These, along with IX and IY, are 16-bit, and can store a number in the range 0 to 65535.

These registers are general purpose, to a point. What I mean by that is that you can usually use whichever register you want, but many times you are forced to, or it's just better to, use a specific one. For example, only the HL, IX and IY registers can be used for indirect memory addressing when loading into registers other than A, all 16-bit registers can be used to load to or from an indirectly addressed memory location when loading from or to (respectively) register A.

The special uses of the registers:

8-bit Registers:
* A is also called the &quot;accumulator&quot;. It is the primary register for arithmetic operations and accessing memory. Indeed, it's the only 8-bit register you can use. 
* B is commonly used as an 8-bit counter. 
* C is used when you want to interface with hardware ports.
* F is known as the flags. The bits of this register signify (that is to say they &quot;flag&quot;) whether certain events have occurred. For example, one of the flags (bits) reports if the accumulator is zero or not. The uses of the flags will be explained at a later day because we have no use for them at this point.
* I is the high byte of the interrupt vector when the processor is in Interrupt Mode 2 (IM 2), the low byte of the vector comes from the data bus and is functionally random. Note that this vector is used to load a value from RAM first, then that address is called. You can only load to and from it using A.
* R is the dynamic RAM refresh register, it increases after every instruction by an amount depending on the instruction. Its contents are pseudo random. You can only load to and from it using A.

The two bytes of all 16-bit registers can be used separately as well.

16-bit Registers:
* AF is only used in pushes and pops.
* HL has two purposes. One, it is like the 16-bit equivalent of the accumulator, i.e. it is used for 16-bit arithmetic. Two, it stores the '''h'''igh and '''l'''ow bytes of a memory address. 
* BC is used by instructions and code sections that operate on streams of bytes as a '''b'''yte '''c'''ounter. 
* DE holds the address of a memory location that is a '''de'''stination. 
* PC holds the address of the currently executing instruction, you can only change it's contents with jumps, calls and rets. The only way to load directly to it is 'jp (hl)' you could see this as a 'ld pc,hl'.
* SP is the Stack Pointer, it determines where in RAM values are Pushed and Poped, you can only load to it using HL, and you can only load from it using arithmetic like 'add hl,sp', if HL was zero before the addition it now holds the value of SP.
* IX and IY is a funky li'l registers called the  '''i'''ndex '''r'''egisters. Almost everywhere HL is acceptable, so too is IX and IY. Important to note that using IX and IY results in slower and more inflated code than HL would (approximately double the size and time) because they were not present on the 8080 (the processor the Z80 is based on), so use it only when necessary (usually when HL is tied up). IX and IY can do something special that no other register can though, we'll look at that in due time. 

To store to a register, you use the LD instruction.
 LD destination, source         Stores the value of source into destination.

&lt;center&gt;Valid arguments for LD&lt;/center&gt;

There are many more, but they involve registers you haven't heard of yet.

You obviously have no clue what difference parentheses make for an operand. You'll see shortly.
You can only to/from I and R using A.

Examples:
 LD A, 25       Stores 25 into register A
 LD D, B        Stores the value of register B into register D.
 LD ($8325), A  Stores the value of register A into address $8325 (explained later on).

Some points that should be made clear:

The two operands for LD cannot both be register pairs, excepting SP. You have to load the registers separately:

   ; Since we can't do LD DE, HL...
   LD    D, H
   LD    E, L
   ; But we can do this:
   LD SP,HL
   ; The following instruction effectively loads HL into PC
   JP (HL)

If you use LD with a number that is too big for the register to hold, you will get an error at assembly time. Storing negative numbers, however, is legal, but the number will get &quot;wrapped&quot; to fit. For example, if you assign -1 to A, it will really hold 255. If you assign -2330 to BC, it will really hold 63206. Adding one plus the maximum value the register will hold gives you the value that will be stored. There is a reason for this phenomenon that will be made clear shortly.

An instruction similar to LD but functionally different, is EX. Despite the fact that it is very particular about its operands, it is a very useful instruction. (90% of the time the registers you want to exchange are HL and DE).

 EX DE, HL      Swaps the value of DE with the value of HL.

If you want to swap and other register pair with HL (or an index register) without losing an other register you could do the following (although slow)

 PUSH BC
 EX (SP),HL
 POP BC

Registers F and AF cannot be used as operands for the LD instruction. Actually, these registers can not be operands for ''any'' instruction barring a few.

=Negative Numbers=
Up to this point there has been an implication that registers are only capable of assuming positive values, but in the real world negative numbers are just as common. Fortunately, there are ways to represent negative numbers. In assembly, we can attribute a number as either signed or unsigned. Unsigned means that the number can only take on positive values, signed means that the number can be either positive or negative. It is this concept of signed numbers we need to look at.

It turns out that there are many signed numbering schemes, but the only one we're interested in is called the two's complement. When we have a signed value in two's complement, the most significant bit of the number is termed the sign bit and its state determines the sign of the number. The existence of the sign bit naturally imposes a restriction on the number of bits a number may be composed of. With this, the amount of bits at our disposal to represent the number is reduced by one; for a string of eight bits, we can have a numeric range of -128 to +127. For a string of sixteen, it's -32, 768 to 32, 767, etc.

As to what bearing the state of the sign bit has on the value, it is this: if the sign bit is clear, the value is a positive quantity and is stored normally, as if it were an unsigned number. If the sign bit is set, the value is negative and is stored in two's complement format. To convert a postive number to its negative counterpart, you have two methods, either of which you can choose based on convenience.

# Calculate zero minus the number (like negative numbers in the Real World). If you're confused how to do this, you can consider 0 and 256 (or 65536 if appropriate) to be the same number. Therefore, -6 would be 256 - 6 or 250: %11111010.
# Flip the state of every bit, and add one. Therefore, -6 would be %11111001 + 1 or %11111010. 

There is one special case of two's complement where negation fails, and that is when you try to negate the smallest negative value:

      %10000000        -128
      %01111111        Invert all bits
      %10000000        Add one (=-128)

Of course -(-128) isn't -128, but the value +128 cannot be represented in two's complement with just eight bits, so the smallest negative value can never be negated.

There is an instruction to automate two's complement:
NEG 	Calculates the two's complement of the accumulator.
I'm sure you find the theory wonderfully engrossing, but what you're probably interested in is how the CPU handles the difference between unsigned and signed numbers. The answer is, it doesn't. You see, the beauty of two's complement is that if we add or subtract two numbers, the result will be valid for both signed and unsigned values:

                     unsigned        signed
        %00110010           5             5
      + %11001110       + 206          + -5
      %1 00000000         256             0   (Disqualify ninth bit)

This phenomenon was not lost on the makers of the Z80. You could use the same hardware for adding signed numbers as unsigned numbers only with two's complement, and less hardware means a cheaper chip (true, nowadays you can get a fistful of Z80s for fifty cents, but back in 1975 it was a big deal, just look at the 6502).

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

The Baroque Period spans from 1600 to 1750. During this time there were increases in commercial activity, leading to an increase of power in the middle class, which ultimately lead to the Industrial Revolution. 

Opera was now emerging for the first time, with many opera houses being built. The two 'giants' of the Baroque era were Bach and Handel.

Bach's death in 1750 marked the end of the Baroque period. Other main composers of this period were Monteverdi, Purcell, Vivaldi, Corelli, Telemann, and Rameau.

The Baroque era is sub-divided into Early Baroque, Middle Baroque and Late Baroque. The Early Baroque period was between about 1600 and 1660. During this period came the invention of opera – a drama sung to an orchestral accompaniment - and homophonic texture was favored. The Middle Baroque period dates from about 1660 to 1710. Here church modes give way to major and minor chords. Instrumental music becomes very important, and the fully fledged orchestra is now developed. The Late Baroque begins about 1710 and ends circa 1750. Polyphony once more flourishes, most notably of all in the works of Bach.

== Music in Society ==

Music was the main source of entertainment/diversion in the Baroque era. Aristocrats surrounded themselves with concert halls etc…. Music directors were employed by the aristocracy to oversee orchestras, choirs, instruments, music libraries etc… They were highly paid and prestigious positions in Baroque society. Music was a craft passed down over generations, a musician teaching the craft to his son, and he to his son. Commercial opera houses were about and flourishing.

= Musical Styles in the Baroque Era = 

== Mood ==

A Baroque piece expresses only one basic mood, and follows what is termed the ‘doctrine of affect’. Composers used musical language to depict particular affective states, specific rhythms and melodic patterns being associated with each.  Word-painting was especially used to associate what one was playing to certain texts of music, for example, &quot;Primavera&quot; (Spring) within Vivaldi's &quot;Four Seasons.&quot;  The sonata that precedes each movement describes what the music will be representing (i.e. violins emulating birds, thunderstorms, dogs, etc).

== Rhythm ==

Unity is achieved through rhythmic continuity. The same rhythmic patterns are repeated throughout a Baroque piece of music. Some might think that this repetition would become tedious, but this, however, has the opposite effect, propelling the music forward. The beat is emphasized very strongly, which is a huge leap from the rhythmically free nature of the Medieval Gregorian Chant.


== Melody ==

The Baroque melodies also create a feeling of continuity. The melody was also repeated in the same way as the rhythm. A gradual unraveling, unwinding and expansion of the melody was gradually created as the piece goes along. As a result, melodies of this era tend to lack the kind of symmetry and balance associated with Classical era melodies.

== Dynamics ==

Baroque music uses terraced dynamics. This means that the volume stays the same for a period of time, then there is  a sudden shift to a different dynamic level. There are no gradual changes in dynamics (such as a crescendo or decrescendo). Terraced dynamics were used as the main keyboard instrument was the harpsichord, which could only be played in two modes, either loud (forte) or soft (piano), precluding the ability to accomplish crescendos or decrescendos.

== Texture ==
Textures used in the Baroque period, especially in the early part (c. 1600-1660), were predominantly homophonic, or melody with basso continuo, typical of Baroque music.  In the late Baroque era, German composers such as Telemann, Bach, and Handel experimented with counterpoint and helped to create, in no small degree, Baroque polyphonic music.

== Harmony ==

Chords became increasingly important in the Baroque period. Before then, composers were concerned with the individual beauty of melodic lines, rather than with chords. Chords were previously a mere by-product of the motion of several simultaneously sounding melodic lines. In Baroque, chords become significant in themselves, due to the emphasis on the Bass Voice. The entire structure of the Baroque piece rested on the Bass Voice. This new emphasis on chords and the Bass part results in the most characteristic feature of all Baroque music – the Basso Continuo (alternatively translated as Thoroughbass or Figured Bass).

The Basso Continuo consists of a bass part together with numbers below each note which specify the chord to be played above it. It is played by at least two instruments, usually the organ or harpsichord (to produce the chords) reinforced by a cello or bassoon. The performer was given a great deal of freedom with regards the realization of the figured bass. The Basso Continuo was also used in the early classical period, particularly in some works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, who will be covered in the [[Western Music History/Classical Music|next chapter]].

== Words and Music ==

Word painting was still important, and composers emphasized words through their music.


== Orchestra ==

The orchestra was based on the string instruments, and usually consisted of 10 to 40 instruments. However, there was a very flexible arrangement of instruments. At its nucleus were the basso continuo and upper strings. The use of woodwinds, brass and percussion was variable.

Genres  

Compositions include sets of movements/pieces. A movement is considered an independent piece. The musical genres used during the Baroque era include: opera, oratorio, cantata, suite, sonata, mass, concerto and fugue.

= Important Figures =

=== Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) ===

==== Life ====

Bach came from a very long line of musicians. Each generation learned the musical craft from the previous generation. Bach had twenty children, although only nine survived; of those nine, four became composers. When he was 18 years old he became an organist. The church complained about his dense polyphony and questioned his strange meeting with a maiden in the church (which happened to be his cousin, who he then married). Then started working for the Duke of Weinstad and was promoted, but did not want the promotion, so he was put in jail for a month. He then moved to Cöthen, where he wrote the Brandenburg concertos. He then moved to Leipzig and became municipal director of all four churches. He sent his children to the local university to study. He was completely blind towards the end of his life, only to have regained his sight briefly before his death.

==== Music ====
Bach created masterpieces in every Baroque genre except opera. Instrumental music - especially keyboard works - were prominent in his output.  It was also during the Baroque period that the public  witnessed the emergence of the orchestra. Bach used dense polyphonic textures and rich harmonies. His harmony and counterpoint is still used as a model for music students today. His 'Art of Fugue' displays all resources of fugal writing.

===== Fugues =====

Bach wrote fugues for solo instruments (mainly for keyboard instruments). The fugue is NOT a form, but rather a compositional device, much like a canon or round.  A fugue consists of two items: a subject, or main theme, and an answer.  The answer can be either an exact, or real, repeat of the subject, or it can be a tonal repeat, in which the answer is modulated to another key center (usually the dominant) and contains intervallic modifications in order to make it fit into the new key. 
 
Several methods can be used to modify a fugue subject:
AUGMENTATION (Lengthening the values of the notes), DIMINUTION (Shortening the values of the notes), INVERSION (Inverting the intervals), RETROGRADE (the theme backwards) and STRETTO (Overlapping of voices). 

Another often encountered feature is pedal-point, where the tonic or dominant note (usually in the bass part)is held for long periods of time. One subject is exhaustively exploited.

===== Cantatas =====

The cantata was the principal means of musical expression of the Lutheran service. Most usually it was written for chorus, vocal soloists, organ and small orchestra, and set to a German religious text based on the bible. It was used to reinforced the minister’s sermon, and was generally around 25 minutes in length. It consists of several movements, including  choruses, chorales (hymns), recitatives (sections consisting of melodically intoned narrative), arias and duets. Bach wrote a total of 295 cantatas in his life time. While the opera, which also blossomed during the Baroque era, was a dramatic SECULAR work employing an orchestra along with stage actors, the cantata featured all the opera's elements except that the cantata was sacred.   

Bach's most famous Cantata: Cantata no 140 – “Wachet Auf”. It was based on a chorale tune, written 130 years earlier. This hymn has 3 movements. Bach uses hymn melody in 3 of the 7 movements.

'''1st Movement'''
Opens with orchestral introduction. Uses dotted rhythms, syncopation and rising scale passages. Sopranos enter, sing chorale notes in long note values. There are three layers of sound: 1. Chorale melody in long notes in Soprano voice. 2. Imitative dialogue in shorter notes in lower voices. 3. orchestral accompaniment .

'''4th Movement'''
This is the most famous movement. Arranged as a chorale prelude for organ later on in Bach’s life. Thee are two contrasting melodies against each other. Chorale tune moves in faster rhythmic values than in the 1st movement, sung against the string’s counter-melody.

'''7th Movement'''
This movement rounds off the cantata. For first time, all voices and instruments are used. The chorale is set in a homophonic texture for four voices with the instruments doubling. The chorale is presented as a continuous melody with full harmony and regular rhythms.

===== Concerto Grosso =====

The Concerto Grosso was an very important genre in late Baroque in orchestral form. It was written for small groups of soloists (between two and four) put against the orchestra – called the tutti. It standardly comprises three movements : 1st: fast (dramatic); 2nd: slow (lyrical); 3rd: dance-like; 1st and 3rd movements use ritornello form, which is based on alternation between tutti and solo sections.

The main theme is always presented by the tutti. It returns in different keys (possibly only fragments). Bach wrote many Concerti Grossi, e.g., the six Brandenburg Concertos.

=== Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048 ===
This is arguably the most famous of all the Brandenburg concertos. This is with out a doubt a great piece for an intermediate orchestra. The outer of the three movements are in ritornello form.  The concerto's first movement is easily recognizable and associated with Bach.  Surprisingly, the second movement consists of only two chords that make up a cadence, which leads to the final movement in 3/4 meter.

=== Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major, BWV 1050 ===

The Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 uses a string orchestra and group of soloists, which are the flute, violin, and harpsichord. It comprises three movements: The 1st movement - Allegro (lively) - makes use of a continuous flow of rapid notes, alternating between soloists and tutti. The recurring tutti section is louder and longer than the intervening soloist sections, which are mainly marked piano and use the flute to add a new tone-color (timbre). Their music is brilliant and more polyphonic than the tutti refrain, and new material is presented in them. Tension is built up during each soloist section, which anticipates the tutti’s next return.  There is a vast cadenza for solo harpsichord towards the end, demonstrating this tension-building and eventual relief, and thus the formal scheme of the concerto grosso, as a tour de force.


'''''Note : A Cadenza is a passage which displays virtuoso brilliance.'''''

The 2nd movement is slow, in the relative minor (B minor) and much quieter. It uses only the three solo instruments, and a cello, which duplicates the bass line of the harpsichord. The harpsichord has both an accompanying role as well as a solo role. There is a serious mood throughout. The 3rd movement is dance-like and makes use of an ABA form (maj|min|maj – ternary form). It opens like a fugue, with plentiful contrapuntal imitation. The main theme is introduced by violins and imitated by the flutes and harpsichord. In the B section, a new, lyrical theme is introduced.

=== Antonio Vivaldi (1678 – 1741) ===

Vivaldi was an Italian composer born in Venice. His father was a violinist in St. Marks’s cathedral. Vivaldi is best known for his 400 concerto grossi and solo concerti. In particular, he exploited the resources of the violin. His solo concertos include instruments like piccolo, flute, cello, bassoon, and mandolin.  He also composed many operas, much of them lost.  Despite being known for his concerti today, in his own time he was known largely for his operas (indeed, he was the most performed composer in Venetian theaters from 1713 to 1719). 

==== The Four Seasons ====

His most famous work is a set of concertos for solo violin with string orchestra. Each concerto depicts a season, and each concerto is prefaced by a sonnet. These concerti are programmatic / narrative in nature. The “Spring” concerto is arguably the most famous of the Four Seasons. It consists of three movements (fast | slow | fast), and makes use of terraced dynamics and tone painting; e.g. high trills to imitate bird chirps, tremolos to depict thunder and lightning, and soft running notes depict a stream. There is a Ritornello theme.

== Opera in the early Baroque Era ==

The Baroque era invented opera. &quot;Opera&quot; can be simply defined as a drama, set to an orchestral accompaniment. It originated in the courts of kings and princes, and does not deal with the ordinary and mundane, but rather deals with the spectacular and the wonderful. An opera is the joint effort between a composer and a librettist (dramatist). The Libretto is the text, which is set to music by composer(s). Some operas are serious, comic or a mixture of both, and may contain spoken dialog, but most are sung entirely. They can consist of one to five acts
subdivided into scenes. The main attraction is the aria, which is a song for solo voice set to orchestral accompaniment. The Opera may include recitatives, where the vocal line imitates the rhythms and pitch fluctuation of speech. Words are sung quickly on repeated notes, and are not melodic. Also, duets, trios, quintets etc... are used. The Chorus is important, as it generates atmosphere, and makes comments on the actions. Dance may be included. Most operas open with an overture or prelude, which is purely an orchestral composition.

Opera was born in Italy. Prepared by musical discussions between a group of nobles, poets and composers, which met regularly in Florence around 1575, and were known as the Camerata (Translated : “Fellowship” or “Committee”).  They included Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo. The Camerata wanted a new vocal style based on the music of ancient Greek tragedy. These Grecian dramas were sung in a style midway between melody and speech. They wanted vocal lines to be speech-like. This speech-like style became known as recitative. The earliest opera that has survived is “Euridice” by Jacopo Peri (1561-1633). The first-known great opera is “Orfeo” by Monteverdi. It was written for the court of the Gonzago family in Manua and based on Greek myth. The first commercial opera house, opened in Venice in 1637, which was one of the factors which caused Venice to became a major tourist attraction.

== Claudio Monteverdi (1567 – 1643) ==

Monteverdi was an Italian composer of the Early Baroque, who initially worked for 21 years in the service of the Gonzagas, the ruling family of Mantua. He was later positioned as the director of music at St. Marks in Venice. All of his works involve voices, and include operas, madrigals and church music. He makes use of the basso continuo and other instruments. He wrote 12 operas, of which only 3 are preserved. He is one of the key composers in the transition from Renaissance to Baroque.

=== Orfeo ===

Generally considered to be the first large-scale opera ever composed, 'Orfeo' was written in 1607 by Monteverdi for the Mantuan court. It was a lavish production, including soloists, dancers, chorus and large orchestra of 40 players. Beginning with an orchestral overture, it uses recitatives, arias, duets, choruses and instrumental interludes.

== Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632 - 1687) ==
Lully was an Italian-born French composer.  His birth name was Giovanni Battista Lulli.  He moved to France (where he later became a naturalized citizen) at the age of 14, and was very influential in the development of French opera, the French overture, and ballet.  He composed many in these genres, along with a handful of keyboard works.  He died of an infection caused by his stabbing of a staff into his foot.

== Henry Purcell (1659 - 1695) ==
Purcell was an English composer, born in Westminster, now part of London.  He is best known for his opera '''Dido and Aeneas''', semi-operas, and incidental music.  He also wrote much chamber music and harpsichord suites.

=== Dido and Aeneas ===
This was Purcell's only true opera, based on the Aeneid by the ancient Roman poet Virgil.  In this opera, soldier-of fortune Aeneas falls in love with Dido, queen of Carthage.  Then he deserts her, sailing off to found the city of Rome.  In Virgil's original story, Dido stabs herself with Aeneas's sword, but in Purcell's opera, she dies of a broken heart.  This is the subject of the famous aria &quot;When I am laid in earth.&quot;

== Francois Couperin (1668 - 1733) ==
Couperin was one of the leading French composers of the Baroque era, born in Paris.  Like Bach, he was from a family of musicians and composed no operas.  He wrote a bit of choral and vocal music, but is best known today for his instrumental music, especially his harpsichord works.

== Arcangelo Corelli (1653 - 1713) ==
Corelli was an Italian composer, violinist, and teacher and was very influential to succeeding Baroque composers.  He wrote 48 trio sonatas, 12 sonatas for violin and continuo, and 12 concerti grossi.  Perhaps his most famous composition is the Concerto Grosso in G minor, Op. 6, better known as the &quot;Christmas Concerto&quot;.

== George Frideric Handel (1685 – 1759) ==

Handel studied the organ at the age of 9, and was teaching and composing by the time he was 11. His output consists mainly of English oratorios and some 39 Italian operas, the latter  based on ancient Greek and Roman history and mythology (e.g., 'Julius Caesar'). With the exception of the &quot;Messiah&quot;, stories from the Old Testament form the basis of his oratorios. He also wrote a great deal of instrumental music, ranging from solo harpsichord works and sonatas for small combinations to orchestral concerti grossi and celebratory music (e.g. &quot;The Water Music&quot;)

His music, which embraces both homophonic and polyphonic styles, contains frequent changes of texture and sharp changes of mood, and often shifts between major and minor keys.

== Messiah (1741) ==

The best-known of all oratorios, the 2 ½ hour long &quot;The Messiah&quot; took Handel just 24 days to write, and was first performed in 1742 in Dublin. It consists of three parts. The first part deals with the Messiah’s coming, and uses the New Testament extensively. There is a total of 50 movements in this oratorio. The famous Hallelluja chorus occurs at the end of the 2nd movement (movement no. 44). All movements are contrasting between major and minor keys.

== Georg Philipp Telemann (1681 - 1767) ==
Telemann, a German, was the most famous composer in Europe during his lifetime, over Bach and Handel, both of whom are now, ironically, more highly renowned than Telemann.  He was born in Magdeburg.  He wrote the first of his 40 operas at the age of 12.  Other than operas, Telemann wrote numerous sacred music, but is best known today for his instrumental music.  Among his most notable works is the '''Suite for recorder, strings, and continuo in A minor, TWV 55:a2''', the '''Hamburger Ebb und Fluht, TWV 55:C3''' overture in C major, and the '''Trumpet Concerto in D major, TWV 51:D7'''.

== Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683 - 1764) ==
Like Couperin, Rameau was one of the most famous French composers of the Baroque era.  Besides composing instrumental music, he also composed a handful of ballets, motets, and operas, making him a versatile composer.  Some of his most famous works include '''Pièces de clavecin''', '''Pièces de clavecin en concerts''', and operas such as '''Hippolyte et Aricie''', '''Castor et Pollux''', and '''Zoroastre'''.

      <comment>/* Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Classical era occurred between 1750 and 1820. It was an age of enlightenment, set in motion by the great philosophers Voltaire, Diderot and Rousseau. People of the Classical period believed in reason, moving away from custom. They attacked the privileges of the aristocracy. The four great composers of the Classical Period were Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert.  The latter two made the transition to the succeeding Romantic period.  The first three were drawn to Vienna, and Schubert born there. The middle class was more powerful in the Classical era than before,  now having access to music, music lessons, printed music etc… which used to be a privilege of the aristocracy. Public concerts were now given for the first time.

== Mood ==

There is a much greater variety and contrast in mood, with lots of fluctuation. This is contrasted with Baroque pieces, which convey a single mood according to the &quot;Doctrine of Affection&quot;.

== Rhythm ==

There is now an enormous flexibility of rhythm. Classical pieces contain a wealth of rhythmic patterns, which make use of syncopations, or stresses of the upbeat,  changes in note values etc… In a Baroque piece, few patterns are reiterated throughout. In Classical pieces, there is constant rhythmical change.

== Texture ==

Most Late Baroque music is polyphonic. Classical music moves back towards homophonic textures consisting of melody + accompaniment.

== Melody ==

In contrast the relatively asymmetrical and elaborate melodies of Baroque music, classical era melodies are generally balanced and symmetrical, and often have a question-answer relationship in the cadences.

== Dynamics ==

There is a widespread use of dynamics. With the invention of the piano (pianoforte), crescendos and decrescendos come into widespread use. The music is not restricted to the terraced dynamics typifying that of the Baroque era.

== Harmony ==

The basso continuo, and the figured bass is abandoned in the Classical era, as there were many amateur musicians who could not improvise from the figured bass. Another reason for this was that composers wanted more control over their work. 

Major-minor tonality provides the structural framework for all musical forms and genres.

== Orchestra ==

In Baroque music, the orchestra changes from piece to piece. In the Classical period, there is a standard group of instruments constituting the orchestra:

'''Strings'''

The Strings form the most important group (and still are the foundation of the modern orchestra). The first violins carry main melody. The lower strings play accompaniment.

'''Woodwind'''

The purpose of the Woodwind section is to add contrasting tone colours to the accompaniment and to provide occasional melodic solos.

'''Brass'''

The Brass give power to the music and fill out the harmonies.

'''Percussion'''

Timpani give rhythmic bite and emphasis.

== Forms ==

Classical pieces consist of several movements that contrast each other in character and in tempo. Forms carried over from the Baroque era include the Concerto, Opera and Symphony. The new emerging forms in the Classical era are the String Quartet (four movements - Fast; Slow; Dance-like; Fast), the Sonata (four movements - Fast; Slow; Dance-like; Fast).

Various forms employed in the classical period include: Binary (A | B), and Ternary (A | B | A). Ternary may be used in an individual movement, and often the third movement in a symphony, string quartet, sonata, etc. There was also the Minuet (A | Trio B | Minuet A), for example, the third movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (Mozart). The Rondo form was also employed (A | B | A | C | A, etc.) For example: Mozart’s String Quartets, only found in last movements. The Minuet and Trio (A | B | A), where A – Minuet, B – Trio. Theme and Variation form (A | A1 | A2 | A3 | etc… ) is basically the theme followed by variations,for example, Haydn’s Surprise Symphony, 2nd movement.

The most important new form of the Classical period was sonata form. It can be found in solo form, chamber music, concertos, and symphonies. Sonata form divides a movement into three basic parts:

#'''Exposition:''' The theme or themes of the movement are introduced, often in different keys.
#'''Development:''' The composer experiments with his or her theme(s), changing their keys around or writing variations of them.
#'''Recapitulation:''' The themes are restated in more or less the original form, but are now all in the tonic, i.e. the key of the piece.

Sometimes a composer also uses a slower-paced introduction or an extra concluding passage called a coda.

== Symphony ==

One of the great contributions to the classical era is the symphony. Haydn wrote an amazing 104 symphonies, Mozart wrote over 40, and Beethoven wrote 9 (the first two of which best fit the classical style). The classical symphony lasts between 20 and 45 minutes, consisting usually of four movements:

1st movement : Sonata form

2nd movement : Slow. May use sonata, ternary or theme-and-variation form.

3rd movement : Dance-like. Minuet and Trio form.

4th movement : Brilliant and heroic. May use sonata, rondo or sonata-rondo form.

== Concerto ==

The Concerto is a three-movement work for instrumental soloist (or occasionally two or three soloists) and orchestra. The first movement is always in a lively, brisk tempo. A '''cadenza''' often appears near the end of the first movement, during which the orchestra is silent and the soloist is given an opportunity to demonstrate technical ability. The second movement is generally slow, and any form may be used. the third movement is contrasted from the second and usually quite fast, usually employing rondo form.

The concerto uses a specialized sonata form containing two expositions, the first of which is normally for the orchestra alone, the second for the soloist with the orchestra accompanying.  The concerto lasts between 20 and 45 minutes.

== String Quartet ==

The string quartet is for two violins, viola and cello. It consists of four movements, using the same forms as used in a symphony.

== Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788) ==
During his lifetime, C.P.E. Bach was more famous than his father, Baroque master J.S. Bach.  He is regarded as a key founder of the Classical style and period, and most, if not, all of his compositions have more simplistic techniques that use more emotional power, in contrast to the ornamental Baroque music of his father.  He composed an immense output consisting of keyboard sonatas, concertos, symphonies, oratorios, chamber music, and more.  One of his most well-known pieces is the &quot;Solfeggietto in C minor&quot;.

== Christoph Willibald von Gluck (1714-1787) ==
Gluck was a German composer from Bavaria, known for his contributions to changes in operatic form of the Classical period.  Aside from writing opera, he also wrote ballet suites, chamber music, orchestral music, and other genres, but is most well-known for his operatic reforms.

===Reform of Opera===

====Orfeo ed Euridice====

== Joseph Haydn (1732-1809)==

Haydn is referred to by many scholars as the &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot;. He was born in Austria, and his father made wagon wheels. Haydn incorporates folk tunes in his music which his father sang to him as a child. He was a pioneer in the development of the symphony and the string quartet. Mozart and Beethoven influenced his style, even as did he theirs. He was a master at developing themes, often using contrasts of key, mood, texture, rhythm, dynamics and orchestration. His music contains unexpected pauses and tempo changes. He wrote over 100 symphonies, 68 string quartets, piano sonatas, concerti, operas and masses. His last 12 symphonies are called his &quot;London symphonies&quot;. The London Symphonies each have a nickname, such as “Surprise”; “Clock”; “Military”; “Drum Roll” etc.

'''Trumpet Concerto in Eb maj (1796)'''

His Trumpet Concerto in E flat major was written on a different trumpet to what was around before. It consists of three movements: Fast | Slow | Fast. The third movement uses Rondo Form.

== Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 – 1791) ==

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Austria. He is one of the most versatile of composers in the entire history of music. He wrote masterpieces in all musical forms. All his music has a ‘singing’ quality, even his instrumental melodies seem to grow out of the human voice. His music conveys a feeling of ease, grace, balance and perfect proportion. He created compositions with ease (e.g., writing his last three symphonies in 6 weeks!). He wrote over 600 compositions, all of which were catalogued by Von Köchel (a botanist) in chronological order. Thus, we refer to Mozart’s work by the “K” number, which indicates the chronological position of the work in his output. Many of his concertos were among his finest works; he wrote many for piano, several for violin and for horn, as well as two flute concertos, one bassoon concerto, one clarinet concerto and one oboe concerto. He was a master of opera, with most of his operas being comedies. The Italian operas were sung throughout, whereas the German operas included speech. Some of his better known operas were :The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni &quot;, and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Additionally, Mozart wrote forty-one symphonies.

'''Mozart’s Concertos'''
The Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major was written during a very productive stage in Mozart’s life. Its three movements stress delicacy and lyricism, rather than orchestral power and virtuosity. Trumpets and timpani are absent from the orchestral setting, whereas the clarinets, flutes and bassoon are highlighted. The first movement has two expositions. The orchestra presents the two themes, which are restated by the piano in the second exposition. The development is based on a new theme, introduced by the orchestra. Towards the end of the movement, there is a cadenza.

== Ludwig Van Beethoven (1770 – 1827) ==

Ludwig van Beethoven's career has 3 phases. His first phase was between 1770 – 1802, during which his music was strongly influenced by Mozart and Haydn. He wrote his first two piano concertos, first two symphonies, string quartets Op.18 and first 10 piano sonatas all during this period. His second phase was between 1802 – 1815. During this stage he was going deaf. He greatly expanded upon existing forms, and infused his music with heroic expression. his works include the Kreutzer Sonata for violin and piano; his only violin concerto; 3rd, 4th and 5th piano concertos and some of his greatest piano sonatas including “Les adieux”, “Waldstein” and “Appassionata”. His third phase was from 1815 – 1827. Now he was totally deaf, leaving him completely isolated from society. He departs substantially from established conventions, both in form and in style. His works include the 9th symphony, the Missa Solemnis, the last piano sonatas and the late string quartets.

Beethoven believed that there was a moral force behind music. He revised and refined his work repeatedly. He used classical forms and techniques but gave them new power and intensity, creating a bridge between classicism and Romanticism. His works convey tension and excitement through syncopations and dissonances. Entailing many contrasts in mood, tiny rhythmic ideas are repeated over and over to create momentum. There is an enormous range of expression in his work: tempo, dynamic and expressive indications are marked far more extensively in his scores than in those of his predecessors. Often he had markings such as “&lt; p”. He uses extremes of pitch far more. He unified the movements of his symphonies, sonatas and string quartets. Often, one movement leads directly into another with out a pause ('''attacca'''). There are also thematic inter-relationships between movements. Many of his movements use sonata form, but the development section and the coda are greatly expanded. He uses the scherzo rather than the minuet for the 3rd movements of his pieces. His scherzos have rapid movement with rhythmic drive. His most famous works are his nine symphonies, which were conceived for large orchestras. In some of them he adds piccolos, trombones and contrabassoon. All instruments play difficult music, and Beethoven was the first composer to make dynamic use of brass instruments within the orchestra. Beethoven's odd numbered symphonies are more forceful, whereas the even numbered symphonies are very calm and lyrical. His Symphony No. 9 is the first up to that time in music history to use a choir, which we hear in the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; finale movement. He wrote 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, five piano concertos, one opera (“Fidelio”), two ballets, one violin concerto, and two masses. He incorporated fugues extensively in his later works.


'''Symphony no.3'''
This symphony was intended to reflect on the life of Napoleon. However, Beethoven scratched out its dedication to Napoleon when he found out the general had invaded Austria. Nicknamed the ''Eroica'' Symphony, it was the longest symphony ever composed at the time of its premiere.


'''Symphony no.5'''
In his Symphony number 5, he unifies all contrasting movements. The first four-note motif is used extensively in first and third movements. The third movement theme reappears in the finale. The last two movements are connected by a bridge. This contrasting element that he retained by employing the motif in all four movements of Symphony no. 5 is known as a cell.

== Franz Schubert (1797-1828) ==
Schubert was a Viennese composer and child prodigy.  His earliest works, like that of his predecessor Beethoven, were in the Classical style.  His output consists of over 600 songs, nine Symphonies, eight completed operas, six masses, and an abundance of piano music, string quartets and other chamber works. His songs embrace a wide spectrum of moods, and his melodies range from simple folk-like tunes to complex lines. He makes use of very rich harmonies and rich accompaniments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Romantic era spans from 1820 A.D. up until 1900 A.D. It can be characterized by the individuality of style, where there is an emphasis of self-expression and individuality in compositional style. The music is generally very programmatic, where the instrumental music depicts a story, idea or a poem - e.g., Smetena’s “The Moldau” depicts scenes along the Moldau River. The programmatic style can also be seen in the titles, which are usually very descriptive. Nationalism becomes important during this era, where composers created music using folk song, history and dances of their homelands.

There is a variety of mood, atmosphere and tone color. The orchestra expanded due to the growing size of concert halls and opera houses, causing an increase in the power of the brass section. The woodwind section takes on new tone colors, with the addition of the contrabassoon, bass clarinet, piccolo and the cor anglais. There are huge technological improvements in musical instruments which made them more musically flexible and accurate. New sounds were now created/used in all instruments. i.e. flutes were required to play in the breathy, lower registers; violins were asked to strike the strings with the wood of the bow – col legno. All instruments were required to play with more virtuosity.

== Harmony ==

In Romanticism, a broader harmonic vocabulary was used, such as chromatic harmonies, adding color to the music. Dissonant, unstable chords where also used more freely. Delayed resolution of dissonances gave an increased feeling of angst. Extensive modulation was now used much more than previously in the Classical era. Because of this extensive modulation, there is less tonal gravity (the centration around one common key).

== Dynamics And Rhythm ==

Romantic music uses a wide range of dynamics from fff (fortississimo:  very, very loud) to ppp (pianississimo:  very, very soft). The range of pitch is expanded. Tempo becomes another tool in the hands of the Romantic composers as indicated by the increased use of accelerandos (speeding up) and ritardandos (slowing down), as well as extensive use of rubato (the bending of tempo/rhythm).

== Forms ==

Composers wrote musical miniatures as well as monumental pieces. Some genres are carried over from classicism, but are more greatly exploited, such as sonatas and symphonies. Additionally, a few new forms are invented.

'''Art Song'''

One of the forms of the Romantic Era is the Art Song. It is standardly a composition for solo voice and piano. The piano accompaniment is an integral element in the piece, and serves as an interpretive partner to the voice, rather than a simplistic accompaniment. Poetry and music are thus intimately fused. The best Art Song composers of the Romantic era include Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. The Art Songs  based on German texts tended to favour the poets Heine and Goethe. The song composers interpret the poems, translating their mood and atmosphere into music. Most songs have a piano introduction and in many cases a postlude.

Types of Art Songs:
'''Strophic''' - The same music is used for each stanza. Like a hymn in structure.
'''Through-composed''' - New music is used for each stanza. Allows music to reflect changing moods in the poem.
'''Song Cycles''' - Contains several art songs, grouped into a set. Often unified by a single story line. i.e. : Schubert's “The Winter Journey”

''''Tone Poem'''

== Beethoven (1770 – 1827) ==

Ludwig van Beethoven's career has 3 phases. His first phase was between 1770 – 1802, during which his music was strongly influenced by Mozart and Haydn. He wrote his first two piano concertos, first two symphonies, string quartets Op.18 and first 10 piano sonatas all during this period. His second phase was between 1802 – 1815. During this stage he was going deaf. He greatly expanded upon existing forms, and infused his music with heroic expression. His works include the Kreutzer Sonata for violin and piano, his only violin concerto, the 3rd, 4th and 5th piano concertos and some of his greatest piano sonatas, including “Les adieux”, “Waldstein” and “Appassionata”. His third phase was from 1815 – 1827. Now he was totally deaf, leaving him completely isolated from society. He departs substantially from established conventions, both in form and in style. His works include the 9th symphony, the Missa Solemnis, and the late piano sonatas and string quartets.

His Symphony No. 9 is the first up to that time in music history to use a choir, which we hear in the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; finale movement. He wrote 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, 5 piano concertos, 1 opera (“Fidelio”), 1 ballet, 1 violin concerto, and 2 masses. He incorporated fugues extensively in his later works.


'''Symphony no.3'''
This symphony was intended to reflect on the life of Napoleon. However, Beethoven scratched out its dedication to Napoleon when he found out the general had invaded Austria. Nicknamed the ''Eroica'' Symphony, it was the longest symphony ever composed at the time of its premiere.


'''Symphony no.5'''

In his Symphony no. 5, he unifies all contrasting movements. The first four-note motif is used extensively in first and third movements. The third movement theme reappears in the finale. The last two movements are connected by a bridge. This contrasting element that he retained by employing the motif in all four movements of Symphony no. 5 is known as a cell.

== Paganini (1782 - 1840) ==

== Weber (1786 - 1826) ==

== Rossini (1792 - 1868) ==

== Donizetti (1797 - 1848) ==

== Mendelssohn (1809 - 1847) ==

== Schumann (1810 – 1856) ==

Schumann was a very conservative composer, whose works are very autobiographical and programmatic in nature. He was the founder of the first musical journal – “The New Journal of Music”. His most famous Art Song is considered to be &quot;In The Lovely Month Of May&quot;, an example of an Art Song which makes use of Strophic form.

== Schubert (1797 – 1828) ==

Schubert was a Viennese composer and child prodigy. His output consists of over 600 songs, nine Symphonies, eight completed operas, six masses, and an abundance of piano music, string quartets and other chamber works. His songs embrace a wide spectrum of moods, and his melodies range from simple folk-like tunes to complex lines. He makes use of very rich harmonies and rich accompaniments.

'''The Erl King'''

'The Erl King' is an Art Song based on a ballad by Goethe. The Poem is in dialog throughout. The story is about a father riding through a storm on horse-back with his sick child in his arms. The boy has visions of the Erl King – a symbol of death. A through-composed setting is used to capture the tension and excitement of the poem. The piano part has a triplet motion, describing the galloping of the horse. The motif in the bass symbolizes the Erl King and death. Schubert makes one singer portray several characters. The ‘boy’ is sung in the high register in a minor key, often with dissonant harmonies (symbolic of his sickness), whereas the ‘father’ sings in the low register, trying to reassure the boy. The ‘Erl King’ sings coy and enticing melodies in the major key. The highlight of the piece is its closing recitative, announcing the father's discovery on reaching home of his son dead in his arms.

== The Symphony ==

During the Romantic era, two groups of Symphony composers arose. The first being the &quot;Conservative&quot; Group, comprising of Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky and Brahms. The second is known as the &quot;Revolutionary&quot; Group, and consists of Berlioz, Liszt, Mahler, and Dvorak.

== Berlioz (1803 – 1869) ==

Berlioz was a French composer, whose work contains abrupt contrasts in dynamics and tempo changes.  He assembled hundreds of musicians in his orchestras to achieve an enormous range of power. He made use of unusual orchestral effects such as col legno, and the combination of bells and brasses. His melodies are long, irregular and asymmetrical. All his works are for orchestra or for orchestra with chorus and vocal soloist, and have a literary program and are dramatic and use new forms.

'''Symphnonie Fantastique, 1830'''

Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique (1830) is a five movement programmatic symphony. A single melody, called the ideé fixe, is used to represent the beloved, and makes an appearance in all movements, unifying the symphony. The theme changes in character throughout the symphony. He makes use of a large and colorful orchestra consisting of bells,  harps, timpani, piccolo, cor anglais, etc… He has the heaviest orchestration in the last two movements which depict the fantastic and the diabolical.

1st movement: slow introduction with 11 tempo changes, followed by the Allegro, in which the ideé fixe is very noble and shy.

2nd movement: A waltz, using ternary form and including the harps.
 
3rd movement: describes a country scene and includes the cor anglais.

4th movement: a march, here the timpani are tuned a 3rd apart.

5th movement: most fantastic. Starts with muted strings. Here the ideé fixe is a witch, and is transformed into a dance tuned decorated by trills. Bells are used, tubas and bassoons intone the Dies Irae, symbolizing eternal damnation. There are contrasting Pizzicato in the strings. The movements ends with a figure in the lower strings. There is a huge crescendo at the end, culminating in a musical nightmare.

== Brahms (1833 – 1897) ==

Brahms was a German composer, influenced by Schumann to a small extent. He created masterpieces in all forms except opera. His output includes four symphonies, two piano concertos, one violin concerto, short piano pieces, many songs (over 200) and a large number of choral pieces.  He was a master of ‘Theme and Variation’ form. Strongly influenced by Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, his music embraces a wide range of moods and uses intricate and dense polyphonic textures. He makes extensive use of imitation, canon and fugue, with intricate rhythmic patterns,  including polyrhythms (various rhythms placed against each other E.g. : 2 against 3, or 3 against 2). Brahms treated tonality with greater freedom whilst adhering to strict, formal classical forms and standards. Each of his 4 movements are arranged in the traditional sequence: Allegro, Slower 2nd, Scherzo and massive finale. He employs extensive modulation throughout. He was very fond of mellow instruments / tone colors such as viola, clarinet and French horn.

'''Symphony IV opus 98'''

1st movement : Sonata form

2nd movement : Slow and lyrical, with a pair of song-like themes.

3rd movement : Scherzo. Incorporates Sonata-rondo from.

4th movement : Theme and Variation Form (Allegro in E min). Consisting of the theme, 30 Variations and a coda. The brasses and woodwinds introduce the theme (consisting of an ascending, eight bar/note melody). Variations embrace a wide range of moods,  and are connected to each other and maintain the themes eight bar form and triple meter. In variations 1 – 3, the theme is presented in the top or middle parts. In variations 4 – 11, the theme is presented in the bass. In variations 12 onwards the theme is presented in the top, middle or bass parts. This movement uses an overall ternary form:

A

Theme, then Variations 1 – 11 in a Minor key. Very Forceful.

B

Variations 12 – 15 in a Major key with a slower tempo and more relaxed.

A

Variations 16 – 13 with a quick tempo in a minor key followed by the Coda.

== Liszt (1811 – 1886) ==

Liszt wrote very controversial music. His output consists mainly of piano compositions. He found new and exciting  ways to exploit the piano. He uses an enormous range of dynamics, reminiscent of Beethoven's symphonic compositions. Pianists are required to play rapid octaves and daring leaps. He transcribed many operas and symphonies for the piano. He is said to have created the symphonic poem, a one movement orchestral composition, based on a literary or pictorial idea. A single musical idea recurs throughout the work and its character is transformed. Similar in nature to the idée fixe utilized by Berlioz. Many of Liszt’s compositions deal with the devil or death. He makes constant changes of tempo and mood in his pieces.

'''Transendental Etude no.10 in F min'''

Uses ABA / ternary form, as well as the inclusion of a Coda. The B section is more lyrical and in a higher register, and there is constant contrast between brilliant virtuosity and melodic ideas, which occur throughout the movement.

== Chopin, Frederic (1810 – 1849) ==

Frederic Chopin wrote relatively few works, but almost all of them remain in the pianist’s repertory today. Most of his music are short, musical miniatures, which evoke a variety of moods. Even his virtuoso passages are melodic. His music is nationalistic, and expresses his love of Poland (his home country) through his many Mazurkas and Polonaises. Chopin does not use literary titles or programs in his music, but rather, his poetic effects are created by the exploitation of the pedal. All of his harmonies blend together in a rich fashion.

'''“Revolutionary” Etude no.12 Opus 10 (1831)'''

This etude is inspired by the Russian Invasion of Warsaw. It is essentially a study which develops speed and endurance in the pianist’s left hand. The left hand plays rapid scale passages throughout. The piece begins with high, dissonant chords, and rushing passages.

== Verdi (1813 – 1901) ==

Verdi's music has a great variety of moods. His operas are fast moving, and involve characters who are quickly plunged into extremes of hatred, love, jealousy and fear. The vocal melody is the soul of Verdi’s opera. He uses many trios, duets and quartets in which the emotions of each character are clearly depicted. Verdi’s last three operas are among his greatest: Aida, Falstaff and Otello.

== Wagner (1813 - 1883) ==
 
Wagner was one of the few great composers who was able to write his own librettos, which he based on legends and myths such as the story of Tristan and Isolde and of the Norse gods. He called his works “music dramas” or “Universal Art Works” (gesamtkunstwerk in German). Wagner shifted the musical gravity from the voice to the orchestra, and so expands his orchestra, which is treated symphonically. His orchestral interludes were used to describe the present scene. He exploited the power of brass instruments fully and even invented a new instrument, the Wagner tuba. He used leitmotifs, which are a recurring, short musical idea associated with a person or object in the drama. He varied and transformed these leitmotifs to convey changes of character, and these leitmotifs are what unify Wagner’s operas. He uses chromatic and dissonant harmonies, and frequent modulation, but avoids resolution of dissonances, leading to the breaking down of tonality.

'''The Ring'''

&quot;The Ring&quot; (AKA ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'') is Wagner's most famous work. It is a widely performed sequence of 4 operas /dramas, arranged in a gigantic cycle.

== Strauss (1825 - 1899) ==

== Puccini (1858 - 1924) ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PHP tags: ==

=== '''&lt;?php [code] ?&gt;''' ===

* Enclose php code

* Can be configured in the php.ini to be &lt;? ?&gt;, &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; etc.

* Embedded in normal HTML code

* Within php tags, statements are separated by a ; (generally also followed by a new line).

Example: 

 &lt;?php
 print “Hello World\n”;
 $date = date(“Y-m-d H:i:s”);
 print “The date and time at the moment is $date”;
 ?&gt;

=== '''&lt;?=''' ===


* Used if you just want to print out the value of a variable

Example:  
 &lt;?php
 $name = &quot;Bobby&quot;;
 ?&gt;
 
 &lt;?=$name?&gt;
Which will output ''Bobby''.

Example:
 &lt;?=date(“Y-m-d H:i:s”)?&gt; 

Which will output something like ''2005-11-09 19:40:05''.

== Commenting ==

==='''#'''===

* Comments out one line

* Example:
 echo “Hello”; # Everything from the hash is commented out

* Example:
 # This entire line is commented out

==='''//'''===

* Works just as in Java and JavaScript

* Same function as '''#'''

==='''/* (text) */'''===

* Comments out everything between the /* and the */

* Example: 
 /*All of this is
 commented out.
 Even this line!*/

== Variables ==

➢ Variables in PHP are denoted by the $ prefix.

e.g. : $a = “Hello World”; # this assigns the string “Hello World” to $a.

e.g. : $b = “$a, I'm Ralfe”; # this assigns “Hello World, I'm Ralfe” to $b.

e.g. : $b = $a.”, I'm Ralfe”; # exactly the same as the previous example.


➢ PHP supports dynamic variables.

e.g. : $c = “response”;

e.g. : $$c = “Hello Ralfe”; # this assigns “Hello Ralfe” to $response.


➢ PHP variables do not have to be declared ahead of time, nor do they require a type
definition. PHP handles all data type conversions.

e.g. : $a = 4;

e.g. : $b = 12;

e.g. : print “The value of a is $a.”; # Uses a as a String.

e.g. : $c = $a + $b; # $a is now used as an Integer again.


➢ PHP supports boolean variables, which can be assigned either a one or a zero, or a
true or false.

e.g. : $a = true;

e.g. : $b = 1;

e.g. : # $a and $b are the same thing!

e.g. : $c = false;

e.g. : $d = 0;

e.g. : # $c and $d are the same thing!

== Operators ==

➢ Arithmetic Operators

$a = 4;

$b = 2;

// Addition: $a + $b = 6

// Subtraction: $a - $b = 2

// Multiplication: $a * $b = 8

// Division: $a / $b = 2

// Modulus: $a % $b = 0

// Increment: $a++

// Decrement: $a--


➢ Assignment Operators

$a = 4;

$b = $a;

// $b = 4;


➢ Comparison Operators

$a == $b // test if two values are equal

$a != $b // test if two values are not equal

$a &lt; $b // test if the first value is less than the second

$a &gt; $b // test if the first value is greater than the second

$a &lt;= $b // test if the first value is less than or equal to the second

$a &gt;= $b // test if the first value is greater than or equal to the second

== Concatenation ==


$a = “Fill the halls “;

$b = “with poisoned ivy...“;

$c = $a . $b; # the '.' operator concatenates two variables.

// $c = “Fill the halls with poisoned ivy...”

== Arrays ==

PHP supports both numerically indexed arrays as well as associative arrays.

$a = array(1, 2, 3, 4);

// $a[0] = 1;

// $a[1] = 2;

// $a[2] = 3;

// $a[3] = 4;

$b = array(“name” =&gt; ”Fred”, “age” =&gt; 30);

// $b['name'] = “Fred”;

// $b['age'] = 30;

== Decision and Loop Statements ==

'''IF THEN ELSE statement'''

 $a = 1;
 $b = 10;
 
 if ($a &gt; $b) {
    echo &quot;a is greater than b&quot;;
 }
 else if ($a == $b) {
    echo &quot;a is equal to b&quot;;
 }
 else {
    echo &quot;a is not greater than b&quot;;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // a is not greater than b
 

'''SWITCH statement'''

 $a = 100;
 
 switch($a) {
    case(10):
       echo &quot;The value is 10&quot;;
       break;
 
    case(100):
       echo &quot;The value is 100&quot;;
       break;
 
    case(1000):
       echo &quot;The value is 1000&quot;;
       break;
 
    default:
       echo &quot;Are you sure you entered in a valid number?&quot;;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // The value is 100


'''FOR statement'''

 for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
    # initialize $i ; while condition ; increment statement
    echo $i;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // 0123456789


'''FOREACH statement'''

 $a = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 
 foreach ($a as $val){
    echo $val;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // 12345


'''WHILE statement'''

 while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){
    print $row[0];
 }


'''DO WHILE statement'''

 $i = 0;
 # Note that it might seem that $i will
 do{
    # never be printed to the screen, but
    print $i;
    # a DO WHILE loop always executes at
 } while ($i &gt;0);
 # least once!

== Functions ==

 function square_number($number) {
    return ($number * $number);
 }
 
 $answer = square_number(10);
 echo &quot;The answer is {$answer}&quot;;
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // The answer is 100

== Classes ==

 class dog {
    var $name;
    
    function dog($name){
       $this-&gt;name = $name;
    }
    
    function bark(){
       echo &quot;Woof! Woof!&quot;;
    }
    
    function who_am_i() {
       echo &quot;My name is {$this-&gt;name), and I am a dog&quot;;
    }
 }
 
 $the_dog = new dog(&quot;John&quot;);
 $the_dog-&gt;who_am_i();
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // My name is John, and I am a dog

      <comment>/* Case II */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Section 18 of ICTA sets out the charge to tax under '''Schedule D'''.

Subsection (1) raises the charge to tax in respect of:

*Annual profits or gains arising or accruing on worldwide income from property of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK residents]]
*Annual profits or gains on worldwide trading income for UK residents
*Annual profits or gains on UK trading income or income from property
*All interest of money, annuities and other profits or gains not charged under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] or ITEPA and not specifically exempted from tax.

Subsection (2) provides that the charge under Schedule D happens under different Cases.

Subsection (3) sets out the different Cases. There are different definitions for some of the Cases depending on whether you are looking at income tax or corporation tax. However, subsection (4A) provides that Subsections (1) to (4) only apply to income tax to the extent that they are needed in the application to corporation tax.

Subsection (5) notes that Parts III and IV of ICTA as well as ITTOIA have further related provisions.

==The Cases of Schedule D==

===Case I===

This Case covers tax in respect of any trade carried on in the United Kingdom or elsewhere but not contained in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]].

===Case II===

This Case covers tax in respect of any profession or vocation not contained in any other Schedule. In practice, it is not thought possible for a company to be charged to tax under Case II.  eah as if this is true

===Case III===

For companies, this Case covers tax from [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legisation/Loan relationship|loan relationships]] charged under this Case by Chapter II of Part IV of FA 1996. It also covers any annuity or other annual payment which is payable in repect of anything other than a loan relationship and which is not a payment under Schedule A. 

For individuals, this Case covers UK interest-like receipts, but in practice this rule only applies insofar as it is relevant for the operation of corporation tax as individuals are taxed under ITEPA.

===Case IV===

This does not apply to companies. For individuals, this Case covers income from overseas securities, but in practice this rule only applies insofar as it is relevant for the operation of corporation tax as individuals are taxed under ITEPA.

===Case V===

This Case covers tax in respect of income arising from posessions out of the UK that are employment, social security or pension income taxed under ITEPA. For companies, it excludes anything falling within Case III.

===Case VI===

This Case covers tax in respect of any annual profits or gains not falling under any other Case and not taxed under Schedule A, or as employment, social security or pension income under ITEPA.

==Further provisions and definitions==

Subsections (3B) to (3E) provide some supplemental provisions.

Subsection (3B) expands the meaning of '''relevant foreign holdings''' to include proceeds of a sale or other realisation of coupons for foreign dividends effected by a UK bank that pays the proceeds over or credits them to an account, and any proceeds of a sale of such coupons in the UK by a person who isn't a bank or another dealer of coupons.

Subsection (3C) defines '''relevant foreign holdings''' for the purposes of this Section to mean non-UK government, public or local authority securities or any share or securities issued by a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|non-UK resident]].

Subsection (3D) defines '''foreign dividends''' essentially to mean payments in respect of relevant foreign holdings.

Subsection (3E) defines [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Bank|bank]] to have the meaning given by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 840A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 840A of ICTA]]. References in Section 18 to '''coupons''' include, in relation to any foreign dividends, warrants for an bills of exchange purporting to be drawn or made in payment of those dividends.

== [[Programming:PHP &amp; MySQL]] ==
It would be better if you named pages consistently: when you have TOC in [[Programming:PHP &amp; MySQL]] and chapter name is [[PHP &amp; MySQL/PHP Syntax]], chapter won't have automatic link to the TOC. I suggest renaming main book page to [[PHP &amp; MySQL]], it would be shorter. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

== [[Wikibooks:Surgery department]] ==

Hi. The five departments Wikibooks currently has are: natural sciences, social sciences, computing, arts, and miscellaneous, all of which contain bookshelves. Because [[Wikibooks:Surgery department]] contains only four books, all of which are found on [[Wikibooks:Health science bookshelf]], I have redirected the page to that bookshelf. I don't think we should confuse browsers with extra pages. Is this alright? BTW, I'm glad to see someone finally working on [[Orthopaedic Surgery]] again! Thanks and regards, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:18, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

: Yes, the natural sciences bookshelf is really a &quot;miscellaneous natural sciences&quot; bookshelf. Math and computer science, which are under the same department, are not natural sciences at all. In fact, some don't even consider math a science. Engineering and health science would both fit better under an applied sciences department. And this is only one department! The others suffer from similar problems. I have proposed a more sensible organization [[Wikibooks_talk:All_bookshelves#Reorganization|here]], based on [[w:list of academic disciplines]], but unfortunately it hasn't gotten much attention. Good luck on your books, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:25, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

:Yes [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]], it appears that you have been working hard with a few others to get the whole bookshelf arranged. At the moment I don't have anything specific to suggest. I presume it will take a while to get the best/working combination. Don't be disappointed. I am sure you will get it right, especially when there are more books on the shelves! Good luck.
:And thanks for your encouraging words.

I wonder if this is the best way to contact you.  I have some content for the orthopaedic wikibook but am unsure what is the best way to put it on there.  [[User:Openelfar|elfar]] 02:59, 17 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

== lots squares in columns about name and transliteration ==

I see lots square simbols in two colums: name and transliteration.
My o.s. is windows XP

== Where did this come from? ==
i feel like this isn't very clear, even to someone who's studied Arabic.  The image labelled &quot;self-explanatory&quot; isn't at all - why are only half the letters labelled? [[User:The chavi|The chavi]] 00:31, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

I think it's a cop out to say that you won't hear or will hear as a different sound the rest of the letters.  It's important to teach people how to speak the language, and leaving an aspect like this out will cause major trouble for anyone using this as a legitmate resource.

== Agreed: Not clear ==

This article is not very clear at all. The pictures have awkward MSPaint arrows, and need more explanation. The table at the bottom is the best part, but some of the letters show up as boxes. These need to be changed to pictures.

== Alienating the Reader ==

It seems to me that the sentence &quot;just in case you haven't noticed yet, Arabic is written from right to left&quot; sounds arrogant, even if the reader isn't one of those rare individuals who've managed to let that basic fact about their topic of study pass them by. I suggest &quot;Please note that Arabic is written from right to left&quot; or &quot;We wish to remind the reader...&quot; as alternatives. [[User:Dorfl|Dorfl]] 07:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General observations ==

I hope you will consider the following criticism as constructive.

As the opening paragraphs of a book, neither the flow nor the content are sufficiently &quot;racy&quot; to capture the attention of a putative student. The traditional opening remarks found in many if not all statistics textbooks refer to the etymology of the word &quot;statistics&quot;. Such discussion is easily understood and gently eases the reader into the subject matter.

The reasons for doing statistical studies are much more varied than garnering biometrics from large animals, and at the very least a selection of contrasting applications should be included in the book's opening preamble.

The English is not sufficiently straightforward in places to allow smooth reading of the text. By this I mean that one has to pause periodically and work out what the author intended to say.   J.Morgan. 6 Feb 2006

=An Outline=

I think it would be best if we came up with a good general outline for a &quot;What is Statistics?&quot; section. It would give us a clear train of thought from beginning to end, improve the flow of the section, and address any overall issues we may have with the section. I am just throwing out a first draft, please edit as necessary as we transition the actual content to match the outline.

Additionally, it would be a good idea to think about the questions which might be asked in a quiz on this section. Here are some possible questions:

*&quot;From where do we get the word ''statistics''?&quot;
*&quot;Who invented the term &quot;standard deviation&quot;?&quot;
*&quot;I give you a list of numbers and ask for their sum. This is an example of ___________ statistics.&quot;
*&quot;Name three of the five(/six/seven) central concepts of statistics.&quot;
*&quot;Give a real-world example where it would be appropriate to use statistics.&quot;

===Outline===

*Some Loose Examples
**I always found those first pages in maths textbooks which laid out one or two real-world examples were very helpful in alleviating the more numbers-heavy aspects of the rest of the book. It would also be good if these examples covered the gamut of statistical topics (data description, probability, distribution, surveys/samples, correlation/causation, etc.) without too much overlap. They also can provide nice tie-ins to later chapters (&quot;In the opening chapter, we asked how you would conduct a test to determine a drug's effectiveness ...&quot;)
**Medicine: Drug testing = samples, null hypothesis, placebo effect
**Business: Sales data report = mean/median/mode, standard deviation, bar graphs
**Sports: Proposition bet = probability
**Politics: Conducting a poll = sample size, bias, margin of error
**Technology: Widget maker error = tolerance, yield, min-max analysis
*A General Definition
**Again, as this is the general definition contained in the introduction, we should be leery of any attempt to compartmentalize it (&quot;Statistics includes Bayesian statistics, which does such and such, and also Gaussian statistics, and also, and also&quot; ad infinitum), to overgeneralize it (&quot;Statistics is the study of why nothing in life is certain&quot;), and especially to underrepresent it (&quot;Statistics are used a lot in the worlds of business, politics, and technology,&quot; with the implication that no other fields use statistics &quot;a lot.&quot;)
*Etymology
**Does anyone have any interesting stories about the etymology of statistics? Or the history of statistics as it relates to its etymology? When did the word itself come into popular use? I find the fact that its modern derivation is German in origin to be particularly amusing.
*History
**The history should be 4 paragraphs at most, in my opinion, for two reasons. First is that this book, while attempting to encompass many facets of statistics, is more primarily concerned with the mathematical treatment of it - in short, this is not the History of Statistics book. (And there are many good references for its history.) Secondly, most of the concepts to be covered in this book have been discovered and enumerated in the past 200 years, suggesting that the topic's history is not so illustrious.
**Also, these paragraphs should focus less on the details of the concepts, and more on what particular aspects of statistics were being advanced at this time.
***Good Example - &quot;In the 1860s, British scientist '''Francis Galton''' began using statistics to study hereditary traits, and helped form the concept of ''regression'' to more accurately identify and predict the relationships between things.&quot;
**Paragraph 1 - Pre-1600 - Summarize all statistical efforts prior to the modern adoption of statistics in the 17th century. My own personal suggestion would be to focus on the taxation and collection efforts of the ancient world, with a culmination in the [[Domesday Book]].
**Paragraph 2 - 1600-1800, Early efforts to modernize statistics: Graunt, Pascal, Bernoulli, Bayes.
**Paragraph 3 - 1800 - 1900, Gauss, LaPlace, Galton, the bell curve, Social Statistics
**Paragraph 4 - modern day advances, Pearson, Spearman, Fisher, Neyman
**&quot;For additional reading, consider Stephen Stigler's '''Statistics on the Table: The History of Statistical Concepts and Methods'''.&quot;

*Statistics as a subset of mathematics
**By this I mean we should also explain that statistics is a lead in to many modern mathematical concepts: probability, distribution, samples, surveys, the bell curve, estimation, and data analysis. We shouldn't try to get into too many practical applications (that's covered in a later part of the introduction), nor should we get bogged down in definitions or examples. It should be sufficient to say that in answering the question &quot;What is statistics?&quot;, part of the answer is &quot;Statistics is an important part of mathematics.&quot;
*Up Ahead
**Just like it says, telling them what lays ahead within the Introduction chapter. Also, what's the deal with navigation within the Wikibooks? Is there some sort of navigation code available? Because right now all of these sections are just dead ends from the book perspective.[[User:Kthejoker|Kthejoker]] 17:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

Sorry to say this, but the current text is valueless. J. Morgan 6 Feb 2006

The section currently says:

:Some made-up examples of ordinal scales are &lt;0,1,2&gt; representing &lt;peaceful,threatened,at war&gt;, &lt;A,B,C,D&gt; representing &lt;black,brown,yellow,white&gt;, and &lt;-10,-9,-8&gt; representing &lt;circle,pentagon,triangle&gt;. Note that in these examples, the exact difference between [peaceful] from [threatened] was not important in determining that the next rank is [at war]; it is only important that [peaceful] is stronger than [threatened] in the same way that [threatened] is stronger than [at war].

How are the four colours '''''ordinal'''''?  I can't see how they are supposed to be ranked data at all. [[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]] ([[User talk:Jimbotyson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jimbotyson|contribs]]) 11:11, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

I removed the examples about planar objects, colours and peace and war and replaced it with an example of a Likert scale to illustrate the notion of rank.  I think this is clearer.

These beats, basslines, hooks, and other assorted bits of music are best taken along with other, more varied sounds that you record yourself, but for the purposes of learning how to use GarageBand, your first project will be composed exclusively from loops.

[[File:Loop_bank.jpg|700px|center]]

# This column is a filter for all the loops. You can click on the buttons to filter the loops out that you want. In this case 'Urban Bass' loops which show up on the right side of the panel.
# In this column you can see if a loop is a midi track or an actual recording. The loops with green icons are midi and the ones with blue icons are actual recordings.
# This column shows the name and also the description of the loop.
# This column shows the original tempo of the loop. When your project is a different tempo, the loop will adjust to it. If the tempos of your project and the loop differ greatly, the loop might not sound very good.
# In this column you can find the key of the loop. In case you do not know the meaning of key, use loops from the same key and they are likely going to sound nice together. Still you can use a mix of keys and this will make your song sound more experimental.
# This column shows the length of the loop in beats.
# You can also use the search function to search for loops.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Very good try for the modern greek language, as is my native language i ll try to help you and correct if you have any mistake ;)

== Infinitive ==

All sources on Greek grammar agree in that the infinitive does not exist in Modern Greek. The Greek word απαρέμφατο for infinitive is used only for ancient Greek. [[User:70.52.2.61|70.52.2.61]] 19:14, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== Accent ==

''Every Greek word has an accent on one syllable'': Enklitic forms, articles, and other short words like και are unstressed. In fact, the accent on από is there for historical reasons, because the word is unstressed. [[User:70.52.2.61|70.52.2.61]] 14:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

Hi 70.52.2.61 -- Thanks very much for your help! I edited the section about constructions with να a little more, to explain the aorist and progressive; I hope I didn't reintroduce any more mistakes :-) --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:14, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

==Introducing the letters==

I think it would be easier to introduce the letters using the capital forms rather than the small ones (or both together).  That way, many more of them look just like Latin letters, and have pretty much the same sounds:  A, E, Z, I, K, M, N, O, T. --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 20:43, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:Hi -- Thanks for your help and suggestions! On this point, however, I disagree with you. Many of the lowercase letters are also immediately recognizable to English speakers, and since writing is almost all lowercase normally, it seems better to me to teach the lowercase letters first.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 07:07, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

==The sound of kappa==

You say that kappa has the same sound as in English.  That is more or less true (though Greek k isn't aspirated) before the sounds a/o/u, but not before e/i, where Greek k is palatalized, almost like kj.  So it is unfortunate that your first few words include και, which doesn't sound much like &quot;keh&quot; in English. If you must have κ in your first line of words, how about κάτω, κότα, άκου? --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 20:43, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
:Good suggestion -- done! --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 07:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

==Greek words in English==

I've added the comment about 10% to 20% of English words being of greek origin, you can see the Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_words_of_Greek_origin and the ongoing discussion about this issue.

==We need charts==
There should be a section on noun declensions, and how each is declined along and there should be a big chart to describe regular 'ω' verbs and how they are conjugated in each mood, tense, and voice. But I don't know enough modern greek to do it.</text>

      <comment>/* Nemonic for trig identities */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is out of order! The link is wrong at the bottom

[[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] This page could do with a few graphs and maybe a few different explanations of why the identities exist (i.e., unit circle example of x^2 + y^2 = 1 and addition of opp/hyp instead of A/C off the top of my head). I'll get started on the explanations a little later, but the graphs are out of my hands. If whoever added the previous trigonometric function graphs could help out here, that would be great.

*Secondary Note: Link at bottom fixed.

==Misleading page name &amp; Merger proposal==

The page name &quot;Using fundamental identities&quot; implies that the page will show examples of how to use them.  Instead, it just lists the fundamental identities and in one case derives it.  As the page stands now, I think a better page name would be &quot;Fundamental identities&quot;.

Also, I think this list of identities should appear earlier in the book -- I think it would be a good idea to merge this page into the page entitled Trigonometric Identities, which currently does nothing more than define &quot;identity&quot;.  [[User:Douglas W. Mitchell|Douglas W. Mitchell]] ([[User talk:Douglas W. Mitchell|talk]]) 16:09, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

== Nemonic for trig identities ==

I know Soh-Cah-Toa is the popular one today; but I wonder if possibly others should be given in case some finds one easier than the another.  Not everyone will find the same nemonic works for them.

For instance, the one I learned gives the formulas for all 6 identities: Sin, Cos, Tan, Cot, Sec, Csc  and is:  oh ah oh-ah ah-oh ha ho;  where for example the spoken 'oh' is for o/h -and- 'oh-ah' is oh over ah or o/a.

Just the 1st 3 are easy to say; oh ah oh-ah.  Saying all six is not as easy for some people.  You need to practice saying it for some 10-15 min.  But I still remember it after 45 years and personally prefer it.  I am sure there must be others.

&lt;tt&gt;
mystring = StrConv(mystring, vbProperCase)&lt;/tt&gt;

e.g. where the original value of mystring was &quot;HELLO&quot;, the new value of mystring will be &quot;Hello&quot;.

== Mathematical Functions ==
===Abs===

Returns the absolute value of a number

Usage

Abs(number)

Example

msgbox &quot;The absolute value of -4 is &quot; &amp; abs(-4)

Important note!

The Abs function only accepts numbers.  Non-numeric values generate an error.

===Cos===

Returns the cosine of a number

Usage

Cos(integer)

Example

msgbox &quot;The cosine of 4 is &quot; &amp; cos(4)

Important note!

The input angle for all VB trigometric functions should be in [[w:radian|radians]]. To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by pi / 180.

===Sin===

Returns the sine of a number

Usage

Sin(integer)

Example

msgbox &quot;The sine of 4 is &quot; &amp; sin(4)

Important note!

The input angle for all VB trigometric functions should be in radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by pi / 180.

===Tan===

Returns the tangent of an angle

Usage

Tan(integer)

Example

msgbox &quot;The tangent of 4 is &quot; &amp; tan(4)

Important note!

The input angle for all VB trigometric functions  should be in radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by pi / 180.

===Val===

Returns the numeric value of a string

Uses &quot;.&quot; as decimal separator. ( It does not depend on the Regional Settings ) 

Usage

Val(string)

Example

&lt;code&gt;Val(&quot;5&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value will be 5

&lt;code&gt;Val(&quot;10.6&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value will be 10.6

&lt;code&gt;Val(&quot;Hello World&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value will be 0 (zero)

&lt;code&gt;txtOutput.Text = Val(txtNumber1.Text) * Val(txtNumber2.Text)&lt;/code&gt;

The text box txtOutput will contain the product of the numbers in the txtNumber1 and txtNumber2 text boxes. If either of the text boxes contains a value that cannot be evaluated to a number then the output will be 0 (zero).

===Rnd===

Returns a floating point number less than 1 but greater than or equal to 0.

Usage

&lt;code&gt;Rnd[(&lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt;)]&lt;/code&gt;

You can change the seed the random number generator uses by providing a value as a parameter e.g. Rnd(500) will use the number 500 as the seed in generating random numbers.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you provide a value less than zero then the same number will be returned by the Rnd() function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A value of zero will return the most recently generated random number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing no value will generate the next random number in the sequence.
&lt;li&gt;Providing a positive number will generate the next random number in the sequence using &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; as a seed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Example

&lt;code&gt;myvar = Rnd() * 10&lt;/code&gt;

myvar will become a random number between 0 and 10.

&lt;code&gt;myvar = (Rnd() * 15) + 25&lt;/code&gt;

myvar will become a random number between 25 and 40.

&lt;code&gt;myvar = (Rnd(12345) * 50) - 25&lt;/code&gt;

myvar will become a random number between -25 and 25 and 12345 will be used as the seed to generate this number.

===Int===

Returns the integer portion of a number.

Usage

Int(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)

Where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number to return

Example

&lt;code&gt;Int(10)&lt;/code&gt;

Returns 10

&lt;code&gt;Int(5.1)&lt;/code&gt;

Returns 5

&lt;code&gt;Int(5.86)&lt;/code&gt;

Returns 5

&lt;code&gt;MsgBox &quot;The integer portion of &quot; &amp; myvar &amp; &quot; is &quot; &amp; Int(myvar) &amp; &quot;.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

NOTE: No rounding will be performed, the decimal portion of the number will simply be removed. If you want to round a number to the nearest whole integer then use CInt. One interesting point to remember about CInt is that if the decimal portion of the number is exactly .5 then it will be rounded down if the number is odd and rounded up if it is even. For example CInt(1.5) and CInt(2.5) will both return 2.

== Input and output ==

===MsgBox===

Displays a message box

Usage

MsgBox prompt,buttons,title,helpfile,context

where
prompt = the text displayed on the message box
buttons = combination of keywords to set out the layout of buttons and icons on the message box
title = the title displayed in the message box titlebar

Where the output from the message box is being assigned to a value (such as when there is a choice to be made, use parenthesis thus:

string=MsgBox (prompt,buttons,title,helpfile,context)

If no title is defined, the program name will be used instead. Button combination defaults to vbOKOnly if none is defined, and no icon will be displayed.

Button Combinations

vbOKOnly
vbOKCancel
vbAbortRetryIgnore
vbYesNoCancel
vbYesNo
vbRetryCancel

Icon Display

vbCritical
vbQuestion
vbExclamation
vbInformation

Default Button

vbDefaultButton1
vbDefaultButton2
vbDefaultButton3
vbDefaultButton4


''Examples''

MsgBox &quot;An error has occurred!&quot;,vbExclamation,&quot;Error&quot;

''Note that since the message is fixed, quotation marks have been used.''

Response=MsgBox(&quot;Yes or no?&quot;,vbYesNo + vbQuestion,&quot;Choose one&quot;)

''Note the parenthesis and how the vbYesNo and vbQuestion constants have been combined''

MsgBox &quot;An error has occurred on line &quot; &amp; lineno, vbExclamation, &quot;Error&quot;

===InputBox===

Displays a simple input box for user to enter data

''Usage''

Variable=InputBox(Prompt,Title)

Variable = variable to which the input value will be stored
Prompt = text displayed to the user in the input box
Title = title of the input box

Examples

myint=InputBox(&quot;Enter a number&quot;,&quot;Enter a number&quot;)

== Date and Time ==

===Date===

Returns or sets the current system date

Example

MsgBox &quot;Today 's date is &quot; &amp; Date &amp; &quot;.&quot;

===Time===

Returns or sets the current system time

Example

MsgBox &quot;The time now is &quot; &amp; Time &amp; &quot;.&quot;


''Sidenote: be wary of changing date and time in your program. Many other programs will depend upon the system's date and time being set correctly, so altering it could have a knock on effect. Use date and time changes sparingly, and notify the user if this is being done.''

===Timer===

Returns the number of seconds since midnight

Example

NumHrs=Int(Timer / 3600)
MsgBox &quot;Currently in hour &quot; &amp; NumHrs

===WeekdayName===

Returns the name of a day of the week

Usage

WeekdayName(x,FirstDayOfWeek)

x = integer between 1 and 7
FirstDayOfWeek (OPTIONAL) = the day counted as the first in the week. The default is Sunday.

Example

DayName=WeekdayName(i,vbMonday)

==Miscellaneous==
===IsNull===
Returns true if an expression is null and false otherwise.

Example:
 If IsNull(vntMyVariantVar) Then
     Debug.Print &quot;vntMyVariantVar is null&quot;
 Else
     Debug.Print &quot;vntMyVariantVar is NOT null&quot;
 End If

== File Handling ==
===Open===
Open &quot;&quot; &amp; namefile&amp; &quot;.dat&quot; For Binary As #ff

== Selection ==

'''If... Then... Else...'''
Performs selection based upon criteria. A cornerstone of any VB program.

'Usage'

Single Line Selection

&lt;pre&gt;
If condition Then action&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that only one line can be used with this style of statement

Multi Line Selection

&lt;pre&gt;If condition Then

[code to execute if condition is true]

EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

Using Else

&lt;pre&gt;If condition Then

[code to execute if condition is true]

Else

[code to execute if condition is false]

EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

Condition is a condition which must be met for the code within the statement to be executed. It can make use of the modifiers AND, NOT, OR and XOR (e.g. x=4 AND y &gt; 6). See also the Examples section.

===Examples===

''Simple one-line selection:''
&lt;pre&gt;If x &lt; 10 then MsgBox &quot;The number is below 10&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

''Slightly more complex one-line selection, using the AND modifier to check two conditions at one time.''
&lt;pre&gt;If x &gt; 10 AND x &lt; 20 then MsgBox &quot;The number is between 10 and 20&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

''Simple multi-line selection. The code between the If... and EndIf statements will be executed only if the condition is met.''
&lt;pre&gt;If Date = 25/12/2006 Then
    MsgBox &quot;The date is Christmas Day&quot;
    Call ChristmasDay
EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

''Using the Else statement. If the variable i is over 4, the program will exit the subroutine. Otherwise, it will go to the label SaveFile.''
&lt;pre&gt;If i &gt; 4 Then
    Exit Sub
Else
    Goto SaveFile
EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

''Two If... Endif statements are used, one nested within the other. If i is 6 or 7, the code between the inside If...Endif statements is executed. Then if i=7 the first message box will be shown; otherwise (i.e. if i=6) the other will be displayed. For both cases, the final message box will be shown. When nesting selection statements, it's often a good idea to indent them as shown here.''
&lt;pre&gt;If i = 6 OR i = 7 Then
   If i = 7 Then
       MsgBox &quot;Today is Sunday&quot;
   Else
       MsgBox &quot;Today is Saturday&quot;
   EndIf
   MsgBox &quot;Today is the Weekend&quot;
EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

The normal translation of ''I want to write'' is ''θέλω να γράψω''. I think that the [[w:grammatical aspect]]s should be learned together with the subordinate cluases.
In general, there are many mistakes in this book. Before giving an example, ask a native speaker or look the sentence up in Google if it is really used that way. [[User:70.52.2.61|70.52.2.61]] 20:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks for the correction! I've been soliciting help from native speakers, and am grateful for your work! --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:13, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

=cases=
I've changed the terminology for the cases back from nom/gen/acc/voc to subj/gen/obj/voc. I would like to minimize the number of new grammatical terms that the reader has to learn, and &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot; will already be familiar from English grammar. I've also rearranged things a little so that the genitive isn't presented until lesson 3, and the vocative until lesson 4. Again, the idea is to avoid overwhelming the reader.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:15, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

=about over-simplification=
I very much appreciate your effort (you started the whole thing in the first place), but I still cannot understand your over-simplification approach. The cases should be always referred to with their proper names.

It's one thing to slowly introduce Greek and another thing to slowly introduce Grammar itself!

Now in terms of the order of the chapters, perhaps we should reconsider it all along. Here is a link that I find very useful, from the German-Hellenic School of Greece (it is in Greek):

http://www3.ellinogermaniki.gr/artemisTool/grammar/

In terms of a native speaker pronunciation, although I'm a native speaker myself, there is some excellent work already done in Φιλογλωσσία

http://www.xanthi.ilsp.gr/filog/ch1/alphabet/alphabet.asp

In general their whole course material is excellent and we can take an example from there about the structure of these lessons.

== Speed ==

Your explanations are good, but I think you are trying to teach too much in one lesson. I have studied Greek for almost one year at university now, I can manage everyday situations without spending a lot of time thinking of words and yet I still don't know some of the grammar concepts or vocabulary introduced in this lesson - which is supposed to be for people who have only done one lesson of Greek so far?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I believe the amount of things you introduce in one lesson force students to spend too much time on one lesson. They will feel like they never progress, they will get frustrated and stop learning Greek. Learning a language in self-study isn't easy in any case, but this is bound to discourage even avid language learners. Perhaps you might want to have a look at a new approach in language courses that I developed and that I'd now like to introduce to Wikibook creators: see [[Bite-sized language lessons]] . You may also want to read the Wikibook on language-course creation. This is not to diminish the work you have obviously put in this, I just think that precisely because of the effort involved, you should make sure that learners can get the most out of these lessons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Gender ==
The ος ending is described for masculine nouns, which helps us recognize masculine nouns. However the same is not done for feminine and neutral. That would be appreciated.

== Modern pronunciation ==
I was taught that in the modern language the characters μ, and ν were pronounced &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; (etc. for other letters), not &quot;mu&quot; and &quot;nu&quot; as seems to be implied on this page. Am I missing something here? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 18:04, 20 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

If you have the time it would be great if you could simplify this page a tad, just because its a children's book. I would do it myself, but i find it works out better if the original author does it! 
Thanks,     [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 22:26 4 February, 2006
*&lt;s&gt;I guess that's me, I've written most of it.  I realise it's a bit complicated, but I just didn't have the time to simplify it at the time of writing.  I will do that when I get the time, and of course I don't mind if anyone else does it.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 06:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

=The genitive=
What English expresses using possessives or the presposition &quot;of,&quot; Greek expresses using the genitive case. The following example shows the noun σκύλος in all the subject, genitive, and object cases.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο σκύλος
| the dog (subject form) 
| οι σκύλοι
| the dogs (subject form) 
|-
| του σκύλου
| of the dog (genitive form) 
| των σκύλων
| of the dogs (genitive form) 
|-
| τον σκύλο
| the dog (object form) 
| τους σκύλους
| the dogs (object form) 
|-
|}

Example:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το πόδι του σκύλου
| the dog's foot (literally, the foot of the dog)
|}

The genitive plural is easy, because it's always formed with -ων, and the article is always των.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| τα πόδια των σκύλων
| the dogs' feet
|}

The genitive singular is formed according to a greater variety of patterns, of which three of the most important are shown here:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο σκύλος
| του σκύλου
|-
| η ώρα
| της ώρας
|-
| το βιβλίο
| του βιβλίου
|-
| το παιδί
| του παιδιού
|}


== Accentuation ==

In some nouns, when the antepenult is accented, the genitive is accented at the penult and when the penult is accented the genitive is accented at the ultimate. There is a set of rules to distinguish in which cases this happens. Most of the rules derive from Ancient Greek and have to do with either long and short vowels or Ancient Greek declensions. This is an issue with Modern Greek itself, since most of the nuances of Ancient Greek are lost in Modern Greek. People in most cases put the accent intuitively and at some instances even native speakers have great difficulty in accentuating correctly. This is why it is often said that in order to properly speak Modern Greek, one has to have at least a basic level of Ancient Greek.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| τα πόδια των ανθρώπων ('''ά'''νθρωπος/ανθρ'''ώ'''πων)
| the men's feet (genitive plural)
|-
| τα πόδια του ανθρώπου ('''ά'''νθρωπος/ανθρ'''ώ'''που)
| the man's feet (genitive singular)
|-
| τα πόδια των ανδρών ('''ά'''νδρας/ανδρ'''ώ'''ν)
| the men's feet (genitive plural)
|-
| '''but'''
|-
| τα πόδια των πατέρων (πατ'''έ'''ρας/πατ'''έ'''ρων)
| the fathers' feet
|-
| τα πόδια του άνδρα ('''ά'''νδρας/'''ά'''νδρα)
| the man's feet (genitive singular)
|}

The accent can also advance two positions, from antepenult to ultimate between nominative plural and genitive plural. The noun το χάδι (the caress) presents the following declensions:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το χ'''ά'''δι
| τα χ'''ά'''δια
|-
| του χαδι'''ού'''
| των χαδι'''ώ'''ν
|-
| το χ'''ά'''δι
| τα χ'''ά'''δια
|}

==Genitive indefinite article==
The following list shows the indefinite article in all three of the cases covered so far:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ένας
| ''one,'' masculine subject
|-
| ενός
| ''of one,'' masculine genitive
|-
| έναν
| ''one,'' masculine object
|-
|-
| μία or μια
| ''one,'' feminine subject
|-
| μίας or μιας
| ''of one,'' feminine genitive
|-
| μία or μια
| ''one,'' feminine object
|-
|-
| ένα
| ''one,'' neuter subject
|-
| ενός
| ''of one,'' neuter genitive
|-
| ένα
| ''one,'' neuter object
|-
|}

=Genitive pronouns=
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| μου
| μας
|-
| σου
| σας
|-
| του, της, του
| τους
|}

When indicating possession, the genitive pronoun follows the noun it modifies.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Στην υγειά σας!
| To your health (Cheers!)
|-
| το βιβλίο μου
| my book
|-
| Το κεφάλι του είναι μεγάλο.
| His head is big.

When greeting a person you either say ''Γεια σας'' (the polite plural) or ''Γεια σου'' (friendly address, more often than not the ''σου'' is omitted). Γεια is a short form for υγεία (health → &quot;hygiene&quot;). For a group of people except the abovementioned ''Γεια σας'', the salutation ''Χαίρετε'' (rejoice) is also utilized.

When a noun followed by a possessive pronoun has the accent on the third syllable from the end, it gets a second accent on the final syllable:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το γόνατό μου
| my knee
|}

In Greek, rather than saying that you like something, you say that it is pleasing to you, using the verb αρέσω:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Μού αρέσει το αυτοκίνητο.
| I like the car (lit. &quot;The car is pleasing to me.&quot;)
|}

This form is a remnant of the ancient dative case (δοτική πτώση). Something similar happens with certain prepositions (see below).

=Prepositions=
The following are some common prepositions:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| με
| with, by means of
|-
| μαζί με
| together with
|-
| χωρίς
| without
|-
| για
| for
|-
| από
| from (moving away from)
|-
| σε, εις
| in, at, on, moving to
|-
| μέσα σε
| into
|- 
| πάνω σε
| on
|-
| πάνω από
| above, over 
|-
| κάτω από
| below, under
|-
| ύστερα από
| after
|-
| πρίν
| before (~&quot;pre-&quot;)
|-
| πρό
| before, in front of (~&quot;proactive&quot;)
|-
| ενάντια σε
| against
|-
| εναντίον
| against
|-
| εκ, εξ
| from, out of (~&quot;ex-wife&quot;)
|}

Examples:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Το κλειδί της Άννας είναι κάτω από το τραπέζι.
| Anna's key is under the table.
|-
| Είμαι από την Αμερική.
| I'm from America.
|}

If the preposition ''σε'' is followed by a definite article, the joint form στο(ν)/στη(ν)/στο (σε plus το(ν)/τη(ν)/το) is used:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Το κλειδί της Άννας είναι στο τραπέζι.
| Anna's key is on the table.
|-
| Ο Παύλος είναι στο θεάτρο.
| Paul is at the theater.
|}

As a remnant of ancient Greek's more complex case system, certain prepositions (πρό, εναντίον, εκ/εξ) are supposed to take the genitive case rather than the object (accusative) case. In these constructions, the genitive is really being used as the dative (indirect object) case, as in the use of the genitive with the verb αρέσω. This is a usage that is dying out, and a beginner doesn't need to worry about it too much. There are, however, certain fixed phrases that will seem inexplicable otherwise:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| πρό Χριστού, π.Χ.
| before Christ
|-
| εν τάξει
| OK
|}

==Prepositions used as prefixes==

It is extremely common for Greek verbs to be formed by adding a preposition as a prefix to a simpler verb. However, the preposition
may be in a different form than the ones given above, e.g., εις rather than σε. A common prefix is συν-/συμ-, from the ancient Greek preposition συν, ''with, together.'' Two other suffixes based on ancient Greek prepositions are δια, ''for, because of, relating to'', and υπό, ''under'' (~&quot;hypodermic&quot;).
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|-
| βάλλω
| to shoot; in ancient Greek, to throw
|-
| '''εισ'''βάλλω
| to invade: σε (modern εις)+βάλλω, 'throw in'
|-

| to contribute to: συν+βάλλω σε, 'throw together'
|-
| '''εκ'''βάλλω
| to debouch
|-

|-
| '''δια'''λείπω
| to be intermittent (also ''διάλειψη'' = lapse of memory)
|-
| '''υπο'''λείπομαι (passive)

|}

|-
| Είναι η μητέρα της Αννας.
| She's Anna's mother.
|-
| Είναι το σπίτι των αδελφών.
| It's the brothers' house.
|}

Note that in Greek, a definite article is used with a person's name.

=Grimm's law=
The words ''πατέρας'' and ''μητέρα'' are actually closely related to the English words ''mother'' and ''father.'' When English and Greek words are derived from the same root in their common ancestral language, Indo-European, the consonants are related as follows:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| π
| τ
| κ
| β
| δ
| γ
| φ
| θ
| χ
|-
| f
| th
| h
| p
| t
| k
| b
| d
| g
|}

This is known as Grimm's law (after a linguist from the same family that collected the Grimm's fairy tales).
Sometimes it can help you to learn words in Greek.

Examples:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| δύο
| τρία
| πόδι
|-
| two
| three
| foot
|}

In some cases, the Greek word that's cognate to the English one is ancient rather than modern. For example, ''brother'' corresponds to the ancient ''φρατήρ'' (e.g. &quot;fraternity&quot;), not the modern ''αδελφός'', and ''door'' to the ancient ''θύρα'' rather than modern ''πόρτα'' (which is a loan from italian).

=Nouns in -ας and -ης=

[[Image:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|400px|ο αστροναύτης]]

Other than -ος, the most common endings for masculine nouns are -ας and -ης.

Ο πατέρας, the father:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| subject
| ο πατέρας
| οι πατέρες
|-
| genitive
| του πατέρα
| των πατέρων
|-
| object
| τον πατέρα
| τους πατέρες
|}

Ο μαθητής, the student, pupil:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| subject
| ο μαθητής
| οι μαθητές
|-
| genitive
| του μαθητή
| των μαθητών
|-
| object
| το μαθητή
| τους μαθητές
|-
|}

These endings are particularly common in nouns referring to professions, e.g., ο αστροναύτης, the astronaut.

|-
| Ο βασιλιάς είναι πλούσιος.
| The king is rich.
|-
| Ο δάσκαλος έχει τριάντα μαθητές
| The teacher has 30 students.
|}

=The letter ''ν'' at the end of a word=

You might have noticed above that while both ο πατέρας and ο μαθητής are masculine nouns, the definite article at the accusative (object) case is different:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το'''ν''' πατέρα
|-
| το μαθητή
|} 

There is a general rule that applies not only to the definite article but to most words ending with a ''ν''. According to this rule if the '''next''' word does '''not''' start with a vowel or any of the voiceless plosives (''κ, π, τ, ξ, ψ'') then the ''ν'' is often omitted. 

Thus, the avoidance of complex consonant combinations helps in producing a smooth flow of speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Granny Knot is basically an incorrectly tied [[Scouting/Knots/Bends/Reef knot|Reef knot]].  On the Reef Knot page is a blue and red graphic representing that knot.  A Granny Knot is similar, except for one thing.

In a Reef Knot, the two blue ends cross underneath the red loop on the right side and the two red ends cross over the blue loop on the left side of the knot.  In a Granny Knot, the top blue end would be over the red loop on the right side and the top red end would be under the blue loop on the left side of the knot.

Also, the red rope part at the top of the knot would cross over the blue part of the rope, rather than under it.

The Reef Knot is criticized as an unstable knot.  The Granny Knot is much, much more unstable and should never be used for any purpose.

:'''Definition'''
:The '''acrostic''' in Greek, ''Ichthys'', is &quot;Jesus-Christ-Of God-Son-Savior. '''Jesus:''' The Hebrew &quot;Joshua&quot; or Aramaic&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yeshua,&quot; means &quot;God is Salvation.&quot; '''Christ:''' Being equal to the Hebrew/Aramaic word &quot;Messiah,&quot; means the&lt;br&gt;Sent One, the Anointed of God. The word points to redemption and reconciliation between God and man. '''Of God:'''&lt;br&gt;Reminds Christians of the deity of Christ. Christ is triune [[Image:ICHTHYS.jpg|left]]with God and the Holy Spirit. Together &lt;br&gt;the 3 are 1 God with 3 differing roles. &quot;Of God&quot; signifies that God is the Head of Christ. God is&lt;br&gt; Father, Christ is Son. '''Son:''' As heir, Jesus is not inferior to the Father, but has a different role in&lt;br&gt; the redemption of humanity. The Son is the heir of the Father, and God has given all power and authority to Jesus.&lt;br&gt; As Son and heir, Jesus was obedient to God the Father. '''Savior:''' Jesus' death on the cross for the redemption of&lt;br&gt;all heaven and earth represents the culmination of the obedience of Jesus towards God the Father. Jesus provides&lt;br&gt;salvation based on His sacrificial broken body and blood at the cross to everyone who trusts in His righteous life.&lt;br&gt;Jesus lays claim as rightful God of the New Covenant who can die for sin, judge sin, yet be blameless from sin.

==History==
The fish was well known in ancient times as a symbol of fertility. The interlocking arcs have become a modern day Christian amulet, even the subject of various parodies. The exact date or reason for the Christian church assimilating the simple art form and the soteriological formula behind it, is not known. There is no clear evidence for the use of the IXTHYS acrostic in early Christianity much before the late second century C.E. The New Testament contains many details about fish and fishermen, much more than in the Old Testament. The origin of ''ichthys'' is thus closely related to the idea of “fishers of men,” baptism of water, dividing the fish and loaves, or the last meal on the shore which enumerated the catch of 153 fish. Usage is described as a pointer to secret meetings during the period of persecution, a primitive password or handshake in the sand where when two meet each one supplies an arc, or simply a theological statement inscribed under trying circumstances and signifying a certain perseverance above all else. The earliest known reference in Christian literature (ca. 193 C.E.) quotes Tertullian, De Baptismo 1.3, &quot;we, little fishes, after the image of our &amp;Iota;&amp;Chi;&amp;Theta;&amp;Upsilon;&amp;Sigma;, Jesus Christ, are born in the water,&quot; where only the word for fish is written in Greek instead of Latin and so most assuredly alludes to the acronym for fish, IXTHYS. 

A grave-yard remains something of a broken record of the church to which it belongs. The catacombs exhibit many such monumental inscriptions, Greek and Latin, or oddly mixed (Latin words in Greek uncial characters), often rudely written, of bad spelling, mutilated, and almost illegible, with and without symbolical figures. Christianity appealed to the poor and illiterate of the time. Fish imagery was very popular in early Christianity, and is mentioned in patristic literature. Clement of Alexandria (ca. 202 C.E.) sanctions the use of the image as art in the form of a seal for a signet ring in Paedogogus 3.11. The popular motif found on Christian gems of the later third century contains a pair of fish flanking an anchor or a cross-like object, also, fish and anchors are drawn beside funerary inscriptions datable at the earliest to the late second or early third centuries. The acrostic and fish symbols are found in tombs beneath the church of San Sebastiano, Rome, but, while highly probable, it's not universally accepted that these tombs are Christian. They date from the late second/early third century as well. Fish imagery from this period also occurs in the catacombs, the best known example being a crude painting commonly called the &quot;Eucharist fish&quot; showing a basket of five loaves of bread on the fish's side in the Lucina crypt in the Catacomb of Callixtus, Rome.[[Image:Fish_bread5.jpg|right|Eucharist fish]]

The acronym for fish is in wide use by the fourth and fifth century C.E., for Augustine relates that “these five greek words” mean &quot;Christ&quot; (Jesus Christ, of God the son, saviour) because, in Augustine’s words, &quot;He was able to remain alive &amp;#8722; that is, without sin &amp;#8722; in the abyss of our mortal condition, in the depths, as it were, of the sea&quot; (City of God 18.23, part of a discussion of Sibylline Oracle 8.217). Many early references to the fish mention baptism and may have foundation in the period use of the term &quot;piscina&quot; when referring to the baptismal font.

The acronym for fish obviously influences a passage in the epitaph of Abercius, an enigmatic Phrygian inscription, now in the Vatican, which probably dates from the late second century.  The inscription is in Greek:&lt;br&gt;
:''My name is Abercius, the disciple of the Holy Shepherd... I followed Paul and everywhere Faith was my leader and she gave me food in every place &amp;#8722; the Fish from the fountain, a mighty Fish and pure which a holy maiden took in her hands and gave to her friends to eat for ever, having goodly wine and giving it mixed with water and also bread...''

Similar language is used in the inscription of one Pectorius, which was found near Autun, France and kept in the museum there.  It has not been accurately dated &amp;#8722; probably third to fourth century.  The inscription has some gaps which must be filled out by conjecture. The first portion seems to be older. Schultze conjectures that it is an old Christian hymn. This inscription is also in Greek, but it's written in a form resembling verse and the first letters of the first five lines spell out the '''acrostic''' IXTHUS:&lt;br&gt;

:1 Thou, the divine child of the heavenly Fish 
:2 Keep pure thy heart among the mortals 
:3 Once thou hast been washed in the fountain of divine waters.&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Refresh thy soul, friend, 
:4 With the ever flowing waters of wealth-giving wisdom. 
:5 Take from the Saviour of saints the honey-sweet food; 
:6 Eat with joy and desire, holding the Fish in thy hands. 
:7 I pray thee, Lord Saviour, satisfy his hunger with the Fish. 
:8 May my mother rest peacefully, I beseech thee, Light of the dead. 
:9 Aschandius, father, my heart's beloved 
:10 With my dearest mother and my brothers 
:11 In the peace of the Fish remember thy Pectorius. 


:Summary (in Modernity)
 
:''Divine race of the heavenly Fish preserve a reverent mind when you partake of the immortal fountain of wondrous waters that springs up among us here. Friend, let your soul be comforted with the ever-flowing waters of treasure-bestowing wisdom. Take the honey-sweet food of the Redeemer of the saints and eat it eagerly, holding the Fish in your hands. Satisfy me thus with the Fish I pray you, My Lord and Savior... be mindful of all those abiding in the peace of the Fish''.&lt;br&gt;
:''Yours, Pectorius''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If I'm not mistaken, this should be 8 lasagne noodles -- two isn't enough for two layers. --[[User:209.242.5.195|209.242.5.195]] 00:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

:I've changed it to read &quot;one package&quot; of noodles, which I realize is a bit vague, but lasagna noodles are commonly sold in packages containing the right amount for a lasagna of this size - here in the US, at least. Anyway, it's better than saying &quot;six,&quot; which it did before I changed it, which couldn't possibly be right, unless it meant &quot;six layers' worth.&quot; [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 22:25, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

Another Italian American recipe.

Please put these in the appropriate place: Italian-American cuisine. 

Italian recipes are always identified by the region, town or village they come from and the inclusion in one dish of both Parmigiano Reggiano ( Emilia-Romagna ) and Mozzarella ( Lazio and Campania ) gives away that this is not a traditional Italian recipe.  But glad you got &quot;Lasagne&quot; right and did not call it &quot;Lasagna&quot; !</text>

== IF statement ==

The if statement executes the command between &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;. If the command returns not 0 then the commands between &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; are executed - otherwise the command between &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fi&lt;/code&gt;.

   if test &quot;${1}&quot; = &quot;red&quot; ; then
     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
   elif test &quot;${1}&quot; = &quot;blue&quot; ; then

   elif [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;blue&quot; ]
   then
     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
   else
     echo &quot;Access granted.&quot;
   fi 

==== Test Syntax Variations ====

Most test commands can be written using more than one syntax. Mastering and consistently using one form may be a programming best-practice, and may be a more efficient use of overall time.

==== String Tests ====

String Tests are performed by the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; command. See &lt;code&gt;help test&lt;/code&gt; for more details. To make scripts look more like other programming languages the synonym &lt;code&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/code&gt; was defined which does exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! | Command
! | Effect
|-
| test &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;red&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;red&quot; ]
| String comparison, true if match.
|-
|test &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;red&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;red&quot; ] 
| String comparison, true if no match.
|-
|test -z &quot;${shvar}&quot;&lt;br&gt;
test  &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;&quot; ]
|        True if null variable.
|-
|test -n &quot;${shvar}&quot;&lt;br&gt;
test  &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ -n &quot;$shvar&quot; ]&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;&quot; ]
|       True if not null variable.
|}

==== Arithmetic tests ====

simple arithmetics can be performed with the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; for more complex arithmetics the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; command exists. See &lt;code&gt;help let&lt;/code&gt; for more details. Note that for &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; command variables don't need to be prefixed with '$' and the statement need to be one argument, use &lt;code&gt;'...'&lt;/code&gt; when there are spaces inside the argument. Like with &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; a synonym - &lt;code&gt;(( ... ))&lt;/code&gt; - was defined to make shell scripts look more like ordinary programs.

==== Boolean tests ====

Boolean arithmetic is performed by a set of operators. It is important to note then the operators execute programs and compare the result codes. Because boolean operators are often combined with &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; command a unifications was created in the form of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ ... ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

|-
|test  -r /tmp &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; test -w /tmp
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ -r /tmp || -w /tmp ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|-
|test ! -x /tmp&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ ! -x /tmp ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| True if the file is not executable

== CASE statement ==

   case &quot;$1&quot; 
   in
     &quot;red&quot;)      echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
                 exit;;
     &quot;blue&quot;)     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
                 exit;;
     &quot;x&quot;|&quot;y&quot;)    echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
                 exit;;
     *)          echo &quot;Access granted.&quot;;;
   esac

== Loop statements ==

   for nvar in 1 2 3 4 5
   do
     echo $nvar
   done 

   for file            # Cycle through command-line arguments.
   do
     echo $file
   done

   while [ &quot;$n&quot; != &quot;Joe&quot; ]     # Or:   until [ &quot;$n&quot; == &quot;Joe&quot; ]
   do
     echo &quot;What's your name?&quot;
     read n
     echo $n
   done

There are &quot;break&quot; and &quot;continue&quot; commands that allow you to exit or skip to
the end of loops as the need arises.

Instead of [] we can use test.
[] requires space after and before the brackets and there should be spaces between arguments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sima==
The part about &quot;Sima&quot; was pretty messy. I cleaned it up a bit, but I don't think it belongs here. It isn't mead; it has no honey in it. Mead by definition has honey in it. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:24.147.141.127|24.147.141.127]] ([[User talk:24.147.141.127|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/24.147.141.127|contribs]])  on 2006-02-06.&lt;/small&gt;

:I agree, Sima isn't mead so perhaps should have its own article. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 08:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

==another recipe==
I havn't made mead for some time, but I used to use apple juice instead of water (500g honey / liter apple juice). You don't need yeast nutrient in this case and it also adds some acidity to make the taste somewhat richer. (This is the internet, so: I'm talking about real, pure apple juice made of apples and nothing else.) [[User:212.202.2.123|212.202.2.123]]
:What you are describing is called a ''cyser''. I agree, they are very nice, and easy to make (easier than a straight mead). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:20, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

==Requests==
Please describe what it is to &quot;rack&quot; and a link to proper airlocks would be nice.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The main characteristics in community acquired pneumonia 
Aim: To evaluate the main characteristics of adult inpatients with community acquired pneumonia  
Methods: We performed a retrospective study using the medical records completed between 1 January-31 December2004. The study group was composed of 333 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 61.6% male. The average age was 56.5±16.9 years. The risk-class was estimated calculating the Fine score.
Results: In study group we found that 6.3% were in class V, 27.6% in class IV, 22.8%in class III, 24.6% in II and18.6% in class I respectively. The general mortality was 3%, 23.8% in class V. An important aspect of the group was their socio-economic status. About 67% of patients had income under  70 euros. An intriguing finding is a relatively high number of patients with blood urea nitrogen over 30 mg/dL. Hepatic disorders were the most frequent among co-morbid illnesses (this could be partially explained by alcohol abuse, 18.3% patients used more than 21 units/week).
Conclusion: There were a high number of low risk patients (I and II risk class) admitted. This situation is explained by low income of the patients. Only 8 out of 21 patients in risk class V were admitted to Intensive Therapy Unit. Despite this class V mortality was 23.8% comparable with anterior studies.</text>

Using the &quot;shift&quot; variable in the subroutine at the end of this page without mentioning it previously in the instructional is confusing.

Make it so...

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onion,(Optionally: 2 Carrots and 2 Celery) finely chopped 
* 3lbs (1.5 kilo) Minced beef
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or crushed
* 1 can (400g) quality chopped plum tomatoes
* 10-15 basil leaves, chopped or torn (or 1 tsp dried basil)
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* 5 crushed black peppercorns (or to taste)
* 1 tsp sea salt (or to taste)
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* (Optionally) 150-200ml red wine
* One pack of lasagne sheets

* 1.5 pints (850ml) [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|béchamel sauce]]

* Finely grated parmesan

== Equipment ==
* One small pan for the bechemel sauce (preferably non-stick)
* One large, deep pan for the ragu
* A shallow oven-proof dish

== Procedure ==

# Heat the olive oil in a heavy base or non-stick pan over a medium-high heat. If the oil browns, turn the heat down.
# Add the onion and fry until golden brown
# Increase heat to high and add the meat and garlic. Fry until brown. Minced/ground beef takes some time to cook well. Fry until there is little moisture left in the pan. If necessary, spoon out any excess fat.
# Add the tomatoes and sugar, cover the pan and lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce.
# Pre-heat the oven to 375f/190c
# Mix the basil, oregano, salt &amp; pepper in to the ragu
# Place a thin layer of ragu in the base of the ovenproof dish and cover with a single layer of pasta sheets. Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the pasta. Repeat this until you run out of meat, making sure that you have enough bechemel sauce left to cover the top layer of pasta.
# Sprinkle the grated parmesan over the top.
# Place the dish in the oven on the top shelf and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the sauce is bubbling.

== Hints &amp; tips ==
* Get good beef. This is the most important part of the dish. The best beef will produce little fat and a great flavour.
* Try using goats cheese and milk for the béchamel sauce. Sainsbury's and Safeways both sell a goat's cheese that's almost like cheddar in consistency. Perfect for béchamel sauce.
* Look for canned tomatoes in 'rich tomato juice'. They're a bit more expensive, but definitely worthwhile
* Fresh basil and pepper are a must.
* Try it with minced lamb

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to PHP ==

PHP started off as a collection of Perl scripts used to aid in the maintaining of personal home pages. Hence, it originally stood for &quot;Personal Home Page.&quot;  However, the language has grown into a huge open source initiative, used by thousands of amateur and professional programmers world wide. It now is officially known as &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor,&quot; which is a recursive acronym (For some strange reason, open source programmers seem to love recursive acronyms).

The reason it is known as a preprocessor and not merely as a processor, is due to the fact that the php files are sent by the webserver to the PHP preprocessor to be processed. the resulting HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), is then sent across the internet to the web browser requesting the php page.

PHP has traditionally been used for adding dynamic content onto previously static webpages; however, due to the rapid development of the language, it is now used for writing command line tools, and now has GTK bindings allowing the programmer to write GUI applications!

Since the beginning of version 5 of PHP, with the inclusion of Zend Engine II as PHP's foundation, PHP now can be used to write Object Oriented applications.

You can download PHP free of charge (as it is an Open Source programming language) from http://www.php.net

      <text xml:space="preserve">As with most programming languages, file handling is very important for storing and retrieving a wide variety of data.

== Opening and Closing Files ==

To open a file, we use the fopen() function. This function takes in two parameters. Firstly, a String containing the name of the file, and secondly, the mode with which to open the file with. It returns a filehandler. e.g. :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $filename = &quot;text.txt&quot;;
 $f = fopen($filename, 'r');
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code assigns the file name of &quot;text.txt&quot; to a variable called $filename. Then it uses the fopen function to open up &quot;text.txt&quot; with 'r' mode (meaning &quot;read mode&quot;) and returns a filehandler to $f.

To close a file, we simply call the fclose() function, and pass it the filehandler. e.g. :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 fclose($f);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Including a File ==
It is very easy, in PHP, to include code (be it PHP or HTML) from one file into another. This is achieved by means of the include() function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 include (&quot;objects.php&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, the PHP code will look within the current directory of the PHP file calling the include function, it will then open the objects.php file, and include its content at of that file at the position of the include() function.

== Writing to a File ==

The procedure for writing to a file is:
# Create a file handler.
# Use the file handler to open up an input stream from a file.
# Write Data to the file handler.
# Close the file handler.

Here is an example of writing two lines of text to a file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $filename = &quot;file.txt&quot;;
 $f = fopen($filename, 'w');
 fputs($f, &quot;Bonjour Madam.\n&quot;);
 fputs($f, &quot;Bonjour Monseur.\n&quot;);
 fclose($f);
&lt;/source&gt;

fputs() is used to write data to the file. It takes 2 variables, firstly, the file handler, and secondly, a String to write to the file handler.

== Reading from a File ==
Reading from a file goes along much the same format as writing to one. The function used to read from a file is fgets() function. Which takes in two variables. Firstly, the filehandler from which to read, and secondly, the amount of data to retrieve.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $filename = &quot;text.txt&quot;;
 $f = fopen($filename, 'r');
 $line = fgets($f, 1024);
 print $line;
 print $total_contents;
 fclose($f);
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code opens up a file, reads the first line of the file, and then displays it. If we wanted to rather read the entire contents of the file into a variable, we could replace the $line=fgets() line with : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  $total_contents = fread($f, filesize($filename));
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Info|This was a Case Study in progress, now linked to by the main page when it is complete. [[User:matt73]] was working on this.}}
== Case Study 1B - C front-end (Lex and Yacc) ==
The purpose of this case study is to give an example of a compiler/interpreter front-end written in C using Lex and Yacc. An interpreter is used since it allows a working program to be created with minimal extra effort (after the construction of the front-end). This code could be developed into a compiler by replacing the last phase with a compiler back-end.

The code is shown in an order which underlines the processes of creating a compiler, so the same file will be shown multiple times as it is developed.

The case study develops an interpreter for Very Tiny Basic, which is specified in the [[Compiler Construction/Case Study 1|Case Study 1]] section of the book.

The following steps shall be taken to complete the interpreter:
*Lexical Analysis
*Syntax Analysis
*Lexical Analysis with Semantics
*Abstract Syntax Trees
*Generating Abstract Syntax Trees
*Interpreting

Many important features of a useful compiler/interpreter have been left out, for brevity and simplicity, including:
*Dealing with Errors
*Optimization

Also some processes do not apply to such a simple language as Very Tiny Basic, for example Name Tables do not apply since only single characters are used to name variables.

'''Requirements'''
*A C compiler 
*[[w:Lex programming tool|Lex]] or equivalent ([[w:Flex lexical analyser|flex]]).
*[[w:Yacc|Yacc]] or equivalent ([[w:GNU bison|bison]]).
*(preferred) The [[w:Make|Make]] utility. 

=== Lexical Analysis ===
The first draft of the lex file identifies different tokens by returning a certain value in the associated C action. For keywords and operators this is simple, however identifiers, values and comments are trickier.

&quot;LET&quot;           {return LET;}
&quot;IF&quot;            {return IF;}

&quot;=&quot;             {return EQUAL;}
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;            {return NEQUAL;}

&lt;/pre&gt;

This file can be processed using one of the following
 lex VTB.l
 flex VTB.l

You may wonder where all those values we returned are coming from. They will be created by Yacc grammar file when it is processed.

There are some differences from the ''Very Tiny Basic - Specification'' in [[Compiler Construction/Case Study 1##Very_Tiny_Basic_-_Specification|Case Study 1]], for instance MULT and DIV in place of MULDIV. This is because we need to know the difference between the two. LineNumber and WholeNumber are lexically identical, and so cannot be separated at this time. Defining the use and category of tokens is left until the next stage.

=== Lexical Analysis with Semantics ===
In this version of the lexer, the header file generated by yacc/bison is included. The header file defines the return values and the union that is used to store the semantic values of tokens. This was created according to the ''%token'' declarations and the ''%union'' part of the grammar file. The lexer now extracts values from some types of tokens, and store the values in the ''yylval'' union.

=== Abstract Syntax Trees ===
[[wikipedia:Abstract syntax tree|Abstract syntax trees]] are an Intermediate Representation of the code that are created in memory using data structures. The grammatical structure of the language, which has already been defined and has been written down as a YACC grammar file, is translated into a tree structure. Using YACC &amp; C, this means that most grammar rules and tokens become nodes. Comments are an example of what is not put in the tree.

The grouping of operands is clear within the structure, so tokens such as parentheses do not have to be present in the tree. The same applies to tokens which end blocks of code. This is possible because the rules in the grammar file can use these tokens create the tree in the correct shape. 

''Illustration of grouping in abstract syntax trees''
 (1+3)*4     1+3*4
   
   *            +
  / \          / \
 4   +        1   *
    / \          / \
   1   3        3   4

In this interpreter the Primary/Secondary expression structures could be discarded by collapsing them. This would add complexity to the code, so it is currently not implemented. Rem statements are also kept (without the comment text) since the definition of VTB implies that they are a valid target for Goto. In fact, a goto to a non-existent line is undefined, so this interpreter will issue an error.

==== absyn.h ====
Using pointers and dynamic allocation is a must for the tree structure, or else it would be infinite in size and thus use too many resources (think about it). In order to keep the code nice and neat,

==== Makefile ====
Since we are working with standard *nix tools and the normal build system used on *nix is make, it is useful to write a Makefile for the interpreter. Keep in mind that most compilers/interpreters are very large and need a more advanced build system than this example. They may require CVS, autoconf and many makefiles distributed across different directories. Since this one only uses five files, it is quite trivial.

RELEASE_LDFLAGS :=

#Comment out following line if you need optimization ;-)
DEBUG := YES

#Comment out following line if you're not using Windows/Dos
POSTFIX := .exe

ifeq (YES, ${DEBUG})
   CFLAGS       := ${DEBUG_CFLAGS}
   LDFLAGS      := ${DEBUG_LDFLAGS}

   CFLAGS       := ${RELEASE_CFLAGS}
   LDFLAGS      := ${RELEASE_LDFLAGS}
endif

.PHONY : all clean

=== Generating Abstract Syntax Trees ===
'''VTB.y''' - Version 2
The lexer is now giving values for tokens and the abstract syntax tree structure has been written. Next the grammar file is updated to construct the trees from what the rules and semantic values. All the tree node types are added to the union declaration. Rules must be given types and return the correct type.

'''This tutorial needs some more explaining as to what is going (and why) in section 4.'''

In the following tutorial, you will use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;polygon mesh
&lt;li&gt;face loop cutting
&lt;li&gt;spin dup
&lt;li&gt;subdivision surfaces
&lt;li&gt;subdivision creases
&lt;li&gt;bevel
&lt;li&gt;set smooth
&lt;li&gt;multiple materials
&lt;li&gt;extrusion
&lt;li&gt;merge vertices
&lt;li&gt;remove doubles
&lt;li&gt;constraints
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Press '''NUM'''-'''1''', '''7''' or '''3''' then '''SPACE''' ''&amp;rarr;add&amp;rarr;mesh&amp;rarr;cube'' to
make a cube aligned to the axes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

2. Hit tab to go into edit-mode and select all faces to prevent bevel
messing up normals. Hit '''WKEY'''-&amp;gt;bevel, recursion-&amp;gt;1 (you'll see why
later) then choose bevel size. Bevel of 0.15 is ok. &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay2.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

3. In editmode, go to the Editing tab ('''F9''') and look at the mesh tools 1
panel. In Blender 2.37, there is a set of buttons for edge measuring.
Turn on Edge Length and note the length of one of the sides of the
square faces. This should be 1.7 if the
above settings were used.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay3.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

4. A typical die has a grid of 9 possible positions for the dents and
the gap between the dents is the dent radius (or half the diameter). So, there are
conveniently 10 units on each edge of the square faces, where the gaps
use 4 of the units and the 3 dents use two each. This means the gaps are of
size 1.7/10 = 0.17 and the dents (1.7x2)/10 = 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:9 posiciones.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:muescas y espacios.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

5. To make these segments, use the face loop cut tool. Press '''KKEY'''-&amp;gt;face
loop cut and select one of the edges.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay5a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;

click and you get a blue line to position.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay5b.png|200px]]

Because it's very difficult to position using percentages, especially
after the first segment is made because you then have to work out
percentages of what's left but also because you can't seem to input
exact values, place the blue line to the far left edge and click once.
Do not click again because this line is on top of another one and it
will be tricky to select it again. If you make a mistake, hit '''UKEY''' or '''CTRL'''+'''ZKEY''' to undo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now press '''GKEY''' then '''YKEY''' to move the line along the axis (this is why the
cube needed to be aligned to the axes first). I'm using '''YKEY''' because of
the way my cube is setup - the blue line moves along the green axis. If
you've done it another way round, use the appropriate axis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After hitting '''GKEY''', '''YKEY''', enter the exact value of the gap that we measured
(0.17) and hit return - if you make a mistake before hitting return,
hit delete and retype the number or press '''UKEY''' or '''CTRL'''+'''ZKEY''' after hitting return.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Select the remaining segment to the right of the line, cut this and
move the blue line as far as you can, which will be to the line you
just made. Move this line to 0.34 along y because it is where the dents
go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

6. Repeat step 5 with the remaining segment until you have made 6 cuts
of alternating size (0.17, 0.34, 0.17, 0.34, 0.17, 0.34) and get
something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay6.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

7. Now turn the cube round and do step 5 for the adjacent edge until
you get the grid forming. Note, you move the cuts along the x-axis now
so do '''GKEY''', '''XKEY''', 0.17 etc. Don't worry if the last edge says 0.169 instead of
0.17.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay7a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
You can see the grid of 9 squares mentioned earlier:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay7b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

8. The problem here is that it is very time consuming to do this for
the remaining 5 sides of the die. Instead, we will just duplicate the
one we have done already. But first the rest needs to be deleted. So go
into front view ('''NUM1''') and orthographic mode ('''NUM5'''). Also turn
off depth buffer clipping. Use vertex select mode and select the bottom
vertices:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Make sure these are the right ones by rotating your view with the
middle mouse button. Now press x and select 'vertices'. This should
leave
only the top side of the die:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
We now have to duplicate and rotate this side. There is a very handy
tool to save doing this manually called spin dup located in the editing
tab ('''F9''') in the mesh tools panel. We want to duplicate the side 3 times
in both the x and y axes to complete the cube - 3 times isn't necessary
in the second axis because we will already have a bottom side but it's
easier that way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Spin Dup works relative to your camera and the cursor.
So, put the camera into front view ('''NUM1''') and orthographic mode
('''NUM5'''). If you haven't moved the cube, the 3D cursor should be at
the center of the cube (at the pink dot). If not, go into object mode
('''TAB''') and select what's left of the cube and press '''SHIFT+S''' and select
'cursor to selection'. You can also manually move the cursor by going to
the view menu -&amp;gt; view properties and editing the 3D cursor position.
In this tutorial, it should be at (0,0,0).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The settings for spin dup are that we need 3 duplicates over a 270
degree rotation with 1 turn. Now press spin dup to get the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8c.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8d.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You will see the currently selected side is no longer the top side.
This means we have to go into top view and duplicate around the z-axis
so go into top view ('''NUM7''') and hit spin dup again to fill the
remaining sides.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

9. There will now be a few overlapping points. To get rid of these, go
to the editing tab again ('''F9''') and in the mesh tools, there is a button
called rem doubles. Select all the vertices by pressing '''AKEY''' and select
remove doubles. This may leave some overlapping points because the
threshold for removing doubles is set at 0.001 and some points might be
just outside that value. Setting it to 0.003 should get rid of all the
doubles to leave the die with 384 vertices (this information is at the
top of the Blender window). You can check by counting that each side has 8x8
vertices and there are 6 sides on the cube.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay9.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

10. The die needs the dents added. Select one of the faces where a dent
would go and extrude the face by hitting '''EKEY''' and then '''ESC'''. Do not
click after hitting '''EKEY'''. Collapse this face by using '''ALT+M''' to merge the 4
corners of the extruded face into the centre where it will tell you you
have removed 3 vertices. You should get the following:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay10a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Do this for the configuration of the dots on that side. So for
example, 5 would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay10b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

11. Select one of the edges of the dents to check the size is 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay11a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Remember the dent radius was 0.17. We need to use this value to lower
the centre point of the dents down. Select all the 5 centre points at
once to save time and move them inwards by 0.17. The side I put the 5
dents on here was the top so I move the vertices inwards by pressing '''GKEY''',
 '''ZKEY''', -0.17 and hitting '''ENTER'''. I then get this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay11b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

12. '''TAB''' out of editmode. If you haven't done this already, hit set
smooth in the editing panel and turn on subdivision surfaces&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay12a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
It should look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay12b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

13. On a die, the edges of the dents are usually sharp so we'll use
subsurface creasing to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go back into editmode and with the edge select mode on, select all the
perimeters of the dents like so (it may help to turn off subsurf for
the moment):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay13.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Press '''SHIFT+EKEY''' to enable creasing and move the mouse until the display
says crease is at 1.&amp;nbsp; After pressing '''SHIFT+EKEY''', you can then set
crease values in the information box that you get by pressing '''NKEY''' when
objects are selected. This can be useful to check if all the edges have
the right crease because it gives you the average crease value and if
it is less than 1, there is an edge wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

14. Repeat steps 10,11 and 13 for all the sides of the die. REMEMBER, a die is
numbered so that opposite sides add up to 7. In my example, that means
I put 2 on the bottom etc. Once you finish, if you turn on subdiv level 2,
you will get something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay14.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

15. You can make a test render now to see that the dents look the right
size and the bevel is right. So, turn the subdivision level for the
rendering up to 3. To help position the camera so that you centre the
die, you can make the camera look at the die by adding a track-to
constraint to it. I prefer to track an empty though, because it is more
flexible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make an empty by going into top down view ('''NUM7''') and hitting
'''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; add &amp;rarr; empty. It's always best to go into one of the set
orthographic views so as to align new objects to the axes. If you add
something misaligned, just go to the object menu then clear/apply &amp;gt; clear
rotation (or '''ALT+RKEY'''). Because the empty was created at the origin, you
might not be able to see it as it is inside the die. Hit '''ZKEY''' to enable
wireframe mode and select the empty. Just move it outside the cube
until we get the constaint set up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To add a track-to constraint, select the camera first then '''SHIFT+RMB'''
the empty and press '''CTRL+TKEY''' and choose track-to from the list. Move the
empty back inside the die. You edit constraints in the object tab ('''F7''').
Add a couple of lamps (both intensity 1) to get the scene like this or feel free to experiment with a more advanced lighting setup:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay15.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

16. To render, set the size of the image you want. 800x600 is a decent
size so put these settings in the format panel in the Scene tab ('''F10''').
In the render panel, make sure 100% is selected. If it's 50%,
the render will come out as 400x300. For preview renders, don't turn on
OSA, which is anti-aliasing because it slows your renders down
significantly. Try to only use it for a final render.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another way to position the camera is by selecting it and then looking
through it as you move it. Look through the camera by pressing
'''NUM0'''. Use the '''GKEY''' to pan across and rotate around the local axes
of the camera by pressing say '''RKEY''','''XKEY''','''XKEY''' to rotate in x axis. To zoom in and out
press '''GKEY''', '''ZKEY''', '''ZKEY'''. The '''mouse wheel''' zoom moves your view towards and away from
the camera.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another important point is to set the image format. This is done in the
format panel. The listbox has a number of image types. I find
that png is generally the best because it is lossless and offers the
highest compression among the lossless formats. It also supports an
alpha channel for transparency. When rendering an animation, it is
better to render as an image sequence than as a movie because it is
easier to edit these and repair broken frames. Quicktime supports
loading of image sequences and you can save as a movie using
a wide range of compression formats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To save the render, go to the '''file menu &amp;rarr; save image''' and type in the
full name of the image including the extension e.g. die.png.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The output should now be looking something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay16.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

17. To give it some colour, we will need to use multiple materials
because a typical die has dents that are a different colour from the
die itself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go to the editing section in the button panel again and make sure the die is selected. In
the links and materials panel, there is a section for materials and the
number in the box should be at zero. It may be at 1 if you have
assigned a material to the object already. Add enough to make 2
materials in total.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go back to the Shading panel ('''F5''') and there is a box at the very top of
the material panel with the number 2 beside it. Click this number to
make the two materials you've just created independent. Use the arrows
to the right of the ME button to switch materials.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make material 1 bright red by just picking red in the colour picker or
by setting the RGB sliders. Make material 2 white by doing the same. Or
pick whatever colour you prefer and material settings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

18. These colours need to be assigned to the right parts of the die.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go into editmode and turn off subsurf to help. Select the inner faces
of the dents - if you accidentally don't press the '''SHIFT''', press
'''CTRL'''+'''ZKEY''' or '''UKEY''' to undo. Once they are all selected, go to the Editing
tab again and the material panel. Select the colour for the dents.
There is a button that says assign - press it and it will make the
dents white but the die remains red. Turn subsurf back on and render
with OSA (only put it up as high as you need for the resolution of the
image you are rendering):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay18.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Extra:&lt;br&gt;
The reason I modelled the die this way is because it is also very easy
to change the sizes of the components e.g. the bevel and the dent size.
You do this by selecting the vertical or horizontal segments and just
scaling them in one axis. Here we will reduce the dent size and the
bevel by half.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go into front view ('''NUM1'''), turn off clipping and select a line
containing dents. Then just scale in one axis e.g. '''SKEY''', '''XKEY''', 0.5. Remember to
have your pivot point set to median:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWayE1.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Do this horizontally and vertically around the die. You should need to
scale 9 times for the dents and 6 times for the bevel:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWayE2.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
You may need to add extra geometry once you are satisfied with the
sizes of the dots and the bevel so that the edges of the die don't look
warped due to the subdivision. You can use face loop cut again for that
and add extra lines in the middle of the gap segments.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section includes miscellaneous tips that are of use during your test. These tips apply to the whole test unless otherwise noted.

== Pace wisely ==
While taking the ACT, make sure to answer each question quickly and give yourself ample time to finish the test. This is especially true in the English section which has more questions than any other section in the test. For this purpose it is recommended that you bring a watch to the exam in order to pace your time. Make note of the length of time in each session as each session has different timing and glance at the watch every 5 questions or so to keep up with pace. Make sure the watch does not have any alarms set on it. Any alarms going off during the test will get you disqualified, so make sure that  they are deactivated. Also, it may be preferable to lay the watch on the table opposed to wearing it, for the sake of comfort.

== Attempt to finish questions in order ==
Time is used most conservatively when questions are answered in order. It is still acceptable not to answer a difficult question, but keep in mind that this is where most of your time is lost. If the question is too hard then move on, but if you have a conflict between two answers, make a guess quickly and then move on. Either way, it is important to make a decision and commit to it. If the question takes more than 2 guesses, you should immediately move to the next one. Either way, never linger on a question for more than 10 seconds.

== Read materials first ==
When coming across a reading or science question always read through the materials before answering. This is especially important during the reading section. This is important, because if you do not read the materials, it will take you longer to answer the questions and you will have a greater chance of getting them wrong. Make sure you read, but read quickly, as the test does not allot you much time. For the science section, a quick skimming of the chart and graph heading should help you out while answering questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perhaps the first thing we should look at is just what a video codec is.

Well, it's simple. '''Codec''' stands for '''CO'''mpressor - '''DEC'''ompressor. Choosing the right codec to use is the hard part for many. As the name suggests, a codec Compresses and Decompresses a file, Video, Audio or otherwise. There are many codecs out there, and many variations of those too. So this article is not aimed at informing you, the reader of all the codecs available, but rather to make it easier to select the right codec for the right job using the most common codecs.

When it comes to Video Codecs, much of it is personal preference. Some people do not mind compressing video until it looks pixilated just so long as they can fit more on a disc. Others will accept nothing less than perfect quality and the slightest blemish on an otherwise fine video sends them into a fit. This range of opinion makes it hard to give a definite answer as to what codec is &quot;best.&quot; And in all truth, none of them are. Every codec has a different use and was designed with that use in mind, even if it is used for other things today.


== 1. Compressing Codecs: What are they good for? ==
CODECS allow us to compress video and audio so that more can fit onto a disc. Whether it be a Hard Disk, Compact Disc, Digital Versatile Disc or the small memory cards used in portable media players. A common misconception is that compressing video can make it poor quality. This is only half true, it's all a matter of what CODEC is used and how the codec was configured. For example, DVD-Video uses MPEG 2 compression, this is a high quality compression CODEC that was made for DVD. If you were to make a [[SVCD]] (Super Video CD), you would still be using MPEG 2 but it would be configured in a different way to fit the data on a CD instead of a DVD. Same CODEC = different quality.
In short, CODECS allow us to fit more data on a storage device, but the more we want to fit, the more it has to be compressed. The more you compress, the more quality you are losing, although how apparent the quality loss is depends on the CODEC used.


== 2. They had them first... ==
For many years, we have used CODECS in every day life. DVD-Video uses MPEG 2. VCD uses MPEG 1. Videos we watch on the internet can use any number of CODECS. But for a long time, the use of CODECS to encode video was the domain of professionals with large workstations and even larger budgets. As more and more technology is made available to consumers, we now have the chance to do what the big guys have been doing for years. A few years ago, making your own DVDs was only on the drawing board. But the hardware and software required to do it is now available for all. And now the market is flooded with free codecs such as the Windows Media and OGG-Vorbis formats. And while some, like MP3, require payment to buy the codec, there is no shortage of codecs for consumers and even professionals on a budget to use.

== 3. The Main Formats ==
Unlike the VHS-BETA and DVD+/- wars, codecs do not commonly war with each other. They all try to make a better product, but in the end one codec is going to replace them all. So you can use a codec with confidence that it will not soon become unsupported or obsolete. Here is a guide to the main CODECS used.

'''MPEG 1''': Seen sometimes for Internet downloads but is more commonly used for the Video CD standard. It offers roughly the same or better video quality than VHS but not as good as DVD or SVCD.

'''MPEG 2''': Used on [[DVD]] and in another form for SVCD. When used on a standard DVD, it offers great picture quality and supports widescreen. When used on SVCD, it is not as good but is certainly better than VCD. Unfortunately, SVCD will only fit around 40 minutes of video on a CD, VCD will fit an hour.

'''WMV (Windows Media Video)''': Once only used for Internet streaming and distribution, it is now one of the hottest codecs available. It can do anything from low resolution video for dial up internet users to High Definition video to view on an HD TV. Files can be burnt to CD and DVD or output to any number of devices. It is also useful for Media Centre PCs.

'''Real Video''': Once the leader in internet video, it is now losing some ground to WMV but is still very common.

'''QuickTime''': A file format developed by Apple, also used for internet video. QuickTime also refers to software for playing video.  QuickTime for Windows is the Windows version.  QuickTime available directly from Apple supports about 12 codecs such as Animation codec, Apple Intermediate codec, Apple Pixlet codec, Cinepak, Component, DV (many flavors), Motion JPEG codec, Photo JPEG codec, and Sorenson.  The quality of older codecs were not usually as good as WMV and Real Video and downloads took longer.  Now Apple emphasizes the much more efficient MPEG 4 and MPEG 4 H.264 codecs but older codecs still play with the QuickTime software.  QuickTime '''Pro''' ($30) will compress iPod movies (MPEG 4) and H.264.  The iPod movies look great but Apple's H.264 compresses the color so that files are half the size of WMV files.

'''MPEG 4''': The latest MPEG codec can be used for internet and on disc like WMV.

'''DivX &amp; Xvid''': Types of MPEG 4.

'''H.264''': Type of MPEG 4 used on next-generation HD-DVD and BluRay discs.

'''DV Stream''' A codec and file format used for miniDV tapes and DV camcorders.

There are many more codecs available. To find out which is right for you, you should test each one and see what best suits your needs.

== 4. Case Study in Codecs ==
The [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] creates Editing Workshops for beginning film students to learn to edit scenes from television dramas and motion pictures.  The Star Movie Shop locates all the film dailies for a scene from a television drama as NTSC video (29.97 frames per second), digitizes the dailies, then removes the extra frames added during the telecine (inverse telecine), then adds the scene name and frame number to every frame using a window burn and finally compresses the dailies for editing on personal computers.

To compress the clips, the Star Movie Shop must decide which codec to use.  This has not been easy.

The Star Movie Shop started developing these products eight years ago when most schools still used Adobe Premiere 4.2 and had extremely limited disk space.  The Adobe Premiere editing program works with movies of any frame size but the most common for schools was 320 by 240 pixels at 24 frames per second (which is the standard speed of motion picture film.) 

At that time, QuickTime was the most popular file format for digital video and the current version was '''QuickTime 3''' (it is now up to version 7).  With QuickTime 3, Apple introduced the Sorenson 2 codec which was extremely slow to compress but looked better than any other codec on the market.  It also offered a variable bit rate option which made the files for movies very small.  The Sorenson 2 codec is extremely efficient.  While it would be impratical to compress full-frame scene with the Sorenson 2 codec, it works fine for half size frames.

===Very Simple; Very Easy===
Therefore, for Disk #02 which has '''24 Unedited Scenes''' on a single DVD-Data disk, the Star Movie Shop used the Sorenson 2 codec which works with any version of QuickTime manufactured in the last ten years on both the Macintosh and Windows computers.  This was good!

===Fat and Awkward===
A few years later, the DV format became very popular.  Dozens of terrific, new editing programs became available (including iMovie and Movie Maker) but they only work with DV movies.  The DV codec is very popular because it was the first codec to be used as a standard for digital camcorders.  But the DV codec compresses only 5 to 1 and only at full frame size which is 720 by 480 (non-square) pixels for NTSC video at 29.97 frames per second. (This is NOT film speed.)  This makes DV very inefficient... but faster, specially for compression.  With this DV format, only one (1) scene can be stored on an entire DVD-Video disk for a two minute scene with a 5 to 1 shooting ratio.

Now users with DV editing programs cannot use Disk #02 from the Star Movie Shop.  Using the Movie Player that comes with QuickTime Pro or QuickTime for Windows Pro, users can convert the Sorenson 2 movies from Disk #02 to the DV format but unfortunately, only by stretching the clips so they looked really ugly.  QuickTime Movie Player does not letterbox movies when it enlarges them.  Also, it has to double some frames to convert from 24 fps to 29.97 pfs.  That makes the movies bigger and more awkward to edit.  Very bad news!!!

Therefore, on the new DVD disks from the Star Movie Shop, there is only one scene per disk.  The DVD-Video section has the clips in the MPEG 2 format compressed 200 to 1.  But in the DVD-Data section the clips must be in the DV format if people have a DV Editing program.

If QuickTime Pro was able to rip the MPEG 2 movies from the DVD-Video section, that would save a huge amount of disk space.  But it cannot.   That is why the dailies must be in two different formats (two different codecs) on the same disk.  Really dumb!!!

===Incompatibility===
This would not be too bad except there is an even greater problem.  Different editing programs prefer different formats.  iMovie prefers DV movies in the DV Streaming file format while Final Cut Express prefers DV movies stored in the QuickTime file format (not the streaming format), compressed with the DV codec.  Neither of these works at motion picture speeds of 24 frames per second which is the speed of all film dailies.   And since NTSC video and PAL video have different frame rates and frame sizes, this adds another degree of complexity in providing the film clips in a format that people can use.

Only Final Cut Pro can work with movies (usually in the Photo-JPEG codec) at full frame (640 by 480 square pixels) at 24 frames per second.   (The Sorenson 2 codec could not be used because it is too slow for compressing full frame scenes.  Sorenson 3 only works with new versions of QuickTime.  The only universal codec that works well at this size is Photo-JPEG.)

===Options Equally Awkward===
If the user is sophisticated, the user can convert the clips from one file format to another (within limits).  The problem is this is sometimes very awkward.  Apple's newest version of QuickTime does not correctly convert clips from film dailies (at 24 fps) to 29.97 frames per second when using the QuickTime option.  If you do this, the DV clips compressed in the QuickTime file format, store the clips at 24 fps which is unusable in all DV editing programs, even Apple's Final Cut Express.  Therefore, users must convert the dailies to DV Streaming which converts correctly to 29.97 fps and then convert DV Streams to QuickTime movies... in two separate steps.

===Today===
The Star Movie Shop still sells [http://www.starmovieshop.com/pages/disk2.htm Disk #02 - 24 Unedited Scenes] to young filmmakers who want to see how movies are filmed in Hollywood but the disk '''cannot''' be used as an editing workshop since beginning filmmakers cannot afford an editing program which will work with this frame size and frame rate. (Final Cut Pro costs too much for kids and Adobe Premiere 4.2 is no longer available.)

The newest disk from the Star Movie Shop is an unedited scene called &quot;Home Wrecker&quot; from ''Buffy, the Vampire Slayer''.  Fortunately, this scene is so short, the dailies can be stored in a variety of formats on the disk.   By carefully searching for very short scenes, the Star Movie Shop has found two other scenes (&quot;Hearing Voices&quot; from ''Law and Order'' and &quot;Fireworks Display&quot; from ''Northern Exposure'') which will fit on one disk each.

However, longer scenes from the Star Movie Shop require up to 3 DVD disks (and that is just with the NTSC DV codec video clips, not PAL.)  This is expensive and awkward.  So rather than solve problems, new and better codecs are creating new problems.  The disks come with MPEG 4 clips but since the clips are compressed with Apple's QuickTime Movie Player, the color is not good so these are only for situations where nothing else will work.  (And they require QuickTime 7 Pro which very few people have.)

It will be interesting to see if Blue Ray disks will make this easier or more complex.

[[File:Frito Pie as Seen Today.jpg|left|thumb|Frito Pie as Seen Today]]
'''[[w:frito pie|Frito pie]]''' is a corn (maize) chip and [[Cookbook:Chili con carne|chili con carne]] dish popular in the United States. Frito pie may be made with just corn chips, chili, and [[Cookbook:Cheese|shredded cheese]], but often has other condiments added as well. [[Cookbook:Sour_cream|Sour cream]], [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], hot sauce, [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], and various other [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|Latin American]] ingredients are often used.

==Recipe 1==

This is a traditional, and basic, recipe for Frito pie.  Minor variants are common.

* 3 cups (710 ml) Fritos
* 1 cup (240 ml) grated cheddar cheese
* 2 cups (590 ml) chili (homemade or canned)

===Procedure===

# Preheat oven to 350° F (175° C).  
# Spread 2 cups of Fritos in a baking dish.
# Sprinkle half of the cheese over the Fritos.
# Spread the chili over the Fritos
# Bake for 15 or 20 minutes and cheese is bubbly.
# Add remaining cheese and Fritos to top of pie.
# Serve hot.  Makes 4 servings.

==Recipe 2==

This is an alternate recipe.  It includes making the chili for the pie.

===Ingredients===

* 2 tablespoons (Tbsps.) (30 ml) vegetable oil
* 2 cups (475 ml) chopped onions
* Salt
* Cayenne pepper
* 2 pounds (900 g) beef bottom round, cut into &amp;#189; inch (13 mm) cubes
* 1 teaspoon (tsp.) (5 ml) chili powder
* 2 tsps. (10 ml) ground cumin
* Crushed red chile peppers
* 2 tsps. (10 ml) dried oregano
* 2 Tbsps. (30 ml) chopped garlic
* 3 cups (710 ml) crushed tomatoes
* &amp;#189; cup (120 ml) tomato paste
* 2 cups (475 ml) beef stock
* 1&amp;#189; Tbsps. (22 ml) each masa and flour
* 1 bag (10 oz. / 280 g) Fritos
* 1&amp;#189; cups (350 ml) grated Monterey Jack cheese
* 6 Tbsps. (90 ml) sour cream
* 1 small jar of jalapeños

===Procedure===

# In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil.
# When the oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the vegetables start to wilt.
# Season with salt and cayenne.
# Stir in the beef, chili powder, cumin, crushed red pepper, and oregano.
# Brown the meat for 5 to 6 minutes.
# Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, and beef stock.
# Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
# Simmer the liquid, uncovered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, or until the beef is tender. Skim off the fat occasionally.
# Mix the masa and flour together with a little liquid from the stock pot.
# Slowly stir in the masa slurry and continue to cook for 30 minutes.
# Season with salt and cayenne.
# Place a handful of the chips in each shallow bowl.
# Spoon the chili over the chips.
# Garnish with the grated cheese, sour cream and jalapeños.  Makes 8 servings.

==Recipe 3==

Your basic, on the go, craving Frito Pie, recipe:

===Procedure===
 
# Buy a 99¢ Grab-Bag of Fritos.
# Buy a basic 99¢ cup of chili from Wendy's (or wherever you like to buy chili)
# Carefully open the bag without ripping the sides
# Pour the chili over the top of the chips in the bag.
# Pour on the hot sauce from the little packets, and a little more grated cheese.
# Carefully eat it right out of the bag with a plastic fork, and enjoy.

==Recipe 4==
The simple at-home way of making Frito Pie quickly, without an oven. More ideal for children than the hotter bag and casserole methods. Easily multiplied for parties or other occasions!

===Ingredients===
* Single-serving bag of fritos
* Single-serving of chilli
* Cheese and other toppings

===Procedure===

# Heat chilli on stove or in microwave until desired temperature
# Pour over fritos in a bowl
# Add cheese and desired toppings
# Carefully eat it straight from the bowl

      <text xml:space="preserve">An interjection is a short word used solely to express emotion. They help to make your Portuguese sound more authentic, and expand your expressive capabilities. They give your language more flavor.

Portuguese speakers are very expressive, so a familiarization with at least some of these terms is a must. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''então''' - When used as an interjection, '''então''' can mean the same as &quot;Anyway!&quot; It normally means &quot;Then...&quot; or &quot;So...&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Ah!''' - Is used as it is with most languages. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Socorro!''' - Means the same as &quot;Help me!&quot;, as it is used when there is an immediate danger of some kind. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Vamos!''' - Used in place of '''então''', similar to &quot;anyway&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Puxa!''' - Expresses admiration, like &quot;Wow!&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Perdão!''' - Literally, &quot;Pardon!&quot;, used to convey an apology. Typically less formal than its literal English translation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Arre!''' - Expresses impatience. Like &quot;Come on!&quot;, &quot;Move&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To create an interjective expression from an adjective, use the combination ''Que + adjective!''. This is the equivalent of saying &quot;How [ajective]!&quot; in English. For example: &lt;br&gt;
*''Que bom!'' - &quot;How nice!&quot;
*''Que medo!'' - &quot;How frightening!&quot;
*''Que terrível!'' - &quot;How terrible!&quot;

==Misinformation==
The article states ''&quot;Scientists now know that the back bones of the Apatosaurus grew together as the animal gets bigger.&quot;'' I think it would be misinformation to say scientists &quot;know&quot;.  It took them nearly a hundred years to figure out the wrong head was on the body.  And in another hundred years they'll probably change their minds again.  The most that can be said is that scientists speculate about these things since they weren't there to make the observations first hand.  Saying the scientists know is carrying it too far.

I'm trying to obtain an accurate Apatosaurus picture, featuring the whole body, without the neck tilted up(because it's disputed whether they really could tilt their heads up) and with the right head. A couple of days I have contacted the author of [http://www.psychosaurus.com/dino/images/apatosaurus.jpg http://www.psychosaurus.com/dino/images/apatosaurus.jpg] asking for permission, but no response yet.  It would be appreciated if someone could find one.  --[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 07:38, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

== Split this Article ==

Shouldn't this article be split? There should be an article on Apatosaurus, and a second brief article about the Brontosaurus naming mistake. It's confusing to mix them together IMO.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User: Dora Nichov| Dora Nichov]] ([[User talk: Dora Nichov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ Dora Nichov|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;
:I brought this up before actually.  And the general opinion seemed to be that ''Brontosaurus'' is a much more well known name.  I remember when I was a little kid learninga bout dinos I definitely learned about the amphibious ''Brontosaurus'', and I still have the book displaying it proudly.  The discussion was here: [[Talk:Wikijunior Dinosaurs#Brontosaurus  rename .28.3F.29]].  What you are suggesting is what the English-language Wikipedia does (see [[w:Brontosaurus]] and [[w:Apatosaurus]]), but I think because this is for kids it would just create unnecessary confusion.  Anyway the article here is really not long enough on its own to warrant a split in my view.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 01:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
::IMO the article should definitely be split. Kids are much more likely to learn about apatosaurus than brontosaurus these days. Just because we learned about brontosaurus when we were kids doesn't mean that todays kids learn the same thing (and in fact, they don't.) There should be one regular article on apatosaurus, and one 'special' article on brontosaurus. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 13:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

== Is &quot;Deceptive&quot; an adequately simple word? ==

Topic. I'm not sure, I want some opinions. Perhaps &quot;tricky&quot; (although that lacks some of the meaning, and could lead to misinterpretation)? As I said, I'm not sure. [[User:24.205.34.217|24.205.34.217]] 23:23, 7 May 2007 (UTC)
Also, on the article on Brontosaurus, is it correct to use emotive language to describe the degree of the mistake made (&quot;This was a &lt;b&gt;bad&lt;/b&gt; mistake&quot;)? Not sure, just asking. [[User:24.205.34.217|24.205.34.217]] 23:28, 7 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Note that every leaf of the call tree has the value 0 or 1. All of these ones are summed together to give the final answer, so for any n the number of leaves in the call tree is actually Fn itself!&quot;

Did the author mean to say that there are F(N+1) leaves? If we take the example given, F(6), there are F(6+1) = F(7) = 13 total leaves, *not* F(N) = F(6) = 8. It might also be helpful to mention at this point that there are 2*F(N+1) total nodes and, consequently, 2*F(N+1) total recursive steps required to calculate the Nth number in the sequence.

Please point out where I am wrong.

== Calculating fib(n) using its closed form ==

The author made mention that fib(n) can be calculated efficiently from its closed form. Theoretically I see no problem but I think you have to remember that practically the computer would store the value of the golden ratio in floating point variables which keeps limited precision. Therefore I don't think such an algorithm will be [[w:Numerically_stable|numerically stable]]. See [[w:Fibonacci_number#Computation|fibonacci computation]] for a further discussion of this. Of particular interest is that with standard IEEE 64-bit floats the results break down as early as n=75 and obviously for the standard IEEE 32-bit floats the results breaks down for even smaller n.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
'''Anaconda''' is a variant of seven card stud and has an initial phase of card swapping that gives it its name because the cards in your hand may &quot;snake&quot; their way around the table. It is also known as '''Pass The Trash''' because of this initial passing of cards, but that name does not always do it justice because some strategies expect trash to be passed and, therefore, pass higher cards in hopes of making a good hand with low ranked cards. The most descriptive name for this game is '''3-2-1 Left''' because it describes the passing rules in this initial phase.

==How to Play==
The dealer deals 7 cards down to each player, one at a time, starting with the player to his left. Each player, after looking at his hand, passes three cards to the player on his left. Each player then picks up the three cards from the player on his right. Each player now passes two cards to the player on his left and picks up the two cards from the player on his right. Finally, one card from each player is passed to the left and each player picks up the card from the player on his right. During each passing phase it is important that no player ever has more than seven cards in his hand and therefore must make sure that he passes his card before picking up the cards from his right. Each player now makes the best five card hand from his hand and discards two cards. Each player arranges his hand in whatever order he wishes and then places the hand face down on the table. The top card of each player's hand is &quot;rolled&quot; up and then there is a round of betting until four cards from each player's hand are showing. At this point each player declares whether his hand is a low hand, high hand, or both. This is done by placing a number of chips secretively in your hand and then all players reveal at the same time. A low hand is indicated by an empty hand, a high hand is declared by revealing one chip, and a high and low hand is declared by revealing two chips. Once it is clear what the nature of each hand is, the last card is flipped up.

==Who Wins==
In games where hands are declared high, low, or both it may be difficult to figure out who wins the pot. Generally, if any player declares &quot;both&quot;, that player's hand must beat (not tie) every low hand and every high hand. If a hand declared as &quot;both&quot; does not beat all other hands in the showdown then he does not win anything! If a hand then declared &quot;both&quot; does not win the pot then the pot is split in half. The highest hand of all hands that were declared &quot;high&quot; wins one half of the pot, and the lowest hand of all the hands declared &quot;low&quot; wins the other half of the pot. If there is only one type of hand (&quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;) then the entire pot goes to the winner of the best hand of that type. Also, if there is a tie for high or low then each of the players receives half of the pot that was allocated for that type of hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Where to get Pearls ==
where do you get the bubble tea pearls, or how at least do you make them?
: The real dark-colored pearls can be purchased from a number of bubble tea-specific internet vendors.  See the Wikipedia entry for some decent links.   However, if you are willing to settle for the white pearls, you may be able to find them at your local grocery store, near where you would find Jell-O puddings. Get real tapioca pearls, not instant, 'minute', or granules.  They are normally soaked overnight in water, then cooked for about an hour in fresh water.  A tea shop near me uses a slow cooker (crock pot) to cook them.  When they are done, they are drained and I believe they are ready for use.  Some people store them in a [[simple syrup]].--[[User:Mdwyer|Mdwyer]] 23:53, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

What size is a cup? what is the metric unit?[[User:Sweetie candykim|Sweetie candykim]] ([[User talk:Sweetie candykim|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sweetie candykim|contribs]]) 12:16, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

I worked out that a cup size is 237ml but I have added the metric sizes and altered the serving sizes accordingly [[User:Sweetie candykim|Sweetie candykim]] ([[User talk:Sweetie candykim|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sweetie candykim|contribs]]) 12:30, 2 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

==Welcome==
Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

[[Mythology of Final Fantasy X]]

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* Take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]
* See [[Wikibooks:Template messages|list of templates]] which can save your time
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

Good luck!--[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:23, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== MediaWiki subpages and http://www.editthis.info/virtualsoil/index.php/A_New_Story/1 ==

Hi. You asked in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] &quot;a question about Wikibooks setup&quot;; you wanted to enable subpages (slash in titles) on your wiki.

I am not sure exactly how to do this, but using [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/wikipedia/phase3/includes/DefaultSettings.php?rev=1.365.2.17&amp;view=markup DDefaultSettings.php in MediaWiki 1.5.5 in CVS] as a reference, I think that I know what to do.

I believe that you need to ask the web server administrator to edit LocalSettings.php and add &lt;tt&gt;NS_MAIN&lt;/tt&gt; to the list of namespaces in &lt;tt&gt;$wgNamespacesWithSubpages&lt;/tt&gt;. You will need to ask this of whoever set up editthis.info. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

: Some more readings: [[meta:Wikibooks_should_use_subpages]]. Hope you succeed. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

==hey==
dont you think we should make copies of the pages from wikipedia and have them here too, instead of linking back to wikipedia? like all the character bios and stuff? i looked and most of the final fantasy pages are pretty bare and kinda sad, so i have planned to improve them alot, over time, when i have some free time... -[[User:Xornok|Xornok]] 02:36, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Illustrated Guide to the world of Spira (FFX and FFX-2)]] ==

On VFD you asked for a week to transfer this book to another site before it is deleted here. Could I ask whether this has now happened, especially as I don't want to delete it until you've had a chance to move or copy the material? Many thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== RE: Deletion of Games from Wikibooks ==

Regarding your message left on my [[User Talk:DanielBC|talk page]], firstly I'm not a member of any particular project on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|Harry Potter guide]], I am actually brand new at Wikibooks.  But also, I don't understand why Harry Potter would be deleted due to &quot;Games on Wikibooks are being evicted&quot; concerns.  It's not a game, it's a series of books.  Why would it be deleted?  --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 23:18, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

Proposals:
*Use [http://www.arabetics.com Arabetics] fonts in some of  sections of the book.
*Include Arabic type with fat'''h'''äh, kasräh, etc. So that the Arabic text is adequate enough to figure out the pronunciation. This probably requires the next proposal to be implemented.
*Show Arabic type as a picture so it is viewable on all computers. This is necessary to show the  vowelizing symbols (a.k.a. &quot;tashkiil&quot;) (fat'''h'''äh, kasräh, etc.) properly.
*Make transliteration optional to view.
*Allow the user to choose to see vowelized or unvowelized texts, when viewing a page.

These are to be discussed on the talk page.

Anything agreed upon goes below for future authors.

In previous sections, we discussed some numbers that were very large. In astronomy, the appearance of such huge numbers is common. This is one reason astronomers and other scientists use '''scientific notation''' when working with very large or very small numbers. Scientific notation is a system for writing and working with numbers that makes it much easier to deal with numbers that are very small or very large.

[[Image:Schoty_abacus.jpg|thumb|150px|left]]

For example, the Milky Way Galaxy contains roughly three thousand billion billion billion billion tons of material. That is a rather cumbersome number. (Astronomers would never actually write this. Instead, they would say that the Milky Way contains one trillion times the mass of the Sun, which is somewhat easier. We'll use this much larger number for our demonstration.) You could also write this number as
:3 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 tons,
but that's even worse. Scientific notation makes the number much more compact and readable:
:3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; tons.
This number is verbally expressed as &quot;three times ten to the 39 power tons.&quot; This is numerically equivalent to the first two expressions.


[[Image:Scientific Notation Cubes.svg|thumb|right|Using an exponent to represent a number allows that number to grow very big very fast. This makes it convenient to represent very large or very small numbers using exponential notation.]]

A number written correctly in scientific notation has two parts. The first is a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 (but it can be either positive or negative). This is sometimes called the '''mantissa'''. The second part is the number ten raised to a whole number power. The exponent of the second number is called the '''power'''. Some examples of numbers written correctly in scientific notation are:
:2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;
:-1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:7.656 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;
:2.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
These, on the other hand, '''are not''' valid examples of numbers written in scientific notation:
:0.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; '''is wrong''' because the mantissa is less than 1
:12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; '''is wrong'''  because the mantissa is not less than 10
:8.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2.2&lt;/sup&gt; '''is wrong''' because the power is not a whole number
Remember that
:10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 10 × 10 × 10 × ... for ''n'' times,
which means that ten raised to ''n'' power is the same as 10 multiplied by itself ''n'' times, which is the same as a 1 with ''n'' zeros written after it. For example, 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is 10 × 10 × 10, or 1000. That means that our earlier number, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; tons, is equivalent to
:3 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 tons,
which is a three followed by 39 zeros. A number written in scientific notation with a negative power corresponds to a small number. For example, the number 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; is written as 0.001 in conventional notation. In general,
:10&lt;sup&gt;-''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/10 × 1/10 × 1/10 × ... for ''n'' times.

|[[Image:Scientific Notation Big.svg|thumb|left|These are the steps in converting a large number expressed in scientific notation into standard notation. Write the mantissa and find the location of the decimal point, and shift the decimal point by the number indicated in the power. Here, the power is 9, so the decimal is moved nine digits to the right.]]
[[Image:Scientific Notation Small.svg|thumb|right|These are the steps in converting a small number expressed in scientific notation into standard notation. The steps for converting a small number are the same as for a large number, but the decimal point should be shifted to the left instead of to the right.]]
|}

Since scientific notation relies on powers of ten, it's simple to convert a number from scientific notation to standard notation or vice versa. To convert a large number (with a positive power) from scientific notation to standard notation, first identify the decimal point in the mantissa, then shift the decimal to the right by the number indicated by the power. To convert a number from standard notation to scientific notation, just reverse these steps. Find the decimal point in the number, and move it until the number is at least 1 but less than 10. Count the number of places you moved the decimal point and use that number as the power. If you moved the decimal point to the left, make the power positive. If you moved the decimal point to the right, make the power negative.

Scientific notation also makes it simpler to do multiplication and division. To multiply two numbers in scientific notation, multiply the mantissas and add the powers:
: (3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) × (4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;)
: (3 × 4) × 10&lt;sup&gt;4 - 2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
In some cases, such as the one shown here, you may need to shift the decimal point again ensure that the number is in correct scientific notation. It should never be necessary to shift the decimal point by more than one digit. When dividing numbers in scientific notation, divide the mantissas and subtract the powers:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{3 \times 10^4}{4 \times 10^{-2}} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(3/4) \times 10^{4 + 2}&lt;/math&gt;
: 0.75 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;
: 7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
Here also, it may be necessary to shift the decimal point and change the exponent.

Scientific notation makes it easy to compare numbers that have very different values because all the zeroes have been replaced with the much more readable exponent. Numbers with a greater exponent are ''always'' bigger than numbers with a lesser exponent.

If one of the exponents is bigger than the other by more than a couple, the difference between the two is clearly very big. Recognizing a huge difference between two numbers can sometimes be a very useful insight, so it often makes sense to take a moment to develop an intuitive feel for a math problem before attacking it. In some cases, it's useful to see roughly by how much one number is larger than another. Scientific notation makes this much simpler. For a rough estimate, you only need to find the difference in the exponents. For example, 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, since 7 - 3 = 4.

:Some tourists in the Chicago Museum of Natural History are marveling at the dinosaur bones. One of them asks the guard, &quot;Can you tell me how old the dinosaur bones are?&quot;

:The guard replies, &quot;They are 73 million, four years, and six months old.&quot;

:&quot;That's an awfully exact number,&quot; says the tourist. &quot;How do you know their age so precisely?&quot;

:The guard answers, &quot;Well, the dinosaur bones were seventy three million years old when I started working here, and that was four and a half years ago.&quot;

:(From the Science Jokes Web page[http://www.xs4all.nl/~jcdverha/scijokes/])

In science, measurements are never perfect and numbers are never exact. As a result, every measurement we make has some '''uncertainty''' associated with it. Scientific notation makes it easy to express how precisely a number is known. Suppose a paleontologist discovers ancient dinosaur bones and finds that they are 73 million years old. Of course, the paleontologist doesn't know exactly how old they are. Maybe they're 73,124,987 years old, but the paleontologist only knows the age within 1 million years, so the age is written as 73,000,000 years, or 7.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. Either of these expressions imply that the bones aren't ''exactly'' 73 million years old, but are 73 million years old, give or take a million years. 

But what if the paleontologist knows the age within 200,000 years, and is sure that the bones aren't, say, 73.4 million years old? In that case, the standard notation is ambiguous — the number is still written as 73,000,000 years. In scientific notation, we can write the number as 7.30 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. If we write this, we mean that the third digit is '''significant'''. The paleontologist might have calculated that the bones are 72,954,332 years old, but it would be useless to report these numbers, since the error on this measurement was 200,000 years. The extra digits are insignificant. The number of '''significant figures''' in a number are a reflection of the precision expressed in the number. In this case, the number of significant figures is three. The first significant figure is 7, the second is 3, and the third is 0.

Scientific notation gives the trailing digits written after the decimal point of a number special meaning — they tell that the number is exactly 7.30 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. This is unlike the usual use of numbers in mathematics, where trailing zeroes after the decimal point have no special meaning.

In the story about the museum guard, the guard hadn't thought about the precision of the age of the bones. It doesn't make sense to add the four years to 73 million years because the uncertainty in the age quoted to the guard was a ''lot'' more than 4 years. When working with numbers that have uncertainties, we must be sure not to express better precision in the results of our arithmetic than we had in the first place.

When doing arithmetic, numbers being added or subtracted are treated differently from numbers being multiplied or divided.
:'''When multiplying or dividing numbers with uncertainties, make sure that the answer has as many significant figures as the least precise of the original numbers.'''

For example, in (2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) × (1.21 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the number 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has two significant figures and the number 1.21 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has three significant figures. The result should have two significant figures: 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. We assume that there was some uncertainty in the measurement that gave us 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and this leads to some uncertainty in the result of the computation.

Addition and subtraction work differently. When adding 23.14 and 2.2, for example, the number 2.2 has uncertainty beginning in the tenths place. This uncertainty makes it pointless to report the hundredths place in the sum. To see this, try adding some uncertainty to 2.2 and see how this affects the sum.
:'''When adding or subtracting numbers with uncertainties, round the result to the last significant place of the original number with the greatest uncertainty.
For example, 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be written as
:{|
| || 2300
|-
| + || align=&quot;right&quot; |  110
|- style=&quot;height:0px&quot; bgcolor=&quot;black&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|- 
|  || 2410
|}
But we don't know the real value of the tens place in 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so we really only know the answer to the hundreds place. We should write
:{|
| || 2300
|-
| + || align=&quot;right&quot; |  110
|- style=&quot;height:0px&quot; bgcolor=&quot;black&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|- 
|  || 2400
|}
or 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This may seem incorrect, but we're really only rounding off. Since we don't know the result to better than two significant figures, it makes no sense to report the extra digits — that would be like the museum guard who tells visitors that the dinosaur bones are 73 million and four years, six months old.

Almost every number has a '''unit of measurement''' attached to it. The number we used as our first example carried units of tons, and we expressed the age of the dinosaur bones in years. The units a number carries are part of the number itself. Units can also be multiplied or divided just like numbers.

As an example, consider a simple equation:
:distance = velocity × time.
Suppose you drive in a car with a speed of 100 kilometers per hour (60 miles per hour) and you go in a straight line for one hour. The distance you will travel is 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{distance} = 100 \frac{\mathrm{kilometer}}{{\mathrm{hour}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/}}
\times 1 {\mathrm{hour} 
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/}
&lt;/math&gt;
or 60 miles. We have cancelled hours as though it were a number.

This trick is also useful when you need to convert units. If you have a result in one system and you'd like to convert to another, you can set up a ratio, such as 1,000 meters/1 kilometer. Since 1,000 meters is equal to 1 kilometer, the ratio 1,000 meters/1 kilometer equals one. Because of this, multiplying any number by 1,000 meters / 1 kilometer will not change the value of the number. If we want to know what 100 kilometers is in meters, we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
100\mathrm{\ kilometers}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/ 
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\times
\frac{1000\ \mathrm{meters}}{
\mathrm{kilometer}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/},
&lt;/math&gt;
or 100,000 meters.

Other units of measurement used in astronomy are '''kilograms''' (mass), '''Newtons''' (force), and '''Joules''' (energy).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In all forums, it is vitally important to have good clear pictures.  See [[Budget Watch Collecting/Watch Photography]] for help with this.  Ebay charges extra for extra pictures, and many watch forums have limited picture space.  In those cases, it is often easier to use a free hosting service like [[http://photobucket.com Photobucket]] and post links.  Mechanical watches should usually show the movement if possible.  If the watch is running, show pictures with the second hand in different positions.  If a watch is not running, check the balance--If there is no play, report that.  

With inexpensive watches, you need to balance your time with the extra bids better pictures will generate.  I place my watches on a stand, take them to the wall of my porch outside, and take a fairly standard series of photos--Full face, then I rotate the watch to 5 or 6 positions showing all sides and back.  I'll then take a picture of the back,  and a movement picture for mechanicals.  I'll try to get two pictures of any flaws--One with lighting adjusted to make the flaw stand out, another &quot;actual view&quot; with the flaw how it really looks in normal lighting.   If the watch glows strongly in the dark, I try to get a picture of that.  

Don't's:  Make sure a calendar watch isn't photographed in the middle of a date change--Fairly common, that is where the watch is most likely to stop on its own, but it makes it look like the calendar is misaligned.  Chronographs should be photographed both reset and with the chrono running.   LED's should be photographed without flash, with the digits lit. 


Outlets:

So far, my selling has been done on Ebay.  I almost always start with a starting bid a small fraction of the expected price, no reserve and take my chances.  Sometimes I'll set a &quot;buy it now&quot; of about 20% more than I expect the watch to sell for. Occasionally I'll get a buy-it-now, often I'll get a low starting bid but a final price higher than the buy-now price.  

Many watch forums have associated trade forums. Rules vary, and in general expectations are higher, with no &quot;don't know what I'm doing&quot; excuses.

To many theorists, the locus of interest lies in actors, actions, and interactions between persons. But before any research can be done on those issues, the basic points of discussion that are involved in the above topics need to be laid out. In other words, it must first be asked, &quot;What is a human action?&quot;

The American sociologist [[w:Talcott Parsons|Talcott Parsons]] created a model of human action which stressed that the most basic interesting event to recognize is ''goal-directed action''. It was further refined by his student [[w:Robert K. Merton|Robert K. Merton]]. In this model, human actions are made up of and involve:
* '''The actor or agent''' performing an action (including their intentions, schemas, knowledge, motives, and identity);
* '''The goal''', or a future [[w:state of affairs|state of affairs]] that is desired (which may be a ''means to another end'' or an ''end in itself''; involve ''human communicative action'' or be an ''object-oriented action''; and be either ''a creative goal'' or ''reaction to a dilemma'');
* '''The situation''' in which action is located, including both:
** The ''conditions of action'' (the things about a situation that the actor cannot influence or change). This includes such things as the '''normative background''' (or the relevant norms), the ''obstacles'' in the way of achieving the goal, and the ''[[w:human ecology|human ecology]]'' of the setting
** The ''means of action'' (which the actor has some degree of control over)

* And to this, we can also include:
** the ''actual consequences'' of the action (which may be ''foreseeable or unforeseeable'', and either ''intended or unintended'').

Though immediately intuitive and common-sensical, this model is useful as a preliminary guide by which research can be structured. (In semantics, the analytical tool of '''[[w:thematic role|thematic role]]s''' bears many of the same characteristics. This sort of model is one concern in [[w:action theory|action theory]].)

On its own, the above model describes all voluntary ''human action''. However, social psychologists are more interested in describing a narrower subject matter: namely, '''social actions''' and '''aggregate actions'''. A &quot;social action&quot; was defined by Max Weber as any action that &quot;takes account of the behaviour of others and is thereby orientated in its course&quot;; that is to say, another person may be involved in the ''means, goal, or context'' of action (1947). Broader still, social psychologists may be interested in ''aggregate action'', when there are multiple actors attempting to achieve the same ends independently of one another.

Of parallel interest at this level of analysis are the issues involved in '''socialization'''. What are the forces that cause people to learn their social roles? What are the mental processes that produce a socialized person? What is the role of biology in determining a person's development?

== Self ==
One important question is &quot;What does it mean for me to have a self?&quot; It is a question that has been given treatment in a number of theories.

:'''''Philosophical approaches.''''' Philosopher [[David Hume]] regarded the Self as the feeling of continuity of one's experiences, roughly akin to the conscious mind. His theories can be seen as an early prelude to postmodern identity theories ([[Gergen]], [[Harré]]) for they both speak of the notion of the Self in very minimal terms. The common rejection of [[essentialism]] relies upon the idea that the self is something that is in a state of constant change rather than a fixed trait.

:'''''Psychodynamic approach.''''' Psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] understood the Self to be composed of a number of different selves, each of which was tailored to fit their own unique demands of social life. These &quot;selves&quot; were sometimes conscious, sometimes not.

:'''''Social behaviorism.''''' This is a theory developed by [[George Herbert Mead]] that emphasizes the relevant social context of the learning environment. 

:Social behaviorism is influenced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theories, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and the [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] of the [[Chicago school]] ([[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Charles Peirce|Peirce]], Shibutani, etc.). Yet social behaviorism contrasts with cognitive psychology and Darwinian theories in one important aspect. Social behaviorism doesn't consider mind as something that is pre-existing to interaction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...We find no evidence for the prior existence of consciousness as something which brings about behavior on the part of one organism that is of such a sort as to call forth an adjustive response on the part of another organism, without itself being dependent on such behavior. We are rather forced to conclude that consciousness is an emergent from such behavior; that so far from being a precondition of the social act, the social act is the precondition of it. (Mead, 1934) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Although this theory carries within it the word ''[[behaviorism]]'', it has very little if anything to do with the behaviorism of [[John B. Watson]] or [[B.F. Skinner]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; Behaviorism in this wider sense is simply an approach to the study of the experience of the individual from the point of view of his conduct, particularly, but not exclusively, the conduct as it is observable by others. (Mead, 1934) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

:'''''Other sociocultural theories.''''' The social behaviorist's perspective resembles the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], which places learning in the context of social interaction.

==Personality and personal identity==
One of the areas of research in social psychology is [[personality psychology]]. It is a subfield that engages in the study of people and the meanings they associate with themselves. Of interest to this area are questions like, &quot;What is my [[personal identity]]?&quot; and &quot;What are the factors and influences that make me who I am?&quot;. In this article, and by the standards of current research, one's personality is their ''personal identity'', both self-perceived and perceived by others (Cote and Levine). It is a kind of ''meaning''.

:'''''Meaning and self-concept.''''' Some researchers use tools borrowed from the symbolic interactionist tradition, such as the notions of ''self-concept'', the ''looking-glass self'' and the ''ideal self''. The &quot;self-concept&quot; is the idea that people actually have of a person, while the [[looking-glass self]] is the ideas and judgments that the actor thinks others have of them. The [[ideal self]] is the standard to which people aspire to be like, often influenced by [[role model]]s.

:'''''[[Big five personality traits]].'''''

:'''''Applications.''''' One topic of concern is the manner in which people are susceptible towards becoming dominators or victims because of aspects of their personalities. In order to help explain the effects that personality might have in acts of coercion and violence, social psychologists created the notions of [[Social dominance orientation|Social Dominance Orientation]]. This concept has also been used to facilitate critical-political tools, such as that of [[Right Wing Authoritarianism]].

:'''''Implicit personality judgments.''''' Another question of earnest importance is, &quot;Why do other people see me the ways that they do?&quot;. One answer comes from '''[[Implicit personality theories]]''. This set of theories postulates that people have abstract ideas about personality traits that they cluster into positive and negative sets, and which are used implicitly to evaluate others. For instance, a person (Bob) may receive some cues from another person (Joe) which reflect a positive or negative trait about them (Joe). If the judger, Bob, makes a judgment about the other (Joe) without reflecting upon their reasons for the judgment, it will often lead to assumptions and true inferences about other unseen personality traits. For example, a person who is wasteful might also be seen as clumsy, unintelligent, or irresponsible; while a person who is skillful might be assumed to be determined, industrious, and intelligent. In effect, then, this model predicts that Bob will implicitly assume that any person who has one negative trait, also has a number of other negative traits.

=== Identity and identity formation ===
:'''''The [[sense of community]]'''''. Involves the subjectively perceived sense of the traits of members of a social group. Is the conceptual center of [[Community psychology]].

:'''''[[Social identity]]'''''. A person's social identity is their position within a particular social structure. One explanatory attempt in this field has been [[Social identity theory]], which argues that people will cluster themselves and others into meaningful groups. Related notions include [[role]]s, which denotes a person's concrete place in a particular organization, and [[stereotype]]s, which are a collection of traits that is attributed to members of a certain social set.

:'''''[[Place attachment]]'''''. Beightols gay actor feels a bond to a certain place, usually through extensive interaction with it. Through enough exposure to a certain environment, the actor may begin to associate their social and personal identity with that place.

:'''''Identity formation strategies.''''' ''How do people develop their identities? What kinds of identities are there? When will an identity be more resilient across a life-span?'' These are all questions worth considering.

: Writing in a quantitative branch of the psychodynamic tradition is [[James Marcia]], author of the [[identity status paradigm]]. He argued that identity across the lifespan of a person could be attributed to two elements: their ''commitment'' to an identity, and their conscious choice (involving ''exploration'' of alternatives). From these two variables, four identity statuses can be established, which describe actors in varying states of identity consolidation:
:*Identity ''Diffusion'', when a person has neither chosen nor committed to any identity;
:*Identity ''Foreclosures'', when a person has committed to an identity to which they never chose;
:*Identity ''Moratorium'', when a person entertains a number of identity choices, but expresses no commitment; and
:*Identity ''Achievement'', when a person has committed to an identity of their own choosing.

:The formation and development of personal and social identity depends both on biological and environmental conditions. Sometimes, these conditions are not ideal; people grow up with certain functional handicaps and dispositions, or they grow up in poor social environments. In these cases, what results is a malformation of identity. There are three kinds of persons who hold malformed identity strategies: 
:*''Refusers'', who outright refuse to enter adulthood, and shun any behavior that would place them within a social system;
:*''Drifters'', who similarly fail to integrate into a social system, and do not place emphasis upon particular identity traits, but seem to pick up and harness their skills in a discontinuous way; and
:*''Searchers'', who are willing to integrate into social systems, but either cannot find an appropriate community, or suffer from low self-esteem which blinds them to the available communities.
: There are also two other identity-formation strategies which seem at least overtly functional:
:*''Guardians'', who have succeeded at integrating into a social system, but without their personal reflection or consent;
:*''Resolvers'', who have both succeeded at integration into a social system and have done so of their own will and cognition. (Cote and Levine)

:A different set of identity strategies have been postulated by postmodernist [[Kenneth Gergen]]. He identifies:
:*''The strategic manipulator'', who feels alienated from previous sources of their identity, and who suffers a burden of having to maintain inauthentic, false impressions with others;
:*''The pastiche personality'', who disregards identity altogether, sees identity as a mere tool, and lives instead upon continuous experience in the world; and
:*''The relational self'', where the actor is seen as merely a part of a greater social whole.

:'''''Topics.''''' Related issues which require explanation are those of [[race]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[sexual orientation]].

[[image:stick-action.gif|thumb|70px|right|Social action]]
The subject of &quot;human nature&quot; often comes up in social philosophy and political discussion. One of the key questions that the topic raises is, &quot;Is humanity inherantly good or bad?&quot;. In other terms, &quot;Is humanity prone to violence, or to peace?&quot; To the extent that an answer can be provided, it will be in shades of grey.

:'''''[[Helping]] (or [[Pro-social behavior]]) and [[apathy|Indifference]]'''''. Why do people sometimes help those in need, and sometimes do nothing? A number of explanations have been created.

:The [[arousal/cost reward model]] claims that the decision to aid is based on a weighting of the costs and rewards involved, both for oneself and others. If the costs outweigh the benefits, then this model predicts that the actor will fail to act. A related model is the ''evolutionary theory of pro-social behavior'', which postulates that helping behavior may have found an instinctual place within human nature in order for parents to aid their children and thus preserve the genetic line. 

:However, the cost-reward and evolutionary theories might at first blush seem to have trouble in showing how and why some people go out of their way to help total strangers, regardless of cost. A contrasting explanation is that of the [[empathy-altruism model]], which explains helping behavior through ''empathy with the victim'' and subsequent ''empathic distress''.

:Both ''cost'' and ''empathy'' models seem to fall short in explaining the [[bystander effect]]. This effect is the social fact that people in crowds are less likely to help someone in need than they would be  were they alone with the victim. Despite feeling empathic distress, and despite  condrelatively low cost in helping, people in crowds seem to suffer from a ''diffusion of responsibility''.

:But what is happening at the cognitive level when people engage in helping behavior? There are two big perspectives on this matter: theory-theory and simulation-theory. [[Theory-theory]] states that empathy is a product of using a rule-oriented &quot;theory of mind&quot;. On the other hand, there is [[simulation-theory]], which argues that empathy occurs when a person imagines the experience of putting themselves in the victim's position.

:Empirical study has shown that there are certain characteristics of a target, context, and situation which make helping more likely. A ''target'' is more likely to be helped if the actor has a positive acquaintanceship or liking to them, the actor sees themselves as similar to target, and the target seems to deserve aid. Helping is most likely to occur when the normative environment smiles upon helping behavior by beneficient rules and expectations in common currency, and if the actor sees helping as a strong part of their identity or role. Also important are the effects of modelling, whereby an actor sees a third party helping the target, and is inspired to copy the act; personal mood; and sense of guilt.

:The consequences of receiving aid depend upon the sort of aid that is given. In many instances, the result is a feeling of gratitude. However, if the aid is excessive, it may create a sense of indebtedness, low self-esteem, and possible resentment in the target.

:'''''[[Aggression]]'''''. Just as we may study the causes of helping behavior, we may also study the reasons and motives behind acts of hostility initiated by one person on another. Suitably, the theories in this field are highly controversial.

:Thinkers in the psychoanalytic tradition have suggested that humanity does have an innate drive towards destruction called Thanatos, or the [[death instinct]] hypothesis. These outlooks tend to see some violence as [[catharsis]].

:Another outlook is the [[frustration-aggression hypothesis]], which is a highly controversial hypothesis that states that all aggression stems from frustration and vice-versa.

:More recent approaches include the [[Aversive emotional arousal]] model and the ''social learning theory of aggression''.

:Research into the causes of '''anti-social personality disorder''' (frequently known as ''psychopathy'') may yield insight into this subject.

:'''''[[Suicide]]'''''. The classic sociological work of [[Emile Durkheim]] on suicide has produced items of worthwhile study for social psychology. According to his theory, suicide may be motivated by the level of integration that the actor has in their social setting. He categorized suicide into  four categories, which reflect four degrees of integration into a social group: [[anomic]], fatalistic, egoistic, and altruistic.

== Communicative action ==
A number of disciplines and subdisciplines examine various facets of communication. Some of these disciplines include: Communications studies, Pragmatics, Semantics, Semiotics, Linguistics, Rhetoric, Sociolinguistics, Sociology of language, and so on. Social psychology may borrow the tools needed to explain social behavior from the work of these other disciplines.

[[image:Soc-psy_comm-persua.gif|center|Communication-persuasion paradigm]]

: '''''Communication-persuasion paradigm.''''' In attempting to understand the ''objective factors'' that are in play when people communicate with one another, the ''communication-persuasion paradigm'' begins with this model of what goes on in human communication:
:* The ''source'' is the person who is trying to influence another person. What makes a good persuader are how credible, trustworthy, attractive, and competent they are. (In linguistics and pragmatics, the intentions of the speaker to make something understood is referred to as the utterance's [[illocutionary force]]);
:* The ''message'' is what the source is trying to convince the target of. Relevant factors include how far the message departs from the target's ideas, whether or not there is an appeal to emotion, and whether or not there is a balance of perspectives;
:* The ''target'' is the person who the source is trying to convince of something. Important to them are the relevance of message to person, their personal desire for cognition, and amount of distractions present;
:* The ''channel'' is the venu that the message is delivered;
:* The ''impact'' is the reaction from the target. This may include an attitude change, a rejection of the message, a counterargument, a suspense of judgment, and/or an attack on the source. (In linguistic and social philosophy, this is often referred to as an utterance's [[perlocutionary force]].)

: In all cases, the plight of those suffering from '''[[aphasia]]''' is of research interest to those who study communication.

One topic of great concern within the scope of communication is the issue of ''[[persuasion]]'', which can be understood as whenever an actor attempts to change another's thoughts or behaviors based on the ''charismatic and/or reasoned'' input. 

:'''''[[Elaboration likelihood model]].''''' This model is one attempt to explain how the process of persuasion works. It states that there are two methods by which a person may be persuaded of some message: through the ''central route'', when the listener logically processes and considers the message and all its implications, or through the ''peripheral route'', when the listener is persuaded for non-rational peripheral cues (such deference to authority, succinctness of message, or if others accept message as well). The model predicts that whether or not a message will provoke an attitude change in the listener depends on whether or not it is interpreted via the central or the peripheral route. If a message provokes an attitude change on the basis of superficial information, it may be temporarily adopted, but is less likely to be resilient or defended in the face of criticism. On the other hand, if a message goes through the central route, and passes the subject's reasonings, it will be more resiliently held in the future.

:'''''[[Social impact theory]].''''' Trying to explain the objective conditions where any particular message will have social influence, Latane, Jackson, and Sedikides emphasized the importance of three characteristics of the sources in their ''social impact theory''.
:* ''Social Strength'' of the actors involved, for example power and social status
:* ''Immediacy'', or the physical / psychological distance between actors
:* ''Number of Sources Present''

:'''''[[Functionalism (sociology)]].''''' For ''functionalism'', the achievement of goals relative to the normative background is important. To the extent that a) an action is beneficial towards the achievement of a goal, and b) the goal and/or means are compatible with the normative goals and means of some group or society, the act is considered ''functional'' in that respect / relative to that goal. Conversely, to the extent that a) the act is an obstacle to achieving a desired goal, and b) the goal fits the normative background of some group or society, the act is considered ''dysfunctional'' in that respect.

:'''''Subjective factors in persuasion.''''' ''Symbolic interactionism'' stresses the importance of the way the actor ''subjectively perceives'' persons in the world in order to explain how persuasion occurs. Following their models, a person may be more likely to be persuaded when the persuader is more in line with the thoughts and opinions of:
:* the '''[[generalized other]]''' - the actor's notion of the normal expectations of others;
:* the opinions of '''[[significant other]]s''' - the actor's idea of the expectations of special persons; ie, parents, children, spouse, friends.
:Erving Goffman wrote in the same tradition, making sense of human interaction using insights gained from the theories and methods of '''''dramaturgy'''''. For Goffman, two crucial concepts are those of the ''front region'' and ''back region'', which are the &quot;on-stage&quot; and &quot;off-stage&quot; personae which a person has -- those roles which are played for the benefit of others, and those played without others as much in mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:soc_psy_relation.gif|thumb|70px|right|Social relationships]]
For the purposes of this article, a ''relationship'' is any ''association'' between persons, amounting to ''mutual familiarity'', ''mutual awareness of one another's identities'', and ''meaningful understanding of their relations to one another''. In some literature, the word &quot;relationship&quot; is meant to be synonymous with &quot;romantic relationships&quot;, but this category will use the word in a variety of senses. There are a variety of sub-areas within this field of social psychology. The two primary area are interpersonal attraction and close relationship theories. 

:'''''[[Interpersonal attraction]]  

How do people become friends? Lovers? What makes an individual like one person, but not another? How could two people who live on the 3rd floor of a dorm and not be friends, but both are friends with the people who live by the mailboxes on the first floor? Studies on interpersonal attraction have explored both how people become friends and romantic partners. In general, the factors involved with interpersonal attraction are the same regardless of the type of relationship. In this section, we explore the various factors that impact interpersonal attraction.

:''''''''''[[Physical attractiveness]]'''''''''' (under construction)

:'''''''''''''''[[Evolutionary theory]]''''''''''''''' (Buss, 198X)

:'''''''''''''''[[Sociocultural theory]]'''''''''''''''

:'''''''''''''''[[Integrated theory]]''''''''''''''' (Eagly &amp; Wood, 1999; 2013; Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002; 2013) - 2013 dates may be inaccurate, should reflect articles in American Psychologist and Current Directions in Psychologcal Science

In the late 1990s, Eagly and Wood attempted to find common ground between the evolutionary and sociocultural extremes that had been argued throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. They argued that both perspectives admit some limitations, but both perspectives have been slow at accepting this new theoretical perspective - the biosocial theory. Despite the promise of this approach, this theoretical perspective is often often misinterpreted and labeled as sociocultural (see later Eagly and Wood papers mentioned above).  

:''''''''''Propinquity''''''''''  (under construction)

How could two people who live on the 3rd floor of a dorm and not be friends, but both are friends with the people who live by the mailboxes on the first floor? The concept of propinquity explains this phenomena. Specifically, people become attracted to others who are functionally closer to them. By functionally closer, it is meant that the situation forces two persons paths to cross regularly. Using the initial example, two people who live at opposite ends of the hall in a dorm may rarely, if ever, cross paths if they are able to use opposite staircases to leave the building. However, both may be friends with the people by the mailboxes because having to check the mail regularly forces each of the 3rd floor residents to regularly cross paths with the individuals living near the mailboxes. 

This form of attractiveness relies on the '''mere exposure effect'''(citation needed). Research on the mere exposure effect found that people who were regularly exposed to another individual, regardless of if they ever spoke, would find the the person they were exposed to as more attractive. The commonly cited study (citation need) found that students in an introductory psychology course rated a picture of a confederate as more attractive at the end of the semester if that semester sat in on the course for half of the course meetings, or even a quarter of the meetings, than those who never had any exposure to the confederate. This was the case despite the fact that the confederate never had any interaction with any of the students in the courses she sat in on. (this needs to be edited for detail accuracy, but the general study is properly described)

:''''''''''Similarity'''''''''' (under construction)

People with similar opinions, political or otherwise, tend to be more attracted to each other.

:'''''Maintaining Relationships'''''

:''''''''''Attachment Theory'''''''''' (under construction) (Bowlby, 195X; Ainsworth, 197X; adult - Shaver, 198X-200X; Mikulincear, 200X; Feeney, 199X-201X)

:''''''''''''''''Anxious Attachment''''''''''''''''

:'''''''''''''''Avoidant Attachment''''''''''''''''

:''''''''''Interdependence Theory'''''''''' (under construction)

:''''''''''''''''Investment Model of Commitment'''''''''''''''' (Rusbult et al., 1970s to 2014) 

One form of relationship is the romantic relationship. Studies into human dating and attraction investigate the way that norms, [[propinquity]], threat, familiarity, availability, similarity, [[attractiveness]], trust, and dependence have on creating friendly relationships. One theory in this field is the [[matching hypothesis]], which postulates that an actor will attempt to find a mate who matches their level of social desirability.

:'''''[[Power (sociology)|Power]]'''''. Power is the ability to cause an actor to behave or think in a way despite their internal desire to do otherwise. This subject involves an investigation into the nature and causes of [[authority]], which may involve investigation into the [[authoritarian personality]]. There are, in general, six techniques in the use and maintenance of power: the viable promise to provide ''rewards'', the ability to provide viable threats, [[referent power]], an appeal to roles within a social structure, the power of information, and a viable appeal to expertise.

:Power is also established by ''[[Dependency (sociology)|dependency]]'' of some actor(s) upon other(s) for the provision of their wants and/or needs.

:'''''[[Trust (sociology)]]'''''. Trust is the actor's belief in the competence and/or benevolence of another actor. In social cognition, it is important to understand how trust impacts how actors behave and think based on the behaviors and words of others.

In the theory of collective behavior, it is important to separate the ''organized'' action of a group from the ''diffuse, aggregated'' actions of individuals. Both are of interest to social psychologists, since they have to do with a mass of people. However, groups have common interactions and relationships within it, while the interactions and relationships within an aggregate are diffused.

For the purposes of social psychology at the wider level, there are two fundamental worries. First, what acts as the '''catalyst for emergence''' of groups and norms, and what maintains those social forms? Second, how do '''social perceptions''' occur, especially with respect to primary socialization?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:soc-psy_aggregate.gif|thumb|70px|right|Aggregate action]]
:'''''[[Collective behavior]]''''' is any instance of a large collective (either group or aggregate) engaging in some action. Of special attention are the behaviors of ''[[Social movement]]s'' and ''[[Aggregate behavior]]s'', which shed some light into the fundamental questions of what causes, maintains, and structures a society. One sort of such behavior is [[herd behavior]]. [[J-curve theory]] predicts social revolutionary change to occur when an intolerable gap develops between people's ''expected satisfaction of needs'' and their ''actual satisfaction of needs''.

:'''''[[Self]] in social context ([[social structure]], [[population density]])'''''. Examines the influence of personal factors (personality, health, alienation, status, and values) on one's position in various kinds of group structures.

:'''''[[Dissent]], [[Deviance]] and reactions to deviance'''''. Examines the role of habitual mindsets and social functions on the existence of norms, as well as the impact of labeling and social controls on deviance. Deviance is always relative to norms, which are revealed via [[breaching experiment]]s.

:This field has aroused many explanations. [[Anomie theory]] considers some deviance to be a result of persons trying to achieve a cultural goal but lacking the appropriate resources or means to do so. [[Strain theory (sociology)]] explains deviance in terms of social strain. [[Differential association theory]] understands deviance to occur when the definitions and meanings that support deviant acts are learned. [[Control theory (sociology)]] explains deviant behavior as a product of being influenced by other persons. [[Labeling theory]] believes that the reaction that people have to rule violations can have a compelling effect on deviants, either in reinforcing or discouraging it. Finally, the [[routine activities perspective]] considers how deviance occurs out of the routines of everyday life.

== 1.  Explain the difference in food value between whole wheat flour and white flour. ==
Whole wheat retains the bran and germ as well as the endosperm, in contrast to white flour which retains only the endosperm. 

Whole wheat foods are nutritionally superior to refined grains, richer in dietary fiber, antioxidants, protein (and in particular the amino acid lysine), dietary minerals (including magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and selenium), and vitamins (including niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin E). 

The greater amount of dietary fiber, as much as four times than found in refined grains, is likely the most important benefit, as it has been shown to reduce the incidence of some forms of cancer, digestive system diseases, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Some of these protective effects occur because carbohydrates from whole grains are digested and enter the bloodstream more slowly, avoiding the &quot;sugar rush.&quot;

== 2. Describe the effects of yeast in bread making. ==
Yeast interacts chemically with sugar in warm water to provide leavening.  This allows the bread to &quot;rise&quot;.

In more detail, yeasts make up a group of single-celled fungi, a few species of which are commonly used to leaven bread.  In the absence of oxygen, yeasts produce their energy by converting sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. In baking, the carbon dioxide raises the bread and the ethanol evaporates.

== 3.  Give one Old Testament and one New Testament incident where leavening is mentioned. ==

'''Old Testament:'''
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2012:34-39;&amp;version=31; Exodus 12:34 &amp; 39] -- The Israelites prepared unleavened bread for the first Passover

'''New Testament:'''
Jesus mentioned leavening several times including:  [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:33&amp;version=31 Matthew 13:33]; 
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013:20-21;&amp;version=31; Luke 13:20, 21]

Jesus compares the Pharisees to leaven in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:6-12;&amp;version=31; Matthew 16:6-12]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:15;&amp;version=31; Mark 8:15]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:1%20;&amp;version=31; Luke 12:1]

== 4.  Prepare whole grain bread (can be wheat, rye, oatmeal, etc.). ==

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
| name = Whole Wheat Bread (Vegan)
| ingredients =     
* 1 C warm water (105-115 degrees F)
* 2 T (or 2 packages) of active dry yeast
* 1 pinch unrefined sugar
* 1 C soy milk
* 1/3 C (packed) unrefined sugar
* 3 T vegan butter or margarine
* 1 T salt
* 1 1/2 C walnuts (optional)
* 1/4 C soft tofu (mashed), stir until chunks are minimal (egg replacer or 1 T ground flax seed also works)
* 2 1/2 C cups fine-milled or medium-milled whole wheat flour
* 3 7/8 C unbleached all-purpose white flour
| procedure = 
#In a small bowl stir up the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, add a pinch of unrefined sugar. Let the yeast activate for 10 minutes.
#To a large mixing bowl add the other 1/2 cup water, milk, unrefined sugar, melted vegan margarine, salt, tofu, and whole wheat flour. Stir with wooden spoon until creamy.
#Add the yeast mixture which should be foamy by now. Add walnuts. Add in the unbleached wheat flour a little at a time. Stir until the dough is too thick for the spoon then put the dough on a lightly fluored cutting board or counter top and mix by hand. When all the flour is added, knead dough for around 5-7 minutes. Cover dough with a towel and let rise for around 1 to 1.5 hours. Dough should double in size.
#Knock the dough down once then place 2 equal portions of the dough into 2 greased pans. If you want the loaves to look fancy do this: roll dough into 4 separate dough &quot;snakes&quot;. Twist 2 of these together to make a nice looking intertwined loaf. Let rise about 45 minutes.
#Brush tops of loaves with melted margarine (keeps them from drying out) and dust with cinnamon, uncooked oatmeal or white flour (aesthetics). Bake in oven preheated to 375F for around 35 minutes. When done, loaves will sound hollow when tapped.

== 6.  Explain why the use of baking powder and soda should be avoided and why the mixture of milk, sugar, and eggs is harmful to health. ==

;Baking soda and baking powder: In ''The Ministry of Healing'', Ellen White wrote that baking  soda and baking powder should not be used for making bread.  She wrote, &quot;Soda causes inflammation of the stomach and often poisons the entire system.&quot;

;Milk, sugar, and eggs: When these ingredients are mixed and eaten, they ferment in the abdomen, giving the same effect as alcohol products.

== 7.  How do you test a cake for being done? How do you keep a cake from &quot;falling&quot;? ==

You can test to see if a cake is done by inserting a toothpick or butter knife carefully into the ''center'' of the cake.  If it comes out clean without any &quot;cake goo&quot; attached, then the cake is done.  

You can keep a cake from falling by not introducing a cake to temperatures drastically different from the oven too quickly and by not slamming the door on the oven before the cake is done.

== 8.  Prepare two of the following ==
===a. Cake from basic ingredients (any flavor)===
See the Wikibook [[Cookbook]] recipes for [[Cookbook:Dessert#Cakes, Cupcakes|Cakes and Cupcakes]].  Remember that you can use soymilk instead of cow's milk.  In cake recipes calling for eggs, you can substitute a half banana and a quarter cup of apple sauce.

===b. Cake from a mix (any flavor)===
The best advice we can give here is to buy a mix and follow the directions on the package.  Cake mixes were introduced to the market in the 1950s, though they were not initially well received.  At that time, the only thing the homemaker needed to do was add water, blend, pour it in a pan, and bake.  Marketeers determined that homemakers did not like this because it did not feel enough like &quot;homemade&quot; so they omitted powdered eggs from the mix and had the homemaker add fresh eggs along with the water.  As soon as this change was made to the formulation, sales skyrocketed.

It should be noted however, that it is perhaps impossible to find a cake mix that does not use either baking powder or baking soda, or the combination of eggs, milk, and sugar (see requirement 6).  However, 3 tablespoons of water plus 1 tablespoon of either cornstarch or ground flax seed makes a good egg-substitute.

===c. Fruit or nut cake or loaf cake===
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
|name = Fruit Nut Cake
|ingredients=
* 4 ounces dark raisins
* 4 ounces mixed dried fruit (dates, cranberries, or raisins)
* 8 ounces lightly toasted and chopped nuts
* 1 cup orange juice
* 1 cup packed brown sugar or maple syrup
* 1⅔ cups water
* 4 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp cloves
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 3 cups unsifted wholewheat pastry flour or all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 tsps orange or lemon zest
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* oil to grease the pan
* Powdered sugar to dust
|procedure =
* Soak the dried fruit in orange juice in the refrigerator overnight.
* Transfer the fruit to a pot containing 1⅔ cups water
* Add sugar, applesauce, orange zest, and spices.
* Bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes, and turn off the heat
* Preheat oven to 350°F
* Add lemon juice and vanilla to the fruit mixture and allow it to cool to room temperature
* Grease a bundt pan
* Fold in the flour, baking soda, and nuts
* Spoon the batter into the bundt pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  This can take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour.
* Cool for a few minutes, and then turn it out onto a cooling rack.
* Dust the cake with powdered sugar.
}}

===d. Sponge cake===
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
|name = Sponge Cake
|ingredients =
* 2 cups self-raising flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 1/2 cup water
* 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
* 4 Tbsp fruit jam (any flavor)
* 1.25 cups cream
|procedure =
# Preheat oven to 325°F
# Grease two pans and line them with baking parchment
# Sift the flour, baking soda, and sugar into a large bowl
# Using a second bowl, mix the oil, juice, water, and vanilla extract with a whisk
# Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and beat until the mixture is smooth.
# Pour the batter into the two pans, and bake for 30 minutes
# Allow the cakes to cool in the pans, then turn out onto a cooling rack.
# Whip the cream
# Sandwich the two layers together using the jam and whipped cream.

== 9.  Make one pie in each of the following categories ==
===a. Baked, any fruit, including lemon===
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
|name = Berry Pie
|ingredients =
* Double crust
** 2 cups all-purpose flour
** 1/3 cup shortening
** 5-6 Tablespoons water
* Pie filling
** 5 cups blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or a mix of them (fresh or frozen)
** 3/4 cup sugar
** 1/3 cup flour
** 1.5 Tablespoons lemon juice
|procedure = 
'''Double Crust'''
# Cut the shortening into the flour until it is reduced to pea-sized chunks
# Add a tablespoon of water to the center, and mix it in with a fork.  Move the dampened mix to the side and add another tablespoon of water.  Repeat until you have used 5-6 tablespoons of water.
# Divide the dough in half, and form into two equal-size balls.
# Lightly flour your work surface and roll one dough ball out into a 12&quot; circle.
# Pick up the dough by wrapping it around the rolling pin.  Transport it to a 9&quot; pie pan and lay it in, being careful to not stretch the dough.

'''Pie filling'''
# Mix the sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl.
# Add the berries, and toss until they are coated.
# If the berries were frozen, allow them to sit for 15-30 minutes (but don't let them completely thaw).
# Pour the filling into the pie pan (previously lined with the bottom crust).  The filling will mound to an alarming height, but do not worry - it will compact as it bakes.
# Roll out the top crust until you have another 12&quot; circle.
# Pick up the top crust with the rolling pin and carefully lay it over the berry mound.
# Pinch the edges to seal the top and bottom crusts together.
# Cut off any crust that extends over the edge of the pie pan.
# Make several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.  Be creative here.
# Cover the pie with a sheet of aluminium foil that has had a 6&quot; circle cut from the center.  This will protect the edges of the crust and keep them from becoming overdone.
# Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes (fresh berries) or 50 minutes (frozen berries)
# Remove the aluminium foil and bake an additional 20 minutes.
# Place on a wire rack to cool.
# Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

===b. Unbaked (baked pie shell only), fresh fruit, gelatin, etc.===
See the [[Cookbook:Banana Cream Pie|Banana Cream Pie]] recipe in the Wikibooks [[Cookbook]].

== 10.  Make and bake one recipe of cookies. Make one recipe of refrigerator cookies. It is preferable to use wholesome ingredients such as fruit, oatmeal, nuts, etc. ==

By definition, refrigerator cookies are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become even stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. Refrigerator cookies are any type of cookie where the dough needs chilled before baking the cookies.

Examples of refrigerator cookies include:
*Gingerbread cookies
*Most &quot;cookie cutter&quot; cookies
*Some types of chocolate chip cookies.

== 11.  Prepare recipe file for all of the items required above and any others desired. See  how many recipes you can find using fruit without large amounts of sugar. ==

Try one of many recipe sites online such as recipesource.com.  Or, even better, use this as an opportunity to learn recipes that your parents and grandparents have made over the years!  Be sure that you include your favorite recipes!

== wrong powers == 
&lt;pre&gt;
Loops can be nested. The following code prints powers 2 through 4 of the integers from 1 to 10
 do i=1,10
    do ipower=1,3
       print*,i,ipower,i**ipower
    end do
 end do
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't you mean powers 1 through 3?

== missing logical statement ==

there's a .NE. (not equal), I would put it in myself, but don't remember off-hand what the symbolic representation is (might be /=).
[[User:82.13.83.244|82.13.83.244]] 11:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

== Good code practice ==

This is part of the article:

Arguments to the do loop don't have to be numbers, they can be any integer that is defined elsewhere in the program. ''start, end,'' and ''increment'' can be any variable name.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=start,end,increment
     ''code goes here''
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;

I don't know whether this will even compile or not, but using ''end'' as a variable name is not the greatest idea. Consider changing this in the article.

      <comment>/* Style */ whether ALL CAPS is more readable is debatable</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Style==

Older versions of Fortran had strict guidelines on how a program was formatted. However new versions, especially Fortran 90 and above have modernized, allowing more flexibility.


Originally Fortran required all statements to be in ALL CAPS, and in fact the language itself was called FORTRAN (in caps). It remains a bit customary, though completely unnecessary, to put Fortran commands in ALL CAPS.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 PROGRAM test
 IMPLICIT NONE
 INTEGER four
 four = 4
 WRITE (*,*) four
 END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;

Whitespace and empty lines usually won't matter in F90 or above, but in rare cases errors will pop up. However, unlike many other languages such as C, C++, and Java, the line delimiter ';' is optional, so each line of code may stay on its own line!

==Structure==

*There is a GOTO command, but don't use it too much.
*Use DO loops early and often. 
*Encapsulate your code into functions and subroutines making it easier to program at higher levels, and allowing others to understand whats going on. 
*Comment your code well. Don't comment every line, but explain how everything works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Existence of God

In this world, many beliefs exist about God. As a result, people understand God in their own way and often in their own imagination. But what is required is the understanding God as He is, what He is and how He is. The correct understanding about God has to be given by God Himself!

There are some who don't believe in the existence of God, often the reason being His existence cannot be proved like that of human beings. But because we cannot see God with the gross eyes, it doesn't mean that God doesn't exist. Just like wind, which cannot be seen but can be very much felt, it is possible to experience God's presence through Godly knowledge and meditation.

Who is God and what is His form and name? 
We shall now try to understand who God or the Supreme Soul is. The term 'Supreme Soul' means He is supreme among all souls. It implies that, He is also 'a soul', though He is the Highest of all. He is above birth and death. God is the Supreme Father-Mother, Supreme teacher and Supreme Preceptor to all the human beings and He himself has no father-mother, teacher and preceptor. 

God is a subtle, infinitesimal point of Light. He is not visible to the naked eye but it is very much possible to experience His presence and proximity in meditation. He is incorporeal in the sense that he does not have a body of his own. He is not a human being nor does He have a human form. He is immune to pleasure and pain unlike human beings.

Names are a means of identification of human beings after they are born. They do not speak of qualities and actions of the person; they are simply proper nouns and are not attributive names. But the name of the supreme soul or God is based on His qualities and actions. His self-revealed name is 'Shiva'. 'Shiva' means doer of good or benefactor. God does good to all and therefore He is called Shiva. All souls ask for salvation and beatitude i.e. peace and happiness from Him. People remember Him by many other expressive names.

His Virtues
God is the Supreme Father of all. He is called the creator. He is oceanic in his virtues - the ocean of peace, the ocean of love, the ocean of bliss, the ocean of knowledge, the ocean of happiness, the ocean of mercy, etc. He is the truth. He is the Almighty and Authority. He is reputed to be the preserver or sustainer of virtues and the destroyer of all evils. He is also the liberator, the guide, and the bestower of salvation, therefore the sadguru. He dispels sorrow, bestows joy. God is perfect in all ways and absolutely detached and loving. He is very benevolent and helpful and so souls ask all things of him. When in sorrow and losing all hope, souls turn to him intuitively and inevitably. 

Many are the religions and paths that souls take in their quest for reaching God. Many wars have been waged in his name. However, he does not exclusively belong to anyone. He belongs to everyone equally.

The Supreme Father of all Souls
God is the father of all souls in this world. It is observed that all religions have images, idols or memorials bearing one name or another to represent the form of Light that God is. All over India, the images of the form that Shiva has is found installed; these images are without any human form, in the form of linga, which is the symbol of an incorporeal Being. At Mecca, in the holy place of Kaaba, a stone image with oval form is called &quot;Sang-e-Aswad&quot;. The devotes who go for Haj kiss this holy stone. Jesus Christ said, &quot;God is Light&quot;. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism also sang the praise of Him who is 'All-Light' ( ek Omkar) and is incorporeal. In olden days, the Jews held a stone of this shape in their hands while taking a solemn oath and it is believed that Moses had vision of this form of God when he saw a flame behind the bush. The Zoroastrians worship God as fire. The ancient Egyptians worshipped the sun as god. A Buddhist sect in Japan focuses the mind on a small oval shape. They call it Karni, the peace giver. 

It seems therefore that human beings, without realizing, have all been worshipping and trying to discover the same God. There is only one God and His form is a point of light. He is called by different names in different religions. 

The Divine Abode of God
Where does God live? Is there somewhere one can go to see Him, to be with Him? God is a subtle point of light, and He does not pervade the physical universe. Nor does he live in the heart of any human being or in any matter. Neither is He omnipresent; nor is He having a human form. His home is the incorporeal world, an infinite expanse of golden-red light, which is beyond this physical world we live. It is the original abode of all souls as well. The incorporeal world is known as Paramdham or Brahmlok. Knowing where the Supreme Father is, we can establish connection with Him through thoughts during meditation.

The Divine Descent of God
God descends into this world when it is under the spell of extreme darkness of ignorance, unrighteousness, moral turpitude, spiritual lassitude and religious decrepitude. This is described in scriptures as &quot;Dharma Glani&quot;. Looking at the state of affairs today, it should not be difficult for us to conclude that the time the world is undergoing at present is indeed the Dharma Glani. This is the period of darkness when sins and crimes of all kinds usually take place; when man gropes around for want of clear vision. It is at this time that God intervenes in the affairs of mankind. The divine intervention takes place at the darkest hour of human history when the human soul is groping in the darkness of ignorance about the self, the creator and the creation; when the souls are blinded by the vices of lust, arrogance, anger, greed and attachment. 

It is in this time that God descends in the body of an ordinary man to reveal the Godly Knowledge, which paves way to victory over vices and cultivate divine qualities in life. This enables human beings to transform into divine beings again.</text>

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Informal Conventions =

Our predicate language, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, like &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is fairly ugly and difficult to read.  The superscripts and subscripts are distracting, and we have multiplied parentheses well beyond necessity.  As with sentential logic, will informally use a less cumbersome variant.  The official language, however, is still used for definitions formalities and other formalities.  Most of the rules for generating informal variants of will be familiar from sentential logic.

== Transformation rules ==

We create informal variants of official &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; formulae as follows.  The examples are cumulative.

* We drop a subscript if it is '0'.  Thus we write &lt;math&gt;a^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;a^2_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and write &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We cannot drop the subscript from &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^0_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* The official grammar requires operation letters and predicate letters to have the superscript indicating the number of places.  For example, &lt;math&gt;a^2_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a two-place operation letter and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a three place predicate letter.  In most cases, we can drop the superscript and let the context show the number of places.  For example, we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;a(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Here we observe from the context that the operation letter has two places, thus leaving it understood that &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an informal variant of &lt;math&gt;a^2_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, we observe from the context that the predicate letter in

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x, y, z)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: has three places.  This makes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, as used in this context, an informal variant of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This convention assumes our &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to be grammatically correct.  In general, we will not be trafficking in grammatically incorrect expressions.  We will also try to avoid, for example, using &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^1_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in close proximity.  Otherwise, their informal variant could cause confusion.

* We will omit outermost parentheses.  For example, we will write

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: instead of

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(y_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* We will let a series of the same binary connective associate on the right.  For example, we can transform the official

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land (\mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: into the informal

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \land \mathrm{H}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: However, the best we can do with 

:: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \land \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:is

::&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \land \mathrm{H}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* We will use precedence rankings to omit internal parentheses when possible.  For example, we will regard &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as having lower precedence (wider scope) than &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This allows us to write

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: instead of

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow (\mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0) \lor \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0)))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: However, we cannot remove the internal perentheses from

:: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Our informal variant of this latter formula is 

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Precedence and scope ==

Precedence rankings indicate the order that we evaluate the sentential connectives and quantifier phrases.  &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has a higher precedence than &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in evaluating

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\ ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we start by evaluating

: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

first.  Scope is the length of expression that is governed by the connective.  The occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) has a wider scope than the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) governs the whole sentence while the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) governs only the occurrence of (2) in (1).

The full ranking from highest precedence (narrowest scope) to lowest precedence (widest scope) is:

{| cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lnot,\ \forall x,\ \exists x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || highest precedence (narrowest scope)
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || lowest precedence (widest scope)
|}

Quantifier phrases have the same precedence as negation signs.

== Examples ==

The following examples are predicate logic variants of the examples at the sentential logic [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Informal Conventions|Informal Conventions]] page.  First,

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor ((\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be written informally as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Second,

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \lnot \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be written informally as

: (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \lnot \mathrm{G}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Some unnecessary parentheses may prove helpful. In the two examples above, the informal variants may be easier to read as

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \lnot \mathrm{G}(x))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Note that the informal formulae

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are restored to its official form as

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\forall x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\exists x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, the informal formula

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is restored to its official form as

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x_0 (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x_0 (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

[[File:Cuba LomaCunagua Ecotourism.jpg|right|400px| Cuba, Loma de Cunagua Nature Reserve.]]

In industrial countries, mass tourism and recreation are now fast overtaking the extractive industries as the largest threat to indigenous communities, and 'pristine' environments.  These are destinations that tourists now want to visit. Attractive landscape sites, such as sandy beaches, lakes, riversides, and mountaintops and slopes, are often transitional zones, characterized by species-rich ecosystems. Typical physical impacts include the degradation of such ecosystems. The ecosystems most threatened with degradation are ecologically fragile areas such as alpine regions, rain forests, wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs and sea grass beds. The threats to, and pressures on, these ecosystems are often severe because such places are very attractive to both tourists and developers. Since 1945, visits to the 10 most popular mountainous national parks in the United States have increased twelvefold. In the European Alps, tourism now exceeds 100 million visitor-days. Every year in the Indian Himalaya, more than 250,000 Hindu pilgrims, 25,000 trekkers, and 75 mountaineering expeditions climb to the sacred source of the Ganges River, the Gangotri Glacier. They deplete local forests for firewood, trample riparian vegetation, and strew litter. Even worse, this tourism frequently induces poorly planned, land-intensive development. 

Negative impacts from tourism occur when the level of visitor use is greater than the environment's ability to cope with this use within the acceptable limits of change. Uncontrolled conventional tourism poses potential threats to many natural areas around the world. It can put enormous pressure on an area and lead to impacts such as soil erosion, increased pollution, discharges into the sea, natural habitat loss, increased pressure on endangered species and heightened vulnerability to forest fires. It often forces local populations to compete for the use of other critical resources. Tourism development can put pressure on natural resources when it increases consumption in areas where resources are already scarce. Water, and especially fresh water, is one of the most critical natural resources. Tourism can also create great pressure on other local resources like energy, food, and other raw materials that may already be in short supply. Greater extraction and transport of these resources exacerbates the physical impacts associated with their exploitation. Because of the seasonal character of the industry, many destinations have ten times more inhabitants in the high season as in the low season. A high demand is placed upon these resources to meet the high expectations tourists often have (proper heating, hot water, etc.).  Important land resources include minerals, fossil fuels, fertile soil, forests, wetland and wildlife. Increased construction of facilites for tourism and recreational has increased the pressure on these resources and on scenic landscapes. Direct impact on natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable, in the provision of tourist facilities can be caused by the use of land for accommodation and other infrastructure provision, and the use of building materials.

Tourism can cause the same forms of pollution as any other industry: air emissions, noise, solid waste and littering, releases of sewage, oil and chemicals, even architectural/visual pollution. Transport by air, road, and rail is continuously increasing in response to the rising number of tourists and their greater mobility. To give an indication, the number of international air passengers worldwide rose from 88 million in 1972 to 344 million in 1994. One consequence of this continuing increase in air transport is that tourism now accounts for more than 60% of air travel and is therefore responsible for an important share of air emissions. One study estimated that a single transatlantic return flight emits almost half the CO2 emissions produced by all other sources (lighting, heating, car use, etc.) consumed by an average person yearly.  Transport emissions and emissions from energy production and use are linked to acid rain, global warming and photochemical pollution. Air pollution from tourist transportation has impacts on the global level, especially from carbon dioxide emissions related to transportation energy use. And it can contribute to severe local air pollution. Some of these impacts are quite specific to tourist activities. For example, especially in very hot or cold countries, tour buses often leave their motors running for hours while the tourists go out for an excursion because they want to return to a comfortably air-conditioned bus. 

In areas with high concentrations of tourist activities and appealing natural attractions, waste disposal is a serious problem and improper disposal can be a major despoiler of the natural environment - rivers, scenic areas, and roadsides. For example, cruise ships in the Caribbean are estimated to produce more than 70,000 tons of waste each year. Today some cruise lines are actively working to reduce waste-related impacts. Solid waste and littering can degrade the physical appearance of the water and shoreline and cause the death of marine animals. 

Construction of hotels, recreation and other facilities often leads to increased sewage pollution. Wastewater has polluted seas and lakes surrounding tourist attractions, damaging the flora and fauna. Sewage runoff causes serious damage to coral reefs because it stimulates the growth of algae, which cover the filter-feeding corals, hindering their ability to survive. Changes in salinity and siltation can have wide-ranging impacts on coastal environments. And sewage pollution can threaten the health of humans and animals.

Often tourism fails to integrate its structures with the natural features and indigenous architectural of the destination. Large, dominating resorts of disparate design can look out of place in any natural environment and may clash with the indigenous structural design. A lack of land-use planning and building regulations in many destinations has facilitated sprawling developments along coastlines, valleys and scenic routes. The sprawl includes tourism facilities themselves and supporting infrastructure such as roads, employee housing, parking, service areas, and waste disposal.

Tourists using the same off road trail over and over again trample the vegetation and soil, eventually causing damage that can lead to loss of biodiversity. Such damage can be even more extensive when visitors frequently stray off established trails. Wildlife viewing can bring about stress for the animals and alter their natural behavior when tourists come too close. Safaris and wildlife watching activities have a degrading effect on habitat as they often are accompanied by the noise and commotion created by tourists as they chase wild animals in their trucks and aircraft. This puts high pressure on animal habits and behaviors and tends to bring about behavioral changes. In some cases, as in Kenya, it has led to animals becoming so disturbed that at times they neglect their young or fail to mate. 

After decades of sustained growth in volume and visibility, tourism is now one of the leading global industries (11% of global GDP) and one of the major migratory movements in modern society (about 700 million international travelers in 2001), producing significant impacts on resource consumption, pollution, and social systems. It can be compared in its deleterious impacts and environmental risks to any other major industry. On the other hand, tourism is a unique tool for awareness building and learning for guests and hosts alike. Sound natural and cultural environments are its basic assets, while peace is one of its basic requirements.

Fortunately there is an encouraging 'greening' of mainstream tourism.   Greater sustainability in the industry as a whole will have the largest impact on overall wildlife protection, and on communities and individuals. But 'nature-based tourism' will play a crucial role in the communities and natural environments under the greatest pressure from the development of tourism. 

Nature Tourism, often referred to as Ecotourism, was introduced to the tourist industry in the early 1980s. Nature tourism attracts tourists with an interest in temporarily living in, and coming to better understand a specific, novel, relatively natural ecosystem. Its primary focus is on experiencing natural areas that fosters environmental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conservation. Nature tourism was initially connected with outdoor travel to remote, unique, and/or scenic areas. Although in its early stages there was a strong educational aspect, this was not a crucial or required element to the industry or the consumer. However, as the demand has increased, the inclusion of ecology as an integral educational element has become increasingly important.  This is why nature tourism is an important topic in applied ecology.

Since its conception, nature tourism has grown to include an entire methodology of planning, conservation management, and economics. It is becoming a robust and encompassing process that not only includes site information, but also considers the sustainability of the ecosystem, conservation management, education, equitable social benefits, and community responsibility. Nature Tourism now includes several major principles:

* Education about the area 
* Sustainable use of resources, and avoidance of degradation 
* Enhancement of local community and assistance in development 
* Respect for cultural/social/political aspects of local people 
* Profit from the tourism industry providing a boost to the local economy 

Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife. Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem. An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.  The returns to an individual from the experience have been described as potentially life-changing or at least memorable, and the development of new skills and knowledge.  Since the mid-1990's nature tourism has emerged as a human activity distinct from adventure travel.  Packages tend to be marketed as a more politically correct, environmentally and culturally aware&quot; form of tourism, e.g., responsible travel to natural areas that conserve the environment and improve the well-being of local people.  In this sense nature tourism is being increasingly recognized as a tool for sustainable development. Achieving this aim is a challenge, because high standards have to be met. But when it is achieved, communities and natural environments are the immediate beneficiaries. 

However, despite their &quot;green image&quot;, few nature tourism packages contribute a positive benefit to the global environment.  A major contradiction comes from considering the environmental impact of the energy consumed in transportation to the exotic location. One study estimated that a single transatlantic return flight emits almost half the CO2 emissions produced by all other sources (lighting, heating, car use, etc.) consumed by an average person yearly.  Arrival also introduces its own set of problems. As in any tourist activity, adverse impacts are ever present, such as cultural erosion and atmospheric pollution, and the drain on local natural resources to provide Western living standards as enclaves in Third World countries.  Problems of sustainability are also evident in the developed countries.  For example in winter 2000, 76,271 people entered Yellowstone National Park on snowmobiles, outnumbering the 40,727 visitors who came in cars, 10,779 in snowcoaches and 512 on skis. A survey of snowmobile impacts on natural sounds at Yellowstone found that snowmobile noise could be heard 70% of the time at 11 of 13 sample sites, and 90% of the time at 8 sites. At the Old Faithful geyser, snowmobiles could be heard 100% of the time during the daytime period studied. Snowmobile noise drowned out even the sound of the geyser erupting. In Yosemite National Park, the number of roads and facilities have been increased to keep pace with the growing visitor numbers and to supply amenities, infrastructure and parking lots for tourists. These actions have caused habitat loss in the park and are accompanied by various forms of pollution including air pollution from automobile emissions; the Sierra Club has reported &quot;smog so thick that Yosemite Valley could not be seen from airplanes&quot;. This occasional smog is harmful to all species and vegetation inside the Park. Such issues are being addressed by planning and managing destinations, setting up institutional partnerships and the continued development of environmentally friendly technology. 

The concept of ecotourism has come into common use in the last decade.  It describes a goal towards which tourism entrepreneurs, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities have been aiming at for much longer. A definition put forward by The Ecotourism Society in 1991 describes it as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and sustains the well-being of local people.' Professionals working within the field of ecotourism generally agree that 'ecotourism' stands out within the area of nature tourism by: 

*Travel to a natural area. 
*Travel that supports the conservation of biodiversity. 
*Travel that brings benefits to local host communities. 
*Travel that leads to greater understanding of the natural or cultural environment visited. 

Including these four components in a travel package significantly restricts the number of tourism products that can genuinely be labelled ecotourism. To some people, ecotourism is regarded as one niche market within the larger, and rapidly expanding market of nature tourism. Here it has been estimated that nature-based tourism now comprises 20 per cent of the world travel market, and ecotourism 7 per cent. A package labelled ecotourism has some inbuilt constraints; the main one being that participants are responsible and benefit conservation efforts and local communities, and the visitor has participated in some learning experience. One example might be camping at a national park, paying an entry fee, following park rules of conduct, buying supplies at a gateway community outside the park, and participating in a natural history lesson. However, these kinds of constraints are what all kinds of nature tourism are aiming for.  In this respect, it is perhaps better to retain the term nature tourism as an umbrella for all packages that involve the softer interaction of people with habitats and species as a primary objective of the holiday.  

Nature tourism requires interactions and partnerships with conservation NGOs, government tourism and resource management agencies, community groups and the private sector.  Above all it requires the management of the many impacts of massed humans introduced into species rich ecosystems.  Even better would be the integration of nature tourism into international strategies for sustainable development.  In this context, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been appointed by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) as the Interagency Coordinator or lead agency responsible for implementation of Agenda 21 issues on tourism. Together with the World Tourism Organization (WTO/OMT), UNEP is the main focal point on sustainable tourism for CSD and the Convention on Biological Diversity for devising global strategies for tourism can contribute to environmental conservation

== Interesting list of categories ==

One of the things that both the Dewey Decimal system and even the Library of Congress catalog does very poorly at is cataloging Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (or more speicifc... Computer Engineering) materials.  Neither Software Engineering nor Computer Engineering are even acknowledged as legitimate engineering disclipines by either classification system.  Oh, you can get to them, and they do have classification codes, but it is very obscure.  Computer Science is considered a sub-disclipline of Mathmatics for the LOC classification and is a sub-disclipline of &quot;General knowledge&quot; for the Dewey Decimal system... right next to Encyclopedias in fact.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think ontology should concern itself more with groups of things
as they actually exist and need to be dealt with, and less with
assorted numbering and classification systems. When I look at that
dmoz.org space, the first thing i think of is the same thing i always
think when i see that kind of list, (similar ones which are used by google and yahoo and msn, etc.) Its obviously a list generated by
a person who wanted large umbrellas and no political fallout. The list is cognicentrically biased to put religion, for instance, as
a subheading under &quot;society.&quot; And so forth. This isn't a reasonable
organization schema, and i doubt that the people who generated it
were even slightly interested in ontology as much as they were in
just making the list quickly and getting it done with.
A realistic list of that many topics should be significantly longer,
and ordered with many more subdetails. Sociology and Religion are not
meant to be squeezed together into one category, just as many of
those categories are hard squeezes. I hate the dewey decimal system.
It was generated so long ago that its usefulness is entirely archaic.
If we are going to number things, lets at least make 30 slots instead
of ten, so that we spread things out a little more realistically.
Think of it this way; we want people to be able to make simple and
predictable causitive leaps of understanding, to guess easilly which
topic heading is the one the subtopic they are looking for is under.
This is a user interface issue, even more than an ontological one, and the problem with these systems is that they aren't user friendly,
they are librarian friendly and sysop friendly respectively.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)


In addition to the current disorganized state of Wikibooks content, we also could look at the [http://www.dmoz.org/ Open Directory Project], where quite a bit of thought has gone into ontological organization of more modern content.  Their purpose is to catalog web pages, and they do have some more unique pressures such as trying to deal with commercial content that is not so much of a big deal here on Wikibooks either.  The number of weblinks for that project is larger than the number of Wikipedia articles, although I think Wikipedia is catching up (hardly a fair comparison, however, and the ODP has been running quite a bit longer).  I think this is a good example, however, of what a mature group of links with typical internet users is going to look like, especially for the top categories.

Still, I think your approach is going to be better than what we currently are doing.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
It is an approach that with your help could get a lot better. Its a very simple ontological approach. Make the categories that simply do
exist, put them in some kind of order relative to each other, and then make subcategories as the need arises.

The main point i'd like to make is that the list was generated by simply viewing the content you have on the main page allready, and
generating categories that umbrella that content. All of these systems put the cart before the horse. The first question here is
&quot;How easilly can a user judge where to look for or insert content?&quot;
The currrent page is a mess at least in part because those divisions
are too vague and thus unclear.
Don't go looking around the net or at other systems. Look at your content and organize it.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

=== A request for input ===

Since you are interested in ontological issues as well, I would like to get your opinion on how I've tried to work with the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{catalog|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template that is going to be a tool to help us out with the classification of the various Wikibooks.  The idea here is that we will not be having to update each page whenever a new Wikibooks is added, but instead take advantage of the catagory system (significantly underused here on Wikibooks) to help with the classification work instead.  This template is intended to be added to the &quot;main page&quot; of the Wikibook, perhaps the title page.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think that the pages i have spotted with categories lists are a good feature, but that their actual use shows you that they aren't
very user friendly, at least not yet. A meta is needed to organize
assorted subcategories, and while it is nice to have a list with alphabetical order, the list most people will use is the one in ontological order. Rather than having a large tree of main categories and subcategories on different pages, what you need is
a category/ sub category on a single page, linked to from the main
page. Keep the old pages, and update them, but realize that most
people won't use them, its too much like a labyrinth.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

For an example of how this might be used, see [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] (a Wikibook where I'm a principle author) to see how an individual Wikibook might be classified.  Discussion about this was done on the [[WB:CCO]] talk page, but I've tried to put it into actual practice, which revealed a few flaws in its execution.  I need to work a little bit more on the template as well, to make some parts &quot;optional&quot; for inclusion, but this is a good place to start.  I'd like to eventually put one of these templates on every Wikibook, and perhaps even expand the practice to include some of the content on Wikisource or even Gutenberg.org.  That is more ambitious, but the Wikibooks content is certainly a higher priority.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think a wikibook on reference materials is a great idea. Lets
get to that after we solve our own problems.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)


  This is also to help &quot;arrange&quot; books to be &quot;close&quot; to related books, and using classification schemes that many people are already familiar with (notably the LOC and Dewey classification codes).  More can easily be added to this template, and we need to work on what constitutes a &quot;related work&quot; as well.  
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
A &quot;related&quot; work covers similar ontological turf. say, 20 axioms worth. 
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
In addition to all of this, I would like some input on [[Wikibooks:LOC Classification]].  I've been trying to add the search heirarchy for the Library of Congress catalog onto Wikibooks, and create a bunch of categories that can be used with the catalog template mentioned above.  Dispite all of the problems with this classification system, it is one that is commonly used and familar to people from outside of Wikibooks. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:51, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think having multiple classifications systems in use is a great way
to go. People who are deweyists ought to be able to link to the dewey
meta, at their leisure. However, the Dewey system is an archaic system, and doesn't serve your primary needs. What you need in the primary list, and on the main page, is an ontological list which simply takes the obvious categories and then derivates the obvious subcategories, not of fictional, hypothetical, or paradigmal content,
but of the content that you have.
(or, the content you would like to have.)

Another main point here is that if you do a good job on the front end, nobody will be pestering you for where to put their book, it will be self evident. That is the thing we should shoot for, a system
in which the location of specific content is self evident, within
a single page +1 click.

Lastly, there are obvious holes in content on Wikibooks, and this is
how I think that should be handled. For each of the Categories, (listed say in bold and red,) 4 or 5 examples of assumed content could be listed to fill out that line (in black italics, for instance.) Actual book entries would then go
on the lines underneath. (in link purple/blue) In this way you can generate a very lucid map of content.

== Some personal thoughts and replies ==

First off, from reading your main user page, you say you were raised LDS and born in Provo?  Do you still consider yourself to be LDS?
-----------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 22:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC) well, yes and no, mostly no. I'm Eclectic, with a heavy emphasis
on integrating &gt;everything&lt;. In as much as I have done that and come
full circle, I think its an honest point to make that the Essenes, if
compared to modern Christian movements, would most closely resemble Mormonism. Since that is a Scholarly observation, I don't know if
it qualifies. If the Church could fullfill its mission and use modern
Scholarship to fully re-instate Essene Theology, I might come back on
board. As it is, they put Beef in their vegetable soup despite the book of mormons admonishment to eat meat only in times of winter or
famine. This compares favorably with the fact that the Essenes were
vegetarian. As an example, it illustrates both the fact that Smith
was on to something, and the fact that the Modern Church lost sight of exactly what that was.
------------

I currently live in Logan, Utah and am currently the Ward Webmaster (strange calling at that).  I was also born in Provo, but I moved around a bit as well, including about 4 years (about 30 years ago) in Santa Barbara, or more exact I lived in Carpenteria but my dad attended Brooks Institute and graduated with a B.S. in Photography from that school.  I loved the Botanical Gardens and the Santa Barbara Mission, and loved to go and play in the ocean as well in Santa Barbara.  I didn't know how good it was at the time, and would move back if I ever had a chance or a reasonable professional opprotunity.  It was a far better experience than where my parents moved from Santa Barbara, which was Inglewood, CA.  Talk about a change of environment.
---------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 22:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC) interesting coincidences. If that was inglewood colorado, it
would be even more. Myself, I have moved sufficiently past mormonism
that i wouldn't be able to survive emotionally in Utah. This area is
paradise, but i see myself moving North to find that demographic of even more &quot;liberal&quot; folks. 
------------
On to Wikibooks business....

Go ahead and simply start the Wikibook project as you are suggesting.
------------
yeah! kewl!
------------

  Something that I think you might want to check out first is this Wikibook:

[[Colonising Mars]]

They have a mailing list that I am also involved with that has touched some very interesting points, including many of the space colonization issues that you have brought up.  I hope this gives you some framework to consider, or something to compare and contrast with what ideas that you have.  This book, Colonising Mars, is currently on the Miscellaneous bookshelf, but that may be misplaced or certainly could be part of a much larger collection of books on that topic.  You may want to dig up the archives of the mailing list as well for some other ideas to include as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:50, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

I will look that up. As a side note, I had envisioned linking to as many other wikibooks as were relevant, and to as many wikipedia articles as possible.

set up to link a new wiki to its parent networks like that.
I have asked at the bot request wikipedia zone. Is there somebody else or someplace else to go look?

==Brain dump of material for the &quot;thinkstarship&quot; project==

Here's a short brain-dump of items that may be useful for your &quot;thinkstarship&quot; project. 
---------------------
wow! Thank You!
------------------


I don't have a WikiBooks account, and don't plan to get one in the near future. If you need to contact me, it's best to do so on my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Christopher_Thomas user talk page] at Wikipedia.


* You're going to need a lot of delta-v to colonize the outer solar system, or to colonize anywhere quickly.
------------
True, and excellent point. This observation organizes as a point
over to the &quot;Map&quot; page, and the Physics page.

ThinkStarship has several main key points here allready covered.
We propose to use a combination of many different tools available
to us, and are trying to do it in an ecologically and economically
sound way also. Due to economics, I think most of the plans on the
table currrently would be moderate thrust systems. I'm not looking
to win races as much as get there safely in a reasonable amount of time.
That in mind, I'm proposing to use Air augmented rockets till out of
atmosphere, chemical rockets to orbit, nuclear powered rockets to
break orbit, space ramrockets for primary acceleration and deceleration,
and a very studious use of the interplanetary transit network.

---------------




* You're going to need at least moderate thrust to colonize anywhere quickly.
------------------
Nuclear powered rockets are the strongest thrust we have. There are a lot of people who have issues with their use, and this is why 
I have been very careful to insure that they would never fire while
in range of our ecosystem. Magnetic space breathing microwave ignition
ramrockets will give a pretty low delta V, but provide a lot of thrust
over a long and steady period as compared to the Nuclear powered rockets.
---------------------



* Combining these gives a fairly arbitrary requirement of a delta-v of 100-300 km/sec and an acceleration of at least 0.01 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This will let you get just about anywhere in a year or less (Neptune or Pluto in about 2 years).
* Relaxing this window to 10-20 years gives you a delta-v of 10-30 km/sec and a thrust of 0.001 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and allows gravity assists. Simpler engines, but much, much more complicated environment systems, so probably a no-go.
--------------------
One primary operational axiom here for me is that we are going for
the closest targets first and colonizing in a slow motion wave
using the planetary gravity assists. Colonizing the entire Solar System in the next 50 years sounds preposterous to some people, until you
realize we could do that t minus 15 years to first launch date, and then
a slow drift actually into the solar system for the next 35 years.
If some enterprising entreprenuers want to plant their flag on some
rock before ThinkStarShip gets there, it won't be that hard cuz most of
what we will have done will be pretty public record. ThinkStarship isn't
trying to get to Mars in under 3 Years, Jupiter probably about 5 or maybe even 10, because the rings are going to be a big project. Saturn another 5 after that, things start to speed up as the designs start calling for larger and more expensive engines. But by then we are using
the asteroid mining endeavor for spare mass, so building monstrous sized
things isn't a big deal to us.
--------------



* Drive options that we know how to build at present are iffy for these constraints:
**A pebble-bed fission reactor that you run hydrogen through as reaction mass gives you a high-thrust drive with an exhaust velocity in the range of 4-5 km/sec when run as hot as you possibly can. This and a 90% fuel fraction give you a delta-v of around 10 km/sec with a single-stage fully reusable craft. Thrust is relatively high (potentially enough for soft-landings on the moon or even Mars, if most of the rest of the mass is engine). Drawback: delta-v is bad.
**A fission-electric engine has as much delta-v as you want it to, but is very low-thrust, due to the power to weight ratio of the reactor. Pulling numbers straight out of my tail gives a thrust of 0.0001 N/kg for 100 km/sec delta-v. You can probably reach ten times this, but a hundred times this will be very difficult. Delta-v and thrust are inversely proportional for this kind of drive.
**I get about 0.001 N/kg for 100 km/sec delta-v with solar-electric in Earth's orbit. This number is on a bit firmer ground than the fission-electric one. Farther out, it's far less useful. It's marginal for a Mars trip, and to do that at all you'd have to reduce delta-v.
* The &quot;electric&quot; end of an electric drive would probably be a Hall-effect thruster, as that avoids electrode erosion problems, and is high enough thrust that it's used for stationkeping for satellites, and is well-understood.
-------------------
Thats good information for our physics and Propulsion page.
I'm not sure that i could go for any thrust device with a nuclear
radioactive thrust. Nuclear power for a magnetic system seems like a more realistic alternative for several reasons, asides from calming
the nerves of environmentalists. I'm not an Algebra guy, but what I understand here is that the specific delta V you end up with is going
to be a product of different burns of different engines. As long as you
have a very high delta V burn for a sufficient duration, a very low delta v burn for a much longer time will afford the kind of speed that
is useful. I think using many different types of thrust systems, whilst
being mindful of what eaches strengths and weaknesses are, is the key here.
--------------------


* The habitat for the trip will contain dried food and medicine as things that _must_ be stored as disposables. Air and water are easily recycled if you're willing to spend a lot of power to do it, but for short trips (1-2 years) it might not be worth the added mass. The mass of air required will be at most about three times the dry weight of the food. The mass of water required is on the order of a couple of kg per person per day, tops.
------------------
&lt;Pan&gt;
The X1 Starship, which is the ship doing all of the long trips in
my currernt hypothetical fleet, will be unto itself an experiment in
a balanced ecosystem. It is also designed to assume that the fully funtional ecosystem completely fails, and to provide air, water, and food for as long as it would take to get back to Earth, or an emergency
assist payload. Believe me, I was hesitant at first to think of having
a payload requirement of a whole grocery store, a large swimming pool,
and a busload of oxygen, but you are right, they are requirements for
the safety of the adventure.
---------------------
* The colony itself will need several heavy pieces of equipment:
**Power plant. Either solar or fission-based (you can use ship drive reactors for this, but they'd have to be pretty beefy). Solar is only really practical in the inner solar system, without exotic construction techniques.
----------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt; I keep finding myself in the position of explaining how useless
Solar is in the outer Solar system. Thanks for the back up. I am pretty
much relying here upon Nuclear power for most of my energy needs. However, I am a SOFT Nuclear Proponent. Have You heard of it? Are you
familiar with its Political issues?
I do think that Solar Powered sattelites in earth orbit is a great way
to generate power for Earth. 
--------------
**Universal smelter. This would be a combination chemical and electrochemical widget that breaks down rock/dirt into oxygen and metals/metalloids, and then separates out desired metals present in few-percent quantities (aluminum, iron, and titanium, mostly). This can be an open-cycle system if you have a source of water to get hydrogen from. A closed-cycle system would do its best to recycle hydrogen, but would still need to be topped up periodically.
------------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
The ThinkStarship answer to this is two fold; First, there would be a main device of this sort in the asteroid capture payload. Second, there
would be Robots whose task this would be. 
----------------
**Really good machine shop. This must be capable of fabricating spare parts for everything in the machine shop.
------------------
Right, and again, the plan here is to have a payload of robots and droids of both macro and nanite sizes specific to the tasks of mining
Asteroids, repairing ships, and fabricating space stations.
--------------
**Airmaker. This is slightly easier to make if it can work in an open-loop cycle. You can get oxygen from the smelter, if on a waterless world, but getting it from water is easier. In a pinch, an air recycler that's periodically topped up will work.
--------------
First, The ThinkStarship plan calls for having balanced ecosystems to provide most of the air needs. This is an air cycle issue, and there is
to be an entire set of pages devoted to solving that problem.
Secondly, redundantly, 3 to 5 years worth of extra air will be stored
for each astronaut. And lastly, yes, there are a variety of ways to get
air out of the environment, and this will be one of the things that will
be covered as droid tasks.
--------------
**Watermaker. You'll need to recycle water on a hydrogen-poor world like the moon or an asteroid. You'd do this by distilling what you can out of waste, and then burning the residue in a hydrogen atmosphere and electrolyzing any resulting water. The hydrogen would then be reclaimed (unless you're on a reducing world like Titan). On Mars, you can condense water from the air in trace amounts, or mine it from the ice caps. On any given world, you'll have either lots of oxygen or lots of hydrogen for the taking, given power. The other will have to be conserved if you're not on a water world.
----------------
&lt;&lt;pan&gt;&gt;
Distillation is certainly one techniqe that we will have available to
use, however, the biocycle itself will attempt to cycle water naturally.
I am curious to know and don't what &quot;Reducing world like Titan&quot; means?

--------------
**Greenhouse. This will be Bloody Huge, but can mostly be built from on-site materials. Fertilizer will have to come from nonmetals extracted from your smelter, though.
--------------
&lt;Pan&gt;
Yes, it will be very large, about the same size space for biocycle as for the rest of the cabins spaces. In other words, the ecosystem doubles
or triples the necessary size of the cabin space.
Thats just for vehicles tho. Colonies will be another matter, and a smelter is again one thing we will have, but extrusion at complicated
levels is more complicated than just a smelter, and we will need a lot
of other devices, including assorted forms of heating and cooling centrifuges, tubing, chambers, etc, etc. Mad scientist gear etc.
-------------
*Humans are an integral part of this system. We don't know how to build a completely automated manufacturing plant, and even if we did, humans would likely be much cheaper.
-------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
We are close to knowing how, there are several key AI heuristics and only a few real robotics problems left to solve. Humans will probably be increasingly useful to design things and increasingly irrelevant to build or repair them.
--------------
*Some items, like medicines and integrated circuit chips, will have to be imported until the colony grows big enough to have enough of an industrial base to build a hundred-million-dollar facility to produce that type of thing. This also includes things like diamond-impregnated tool bits, really good scientific equipment, and so forth. You're going to need lots and lots of spares for this type of supplies.
---------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
I'm assuming that the robotics colonization format for large moon
or planet will be that the a full cities infrastructure will be put mostly in place before the colonists arrive. Self sufficiency is going
to be very important here. It is going to be very expensive to import something and increasingly less expensive to build something on site
once you have a robot army working.
Short of this, the list of things for cabin payload for use in transit
is indeed immense.
--------------------
*Everything else can be bootstrapped with a sufficiently kickass machine shop. The very first things made will be spare equipment for the machine shop (ideally, several machine shops). Second things made will be extra smelters and airmakers and watermakers, so that you can shut these down for regular maintenance or have one fail on you without losing the colony.
-------------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
Agreed, Robots build other most useful Robots to triple redundancy levels for any system that involves a survival failsafe.
----------------


*Light things that you're going to have will be a kickass library, and a kickass entertainment system, both on the ship and colony-side. You need to be able to train people up to be experts in a diverse variety of subjects, and you're going to need to keep people happy for years on end. This wasn't possible during the Apollo era. It's easily possible now.
-----------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
That  library is now being generated by Wikipedia in infancy stage. ThinkStarships &quot;Education&quot; page should and will reflect the need
to generate a long term, every topic library, with a textbook format useful to educating any child to educated astronaut status. That is in a sense what we are doing here; generating the knowledge base that will
be carried to the Stars.

The one thing you don't want me to do is design the recreation department. I know we need one, but I'm a Geek, not a Jock. I do design
really very nice hot tubs tho.
-------------
 *You'll want a high-bandwidth communications link to Earth to keep your library and video collection up to date, as well as sending back status and survey and scientific information. Big dishes are cheap, if you're already hauling a hundred or more tonnes of stuff for a colony.
--------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Again, this is another argument in favor of slow but thoughrough exploration. That way, you are creating a trail of link-ups and substations behind you as you go. However, I would limit off ship
communications intentionally because i think that each Ship and colony
should to some extent accept its isolation, and focus on itself.

Asides, contigous evolution isn't that desirable. The best thing
about many different groups leaving earth is the capacity for each to evolve into its own unique culture. Those differences will be enhanced
if people are motivated to create their own entertainments and so forth
inside of the closed system.

I think a rational limit here is about a maximum of 1 hour a day time
dealing with information from external to the colony per Astronaut.
--------------



I guestimate the bare minimum colony base being 100 tonnes and 10 people. Add another 100 tonnes of supplies, and you can keep them alive for a few years, covering travel and colony-establishment. Add another hundred tonnes of engine and fuel tank, and 3000 tonnes of reaction mass, and you have yourself a ship that might be buildable. It would cost about $100 billion to launch at current market prices. Minimum manned survey craft is about a tenth this for all numbers. Unmanned survey craft a hundredth this or less.
-----------------
I don't think 10 people is large enough crew from a sociology perspective. As I have Aspergers Syndrome, I am particularly mindful of the need to counter Pack psychology with a sufficiently large size population. My minimum crew is 12, and I wouldn't ever send out such crews in groups of less than 3 ships. A better option is about 40.
Trust me, the social and psychological stability factor more than makes it worth it.
My tonnage estimates for ships was in the hundreds ranges. For Colonies
I think we are talking more thousands. However, many of those tons could
probably be mined; Again, my idea here is to send a group of ships to say mars, each with a crew of 12, have them colonize diemos and phobos first, turn those into serious machine shops, and then execute a remote
controlled landing of droid armies from Phobos and Diemos to then land on Mars and build the Colony.The Colonists arrive late in the assembly schedule. Fuel costs are low for Nuclear powered
Ramrockets.
------------------

If you're building somewhere close by, like the moon, you can reduce costs in the short term by sending regular supply craft from Earth, but you'll still need bootstrapping equipment for the colony. Say about $20 billion to launch at current market prices. With a moonbase, colony craft cost goes down to about $30 billion, as you can supply your reaction mass from the moon for far less expense than from Earth.
--------------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
Again, Self sufficiency is the goal we probably won't attain, which is why the colonization wave should move slowly.
We should find materials to use and successfully mine them in order to
learn how to do it better and as we go. Cuithne, and other Near Earth
Asteroids are targets which are even more important than the Moon. The Moon is mostly useful in my mind as the new center of our artificial captured asteroid system.
ThinkStarship pretty much wants the nearest objects first in the order of closeness and usefullness. In some ways, we might even think of it as brooming up the Solar system of anything that might get perturbed and take a close swipe too close to the earth in the next billion years.
Mars in comparison is a distant and long term project compared to cruithne.
---------------
*You'll want chemical rocket shuttles to use as landing craft, ferries, and so forth. If delta-v is in the 2-5 km/sec range, you can do this quite easily with single-stage reusable methane+LOX craft.
--------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
My y2 and y3 designs call for shuttle craft with both chemical and nuclear powered rocket thrust.
------------
Both methane and LOX are very easy to make in-situ if you have carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen available, and will in fact show up at various stages in your airmaker and smelter, so you don't need extra equipment to produce them. The components used in these craft are well-understood and are for the most part already in use. These can probably even be built and maintained with colony equipment, though building them on Earth and transporting them (without fuel) is probably cheaper.
------------------------
&lt;&lt;pan&gt;&gt;
Thanks again. I'll have to let this sit in my mind for a bit and
then start parting some of it out to the actual document.

That about covers it. For further conversation, contact me at Wikipedia. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Christopher_Thomas Christopher Thomas] 04:34, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

==First response to brain dump commentary==

I'll keep this relatively short, as we could end up discussing this all day without accomplishing much, as we seem to have different views on a lot of things:
-------------
&lt;pan&gt;
So far it seems like we mostly share pretty similar perspective on most things. Also, as opposed to some other people i have been chatting with, say, for instance, in Yahoogroups, you have been
very civil and very forthcoming with useful information. I'm not an
expert in everything, so some useful input from a person like yourself is greatly appreciated.

Where we seem to differ the most is the specifics of implementation
in the plan I'm proposing. Unlike most people, I'm not so attached to any part of it that I wouldn't let go of some parts of it if somebody were to show good cause why a a particular aspect is a bad idea, or, some better way to go about doing things. All I claim to have done with the general plan is to have strung in a general way together the basics of what is possible in some sort of realistic
but fast paced timeline. My expectation is that the plans details will evolve and grow as experts weigh in on things that I'm just an amatuer at. I'd rather be wrong and corrected than right in my own
mind and wrong in any other reality.
On the other hand, I'm more lucid by an order of magnitude than any of the guys over at YahooGroups.
--------------


*You seem to be uncertain about what thrust and delta-v mean. Thrust is the force your engines generate at any given instant. Divide it by craft mass to get acceleration. Delta-v is the total change in velocity that your craft can attain by spending all of its fuel (doesn't matter how quickly or slowly it does this). The delta-v to get between various parts of the solar system is well-known. It depends on what type of course you use (minimum-energy elliptical transfer, or a complicated path that uses slingshot maneuvers, or a very complicated path that attempts to use both liberation points _and_ gravity assists, which seems to be the type you're looking at).
-----------------
Thanks, I am a non-mathemetician.
-----------------



*Figure 100-300 km/sec delta-v to get anywhere in single-digit years, 10-30 km/sec to get anywhere in double-digit years using slingshot assists, and forget about the &quot;interplanetary superhighway&quot;. That takes far too long to get manned craft anywhere, and doesn't save you that much delta-v.
---------------
&lt;pan&gt;
remember, I'm going slowly out in an expansion wave.
I think you are right if i start from earth with the intention
of getting immediately next stop pluto. 
In either case, I visualize not as fast as the first figure and
not as slow usually as the second. Thanks for the sense of spectrum
and range.
-------------


*You're putting way, way too much faith in automated robots. I'm a computer engineer. We have no clue how to build a completely automated factory. We hope we'll know how to do it in 50 years, but I'm pretty skeptical. The NASA proposal for an automated moonbase is mostly useful because you can use it to figure out what you'd have to do with humans instead of robots running the place. Don't be fooled into thinking it's something we can actually build without several very fundamental advances in computer science. I think it was Werner von Braun who said, &quot;a human is the best computer we can put into a spacecraft, and the only one that can be mass-produced by unskilled labour&quot;. Humans are expensive to maintain, but they pay off big time in flexibility. If you're doing anything complicated, it'll be done by humans.
-------------
&lt;pan&gt;

My Expertise is in psychology. I am well aware that the heuristics
problems are huge. However, I think that the best solutions for this
are things that I'd like to explore here.
You are correct, we don't have the Heuristics down yet, and often,
I brush this aside. I think i have more faith in a near term set of solutions than you do, but I am aware of the serious obstacles.
------------
*Any outer solar system colony will already be culturally isolated by the time delay for messages. You won't need to enforce bandwidth caps on people.
-------------
&lt;Pan&gt; Again, I am thinking much more near term than that. The nearest rocks first. Inner solar system. I wouldn't &quot;enforce&quot; anything in any case, I'd suggest, strongly, and take issue with people if they became unproductive or apparently fixated.
-----------
*The minimum size for a self-sustaining colony is about 100 people at the time of establishment. This is due to the 50/500 rule for population genetic diversity (you need at least 50 people to avoid inbreeding in the short term, and at least 500 for mutations to feed new genes into the gene pool as fast as they're lost by random selection). I used 10 people as the minimum number of people needed to _build_ the colony, and to keep it running until you can ferry more colonists over.
------------
&lt;Pan&gt; For genetics purposes, I think we are definitely coming up with
about the same numbers. My concern with 10 people is that this is right at or under the Threshold level for pack psychology to take hold. I want to keep tribal psychology going. Its sort of an esoteric
Sociology problem.
-------------
*You need far more greenhouse space than colonist space. Look at the ratio of farmland to city land on Earth to see why. You're not going to be able to carry this on your ship - it's much, much too heavy to have around when you can just pack enough military rations, granola bars, or what-have-you to keep people fed for a trip that takes less than 10 years. Food would mostly be low-moisture, as you can rehydrate it from the water supply, which gets recycled with at least 80% efficiency, and more if you're willing to pay for it.
------------
&lt;Pan&gt; I have some notes on the Sociology page regarding this. In theory you could cram a batch of people into a much smaller space than the area used to create a functional biosphere for them. The problem is, they won't stay mentally healthy for very long. My plan calls for space allowances per person that are really very large.
Also, with permaculture and aquaculture and tray stacking methods,
a single person can in theory eat from a tray stack system only 5 feet wide and long and 6 feet tall. They'd be eating nothing much other than sprouts and soybeans, but you get the point.
------------
*This is also why your airmaker and watermaker are going to be mechanical, not biological. A biological system doing this, in addition to being suceptible to disease, weighs far too much. The closest we've gotten to doing this was a Russian system that tried to use algae grown on wet canvas to recycle air, and that experiment was done for a relatively _short_ time, on Earth, not in space. You're going to end up with mildew and other crud competing with the algae long before you reach your destination, and will need a lot of algae. The mechanical systems for this are very straightforward to build and maintain, and are lighter than the supplies they conserve for trips over a year or two. They just take power, which you'll have lots of from the drive.
------------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Very good point i hadn't given that much thought to. I had assumed
that the waste systems, for instance, on the X1 would rely on mechanical processes because theres too little overall room. Thanks
for an important point.
----------------

*&quot;Reducing atmosphere&quot; means an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, as opposed to oxygen. In a reducing atmosphere, you have mostly methane and ammonia and water. In an &quot;oxidizing atmosphere&quot;, by contrast, you have free oxygen, free nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. Earth and Mars have oxidizing atmospheres. Titan has a reducing one. If I recall correctly Venus has an oxidizing atmosphere, but it's inhospitable enough to never be colonized (very high pressure, very high temperature, very corrosive due to sulphur dioxide forming sulphuric acid in combination with atmospheric water). Most airless bodies in the inner solar system give you the same chemicals as an oxidizing atmosphere (the moon is aluminum and silicon oxides, mostly, with a few percent iron, titanium, chromium, phosphorus, and so on). In the outer solar system, you get icy worlds, which are oxygen-rich but have hydrogen bound into water. They're perfect for colonization, because hydrogen is probably the thing you'll run out of most.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Wow, Thanks, thats fascinating.
------------------

*Don't bother with small asteroids and ring particles until much later. You want something big enough to have gravity, but small enough that you can launch from it cheaply. The moon is about as big as this gets. An asteroid like Ceres is about as small as this gets. The icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn are perfect. Mars is big enough that it's expensive to launch from, but it has all of the elements you need, and an atmosphere, so it's probably also a good colony site.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
I was thinking of centripetal force and not going after any rock smaller than a few hundred meters in diameter. Large gravity wells
are a pain in the but, and Mars is actually a very poor Colonization
Target because it has just enough gravity to make centripetal artificial G systems seriously problematic, and just too little enough gravity sos that muscle atrophy is an issue.
The best objects, I agree, for instance, the most ideal sort
of object is Ceres, the moons of Jupiter and so forth are great
targets also.
----------------

*Launch from any world will probably be via chemical rockets, because they're the only really high thrust drive we have. That's why it's so expensive (Earth is _barely_ small enough that we can get off it with chemical rockets at all). Anything the size of the moon or smaller can be launched from with a reusable LOX/methane craft, which is simple enough to build and fuel with the equipment your colony ship will already have.

*Exhaust from the fission drive won't be very radioactive. A small fraction of the hydrogen will get transmuted to deuterium, but deuterium isn't radioactive either. You'll get trace contamination from erosion of carbon and tungsten from your PBR fuel pellet casings, but this is _not_ desired, because it reduces the life of your engine. A nuclear engine isn't quite high thrust enough to launch from Earth, and isn't politically usable on Earth, but anywhere else you don't have to worry about it (as long as jetwash isn't pointed directly at your colony). Background levels of radiation from space will be much, much higher.
-----------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
I am not a rocket scientist, but my understanding was that &quot;Nuclear
Powered&quot; Rocket is really a very large category with a lot of very different outcomes. The thrust systems which I had looked at were primarilly very high thrust, but with the serious drawback of generating radioactive backwash. This may not be what you are thinking of, I doubt it is. If its just nuclear _powered_ and not
actually nuclear in the ignition chamber, then you get what you seem
to be talking about.
Nuclear Thrust of the first type is even stronger than chemical thrust. But then theres the other problems.
-------------
*Fission drives have to be much more carefully maintained than chemical rockets, so you won't have many of them if you can avoid it. They'll be the big drives on interplanetary ships. All shuttles will be based on chemical rockets. Colonies will have fission plants, which were probably the drive reactors from the ships that founded the colonies, plus extra equipment for electricity generation if the drive was originally a NERVA-style hydrogen-through-PBR design.
---------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Interesting. Others had led me to believe that Nuclear power
was a good solution for small craft. I'm not committed either way,
but I do know that the ramrocket engines i favor would require a nuclear power source. I'm not a rocket Scientist, just a Psychologist and a Sociologist and an Ecologist.
----------------

*Launching from an airless world will in the long run be done with a mass driver (think &quot;maglev train run at several km/sec off an open-ended track&quot;). This is expensive enough to build that it won't happen until your colony has a GDP in the range of at least $1 billion, but it's how you'd get large amounts of building material for a permanent space station colony or what-have-you. You can't do this from any world that has an atmosphere, even one as thin as Mars's.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
I had visualized that for small moons, somehow it seemed odd for larger moons. Space Elevators was also a pretty good option in my mind. Cost seems to be a non-issue if you can get those robot armies
to work. Big if, but hey, IF, then its really just a matter of getting the bots there and getting them started.
----------------
*Mining asteroids is a royal pain in the tail. If at all possible, mining will be done where there's gravity and an atmosphere. Planets are great big balls of metals and useful minerals, so I just don't see the advantage. The only exception is that you might break off a tiny chunk of an icy body and tow it to an established colony on the moon, to give you carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. It might be cheaper just to haul up refined chemicals from a colony elsewhere and ship them, though.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Yes, mining in microgravity would be highly problematic. There are
a number of different groups working on the theories of the problem,
and a lot of interesting answers out there. If we are going to make
large Colonies or ships, materials will proove to be cheaper to mine
from Asteroids than lift from Earth or the Moon.
-------------
*Almost all of the mass of an interplanetary ship will be mass that has to be thrown away: reaction mass used by the drive. Even for an electric drive, travel time requirements mean working with as low an exhaust velocity as you can, which means higher thrust but higher mass consumption. Take the mass of anything that doesn't have to be thrown away, and multiply it by 10 to get the reaction mass you need to carry. That's why the colony ships I specced had 300 tonnes dry weight but 3000 tonnes of fuel. For a high-thrust nuclear drive, the reaction mass has to be hydrogen. Otherwise you lose the exhaust velocity advantage over chemical rockets. For a Hall effect thruster, it can in principle be anything, so you can use oxygen or nitrogen or what-have-you from lunar rock. However, I don't think a nuclear-electric craft will get you to the outer solar system in a reasonable length of time if it's a colony ship. Colonizing incrementally doesn't help you much - you still have several AU between outer-system planets, so every step is a very big one.
-------------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Are you taking into account the ramscoop principle here?
I think you are right on if you are talking a Ship thats destined to
leave our solar system and possibly a bit over the top for a ship whose destination is sedna.
---------------


*Equipment breaks down. Complicated equipment breaks down faster. This is why I don't think automated colony ships will work (besides being incredibly complicated and ludicrously expensive), and why I don't think trips with a travel time above about 5 years are practical with humans on board (the systems maintaining the environment are as simple as we can make them, but still pretty complicated).
----------------
&lt;pan&gt; 
I had encountered this issue before, and its a complicated one.
I think that things do break down, but that they can be built in theory to last at least as long as 5 or 10 years. In any case, I'm using a plan that essentially uses 3-7 year hops from orbit level to
orbit level, so I think that is doo-able.
You do have a good point in that total automation won't be a very good idea- You still want human oversight on Robot activity.

Something to think about- IF Robot armies of self replicating
and construction types do become reality, &quot;cost&quot; becomes a very different thing to define than it is now.
------------
*Cultural problems and mob-tyrrany among the crew are far less of a problem than simply keeping them from getting bored out of their skulls, or hating each other because they're all effectively sharing an apartment that they can't get out of for years on end. The key to this, besides carefully screening crew for conflicts before launching, is to give each person personal space they can retreat do and rearrange, and to give everyone the best library, computer, gaming system, and TV you can. These are relatively light, and let people entertain themselves when they're sick of the group. You'd also have a &quot;living room&quot; type of space with an entertainment centre as well, for group entertainment, as well as board games and what-have-you for social relaxation. There'll be a (compact, lightweight) gym, to reduce bone loss and similar problems, but most people don't entertain themselves physically that way, and a facility for swimming or sports is far, far too heavy to put on a spaceship.
---------------
I had forseen a lot of entertainment, including games and video games. I wouldn't put a swimming pool on a ship, thats just the emergency water tanks i was talking about. That wouldn't be for swimming, but it would be as large as a small swimming pool.
------------

*Similarly, happily-married couples are a good idea. Otherwise you'll get sexually-driven tension between crew members either on the ship or once the colony is established.
-------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
In crew groups over 30 or 40, I think you are right. There are some
strange problems that happen only with very small groups that are driven by subliminal psychosexual motivators. Honestly, it seems counter-intuitive, but the best solution for a really small crew if you want one is a stud male and a batch of lesbians.
-------------

*To avoid health problems, the ship will consist of three big containers. The central one has the drive and fuel tank, which don't rotate. The other two are connected to the central hub by cables, and spin around the hub for gravity, counterweighting each other. One has the crew and everything they need on the trip. The other has everything they don't need on the trip but will need when they establish the colony. If you try to keep humans in zero gravity for years on end, they won't be much good to you when they arrive at the destination. The interplanetary drive doesn't have thrust high enough to produce noticeable gravity.
--------------
&lt;pan&gt; I had the same three containers but had a fourth container
for the drive apparatus including nuclear power system, and put the
two rotating cylinders right next to each other instead of seperating them.
-------------


All of these points pretty much _have_ to be the case for a successful colonization project. Otherwise you end up needing a ship far more massive than you can build, or far more complicated than you can build, and probably far more expensive than you can build given either of those two, and one that takes long enough to reach its destination (any destination) that it's very unlikely to arrive with the crew alive and ship intact. I hope you see why I made each of the specifications I did above. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Christopher_Thomas Christopher Thomas] 22:50, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

&lt;Pan&gt; 
Yes, it is a very serious and dangerous game to design spaceships,
and I think we both have a pretty good handle on the main problems and obstacles. Thanks so much for your input.
-------------

Addendum:
*I found you by checking the edit history for the &quot;ThinkStarship&quot; project. You're the main one working on it.
---------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
Kewl, I guess then that you found ThinkStarship by some amount of
personal interest.
:)
--------------



*Airless worlds give you everything you'd get in an oxidizing atmosphere, _except_ hydrogen, for inner-system bodies like the moon and asteroids in the belt (almost no water).
--------------
&lt;Pan&gt;
I still think we should hope for the best but see what we find when we get there and plan for the worst.

==Second response to brain dump commentary==
-----------------
I hope you will forgive me for being brief. I spent about a half hour or so on this and your edit conflict deleted it all.
----------------

Regarding space drives, you seem to have some odd ideas, 
---------------
I'm feeling pretty sensitive to &quot;odd&quot; ideas lately.
I have some good ideas and some mediocre ideas. All of my ideas
are pretty well covered by science on the one hand and my willingness
to allow process to be what it is, not what i assume on the other.
Please forgive me if this sounds annoyed, but all i am doing here
is trying to get the experts together to get them to solve the 
problems, not pretend that i allready have the answers.
-------------


and to be grouping several different ideas together. Specifics of the different drive options are:

*Chemical rockets. The best delta-v you can get for reasonable fuel amounts is about 5 km/sec. Maximum acceleration is several gravities (say about 30 m/s^2). These are used for your shuttles only, and probably for launching equipment from Earth.

*Nuclear-thermal. This involves making a pebble-bed reactor core (a bunch of marble-sized spheres of uranium clad with graphite and coated with tungsten), letting it heat up to about 2500 degrees C, and running hydrogen through it. The hydrogen heats up and sprays out the end of the rocket. Because hydrogen has a much lower molecular weight than the products of rocket fuel combustion, it's moving much faster at any given temperature. This gives you a delta-v of around 10-15 km/sec, at most, with a reasonable amount of fuel. Maximum acceleration is probably in the 0.01 to 0.1 gravity range (about 0.1 to 1 m/s^2). If you're willing to accept a travel time on the order of 5-10 years, you can use this kind of engine for your ships, and use gravity assists to get you where you're going. You don't have enough delta-v to get anywhere else (other than the moon) in a shorter period of time. Outer solar system could take more than 10 years.
----------------------
This is all very interesting and i hope that you will consider making a presentation of this kind of information in the actual document. Otherwise, I'll have to find somebody like you and beg
them to do it, and i am not likely to find somebody who is as sympathetic for the most part as you seem to be.
----------------




*Nuclear-electric or solar-electric. This involves using either a nuclear plant or a solar panel array as an energy source, and using an electric drive to move a working fluid (usually a heavy noble gas like xenon, for ease of handling and ionization, but it can be almost anything else you can turn into a gas). Options like ion drives and older-style plasma drives have problems with the electrodes eroding, but a Hall effect drive will work quite well. The downside is that thrust is very low. This is an unavoidable problem, because the thrust per unit power goes down inversely as your specific impulse (and so delta-v per weight of fuel) goes up. You'd need a power plant with a very high power to weight ratio (lightweight, high power) for this drive to be useful. It's probably still the only option for outer solar system colonization, but trips could take decades.

*The &quot;nuclear drives for small craft&quot; you'd heard about were probably radiothermal electric generators powering electric drives. These aren't reactors; they're subcritical amounts of material that decay fast enough to get warm. Thermocouples draw power off of the heat gradient that results. They're fine for extremely light probes that are allowed to take decades to get anywhere, but aren't useful for small craft. A &quot;reactor&quot; is an assembly of nuclear fuel that catalyzes its own decay, producing much higher heat output for a given amount of weight. They're useful, as noted above, but have a certain minimum size (a few tons for anything shielded).

These drive designs are well-studied enough that we could build them right now, with off-the-shelf parts, if we wanted to. More exotic options you seem to have been made aware of are:

*Nuclear pulse propulsion with bombs.
-----------------
I think that this is the primary form of &quot;nuclear powered&quot;
rocket which i had been exposed to, but it was described very differently from what you have here.
The bombs were going off almost inside the engine.
------------



 This involves building a ship weighing hundreds of thousands of tonnes with a big shock-absorber under it, flinging nuclear warheads in front of the shock absorber, and setting them off. The design (Orion) was studied extensively in the 1950s and 1960s, but is outright impossible to implement for political reasons. You need to amass a _really huge_ stockpile of warheads, and the ship itself is a mobile bomb-thrower with immense destructive potential, so nobody will let anyone else build one, and the radioactive plume out the back prevents it from being used for ground-to-orbit work, which is what it's mostly useful for.

*Nuclear pulse propulsion with inertial confinement fusion. This involves building a small ship with a magnetic field acting as a rocket nozzle, firing pellets of frozen deuterium into the field pinch, and zapping the pellets with lasers or particle beams to initiate fusion. The problem is that we've been trying to build inertial confinement fusion systems for decades, and still don't have one that produces a beneficial amount of power. The pellets are also extremely difficult to make and handle, due to symmetry requirements, and the laser installation is the size of a large building, not counting power plant for the lasers. So, this isn't happening any time soon.

*Bussard ramscoops. You keep mentioning these, but you don't seem to realize where they were intended to function. 
--------------
Thats not true, my one claim to reasonable knowledge is that i found
out 20 years ago basically what you are saying and was so heartbroken than i tinkered the idea up a lot to make it work in 
any case. My ramscoops aren't used for much in most cases other than
to get more speed once allready moving, and they are nuclear powered
magnetic/plasma driven, which means that they double as a magnetic
thrust system.
--------------


Even in Bussard's original models, you have to be travelling extremely quickly for them to work (delta-v of hundreds of km/sec needed to boost to that speed before ignition). They were meant as interstellar craft (launched, expensively, at the speeds required, and then boosting to much higher speeds). The problem is that this type of drive doesn't actually work at all. First, you're trying to fuse the trace amounts of deuterium in the already-very-tenuous amounts of hydrogen in the interstellar medium. This means most of the hydrogen that passes through your drive is inert, causing problems but giving no benefit. Second, the magnetic field ends up deflecting far, far more hydrogen than it pinches to fusion density. This means that even if you built a ramscoop and launched it at the required speeds, instead of igniting and speeding up, it actually just plows into the interstellar medium and slows _down_ without igniting. The drive was popularized in fiction dating from the middle of the 20th century, but will never actually be possible in practice for this reason. Even if it did magically work, it wouldn't be useful for colony work, for the reason mentioned above (you have to be going fast enough to use it that you don't need it if you have the means to get that fast in the first place).

Additional points:

*Regarding moving out in &quot;waves&quot;, you don't seem to realize
----------------
This isn't true, i do know how big space is, and, this is why i
am talking about asteroid colonization, you see, a key component of the plan is to piggyback onto objects that are allready traveling
around the solar system. Cruithnes closest pass is only abit farther
out than the moon.
-----------



 exactly how empty space is, and how far apart useful sites are. The moon is the only thing we can reach quickly from Earth. Getting anywhere else, at all, means changing radius by 0.5 AU going in to Venus (which we don't want to, for reasons mentioned previously), or 1 AU out to Mars. Large bodies in the solar system are more or less set up in a geometric progression, so getting from anywhere else to anywhere else involves travelling at least 2 AU and usually more. Any of these trips takes years or longer, depending on delta-v available (you probably don't have the delta-v to do a straight transfer orbit for objects in the inner solar system, so you have to use an Earth or Moon flyby after one complete orbit at Earth's distance from the sun before going anywhere). Any of these trips also takes large amounts of delta-v to do at all, as noted in my first post.

*Think of the Earth/Moon system as a double planet, for this reason. It's one location, and travel from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit is easy (though surface launches from Earth are prohibitively expensive, and soft-landing on the moon or lifting off from it takes quite a bit of fuel).

*It's not just human health that's affected by microgravity. Microgravity mucks up just about any industrial process developed on Earth (i.e., that we have significant experience with and understanding of). If you're building any kind of machinery, including your airmakers and watermakers and refinery/smelter, you want it to operate in gravity if at all possible, even if it's low gravity. This is why you'd colonize the moon to mine material for large projects, and colonize moons of Jupiter, and Mars, and only the really big asteroids before even thinking about doing anything with the small rocks in the belt. In the outer solar system, where water can exist as ice in vacuum, you might break off chunks of small icy bodies to tow back to refineries on moons, but you'd only do this if you didn't have material already available, and just about all of the outer solar system moons have ices already.
------------------------
Been here also. An old proffessor freind of mine ran me through a thought experiment which demonstrated how problematic things could be. The stuff i had designed up blew up, fell apart, launched away
from the asteroid, the asteroids dust created by mining, etc etc etc
i have contemplated these problems and still consider going after small rocks to be the best early tactic. I am not alone in this,
a lot of other people have similar ideas.
-----------------
*For pack psychology vs. tribal psychology, remember that you're only dealing with a small group for as long as it takes to establish the colony infrastructure. Each subsequent ship, or subsequent ferry run if it's one ship moving back and forth, brings around 30 more people, because you're not hauling colony infrastructure equipment. As long as the small group only has to last 5 years or so, you're fine. This is why a fast transport is desirable (though not necessarily _possible_).
------------------
I'm only betting on a 15 year flight time from earth to pluto.
I think thats conservative and fair, and if it doesn't work out that
way, i will be fine with it.
--------------
*You also seem to be overlooking exactly how nasty small-town politics gets. 
------------------
untrue, i am actually an expert in Sociology, so, even tho i am only a hobbyist in physics, i have knowledge at deep levels for the humanities, those are the bases i do have covered as well as anybody is going to.
------------


As long as the group is small enough that everyone knows most of the others, or a large fraction of the others, social structures freeze in place. The threshold for this seems to my uneducated guess to be around a thousand people. This also determines how unusual someone can be and still find like-minded people (if your hobby or mindset is 1 in 100, then you can find like minds in a 1000-person town, but not if you're at 0.1% or less). Large towns of 10,000 or more would be required to reduce these effects. Either way, you're not going to haul that many colonists over, so in practice you're starting with 50-100 people, and hoping they sort themselves out after a few generations of large families.
---------------
i have info posted on group sizes and will add more as the occasion and time permit.
-------------
*This is another reason why communication with Earth is a good thing. It gives anyone alienated on the colony a support network of like-minded individuals (for better or for worse).
--------------
I think broad band communication with earth is a good idea and am sorry you seem to think that my comments indicated otehrwise. All I am saying is that theres a balance here, and that we don't want our people fixated on earth.
------------



*Growing food by hydroponics has just as many problems as making a biological airmaker: it takes a lot of power (plants are inefficient), and is suceptible to infection and other maintenance problems. The weight in dried food lasts quite a while and can be stored for years. You'd only start growing things when you could get light for free (a greenhouse on an inner-system world). Outer-system colonies would either need large concentrator mirrors, or would need to spend a very large amount of power, or would just have supplies shipped in periodically. On a spaceship, it's not volume that's a problem (for things that don't need shielding), but weight of the apparatus, and amount of power needed (which means weight in the power plant).
------------------
Again, I am not a physicist and i don't do algebra. I have on the other hand studied ecology sciences in pretty good depth, and I think
i know what is possible. I'd be going for a garden as soon as the ships got into space because i know thats the best way to do it.
-----------



*You'd only use a maglev launch system on a body with an escape velocity of about 1-2 km/s or more. This means the moon. Mars (like Earth) would _benefit_ from one but can't build one because of the atmosphere. Smaller bodies don't have an incentive to build one, because chemical shuttles work fine. Very small bodies, with escape velocities on the range of 100-200 m/s, would use short launch tracks of the type found on aircraft carriers on Earth, but that's a very different type of system (much cheaper to build).
------------
Never even thought of that kind of launch system. The space elevators
are the product of a visitor who hasn't returned. If he does return,
I'll be asking him to justify some of his ideas, more or less
------------------
*The only worlds where a space elevator makes sense are Earth and Mars, because they're rotating quickly, have atmospheres preventing magnetic launches, and are massive enough that chemical rockets are very expensive to use. They're very big, very expensive to make, and very annoying to maintain, so if other options are usable, other options would get used. In practice, Mars is the only place I'd expect to see one, because an elevator for Earth requires materials we don't know how to make yet.

*A rotating base colony-side is an interesting idea, but you'd avoid it due to mechanical annoyance if possible. 
--------------
It solves more problems than it generates.
--------
Any world with 0.1 gravities or more would keep humans adequately healthy, though they'd have trouble if they went down to Earth. 
-------------
Muscles atrophy probably in less than .4 G.
--------


Ceres is 1000 km wide. I'd be reluctant to colonize anything smaller than 500 km, due to the difficulties microgravity causes industry. Typical outer solar system moons are thousands of km wide.
---------------
Centripetal force makes smaller rocks a lot more interesting to start
with.
---------------



*You want rotating parts of the ship to be on as long a baseline as possible. This makes the rotation rate as low as possible. Quickly rotating ships cause motion sickness problems, and sometimes mechanical nastiness due to the coroilis effect. This is why I specced the crew compartment to be at the end of a long cable. You only need one other rotating module, as a counterweight. You don't want the drive module to move relative to the ship's centre of mass, so it can't rotate. This gives you three modules, per my previous outline.
-----------------
I think we more or less agree, just minor variations in implementation. 
------------
*We're going to have to agree to disagree on the &quot;armies of robot workers&quot; thing. 
----------------
I think that you are missing the point. I am a realist and a pragmatist. I know that there are serious problems to be solved. I am anxious for us to start working to solve them. If we don't have operational robots in time to lanch the first ships, then we will have other things to do wha they might have. The main thing is
I am just trying to get the problem solving process going. If we assume it won't work and don't try to solve the problems, then of course, it won't work, and thats one way we won't solve any problems.
If we assume it will work, and find out as we work on it that it won't, at least we will be working on the problem, and maybe in a generation or two it will be useful. I am not stupid nor am i a crackpot. I just want to get people working on solving the problems
in a realistic way. Short term, I just want to use the basic premise
to write a whole hoarde of themed textbooks. I'm not pretending to have any answers i don't have, I am just stringing things together as best as i can figure and hoping that will suffice until physics
folks like yourself string them together even better. I'm not ego attached here, I am seriously and honestly seeking a group effort
based on reason, science, logic, and what is real.
----------------


They'd be far, far more complex than any system we've designed to date, and the expense and difficulty of designing a system goes up extremely quickly as complexity is increased. The chance of it actually working goes down very quickly as complexity is increased. This is why I'm not optimistic about the technology for fully autonomous, self-replicating factories and robots being developed within any useful planning horizon. You're correct about it radically changing how you'd implement projects, but there are lots of technologies that would have effects like that. None look like they're happening in the near future.

I hope this explains why I made some of the statements I did previously. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Christopher_Thomas Christopher Thomas] [[User:130.63.92.157|130.63.92.157]] 23:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Apache Ant has a task called &lt;xslt&gt; (or its synonym &lt;style&gt;) that performs an XML transform on a file or group of files.

Here is an example XML transformation target:

 &lt;target name=&quot;MyXSLT&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xslt in=&quot;MyInput.xml&quot; 
       out=&quot;MyOutput.xml&quot;
       style=&quot;MyTransform.xslt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/xslt&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

In the ant target there are three files you must specify:
* '''in''' The name of the source XML input file
* '''out''' The name of the XML output file
* '''style''' The name of the XSLT file

To test this you can create a &quot;dummy&quot; input file:
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;root&gt;
    &lt;Input&gt;Hi&lt;/Input&gt;
 &lt;/root&gt;

==Hello World XSLT Tranform==
To get started, here is a small &quot;hello world&quot; transform file.  The transform looks for the root data element of the input file but does not actually process any of the input file data elements:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;xml&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
         &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello World!&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

You can now execute this from a command line.  The following is an example run from a Microsoft Windows command shell:

  C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab1&gt;ant
  Buildfile: build.xml
  
  MyXSLT:
       [xslt] Processing C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab1\MyInput.xml to C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab
  1\MyOutput.xml
       [xslt] Loading stylesheet C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab1\MyTransform.xslt
  
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  Total time: 1 second

The output will appear in a file called MyOutput.xml

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello World!&lt;/MyMessage&gt;

===Transforming Files containing external References===
Sometimes you may need to transform XML files containing external references, like URLs in DTDs or Schema definitions.

Quite often, parsing or validating against such external files can not be totally disabled. Saxon for example will want to read DTDs even if parsing them is disabled (parameter &quot;-dtd:off&quot; or equivalent).

In such cases it may also occur, that the development workstation is connected to a company intranet that is protected by a firewall from the internet, and needs some sort of proxy or socks configuration. 

In these cases, the only solution to successfully execute the transformation is by adding this connection configuration to the ant script.

Example (taken from a bigger build.xml file):

    &lt;target name=&quot;xdoclet-merge-top&quot; depends=&quot;init, proxy-set&quot; &gt;
      &lt;xslt style=&quot;${XDocletDescDir}/merge.xslt&quot; 
        in=&quot;${XDocletDescDir}/merge1.xml&quot; 
        out=&quot;${XDocletDescDir}/jboss-2.xml&quot; force=&quot;true&quot; &gt;			
        &lt;classpath location=&quot;${ZubehoerDir}/SaxonHE9-4-0-1J/saxon9he.jar&quot; /&gt;	
      &lt;/xslt&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;proxy-set&quot;&gt;
      &lt;setproxy proxyhost=&quot;proxy.mynet.de&quot; proxyport=&quot;8080&quot; proxyuser=&quot;&quot; proxypassword=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;

==Passing Parameters from Ant into an XSLT script==
You can also pass parameters from an ant build file into an XSLT.  This is handy if you need to run the same transform with small variations.  You can do this by simply adding the &lt;/code&gt;param&lt;/code&gt; tag the &lt;xslt&gt; target:

 &lt;param name=&quot;MyParameter&quot; expression=&quot;ANT AND XSLT ROCK&quot;/&gt;

The ant task now looks like the following:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;project default=&quot;MyXSLT&quot;&gt;
     &lt;target name=&quot;MyXSLT&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xslt
           in=&quot;MyInput.xml&quot;
           out=&quot;MyOutput.xml&quot;
           style=&quot;MyTransform.xslt&quot;&gt;
           &lt;param name=&quot;MyParameter&quot; expression=&quot;ANT AND XSLT ROCK&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xslt&gt;
     &lt;/target&gt;
 &lt;/project&gt;

Here is a sample transform that takes a single input parameter:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;xml&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;MyParameter&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;MyMessages&gt;
            &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello From XSLT&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
            &lt;MyMessage&gt;From input: &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;/root/Input&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/MyMessage&gt;
            &lt;MyMessage&gt;
                &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$MyParameter&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/MyMessage&gt;
        &lt;/MyMessages&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;


This will create the following output:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;MyMessages&gt;
     &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello From XSLT&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
     &lt;MyMessage&gt;From input: Hi&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
     &lt;MyMessage&gt;ANT AND XSLT ROCK&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
 &lt;/MyMessages&gt;

Note that there are three different lines.  One came from the transform file, one came from the input XML file and one was passed directly in from the ant file.

== Other ways to use XSLT within Apache Ant ==

=== Checking dependencies ===
By default, the XSLT task will check the file time stamps to see if the output file is newer than the input file.  If the outputs are newer the task should not have to re-run the transform.  But sometimes a transform will import other transforms files and Ant does not check the timestamps of imported files.  (Perhaps they will add that as an option in the future.)  But all is not lost.  We can achieve the same results by using the &lt;dependset&gt; tag.  Here is an example:

 &lt;dependset&gt;
    &lt;srcfilelist dir=&quot;${XSLTDir}&quot;
       files=&quot;Content2HTML.xsl, HTMLHeader.xsl,PageHeader.xsl,LeftNav.xsl,PageFooter.xsl&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;targetfileset
       dir=&quot;${BuildDir}&quot;
       includes=&quot;*.htm&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/dependset&gt;

In the above example the source transform (Content2HTML.xsl) imported the other four page fragment transforms located in the XSLTDir (HTMLHeader.xsl, PageHeader.xsl, LeftNav.xsl and PageFooter.xsl).  It created the files in the BuildDir directory.  If any of the inputs files change, the outputs will be regenerated.

This is a handy way to build a little ant-based web content management system.  You just put the HTML content in a directory and the transform can wrap the HTML headers, navigation bars and footers around your content.  The HTML for each page can just be a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; section that is copied into the output using the &lt;xsl:copy-of&gt; command.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Put simply, a subspace is analogous to a subset of a topological space. Subspaces have powerful applications in topology.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;( X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and let &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Define the open sets as follows:

A set &lt;math&gt;U_1 \subseteq X_1&lt;/math&gt; is '''open''' in &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a a set &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U_1=U\bigcap X_1&lt;/math&gt;

An important idea to note from the above definitions is that a set not being open or closed does not prevent it from being open or closed within a subspace. For example, &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; as a subspace of itself is both open and closed.

== Introduction ==
This is a collection of '[[w:False friend|false friends]]' (shared words having different meanings) between Slavonic languages, e.g. Russian–Polish, Macedonian–Upper Sorbian, Belarusian–Serbian, etc. For an idea about 'false friends' with respect to the English language, please see [[w:List of words having different meanings in British and American English|List of British American False Friends]]

The [[w:Hypertext|hypertext]] navigation in this book is simple. Use the [[#navtab|navigation table]] at the top of this page and click at an '''X''' at the crossing of two languages to find an alphabetical list of false friends between these languages. A click at the abbreviation of a language itself leads you to a ''monolingual'' page giving an overview over the 'false friends' of the respective language in all other Slavonic languages.

The [[/Maps|semasiological maps]] give you an overview over the different meanings a word has in different Slavonic languages.

Alternatively, you can also use the alphabetical list of all existing pages at [[:Category:False Friends of the Slavist]].

== Conversion from a personal project ==

The concept and the first 2447 'false friends' pairs entered into this wikibook come from an internet project by [[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]], which has now been converted into a Wikibook. It was started in October 1999, when the author was writing his [http://www.uni-bonn.de/~dbuncic/staatsarb/ master thesis] about 'false friends'. (At first it was located at www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/slavistik/fauxamis and from September 2001 until February 2006 at www.uni-bonn.de/~dbuncic/fauxamis.) In September 2003, unfortunately all further development had to be stopped due to lack of time. Now at last it can be developed further, with ''everyone'' interested in Slavonic false friends (and there are lots of people who are, see [[#Pre-Wikibook contributors|below]]) being able to contribute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just edited the section on closed circuits; here's what it said before:

''A closed circuit, or a &quot;Short circuit&quot; is simply another name for a wire. A closed circuit is a section of       the circuit that has no significant resistance. If the theoretical resistance goes to zero, ohms law states that any voltage will cause the current flow to approach infinity.''

''Any time this wikibook mentions that voltage or current go to infinity, the reader should keep in mind that the physical circuit will fail long before the value actually reaches infinity. Such failure can cause damage to the circuit, and possibly even harm to people nearby. In colloquial use, it is not unheard of to say that the circuit &quot;explodes&quot; at this point.''

Now, how I understand it, any completed circuit with a flowing charge is &quot;closed&quot; but you wouldn't call any working circuit a &quot;short circuit&quot;. Also, I've been told despite what most books say, current doesn't flow, charge does; this makes a lot more sense, as current is charge/time which is a speed measurement, not an object quantity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">GoGui is a graphical user interface to Go engines supporting GTP.

GoGui is written in Java and runs on all major platforms.
GoGui is especially useful for Go programmers.
It allows to display the output of engine-specific extension commands (&quot;analyze commands&quot;) by using a configuration file.
The Go engine can be written in any language, as long as it is able to communicate using GTP through the standard input/output streams.
This allows to keep the engine free of non-portable GUI code.

Hello, we have a naming convention here in Wikibooks. Basically, we do &quot;Future/Prologue&quot; and not &quot;Future:Prologue&quot;. I have taken the liberty to correct your page, but please follow naming conventions in the future. Good luck with your project. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Links on [[Future/Totalitarian State]] ==
Could I ask you to review these.  There really are a large number on this page - many only go to a graphic or photo.  The idea of Wikibooks is that the reader will find all they need on the page concerned and links, certainly in this quantity, are rarely necessary.  Thank you  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

==Attribution of other wikis==

Here's the way I do it for most wikis:

Go to the page you're copying, copy it, and add it to the new page you're creating.

Then go back to the page you copied, click on &quot;history&quot;, then click on the '''date stamp''' of the most current revision. Copy the URL address, then go back to the new page here on wikibooks.

Edit the talk page, and put in the following (for example):

:Copied from the page &quot;Category:Yunzhong Hou (Futurologist)&quot; on [http://future.wikia.com/ future.wikia], using [http://future.wikia.com/index.php?title=Category:Yunzhong_Hou_%28Futurologist%29&amp;oldid=7977 this revision]. 

If you're using a page from wikipedia, you can do even better by requesting an import on [[WB:RFI]], which brings over all versions of the page history. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Rewriting? ==

You asked about this on the vfd discussion, and I've answered there. I think there's certainly promise in your approach for a good wikibook, but not the way you're doing it. 

I think the best way foreward would be to just take '''one''' scenario (whichever one you prefer: &quot;Matriarchy&quot; would actually be my vote), and go into detail about the reasons for making such a prediction. You could certainly use some empirical trends (i.e., the historical collapse of patriarchy), and any number of psychohistorical factors (will to power, will to belong, philanthropic drive, instinctive drives (sex, need for food, attraction to the path of least resistance), and gender differences (how different drives are expressed and/or interpreted differently by man and women). 

BUT: just laying out a bunch of hypotheticals without discussions of the method just won't fly. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== speedy deleteion ==

If you want something deleted, just add {{tlx|delete|reason}} to the page. This categorizes it so admins can find tagged pages and delete them. For more substantial content, where deletion would not be uncontroversial, list content at [[WB:VFD]]. Please review our [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|deletion policy]] or ask on my talk page if you have further questions. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:34, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
:About the recent speedies you requested:
:#One was changed to a merge tag. Please make sure that ''all'' useful content is merged before requesting deletion. If you still want it deleted, I suggest nominating it at [[WB:VFD]] since there is not &quot;no meaningful content&quot; at the moment.
:#The other was done
:I noticed that you had started [[Principles of Economics/Labor Supply]] from a Wikipedia article. Simple copying of content from Wikipedia doesn't meet the requirements of the GFDL. Instead, please request an import at [[WB:RFI]]. As well, if there are other pages you created with text from Wikipedia, please let me know so I can import and history-merge them to comply with GFDL requirements. Thanks.

===Latest delete requests===
Those pages you wanted deleted seem like good content, so I can't [[WB:SPEEDY|speedily delete]] them.

Ah, that bureaucracy. On Novelas wikia where I am an admin this would never have been a problem. But whatever, I'll make the point by redirecting those redundant pages to the pages with the same material. --Yunzhong Hou 02:13, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:Sorry, no, that's not the point I was trying to make. There's nothing wrong with having duplicated content when the scope &amp; target of two texts are significantly different. I was trying to say nicely that there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to delete those pages, nor redirect them, and that you need to read our policy. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:28, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The problem of space==

The problem of Relationalism and Substantivalism has been discussed earlier. In this section the concept of space will be explored in more depth.

Space is apparent to us all. It is the existence of many simultaneous things at an instant. If we see a ship and hear a dog barking on our left there is space. If we look at a checkerboard there is space.  This occurrence of space in phenomenal experience is similar to the measurement of space in the world: things that are simultaneously at the ends of a metre rule are a metre apart; if there is more than one object at a given instant the objects are separated by space.  

Physicists have found that the mathematics of '''vector spaces''' describes much of the arrangement of things in the world. In a vector space the independent directions for arranging things are called '''dimensions'''.  At any instant physical space has three clearly observable dimensions.  

It has been known for millennia that the three dimensions observable at an instant are interrelated by '''Pythagoras' Theorem''':

Pythagoras' theorem on a plane shows that the length of any displacement is related to the sum of the squares of the displacements in the independent directions (x and y):

&lt;math&gt;h^2 = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;

Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions is:

&lt;math&gt;h^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2&lt;/math&gt;

The advances in geometry in the nineteenth century showed that Pythagoras' theorem was a special case of a '''metric''', an equation that describes displacements in terms of the dimensions available.  In the twentieth century it was realised that time was another independent direction for arranging things that was interrelated to the other three dimensions. The world is now described as a '''four dimensional manifold'''.

The illustration below shows how different numbers of dimensions affect the arrangement of things.  

[[Image:constudspace2.gif]]

It is sometimes suggested that our idea of space is due to some sort of memory that is read out sequentially. This is unlikely because, at any instant a one dimensional form cannot be made to overlie a two dimensional form and a two dimensional form cannot overlie a three dimensional form etc.  One dimensional forms are not ''congruent'' with two dimensional forms. This means that a one dimensional form such as ''virtual memory'' cannot, at any instant, overlie two dimensional forms such as occur in phenomenal experience and hence experience does not supervene on the idea of virtual memory (See section on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:The_philosophical_problem_-_machine_consciousness#The_Computability_Problem_and_Halting_of_Turing_Machines functionalism as a one dimensional Turing Machine]).

Curiously the idea of ''mental space'' is often denied.  McGinn(1995) gives such a denial:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;We perceive, by our various sense organs, a variety of material objects laid out in space, taking up certain volumes and separated by certain distances. We thus conceive of these perceptual objects as spatial entities; perception informs us directly of their spatiality. But conscious subjects and their mental states are not in this way perceptual objects. We do not see or hear or smell or touch them, and a fortiori do not perceive them as spatially individuated.(2) This holds both for the first- and third-person perspectives. Since we do not observe our own states of consciousness, nor those of others, we do not apprehend these states as spatial. &lt;/font&gt; McGinn(1995).

This denial is strange because it begins by describing phenomenal experience as clearly spatial and then proceeds to argue that there is some other thing, the &quot;mental state&quot;, which is non-spatial. This seems to contradict our everday life where our experience is our experience, there is no other experience.  The issue is whether this experience is things in themselves (Direct Realism) or some other form in the brain (Indirect Realism). The illustration below shows how space occurs in phenomenal experience; it sidesteps the issue of the location of the contents of phenomenal consciousness.

[[Image:constudspace.gif]]

McGinn (1995) gives a description of how phenomenal experience cannot be overlaid by a 3D model of events in the brain:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Consider a visual experience, E, as of a yellow flash. Associated with E in the cortex is a complex of neural structures and events, N, which does admit of spatial description. N occurs, say, an inch from the back of the head; it extends over some specific area of the cortex; it has some kind of configuration or contour; it is composed of spatial parts that aggregate into a structured whole; it exists in three spatial dimensions; it excludes other neural complexes from its spatial location. N is a regular denizen of space, as much as any other physical entity. But E seems not to have any of these spatial characteristics: it is not located at any specific place; it takes up no particular volume of space; it has no shape; it is not made up of spatially distributed parts; it has no spatial dimensionality; it is not solid. Even to ask for its spatial properties is to commit some sort of category mistake, analogous to asking for the spatial properties of numbers. E seems not to be the kind of thing that falls under spatial predicates. It falls under temporal predicates... &lt;/font&gt;McGinn(1995)

He concludes that a 3D form can only be rearranged into the form of the things in experience over a succession of instants (&quot;It falls under temporal predicates&quot;). This is highly suggestive of phenomenal experience having more than three dimensions in the same way as an ordinary physical thing or field has more than three dimensions.

==The problem of qualia==

A quality of an object such as its colour, roughness, temperature etc. is known as a '''quale''', the plural of quale is '''qualia'''.  Qualia are the contents of phenomenal consciousness. The term &quot;qualia&quot; is sometimes extended to all mental aspects of an object such as roundness, size and even relative position. 

===The physics of qualia===

According to physicalism qualia must be things in the universe. But what are &quot;things in the universe&quot; and which of these are qualia?

If we wish to explain phenomenal experience we must first decide whether experience is a measurement or things themselves.  Measurement begins with a quantum mechanical interaction between an instrument and a set of particles, this then creates a ''signal'' which is a change in the state of the instrument. The signal can be a flow of charge or a chemical change etc.  In the Direct Realist case the signal would be the change at the interface between the bulk of a material (a crude measuring device) and a set of QM particles, in the Indirect Realist case it would be some signal in the brain derived from the initial signal.  In either case phenomenal consciousness would be some form of a set of signals themselves. Intriguingly, these final signals that are the content of consciousness would be subject to quantum uncertainty.

The signals that form phenomenal consciousness would differ from those that mediate the transfer of information from QM phenomena to measuring instruments. 

The signals in measuring events arise as a result of interactions between QM phenomena and a measuring apparatus composed of relatively large structures. These structures (called ''the environment'') produce signals at definite locations.  This chain of fixing positions is known as '''decoherence''' (see Zurek (2003)  or Bacciagaluppi (2004) for a review).  This means that measuring events fix the positions of signals and these represent the positions of QM events. (Some physical particles such as photons are subject to little decoherence during propagation, even in water (cf: Anglin &amp; Zurek (1996)).) 

So signals in measuring devices usually have highly restrained positions. Now consider the final signals, the one's in phenomenal consciousness.  To an observer of the brain they should be, very nearly, in their classical positions within the brain unless they consist of photons or are subject to some special effect such as has been proposed for microtubules. The brain acts as a measuring device causing decoherence. But despite this even signals composed of sodium ions, which should decohere rapidly in water, have a tiny, but finite, probability of remaining in a coherent state.

If your conscious experience is the signals and not the fabric of the brain are you the set of signals that interacts with the brain fabric almost immediately, the set that interacts after a minute or the set that almost never interacts?  To an outside observer you must be the main chance, the rapidly interacting signals, but to the signals themselves all possibilities exist. Which one are you?  Certainly any interaction between the signals and the mutually observed world must involve decoherence but the external observer would find it difficult to determine whether a particular interaction was due to signals that had interacted immediately or ones that were delayed (or delayed in an alternate QM reality). This problem is part of the ''preferred basis problem'' that will be discussed later.

Zurek (2003)assumes that phenomenal experience is identical to measurements.  The observer is then both the signal and the apparatus that encloses the signal. He summarises the resultant idea of the completely determined observer who is fully integrated into the measured world:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;The ‘higher functions’ of observers - e.g., consciousness, etc. - may be at present poorly understood, but it is safe to assume that they reflect physical processes in the information processing hardware of the brain. Hence, mental processes are in effect objective, as they leave an indelible imprint on the environment: The observer has no chance of perceiving either his memory, or any other
macroscopic part of the Universe in some arbitrary superposition. &quot;&lt;/font&gt; Zurek (2003)

Notice the phrase &quot;perceiving .. his memory&quot; - as neuroscientists we must ask &quot;how&quot;? By more measurements?  There are no more measurements when things are arranged in phenomenal consciousness, the information has nowhere else to go. However, according to the empiricist philosophers the arrangements of the signals in phenomenal consciousness do extend through time in a definite order at any instant. Is it this order that determines the positions of signals in the brain or is it the brain that determines this order?

Physicalism leads us to an idea of the content of consciousness as an arrangement of quantum fields like the content of the brain or the content of the world.  The arrangement of the quantum fields at an instant in experience is probably related to the arrangement of measured events at a succession of instants in the world.

===The philosophy of qualia===

The term &quot;qualia&quot; was introduced by C.I. Lewis in 1929:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;This given element in a single experience of an object is what will be meant by &quot;a presentation.&quot; Such a presentation is, obviously, an event and historically unique. But for most of the purposes of analyzing knowledge one presentation of a half-dollar held at right angles to the line of vision, etc., will be as good as another. If, then, I speak of &quot; the presentation&quot; of this or that, it will be on the supposition that the reader can provide his own illustration. No identification of the event itself with the repeatable content of it is intended.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;In any presentation, this content is either a specific quale (such as the immediacy of redness or loudness) or something analyzable into a complex of such. The presentation as an event is, of course, unique, but the qualia which make it up are not. They are recognizable from one to another experience.(CI Lewis, ''Mind and the World Order'', 1941 edition Chapter 2)&lt;/font&gt;

Tye (2003) gives the following definition of qualia:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Experiences vary widely. For example, I run my fingers over sandpaper, smell a skunk, feel a sharp pain in my finger, seem to see bright purple, become extremely angry. In each of these cases, I am the subject of a mental state with a very distinctive subjective character. There is something it is like for me to undergo each state, some phenomenology that it has. Philosophers often use the term 'qualia' to refer to the introspectively accessible properties of experiences that characterize what it is like to have them. In this standard, broad sense of the term, it is very difficult to deny that there are qualia.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; Tye(2003).

In philosophy objects are considered to have perceived features such as shape and colour, weight and texture which are called sensible qualities.  Sensible qualities are divided into intrinsic, or primary, qualities that are properties of the object itself and extrinsic, or secondary, qualities which are related to the sensations produced in the observer.  Shape is generally considered to be a primary quality whereas colour is often considered to be a secondary quality. It is generally considered that secondary qualities correspond to qualia (Smith 1990, Shoemaker 1990) and the two terms are often used synonymously. Although secondary qualities may be qualia, the term &quot;qualia&quot; may include things other than perceptions such as pain etc. that are, arguably, not secondary qualities. Primary qualities might also give rise to experience that is distinct from, say, the shape of an object itself. 

Although &quot;qualia&quot; is a recent term, the philosophical debate about the nature of secondary qualities, such as colours, and the nature of conscious experience itself has been around for millennia.

It seems that the visual system gives rise to experience even in the absence of previous visual stimulation. For example, when someone recovers from blindness they have an experience that contains shapes and colours even though these have little meaning:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;When he first saw, he was so far from making any judgement of distances, that he thought all object whatever touched his eyes.... he knew not the shape of anything, nor any one thing from another, however different in shape and magnitude.. We thought he soon knew what pictures represented, which were shewed to him, but we found afterwards we were mistaken; for about two months after he was couched, he discovered at once they represented solid bodiess, when to that time he considered them only as party-coloured panes, or surfaces diversified with variety of paint.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; William Cheselden (1728)

Qualia are the components of experience, whatever the mode of input to that experience. Strawson (1994) includes content such as accompanies suddenly remembering or thinking of something as examples of qualia.

There is thought to be an ''explanatory gap'' associated with qualia (Levine 1983), as an example it is hard to imagine how the experience called pain could be a set of impulses in the brain.  

Some philosophers have attempted to bridge this gap by invoking Direct Realism, proposing that our experience is in some way 'transparent' so that we experience the world or the injured limb directly (i.e.: there is an assumption that things flow within phenomenal experience into a centre point and we see right through this flow!).  Strange though it may seem, this idea has led to a deduction that phenomenal experience is a set of things and qualities are these things, not deductions about or experiences of these things. As Tye (2003) puts it:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;These observations suggest that qualia, conceived of as the immediately 'felt' qualities of experiences of which we are cognizant when we attend to them introspectively, do not really exist. The qualities of which we are aware are not qualities of experiences at all, but rather qualities that, if they are qualities of anything, are qualities of things in the world (as in the case of perceptual experiences) or of regions of our bodies (as in the case of bodily sensations). This is not to say that experiences do not have qualia. The point is that qualia are not qualities of experiences. &lt;/font&gt;

However, the outstanding issue for Tye's analysis is where in the world the thing that is called a quale exists - on a thing in the world beyond the body, on the retina, in the cortex, in the thalamus? Tye seems to be suggesting that &quot;in the world&quot; can only be beyond the retina but given that a television can have a colour and a retina can have a colour why should we insist that the colour in conscious experience is always ''of'' the thing being represented via the DVD or videotape?

As was seen in the previous section, only signals are available in the classical world of conscious observation. The &quot;reality&quot; of the things that generate signals is not available. So whether experience is a signal at the position of what we call an &quot;oak tree&quot; or a signal in the eye due to photons reflected from the tree or a signal in the brain the same sort of phenomena would apply.  Qualia would be a field of signals, not processes based on these signals. 

Some philosophers hold that qualia are a field of signals derived from the original signals that are next to the quantum phenomena that compose an object. In other words they propose that qualia are not the first signals in the chain from whatever composes an object to the observer. These philosophers are known as Representationalists and the emphasis on secondary signals allows a contribution from the brain etc. to the field of signals that is conscious experience.  Modern representationalists such as Tye (1995), Lehar(2003) and Dretske(2003) emphasise the idea that qualia are actual things that represent objects rather than concepts or experiences of things. As Dretske puts it:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;..the features that define what it is like to have an experience are properties that the objects we experience (not our experience of them) have.&lt;/font&gt;(Dretske 2003).

Lehar(2003) uses modern language to express the empiricist notion that the signals that comprise qualia are more likely to be in our brains than elsewhere, according to Lehar the objects we experience must be informational replicas in our heads:
  
&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The central message of Gestalt theory therefore is that the primary function of perceptual processing is the generation of a miniature, virtual-reality replica of the external world inside our head, and that the world we see around us is not the real external world, but is exactly that miniature internal replica (Lehar 2003).&quot;&lt;/font&gt; 

Direct Realists and Representationalists share the same view that qualia are an actual, physical field of things somewhere in the world.  Some functionalists and eliminativists take a different view, believing that qualia do not exist except as judgements of properties that are used in interactions (i.e.: as disembodied information - see the section on Direct Realism).

== Overview ==
Perl modules (Files that end with the pm extension) are files of perl code that can be reused from program to program. There is an online repository of perl modules called CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at http://cpan.org. Many of these modules come standard with Perl, but others must be installed as needed.

There are thousands of perl modules that do everything from creating a temporary file to calling Amazon web services. These modules can make it easy to quickly write your application if you know how to find, install, and use the appropriate Perl modules.  If you are thinking of writing your own Perl module, the best thing to do is to first search at http://Search.cpan.org to make sure you are not about to reinvent the wheel.

There are two major styles of Perl modules:

# Object-Oriented
# Functional

Some perl modules use both approaches. 

To use an object-oriented Perl module you would do something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
use Foo;
my $foo = Foo-&gt;new();
print $foo-&gt;bar;  #call Foo's bar method and print the output.
&lt;/pre&gt;

A functional perl module might get used like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
use Foo qw/bar/; # Import the name of the subroutine you want to use.
print bar();
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== How to install a Perl module ===

Find the perl module you want at http://cpan.org, and download the gzipped file.
Untar and unzip the file:

&lt;pre&gt;
tar -zxvf MyModule.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then cd into the directory, and follow the instructions in the README or INSTALL file.

You can also use a command-line program called cpan, if you have it installed:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo cpan -imt Module::I::Want
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== To Write your own Perl Module ===
Perl modules differ from perl scripts in two key and simple ways.
Instead of starting the module with &quot;#!/path/to/perl&quot;, you start the file with the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
package My::Module::Name;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You need to end the module with a true value, so the common practice is to do this at the end of the file:
&lt;pre&gt;
1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following is a valid perl module:
&lt;pre&gt;
package My::Module::Name;

1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Example ====

We create a new file called ExampleModule.pm, and in it have the following code:

&lt;pre&gt;
package ExampleModule;
use strict;
use base &quot;Exporter&quot;;
our @EXPORT = qw/hello_world/;

sub hello_world
{
   print &quot;hello, world!\n&quot;;
}

1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can test to see if the syntax is valid by running:
&lt;pre&gt;
perl -c ExampleModule.pm
&lt;/pre&gt;

It will print out &quot;ExampleModule.pm syntax OK&quot; if all is well. Otherwise, you can debug using the messages that are printed out.

Now we can use it in a script to see if it works:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

use ExampleModule;

hello_world();

exit;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Voilá! You have made a perl module.

=== Create a CPAN-style Perl module ===
CPAN-style modules have test suites and a way to build the module into the perl library. 

Download and install: Module::Starter from CPAN. Once this is installed, there will be a program called module-starter in your path.
To create a new module, do the following from the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
module-starter --module=My::Module::Name, My::Other::Module::Name, --author=&quot;My Name&quot; --email=&quot;myemail@gmail.com&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It will then create a set of directories for you, including some shell module files with starter POD documentation.
The perl modules will be inside the lib directory inside the directory that is created. These are the files to edit. You can put your tests for the modules into the &quot;t&quot; directory.
To install and build the module, you do the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;perl Makefile.PL
&gt;make
&gt;make test
&gt;sudo make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

==An Introduction==
Pixel art is anything drawn in the medium of computer pixels, usually created one pixel at a time.  Because of this, pixel drawings are usually done on a small scale to save time.

Isometric pixel art is the use of pixel art in an isometric viewpoint.  Alternate or exaggerated perspective is rarely used in isometric pixel art, as it complicates the drawing process.

[[Image:Ispa_b_4.jpg|frame|right|A cube in an isometric viewpoint]]

==Drawing Programs==
The are numerous computer graphic programs available today.  Because of the relatively simple process of creating pixel art, one need not be picky about what they use to create it.
*MS Paint will generally work well, though it lacks several features (translucency, layers) that more complex programs may provide
*Photoshop or other programs of the sort (Paintshop Pro, The Gimp) work well, though their line tools may use vectors or otherwise complicated methods of drawing. Many features (such as automatic anti-aliasing) must be turned off in order to pixel with these programs.
*Programs designed specifically for creating pixel art are also available, such as mtPaint, GrafX2, and ASEPRITE.
*Pixen is a great free app for Mac users.
*Pixelesque is a good pixel art editor for Android and Android-compatible systems(CyanogenMOD, Replicant). It is limited to art of 64x64 pixels or smaller.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two of the basic principles of combinatory logic in discrete mathematics are the Sum principle and the Multiplication principle.

The sum principle holds true in a given partitioned set X where partition Xi intersected with Xj is the empty set unless i is equal to j. The principle states that in such a partitioned set, the sum of the elements of each partition is equal to the number of elements in the set X.

      <comment>The World of Eolian</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The World of Eolian ==

The Purpose of this Wikibook is to create a cohesive fantasy world for use in the d20 role playing system. 

Eolian is an epic world of vast unending sky. Small floating islands are all that remain of a once whole planet, saved from total destruction by the last of man's magic. 

Ingenuity rather then magical will now rule. The sky is filled with the fruits of that ingenuity. Great clockwork flying machines and dirigibles connect the sundered, floating  land masses. Rope &amp; wood bridges stretching across expanses of endless sky are a part of daily life. Engineers create ever more wondrous clockwork devices.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Hi 60.229.70.222 and 70.52.2.61 -- Thanks very much for your corrections! --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 20:29, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

===About γραβάτα and other loan words===
The word η γραβάτα (the tie) although it is Greek, it is not from a Greek root, but a loan from Italian. Perhaps by mentioning the cognate, a misconception may be created that there is a Greek root to cravat --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 07:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
:I'll change the → symbols to ~, which hopefully will do a better job of suggesting the possible relationships (Greek from English, English from Greek, or both Greek and English from a different language such as Italian).--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 16:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

==χτενίζω==
Is χτενίζω the normal way to express the idea of combing the hair? It doesn't seem to be prominently featured in dictionaries, and a google search turned up a relatively low number of hits. Is there some other wasy of expressing this that's more idiomatic? The vocabulary is neeed in lesson 6 for the reading about the battle of Thermopylae.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:28, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:Yes χτενίζω is the correct verb. However, the '''passive''' voice is used. Nobody will say ''χτενίζω τα μαλλιά μου'', they will always say ''χτενίζομαι''. The expression (''χτενίζω τα μαλλιά μου'') is lyrical and is used in cases when lyricism is needed. The passage from the Battle of Thermopylae is one of those cases because it describes an epic event and a little lyricism is fine. Although one could still say ''χτενίζονται'' instead of ''χτενίζουν τα μαλλιά τους'', it sounds a bit mundane when referring to their battle preparations.

:In common speech the verb χτενίζω in the active voice is used when combing someone else's hair. In most cases τα μαλλιά (the hair) is not mentioned at all and the actual expression is: ''Η μητέρα χτενίζει το παιδί'', the mother combs the child('s hair).

:A common expression between women is ''Πού χτενίζεσαι;'' which doesn't mean &quot;where do you comb your hair&quot; but &quot;where you're having your hair done&quot;.¨

==take off==
How do you say &quot;I take off my coat?&quot; Do you use εκβάλλω? --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 21:12, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
:Βγάζω το παλτό μου [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 23:03, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

==Prepositions used as suffixes==
I don't like the hyphens in this section. Is it OK if I take them back out? In my opinion, they make the words harder to read, not easier, and the reader might get the impression that the words were really written that way.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 00:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:Changed it :-) You are right of course.--[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 00:32, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

==cognates for body parts==
Am I just confused about ζωή? My English dictionary says &quot;zoo&quot; is derived from a Greek word meaning both &quot;life,&quot; and &quot;animal.&quot; Is αυτί not actually cognate with &quot;audio?&quot;--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 01:15, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:Ζωή = Life, Ζώο(ν) = Animal.
Audio (lat.)= I hear, αφτί or αυτί (ear) &lt; ωτίον. I don't know if these are cognates, you will have to ask a linguist. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 01:59, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:The word meaning animal is ''ζώο'' not ''ζωή'', but since the root is the same I guess it can be used as cognate. ''Audio'' is Latin, but the Latin word is derived from Greek. Same with ''decapitate'' (from Latin:''capita''), which again is derived from Greek. I don't know though if the reader can make an immediate connection between ''decapitate'' and ''κεφάλι'', this is why I put a medical term using the exact Greek root. --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 01:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:It is a fallacy to believe that ''caput'' (not *''capita'') comes from κεφαλή, they are cousins. English ''two'', Greek ''δύο'', latin ''duo'' Russian ''dva'' etc. are all derived from a proto-Indoeuropean word dwo, etc. Only the father in ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' thinks that everything is derived from Greek ;)  [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 01:59, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::Ah, thanks for the info! I'm only using the ~ symbol in the book to mean that the words are related, not that one is derived from the other. Hm, &quot;cephalalgia&quot; isn't even in my dictionary. I'll just put the entries for brain and head together, so they'll relate it to &quot;encaphalitis,&quot; which I think it probably the most common English word that more closely resembles kefali.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 04:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::: About cephalalgia see http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cephalalgia. By the way I have never claimed Greek is the proto-language, of course it came from the Indo-European mould just like Latin, far from me these things! Perhaps you've heard of a guy named [[w: Liakopoulos|Liakopoulos]]? :-)) --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 07:21, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:::: I'm not saying cephalalgia isn't a word, I'm just saying it's so obscure that it's not likely to be helpful to the reader.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 16:38, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Reading ==

The use of ''you'' as an indeterminate pronoun is not common in Greek. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 03:48, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Prepositions used with the genitive ==

This does not belong here because it is archaic and formal. In spite of the legalization of Dimotiki the actual language used today in Greece is a mixture of both. We should avoid teaching katharevousa features early on in this tutorial because they are only confusing and rarely used except for fixed expressions like εν τάξει, προς το παρόν, etc. Modern Greek is a language difficult to master because there is no standard. Every concept introduced has to be considered carefully. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 04:03, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
:I've cut out some of the material. I'm not completely clear on how εν τάξει and προς το παρόν fit in here, though, so it may be that this needs to be edited more. Do people today use the accusative with these pronouns? Only in speech?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 05:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Dozen ==

Although the word ντουζίνα (=dozen) exists in Greek, it is very rarely used (it was actually incorporated in the Greek language from Greek immigrants to the US). Most Greeks will use δεκάδα (=ten).

e.g. Έχω δεκάδες άσπρα πουκάμισα (&quot;I have tens of white shirts&quot;, but actually the meaning is similar to &quot;I have dozens of white shirts&quot;)

Also very common is the expression &quot;καμιά δεκαριά&quot; which means &quot;about/around ten&quot; and its meaning is approximately that of &quot;a dozen&quot;. So regarding the example at the reading section, a Greek person would say ''Απ' το ίδιο κατάστημα θα αγοράσω και καμιά δεκαριά άσπρα πουκάμισα'' (&quot;From the same store I'll buy about ten white shirts&quot; but actually meaning &quot;From the same store I'll buy a dozen white shirts&quot;).

== Nouns in -έας ==

There are some masculine nouns ending in '''-έας''' which follow a bit different endings than the ones ending in '''-ας''', because the ancient greek equivalent original subject case had the ending '''-εύς'''. Direct transliteration into latin alphabet, especially on names of mythical names, produces the ending '''-eus''', e.g. Odyss'''eus'''. These words follow in Modern Greek more or less the same plural endings as in Ancient Greek.

Some examples are: ιερέας (priest), κουρέας (barber), Αχιλλέας (Achilles), Οδυσσέας (Odysseus)

ο ιερέας, του ιερέα, τον ιερέα

οι ιερείς, των ιερέων, τους ιερείς

Therefore the plural subject case (nominative) &quot;οι ιερέες&quot; is wrong, and also does not sound so well. I propose to mention this difference somewhere and change the legend of the priests' image. [[User:Christos|Christos]] 17:15, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== 1) Movie collection ==
Use the following data model:

[[Image:Xml5moviedm.png]]

:a. Using the IDREF method, create an XML schema to describe the illustrated data model. Include all of the attributes listed in the data model.
:b. Create an XML document that includes at least two movies and two cast members per movie. 
:c. Create a simple XML style sheet to present the information in HTML format. No tables or CSS are necessary.


== 2) Student/Class Directory ==

:a. Every class at a school can have many students, and each student can be registered to more than one class at a time.  Create an XML schema to capture this many-to-many relationship.  Be sure to include the class name, capacity, building number, building name, and room number.  Also include the student first/last name separately  and his or her grade for the class.
:b. Using the XML schema created in part a, create an XML document and an XML stylesheet.  You can make up your own data, but be sure to use at least three students for each class.

See dublincore for a set of standard metadata tags appliciable to anything :
  http://dublincore.org/

The w3c defines metadata here :
http://www.w3.org/Metadata/
 &quot;&quot;Metadata is machine understandable information for the web. The W3C Metadata Activity addressed the combined needs of several groups for a common framework to express assertions about information on the Web, and was superceded by the W3C Semantic Web Activity.&quot;

see 
http://www.w3.org/Metadata/Activity.html
&quot;&quot; Missing is a part of the Web which contains information about information - labeling, cataloging and descriptive information structured in such a way that allows Web pages to be properly searched and processed in particular by computer. In other words, what is now very much needed on the Web is  metadata. W3C's Metadata Activity is concerned with ways to model and encode metadata. A particular priority of W3C is to use the Web to document the meaning of the metadata. Our strong interest in metadata has prompted development of the Resource Description Framework (RDF ™) and its relative PICS ™ (Platform for Internet Content Selection). PICS is now complete; work on RDF continues.&quot;&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Abstract Syntax Trees are basically collections of facts in a program.
a set of statements that cantain declarations, types, values, onstants.

They can be compared to graphs of data in RDF.

Trees basically are an intermediate representation of the program facts.

I hope to create a better tree representation for compilers using RDF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You've been making a lot of contributions to the Maple Story guide. No offense, but you make several major changes in many subjects, and it would be nice if you could check your sources a little. For example: it has been proven on many levels that Double Shot consistantly does more damage than AB, not only is DS more consistant, but it does more damage. (contrary to what Wizet puts on their homepage)

All in all, I thank you for your contributions however. I am glad that you are interested in the guide and are contributing to it :) I hope you don't take this as an offense, because I really don't mean it in that way.

Wikibooks in general also has a policy on no original research: you cannot really add your own opinion to a subject. While this is a bit touchy on video games (as most research is not published), if you see something &quot;incorrect&quot; in the subject make sure it is incorrect, and say something on the discussion page about it. Maybe I was wrong when I put something up, so yeah, change it to a &quot;correct&quot; form, but at least talk in the discussion page about it.

===This Book===
Welcome to the wikibooks free text &quot;introductory physical science&quot;! This free text is built as a year-long course in 7th-9th grade basic physical science. This book is a resource and a basis for the course, which is meant to be taught in a laboratory setting. This text centers on student hands-on work as well as answering questions using critical thinking. This book encourages students to write their own methods for each piece of work before they are simply given the proper procedure. Making mistakes is part of all learning, and in the context of science, it is no less important. Therefore, this book will place more emphasis on the procedure, process, and the quality of performance rather that the actual answer.

===Resources===
Student resources for this book are located within the next several pages, and teacher resources are in the back. Student resources include websites, common methods, a basic glossary, and conversion tables. Teacher resources include materials lists, procedures, detailed charts of results found oupon completion of experiments, and much more.
===Use and Copyright===
This textbook is free and available for every person to use. The book can be used in any method described under the GNU free documentation licence. Distribution is unlimited, and is very much encouraged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Writing Laboratory Reports=
When a scientific experiment is performed, all its parts are carefully recorded, and all data gathered is diligently organized. In this section, we will discuss the basic elements of a laboratory report and how to effectively write for a scientific report.

==Title==
All labs must be named, and therefore the first part of a lab is its title and the number of the section.

==Purpose==
It is important to ask the question: why is this lab important? The purpose of a lab is a question to be answered.

Example: In a lab about the density of copper the purpose might read: what is the density of copper?

==Hypothesis==
If it is at all possible, it is important to record a hypothesis prior to performing the experiment. A hypothesis is an educated &quot;guess&quot; as to the outcome of the experiment. Creating a hypothesis allows us to see how far away from the truth our original ideas where (if anything but the truth).

==Materials==
Keep a detailed list of all materials used in the experiment. This will allow you to make sure nothing is missing when you actually construct and perform the experiment. Keeping a list such as this would allow another person to repeat your experiment in order to test your results. The ability of an experiment to be repeated is considered a good quality in science.

==Diagram==
It is important to sketch a small diagram of all materials used in the experiment to demonstrate how they will be set up when the experiment is performed.

==Procedure==
This is possibly the most important section of all. The procedure is a list of numbered instructions that tell how an experiment is done. The procedure should be clear, concise, and very easy to read. The procedure steps should be simple. Each step should be about a sentence in length. The procedure in each experiment should be written so that a person who has little or no knowledge of science or of the experiment you are performing could do it with no preparation.

==Data==
Data is the product of following an experiment's procedure. Data is most frequently collected in tables at first because they are easy to use and they present data in an easily recognizable format. A data table has several parts. In lesson 1.2 we will talk about the use of data tables and the collection of data.

==Graphs and Charts==
Graphs and charts are a more visual way of representing data. We will talk about different types of Charts and Graphs in chapter 1.4.

==Conclusion==
The conclusion is a short paragraph that discusses the outcome of the lab, what was gained from the lab, and what could be done differently and/or changed. The conclusion reviews the procedure and attempts to answer the purpose question. If no answer can be reached, then explain why the purpose question was not answered and explain what further work might answer it.

=Vocabulary and Questions=
* '''Labs''' are experiments done in a laboratory environment.
* '''Data''' is the information gained from an experiment.
* '''Tables''' are a graphic way of organizing data, also known as a '''chart'''.
* '''Graphs''' are another way of representing data, but instead of using words it uses pictures.
* '''Hypothesis''' is an educated guess as to what may happen when the experiment is performed.

==Covering The Reading==
# What part of the experiment would you suggest changes to the procedure?
# Which section would you collect data in?
# What does the word '''lab''' denote?
# When writing a lab procedure what should be remembered about the instructions?
# If you have a lab that is about the solubility of citric acid what would be a valid purpose?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The SI System==
&quot;SI&quot; or &quot;System International&quot; is the worldwide (excepting the US and Liberia) system of measurement. This system includes units of each dimension, but its defining feature is its basis on the number 10. Old english units (also known as the customary system) where based on units of 12 which, although the system stood for centuries, where not as effective as the current SI measurements. The SI system is sometimes also known as the &quot;Metric&quot; system. Below are the common units within the SI system.

==Units==
===Length, Width, Height===
mm - millimetre: equal to .001 metres

cm - centimetre: equal to .01 metres

m - metre: one metre

hm - hectometre: equal to 100 metres

km - kilometre: equal to 1000 metres

===Area===
cm^2 - square centimetres: equal to a square with length and width of 1cm

km^2 - square kilometres: equal to a square with length and width of 1km

===Volume===
cm^3 - cubic cetimetres: equal to a cube with length, width, and height of 1cm

mL - millilitre: .001 liters

cL - centilitre: .01 liters

dL - decilitre

L - litre: one liter: equal to one cubic decimetre

daL - decaliter: 10 liters

hL - hecto litres: 100 liters

===Mass===
mg - miligram .001 gram

cg - centigram .01 gram

g- gram: one gram

dag - decagram: 10 grams

hg - hecto gram: 100 grams

kg - kilo gram: 1000 grams

==The Common Conversions==
The common system has much different values and uses different terminology for different measurements. Below are the differences between the two systems discussed in depth. Only measurements representing the same physical quantities con be &quot;converted&quot;.  

===Mass vs. Weight===
Where the SI system uses Mass, the Common System uses Weight. The two words mean different things. Weight is the effect of the force of gravity on an object's mass. Although weight depends on mass, it is not the same thing as mass. Mass is the amount of matter (material) that exists within an object (we will discuss matter in depth in chapter 1.6). Mass cannot be &quot;converted&quot; to weight, but rather a calculation involving Newton's Second Law of Motion must be used. It is, however, common practice to use the conversions listed below based on the standard acceleration due to gravity here on the earth. This should be further explored when studying motion and forces. 

===Volume===
Volume is very different between the common and SI systems. In the common system the standard units for volume were the flow ounce and the pint. The two have no basis in the SI system and are only converted by sheer mathematical terms. The conversion factors can be found below.

===Conversions===
====Mass====
1 kilogram = 2.2 pound

1 pound =  0.45 kilograms

====Volume====
1 Liter = 33.81 fluid ounces
1 fluid ounce = .029 liters

1 Liter = 2.11 pints

=Vocabulary and Questions=
* '''Length''' is the distance from a given point A to a given point B
* '''Weight''' is the measure of the effect that gravity has on an object
* '''Mass''' is the amount of matter in a given object
* '''Volume''' is the amount of space an object takes up
* '''Conversion''' is the method by which units in one system are measured against those in another

==Covering The Reading==
# Based on your observations, what do the following prefixes mean? kilo, deca, deci, milli, centi, hecto
# What does SI stand for?
# What country did the metric system originate in?
# How many pints are in a liter?
# What number are SI sytem units based on?

==Critical Thinking==
# Using the 

==Exploration==
# Collect containers from around your house check the units on their labels, construct a table that shows the conversions between the customary and metric units.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Matter And Energy=
Matter and Energy are the two components of our universe. This means that everything is either matter or energy. Matter is percived as physical objects, while energy is the forces that act upon and in conjunction with the matter in the universe.

=Matter=
'''Noun'''

'''matter''' (uncountable and countable; plural: matters)

# The basic structural component of the universe. Matter always consists of a mass and a volume, and contains its mass times the speed of light squared in total energy stored.
# A kind of substance.


Matter represents the physical objects in the universe. Matter, although it appears and acts in ways that are far different from energy, is actually captured energy itself. This can be proven when one looks very closely at the structure of matter that begins with a very, very small component.
==Atoms==
Matter begins with atoms. Atoms are the '''Building Blocks''' of everything. An atom is made up of several even smaller parts. What makes atoms matter, and every piece below it energy is that the electrons and nucleus are held together by both the &quot;electromagnetic force&quot; and '''nuclear force'''. Nuclear force is the force that holds all the pieces of the atom together, it works because of the opposite properties of the different pieces of an atom.

==Pieces of an Atom==

===Protons===
'''Protons''' are very small particles that have a positive electric charge. The protons within an atom reside within the '''nucleus'''. The number of protons is always equal to the number of '''electrons''' within an atom. Proton count cannot be changed excepting when the atom is placed under very special conditions within a special scientific apparatus called a '''supercollider''' or an '''atom smasher'''.

===Neutrons===
'''Neutrons''' are tiny particles that have a neutral electric charge. These particles reside inside the '''nucleus'''. '''Neutrons''' do not effect the '''element''' of the atom, but they may affect the '''isotope''' of the element

===Electrons===
'''Electrons''' are particles that are hundreds of times smaller than '''protons''' and '''neutrons'''. The electrons reside within the '''electron cloud''' which surrounds the '''nucleus''' . The '''electrons''' within the '''electron cloud''' travel at different distances from the '''atomic wall''' these levels are called shells. The number of electrons within a shell can be determined with the formula 2n^2 or 2 times the number of the shell to the second power. Therefore the first shell holds 2 electrons, the second holds 8, and the third holds 18.

===Nucleus===
The '''Nucleus''' of an atom is the center, where the '''protons''' and '''neutrons''' exist. The '''nucleus''' contains 99% of the mass of the atom.

==Mass==
Mass is the Standard SI system measurement of how much '''matter''' an object contains. The standard unit for mass in general terms is the '''gram'''.

=Energy=


'''Noun'''
'''energy''' (plural energies)

# The impetus behind all motion and all activity.
# The capacity of an entity to do work.
# (physics) A quantity that denotes the ability to do work and is measured in a unit dimensioned in mass × distance²/time² (ML²/T²) or the equivalent.

Energy is the ability to cause change or to do work. Energy comes in many, many forms; some of the most common forms we experience on earth are: heat, light, and movement. Energy is separated into two different categories: Potential and Kinetic.

==Types of Energy==
===Potential===
Potential energy is energy that is &quot;stored&quot; i.e. not being used. This can mean any type of energy that is not being spent. For example, a book that is carried to the top of a tower has potential energy; which was put into the object when it was carried to the top of the tower. It has potential energy because it is acting against gravity. In physics, every action has an equal and opposite re-action. The action wAS the book being elevated to the top of the tower. And the re-action would be the book falling or otherwise descending to the ground. This is only one type of potential energy, potential energy can exist in many states such as:
* Food (broken down into simple components and expended by respiration)
* Electric Current (stored in batteries, or generators)
* A Spring (mechanical devices, when expanded or contracted too far)

===Kinetic===
Kinetic energy is energy that is in use. Kinetic energy is the energy that radiates, moves, shines, and heats. This type of energy is very common in our universe. Kinetic energy is very, very changeable; all its forms are interchangeable. As shown below
* Motion ----&gt; Heat (through conduction)
* Heat ----&gt; Motion (through convection)
* Light ----&gt; Heat (through radiation)

====Types of Kinetic Energy====
* '''Motion''' is the type of kinetic energy that moves physical objects through space

* '''Heat''' is the type of kinetic energy that moves the molecules of a physical object. This causes the objects temperature to rise.

* '''Light''' is the type of energy that radiates through space in waves and beams. Light is categorized into a spectrum. Visible light is the light we can see reflected off of objects, while other types of light such as x-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves cause radiation.

=Vocabulary and Questions=
* '''Temperature''' is the average amount of kinetic energy that a group of molecules or atoms has because of random movement of the molecules.

* '''Heat''' is the total amount of kinetic energy that a group of molecules has because of the random movement of the molecules.

* '''Thermodynamics''' is the branch of science dealing with energy in the universe and the interaction of that energy with physical objects. We will talk more about '''Thermodynamics''' later.

* '''Conduction''' is the transfer of kinetic energy from one object to another through direct contact.

* '''Convection''' is the transfer of kinetic energy by currents within a fluid.

* '''Radiation''' is the transfer of kinetic energy through space.

=Section Review=
====Covering The Reading====
# Describe matter and energy in your own words
# Define the parts of an atom and their purpose in the atom
# What is an Element?
# How are matter and energy related?
# Which is the smallest piece of an atom?
# Which part of the atom determines the atomic number?
# Which type of energy can cause motion?
# Which type of energy transfer moves kinetic energy through liquids?

====Critical Thinking====
# Suppose that you are using a heat lamp in your bathroom, what is the method by which the kinetic energy it generates is transferred through space?
# If a proton has a weight of 1unit and an electron has a weight of .007 units than how much does an atom of hydrogen with 3 neutrons weigh?

====Exploration====
1) Look at the periodic table of the elements
* What element has atomic number one
* What elements fall into the noble gas set? 

2) Draw a diagram of an atom include the following
* Nucleus with
** Protons
** Neutrons
* Electron shell With
** The correct number of electrons
** The electrons in their appropriate shells

      <text xml:space="preserve">SilverScheme is a Scheme like OO language that uses introspection heavily. The rather unedited doc is here: [[Introspector/LanguageTools/SilverScheme/Doc]]. The ontology used is here: [[Introspector/LanguageTools/SilverScheme/Ontology]].


In Silverscheme the class system is implemented on top of the prototype system. The prototype system is pretty easy: every object is a (changed) copy of another object. The object that it's a copy of is it's prototype.

A few important concepts:

    * Extending: copying an object and entering the scope of the new object to add/change/delete some stuff. Usually done with (define new-obj (old-obj.extend)).
    * Inheriting: if object A extends object B and the field C in A is the same as the field C in B then A is said to have inherited C from B. 


SilverScheme will have a built-in KnowledgeInterchangeFormat reasoner for logic programming.

Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a way of representing knowledge in computers. It's also a quite simple logic language that's useful for reasoning about knowledge. At the moment KIF resources are rather spread across the web, here are a few links:

    * http://www.csee.umbc.edu/kse/kif/
    * http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/

[[Introspector/KifTutorial]]

Ideas for libraries and tools go at [[Introspector/LanguageTools/SilverScheme/Projects]].



A list of projects that will be needed to support SilverScheme and/or make it more fun.

Needed:

    * A simple make system.
    * Interface to a GUI toolkit (preferably FOX, good test for the C++ invocation mechanism)
Fun:
    * SilverSchemeSourcery 


Usually languages have small examples that aren't really fun. SilverScheme has a big fun example however, a full blown board/card game named Sourcery. Sourcery will be a good example of the logic capabilities of SilverScheme since it will use KIF to determine what is allowed and what not in a dynamic way.

==1. Draw the food pyramid guide. List the number of servings required from each group per day. Why is it important to eat a balanced diet?==
The food pyramid guide is updated and published by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  They replaced the food pyramid with &quot;MyPlate&quot; in 2011.  The food pyramid is no longer promulgated by the U.S. government.
If you wish to continue teaching the food pyramid concept, you could use the Loma Linda University Vegetarian Food Pyramid instead.  Both are shown below:

==2. Explain the difference between the following:==
The prefix ''lacto'' means ''milk'', and can be found in words such as ''lactose'' (a chemical found in milk).

The prefix ''ovo'' means ''egg'', and can be found in words such as ''oval'' (which means ''egg-shaped'').

These prefixes are used to describe the exceptions to a vegetarian diet as follows:

===a. Lacto-ovo vegetarian===
A lacto-ovo vegetarian is a person who eats no animal products (such as meat) except for milk (and milk products such as cheese, ice cream, and yogurt), and eggs.
===b. Ovo vegetarian===
An ovo vegetarian is a person who eats no animal products (not meat and not milk) except for eggs.
===c. Vegan vegetarian===
A vegan is a vegetarian who eats no animal products at all.

==3. Plan a two-day menu, containing a balanced lacto-ovo vegetarian diet utilizing the food pyramid guide.==
To do this using the current version of the USDA food pyramid, you must first go to [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov] and enter the Pathfinder's profile (age, sex, and physical activity).  This will tell you how much of each food category the Pathfinder should eat.

The values in the table below are for children who are physically active for 60 minutes or more per day.  Use the USDA website for adults and less active children.

==4. What is another name for Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?==
'''Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also known as '''thiamine.'''  Beriberi is disease cause by a vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.

'''Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also known as '''riboflavin.'''  It is required for red blood cell formation.

==5. List at least three significant food sources of the following nutrients:==
*'''a. Vitamin C:''' Citrus fruits (lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit), tomatoes, and potatoes are good common sources of vitamin C. Other foods that are good sources of vitamin C include papaya, broccoli, brussels sprouts, black currants, strawberries, cauliflower, spinach, cantaloupe, and kiwifruit. Also, cranberries and red peppers are good sources of the vitamin.

*'''b. Vitamin A:''' Milk and eggs are both animal sources of vitamin A.  Carrots and spinach are both good plant sources of vitamin A.

*'''c. Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:'''  Good sources of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; include whole grains (wheat, oats, rice, etc.), apricots, pineapples, legumes, turnip greens, and pistachio nuts.

*'''d. Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''' Milk, cheese, leafy green vegetables, liver, yeast, almonds and mature soybeans are good sources of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but exposure to light will destroy the riboflavin in these natural sources. 

*'''e. Iron:''' Good sources of dietary iron include meat, fish, poultry, lentils, beans, leaf vegetables, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed pea, strawberries and farina.

*'''f. Calcium:''' Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are a well known source of calcium. However, some individuals are allergic to dairy and even more people, particularly those of non-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume dairy. Fortunately, many other good sources of calcium exist. This includes nuts and seeds (like almonds and sesame), beans; whole wheat; collard greens; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; and fortified products such as orange juice and bread.

==6. Why is it important to drink plenty of water every day? How much water should you drink every day?==
It is important to drink plenty of water so that you do not get dehydrated.  Your body needs water to help eliminate waste and to keep the cells in the body hydrated.

Here are some ways to increase your water intake:

* Drink a glass of water when you first get up in the morning, in the evening when you get home, and again before you go to bed at night.
* Keep a bottle of water beside your desk at work. Drink often throughout the day.
* Drink before, during, and after any physical activity, such as walking, hiking, or biking.
* Carry water with you when you travel. Drink often when flying, as the cabin air is very dry.
* If your water doesn’t taste good, add a lemon or lime slice to improve the flavor. You can filter your water and keep a pitcher in the fridge. Or, buy bottled water if the improved taste helps you drink more.

You should drink water whenever you are thirsty.  A persistent myth is that a person needs to drink 8 eight ounce glasses of water every day.  While following this rule will cause no harm, it is completely unsupported by scientific evidence {{ref|snopes}} {{ref|intelihealth}}.  A person should replace the same amount of water he or she loses in a day.  Water is lost through urination, bowel elimination, sweating, and breathing.  Remember that drinking is not the only way to replace lost water: food contains a lot of water, and your body can absorb water through the skin.  Again, the general rule is to drink water whenever you are thirsty or whenever you want some.

==7. Name three common diseases that can be controlled by diet.==
'''Diabetes:''' The most important forms of diabetes are due to decreased or the complete absence of the production of insulin (type 1 diabetes), or decreased sensitivity of body tissues to insulin (type 2 diabetes, the more common form). The former requires insulin injections for survival; the latter is generally managed with diet, weight reduction and exercise in about 20% of cases, though the majority require these strategies plus oral medication (insulin is used if the tablets are ineffective).

'''Cardiovascular Disease:''' Attempts to prevent cardiovascular disease take the form of modifying risk factors. Some, such as gender, age, and family history, cannot be modified. Smoking cessation (or abstinence) is one of the most effective and easily modifiable changes. Also important is a low-fat, low-calorie diet, which helps one to maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI) and preventing obesity. Regular cardiovascular exercise (aerobic exercise) complements the healthful eating habits. Sometimes, the combination of diet and exercise will improve lipoprotein (cholesterol) levels; if not, a physician may prescribe &quot;cholesterol-lowering&quot; drugs, such as the statins.  Treatment of cardiovascular disease depends on the specific form of the disease in each patient, but effective treatment always includes preventative lifestyle changes discussed above. Medications, such as blood pressure reducing medications, aspirin and other treatments may be involved.

'''Cancer:''' The consensus on diet and cancer is that obesity increases the risk of developing cancer. Particular dietary practices often explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries (e.g. gastric cancer is more common in Japan, while colon cancer is more common in the United States). Studies have shown that immigrants develop the risk of their new country, suggesting a link between diet and cancer rather than a genetic basis.

==8. What is the difference between whole wheat flour and white flour, and which one has the higher nutritive value?==

The two biggest differences between white flour and whole wheat are the processing and the nutritional value. Whole wheat flour has the higher nutritive value.

Flour is made from wheat berries. The wheat berry is made up of the bran, the germ and the endosperm. All parts are filled with nutrients and are used in whole wheat flour. 

White flour on the other hand, uses only the endosperm - the starchy inner layer. There are a total of 30 nutrients present in whole wheat flour that are missing in white flour. The nutritional difference is immense and has measurable impact on our health. 

The fiber content of whole wheat bread has several health benefits. 

Fiber helps the digestive system. It also creates a 'full' 
sensation and thus can help with weight control. Research has 
been conducted by Harvard and other organizations that shows men 
and women who eat high-fiber foods are less likely to have heart attacks and 
strokes as compared to those who don't. 

There is also an increased risk of diabetes in children who eat 
refined white flour - a risk that has been proven by the increase 
in cases of childhood diabetes.

==9. What does RDA stand for? What does it mean?==
'''Recommended Dietary Allowance''' (RDA) is the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient that is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group. The RDAs are established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the (US) National Academy of Sciences.

==10. Why is it important not to take excessive amounts of some vitamins and minerals?==

Fat-soluble vitamins may be stored in the body and can cause toxicity when taken in excess.  Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body, with the exception of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which is stored in the liver.

Some of the most common causes of vitamin poisoning are vitamins A, B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, certain vitamins do not produce toxicity in excess levels: vitamin C has been used in clinical trials in dosages over 100,000 mg — over 1000 times the daily recommended intake — without ill effects.

Excess doses of mineral supplements can also lead to poisoning. Either or both of vitamin poisoning and mineral supplement poisoning can occur due to excessive intake of multivitamin supplements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Data=
Data is information gathered from experimentation. Data can be any type of info that relates to the experiment. Data is usually classified as one of the following types.
==Qualitative==
Qualitative data is data that deals with the qualities of the things obseved. Qualitative data records such things as:
* Color
* Shape
* Texture
* Opacity
* Odor
* Sound

==Quantitative==
Quantitative data is data that records a number that represents a measurement. Quantitative data is usually a number followed by a label that describes which type of measurement it is. Quantitative data includes measurements such as:
* Length
* Mass
* Volume
* Density
* Concentration
* Solubility

=Organizing Data=
Data is most useful in science when it is organized into a reconizable format. Formatting allows very fast reading and easy use in drawing conclusion.

==Tables and Charts==
Tables are graphical ways of representing data.  Data represented in tables can be organized to allow ease of access and to permit faster reading.  For example, if one was testing tab water contamination, you would have columns of various contaminants and rows for the location from which the water was obtained.  Below is an example of a table:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;50&quot;|Object
!width=&quot;90&quot;|Color
!width=&quot;90&quot;|Material
|-
|Bar
|Mettallic
|Iron
|-
|Stick
|Brown
|Wood
|}
As can be seen from the table, it is possible to organize data in such a way as to allow fast reading with minimal work.  Tables are more useful for larger sets of data and this was just an example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 12: Object pronouns, the vocative, more numbers, food, past tenses in first conjugation

=Object pronouns=

We've already seen the personal subject pronouns in lesson 1, and the genitives in lesson 3.
Here are the object forms:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|     με
| me
|     μας
| us
|-
|     σε
| you, singular 
|   σας
| you, plural 
|-
|     τον
| him
|  τους
| them (masculine) 
|-
|     την
| her
|  τους
| them (feminine) 
|-
|     το
| it
|  τα
| them (neuter)
|-
 |}

The object pronouns come before the verb:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Με βλέπουν.
| They see me.
|}

=The vocative=
The vocative case is used when the noun is a person (or, conceivably, a thing) being addressed. The following are some examples of nouns in all four cases.

== Masculine nouns ==

Σκύλος, ''dog,'' is a masculine noun. Note the different forms of the definite article.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο σκύλος
| the dog (subject, singular) 
| οι σκύλοι
| the dogs (subject, plural) 
|-
| του σκύλου
| of the dog (genitive singular) 
| των σκύλων
| of the dogs (genitive plural) 
|-
|-
| το(ν) σκύλο
| the dog (object, singular) 
| τους σκύλους
| the dogs (object, plural) 
|-
|-
| σκύλε!
| dog! (vocative singular) 
| σκύλοι!
| dogs! (vocative plural) 
|-

|}

The ending -ος is the most common one for masculine nouns, and σκύλος demonstrates their regular pattern. Another noun in -oς is άνθρωπος, ''human/man''

Examples:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Ο σκύλος δαγκώνει τον άνθρωπο.
| The dog bites the man.
|-
| Ο άνθρωπος δαγκώνει το σκύλο.
| The man bites the dog.
|}

==Feminine nouns==

The noun Η ώρα (the hour, the time) is shown below:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| η ώρα
| the hour (subject, singular) 
| οι ώρες
| the hours (subject, plural) 
|-
| της ώρας
| of the hour (genitive singular) 
| των ωρών
| of the hours (genitive plural) 
|-
|-
| την ώρα
| the hour (object, singular) 
| τις ώρες
| the hours (object, plural) 
|-
|-
| ώρα!
| hour! (vocative singular) 
| ώρες!
| hours! (vocative plural) 
|-

|}

== Neuter nouns ==

Το παιδί (the child) is an example of a neuter noun.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το παιδί
| the child (subject, singular) 
| τα παιδιά
| the children (subject, plural) 
|-
| του παιδιού
| of the child (genitive singular) 
| των παιδιών
| of the children (genitive plural) 
|-
|-
| το παιδί
| the child (object, singular) 
| τα παιδιά
| the children (object, plural) 
|-
|-
| παιδί!
| child! (vocative singular) 
| παιδιά!
| children! (vocative plural) 
|-
|}

=More numbers=

Multiples of 10:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| είκοσι
| 20
|-
| τριάντα
| 30
|-
| σαράντα
| 40
|-
| πενήντα
| 50
|-
| εξήντα
| 60
|-
| εβδομήντα
| 70
|-
| ογδόντα
| 80
|-
| ενενήντα
| 90
|-
| εκατό
| 100
|}

Most numbers from 1 to 100 are formed by giving a multiple of 10 following by the second digit of the number. (The numbers from 13 to 19 are written as single words, and the ones above 20 as two words.) 

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| δεκατρία
| 13
|-
| εξήντα οκτώ
| 68
|-
|}

The numbers 11 and 12 are exceptions:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| έντεκα (or ένδεκα)
| 11
|-
| δώδεκα
| 12
|}

=Past tenses=
==Imperfect tense in first conjugation==
The imperfect tense is used to describe an action in the past that was continuous or repeated. For verbs in the first conjugation, it is formed from the progressive stem by moving the accent to the third syllable from the end, and adding endings that differ from those used in the present. The following example illustrates this with the verb διαβάζω:

Present:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| διαβάζω
| διαβάζουμε
|-
| διαβάζεις
| διαβάζετε
|-
| διαβάζει
| διαβάζουν
|}

Imperfect:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| διάβαζα
| διαβάζαμε
|-
| διάβαζες
| διαβάζατε
|-
| διάβαζε
| διάβαζαν
|}

Example:
{|  align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Η γιαγιά μου διάβαζε.
| My grandmother used to read.
|}

If the stem of the verb is too short to allow an accent on the third syllable from the end, the prefix ε- is added:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| έγραφα
| γράφαμε
|-
| έγραφες
| γράφατε
|-
| έγραφε
| έγραφαν
|}

==Past tense in first conjugation==
The past tense is used to indicate an action that occurred at one time in the past, or that has been completed. It is formed in the same was as the imperfect, but from the aorist stem.

Past:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| διάβασα
| διαβάσαμε
|-
| διάβασες
| διαβάσατε
|-
| διάβασε
| διάβασαν
|}

Example:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Χτες, διάβασε την εφημερίδα.
| Yesterday, he read the newspaper.
|}

==Past tenses of είμαι and έχω==
The verbs είμαι and έχω have only a single past tense, rather than separate imperfect and past tenses.


[[Image:Achilles by Lycomedes Louvre Ma2120.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ο Αχιλλέας]]

Past tense of είμαι:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ήμουν
| ήμαστε
|-
| ήσουν
| ήσαστε
|-
| ήταν
| ήταν
|}

Past tense of έχω:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| είχα
| είχαμε
|-
| είχες
| έιχατε
|-
| είχε
| είχαν
|}

Example:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Ο Αχιλλέας ήταν γιός του Πηλέα, βασιλιά των Μυρμιδόνων, και της Νηρηίδας Θέτιδας.{{ref|achilles}}
| Achilles was the son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons, and the nymph Thetis.
|}

==Formation of the aorist stem in the first conjugation==
We have already seen that aorist stems are often formed by adding an &quot;s&quot; sound. The following list shows more of the common patterns:

Since το χρώμα (the color) is a neuter noun, we use the neuter gender to refer to itself, although we use the masculine or feminine gender to refer to it as a characteristic of a masculine or feminine noun:

| το μαύρο χρώμα
|-
| ο μαύρος σκύλος
|-
| η μαύρη γάτα
|-
| τα μαύρα μάτια

Foreign words like μπλέ do not change to show case or number:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το μπλε κασκόλ (french: cache-col)
|the blue scarf

== I love the name ==

I should have dropped a line to you earlier.  This is a cool user name, and throws convention and common preconceptions about new users to the wind.  I love to see some fresh blood come in here and stir the pot up, so to say, and it will make for some interesting discussions.

BTW, Welcome to Wikibooks.  I hope you have better success in the future than what apparently your book [[How To Ride The Bus]].  When you copied the content over to the new title, I ended up turning the old title into a redirect.  This is nothing personal against you, but simply a way to inform everybody where the content ended up at.  I tried to preserve all of the changes that you made after the page move.  Moving pages to avoid deletion is generally frowned upon and is more likely to increase the potential of getting deleted.

I should have removed the VfD right after it started.  I've done that two a couple other books, but I've also had quite a bit of flack from other Wikibooks regulars because of that.  Apprarently Derbeth doesn't believe in waiting to see a Wikibook get started to see just where it might go.  He has done a lot of good for Wikibooks, however, so don't consider him to be the spawn of the Devil.  And his is just one opinion out of many as well anyway, and no permanent damage has been done to your book (yet).

It is too bad that you want to assert non-GFDL copyright status on the book.  While from a strictly legal standpoint I don't think you can do that, if you don't want the content on Wikibooks I can understand, particularly given the hostile reaction to the book.  There is no reason to keep the content here if you don't want it on Wikibooks.  It is an interesting reaction to the community BTW, and one that I support as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:25, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:My meandering thoughts: Thank You Mr. Rob. The alias started out with me wondering, perhaps I could register my static IP address as a user; I tried [[user:72.57.8.215X]] but didn't like the X. You hit did however hit the spot. I tend, as you may have observed from the title of my first article, to rock the boat a little and add controversial material. I am an artist after all. Anyway I took 72.57.8.2I5 because so I could remember my close link and try to get credit for my previous edits as IP:72.57.8.215  To be perfectly honest, I like the idea of wikibooks. I wish however that it would be all fun and fun! Where people could come along and say... hmm.. I don't really know what I can add to that but that's interesting. Maybe I should look into it. Instead of saying... I don't really know what I can add into that. Let's delete it! I also didn't want to remove the VfD from fear that wikibookians would be mad. But I couldn't really stand waiting letting this issue go on. I have so many idea for building the book. When I'm on wikibooks, it just seems so much easier write an article then if I did it in my word editor. It seems easier to make references, footnotes, etc... I actually want the book to be out there. But you know what. Once it's out there I'm probably going to bang myself on the head and say &quot;I should have just wrote it in word.&quot; I keep it in the dark files, encrypted, as one of those never to publish idea from fear of being put into jail, labeled crazy, and having people shoot the messenger. Well, I think I should have expected some sort of protest. But I didn't expect this big of a pot stir. Perhaps this is an issue that we should discuss at the deletion policy page. Interesting enough, I'm sure there will be more similar nominations. I have a lot more documentation and scribbles here at home of the original book concept. I also wonder about the GFDL licence?  If I could claim that? No matter the case. I have plenty of ideas. The problem with this one article is that I've taken it personal. This policy stuff, well until your pep talk, Isn't really motivating. As soon as you add rules you restrict creativity. The Art of writing! At the moment, to contribute anymore to this book as I would do on my regular word editor. 

b.t.w.: I would have thought that after changing the name we would have a better leg to stand on!! But... well anyway! This is such a mess, with red-tap, I feel like I'm in an episode of watching the [[w:OJ Simpson]] trial. I just hope this case is fairly judged.  

p.s: I'm at the point where I'm obviously becoming indifferent if the article is deleted or not. But rest assure, the world is watching... I will remember.. And for some reason I'm feeling a little bitter now. The reason being that this nomination is still there and that I'm evaluating my self existence right now and the meaning of wikibooks within this thing of mine called life! Thank you for the kind words. And I'm sure Derbeth did not intend to do this entire process as an evil act. But that fact that no is doing anything about it doesn't seems send happy feelings into my consciousness. We'll just have to see what happens and if I start fixing up the article again or not. Thank you again for listening. Perhaps it would be wise to further this dicussion into some sort of proposed rule? (as I've noticed you've done already with some issues, elaborated into a nice article in a sub-page within your user page) ;) --[[User:72.57.8.2I5|72.57.8.2I5]] 00:58, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:As an addeed thought... I hope you continue to stay active.  I am trying to encourage new users on Wikibooks, particuarly those who have come here just because they like the idea of Wikibooks and havn't necessarily started out on Wikipedia.  Discussion like this have happened before, and I even had a Wikibook that was slapped with a VfD only 18 hours after I started the content.  This killed the early momentum in getting it going, and squashed even my own contributions to instead have to deal with the stupid VfD (that was rejected by the community on top of the whole thing).  I've become somewhat of a Wikimedia lawyer, as long as a court of opinion can be maintained and not changed through executive decrees.  See the Wikimania discussion for what IMHO is an abuse of power by those &quot;in charge&quot; at the Wikimedia Foundation.  My attitude is to give as much support to the new users, and have mild contempt for the veterans... especially if they are throwing their weight around.  To be a Wikimedia veteran you need to have a fairly thick skin anyway, so a litle heated verbage usually goes off each other's backs.

:Again... '''Welcome to Wikibooks'''.  This is going to be a very significant and influential project that will be as significant as Wikipedia, IMHO.  It just needs some passionate people to help get it going.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

I don't think your rewording will be enough. It's still too similar to the original work and will probably be just as much a copyvio as it is now. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 02:32, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

Thank you for your honest reply. I trust your judgement. It would however be nice to have a second opinion. Hence... My reply can also be found on the delete discusion...

I guess you read through my first 4 translations?  You obviously have a copy of the original work somewhere. Is this a book that looks like this,ie. similar format? If we reword it shouldn't it be okay?  The only trouble I see is if the entire article is base on one source... I'm guessing that's what you mean right. We would need more sources to diversify and less chances of a general format copyvio? --[[User:72.57.8.2I5|72.57.8.2I5]] 02:43, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">JavaBeansIntrospector? http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html

    The Introspector class provides a standard way for tools to learn about 
    the properties, events, and methods supported by a target Java Bean.

    For each of those three kinds of information, the Introspector will separately
    analyze the bean's class and superclasses looking for either explicit or 
    implicit information and use that information to build a BeanInfo object 
    that comprehensively describes the target bean.

    For each class &quot;Foo&quot;, explicit information may be available if 
    there exists a corresponding &quot;FooBeanInfo&quot; class that provides 
    a non-null value when queried for the information. We first look 
    for the BeanInfo class by taking the full package-qualified name 
    of the target bean class and appending &quot;BeanInfo&quot; to form a new 
    class name. If this fails, then we take the final classname 
    component of this name, and look for that class in each of 
    the packages specified in the BeanInfo package search path.

    Thus for a class such as &quot;sun.xyz.OurButton&quot; we would first look for 
    a BeanInfo class called &quot;sun.xyz.OurButtonBeanInfo&quot; and if that failed 
    we'd look in each package in the BeanInfo search path for an 
    OurButtonBeanInfo class. With the default search path, 
    this would mean looking for &quot;sun.beans.infos.OurButtonBeanInfo&quot;.

    If a class provides explicit BeanInfo about itself then 
    we add that to the BeanInfo information we obtained from
    analyzing any derived classes, but we regard the explicit
    information as being definitive for the current class and
    its base classes, and do not proceed any further up the 
    superclass chain.

    If we don't find explicit BeanInfo on a class, 
    we use low-level reflection to study the methods of the class 
    and apply standard design patterns to identify 
    property accessors, event sources, or public methods. 
    We then proceed to analyze the class's superclass 
    and add in the information from it 
    (and possibly on up the superclass chain).

    For more information about introspection and design patterns, 
    please consult the JavaBeans specification.

-- Objects --

Everything in SilverScheme is an object. An object consists of two parts: a code
section and an field list. The code section may contain a lambda expression.
The field list is basically a hash with unique keys, the values refer to
other objects.

-- Scope --

Scope is complicated. SilverScheme, like any modern LISP has lexical scope (block
scope). To understand scope in SilverScheme a little knowledge of the syntax is
required.

Every definition is basically a (define), lambda list is (name value . forms).
The forms are evaluated in the scope of the (newly created) object. For example
(define a 10 (define b 20)) will create a new object a with value 10 and with an
attribute b with value 20. Thus a.b = 20 .

When you say (define a.b 30) you define in the current scope a new binding for
symbol b as field of object a. An example demonstrates some things:
(define a 10
 (define b 20))
(define-ref c a) ;c is an alias for a
(define d a) ;d is a copy of a
(define a.b 30)
a.b = 30
c.b = 30
d.b = 20

Thus (define a.b value) doesn't set a.b, but it sets the binding of symbol b to
object a.

Wow, I've finally managed to get scope working decently :-).

For your understanding here are a few simple facts:
* An object is in a box, a memory location.
* A field points to a box.
* The object id is actually the box id.
* The set! function changes the object in a box.
* The define function makes a field point to a different box.

-- Pass-by-reference, pass-by-value --

The general rule of SilverScheme is that function arguments are passed by
reference. However two basic functions are an exception on this. Arguments to
(define) are passed by value, (define-ref) is the normal reference one, thus
(define) can be seens as (define-ref), but with arg.copy done for each argument.

The let construct also needs pass-by-value to keep consistent with define (and
to avoid easily maked hard to find bugs). To indicate reference one must put
:ref before the clause. For example:
(let ((a 10) ;a is by-value
      :ref (b 20)) ;b is by-ref
      __some_code__)

Granted, assigning by reference to a literal is stupid (literals are constant),
but this demonstrates the principle.

Copies in SilverScheme (pass-by-value creates copies) use copy-on-write. I guess
you already know how copy-on-write works.

-- Metadata --

SilverScheme is designed around the concept that: a) code should be free, in all
it's forms and b) that if you don't do that somebody else will ;-). All
information about an object is accessible through it's metadata interface. The
metadata interface consists of roughly two parts: documentation contributed by
the user and information gathered by the interpreter.

The meta field is also where all attributes are stored. An attribute in
SilverScheme is simply an object. The user can thus easily define attributes.

There are thus roughly three types of objects of metadata: the documentation,
the reflection info and custom attributes. The documentation is placed into the
obj.documentation field in hash form. Both reflection and custom attributes go
into obj.meta in normal object form.

SilverScheme supports documentation through the Argentum [1]
scheme. Argentum is the POD of SilverScheme. Documentation can be put in
doc comments of the form ;...\n and #!! ... !# (multi-line). Doc
comments use a syntax similar to YAML.

Attributes can be easily created using (define meta.attrname value).

-- Classes --

SilverScheme has a weird way of implementing classes. The instance of a class is
defined as a field of that class named 'prototype'. The constructor then does
(create-instance), (create-instance) adds the needed class information to a copy
of the prototype.

Note that classes can access private members of their prototypes and vice versa.

To access the class of an object you can use the obj.class field (or the
obj.meta.class field).

An example of a simple class:
(define-class Foo (Object Bar) ;;Foo inherits from Object
                               ;;and promises to implement
                               ;;the public interface of Bar
  (define-prototype ;;(define prototype) doesn't work!
    (define baz 10)))

-- Inheritance --

SilverScheme does not support multiple inheritance. Instead it has interface
inheritance and mixins (later more about that). Every class after the first is
interface inherited. Interface inheritance means that a class only inherits from
the parent in name, not in code (aka no code is copied).

Note that it's not possible to inherit from a non-class. This is to keep the
class mechanism simple.

-- Mixins --

SilverScheme uses mixins to do what other languages do with multiple inheritance. A
mixin is an object that has fields marked with the (mixin) attribute. The object
can also be marked with the (full-mixin) attribute, essentially giving all it's
fields the mixin attributes.

When an object has the (use-mixin __mixin_name__) attribute it copies the source
code of the mixin fields in the mixin and evaluates them in the current scope.
Kinda like how Ruby does it. This is used for example to give objects the &lt;, &lt;=,
=, etc functions for free if they have the &lt;=&gt; function and say (use-mixin
Comparable).

-- Domains --

SilverScheme provides some powerful tools to make programming without bugs easier.
The most important one is domains. A domain is a function that takes one
argument, and checks if that argument is in the domain. If so nothing happens,
if not an Domain-Violation-Error is thrown. Domains have three main uses:
checking variables, enforcing preconditions, enforcing postconditions.

To check a variable against a domain one simply uses the (domain) self-applying
attribute (most attributes are self-applying btw). For example:
(define a 5 ;domain: 0 &lt; a &lt; 5
  (domain (\ (value) (and (&gt; value 0)
                          (&lt; value 11)))))

The domain function accepts a few keywords after the lambda expression:
:read -- Check the domain whenever the variable contents are read.
:write -- Check the domain whenever the variable contents are written.

The keywords may be used both.

By default only :write is on. The domain-default-operation environment variable
is used to set the default to a different value.

To check a preconditions replace the argument name with (argument-name domain):
(\ ((a (\ (value) ;domain: a &gt; 0
        (&gt; a 0))))
    ...)

The domain may be in a variable (useful for often used domains).

Another way to do preconditions is to use the (pre-condition __arg_name__
__domain__) attribute. The advantage of the attribute is that you can use it
conditionally (for example in a testing situation, but not in production use)

To check a postcondition use the (post-condition) attribute. For example:
(define simple-add
 (\ (a b)
  (+ a b))
 (post-domain (\ (value) (&gt; value 0))))

The Argentum documentation extractor (agdoc) also extracts domains, so using
them is a good way to show what the pre- and postconditions are.

-- owner, parent, super --

In a.b object defined as (define a 10 (define b 20)) a owns object b since b was
defined by object a. Object b has full access to the private members of object
a. For object b object a is known by as 'owner'. The variable 'owner' always
points to the owner of an object.

The parent of an object is the prototype of the superclass.

The super variable refers to parent.__name_of_this_function__ .

-- call/cc, call/tf, call/rf --

SilverScheme call/cc (call-with-current-continuation) is pretty much like the
standard Scheme call/cc. However it has some more argument passing power. When
you do (call/cc (\ (b) (b 10 20))) then the resulting continuation has a field
values which contains a list of the values passed to it. When you invoke the
continuation with the arguments the arguments are given as the result of the
break function, always as a list.

The call/tf (call-with-throw-function) function is like the Guile catch
function. It takes one argument, a lambda list with one parameter, the throw
function. When the throw function is invoked a non-local exit is done to the
call/tf, like with call/cc, however there is no return. The arguments passed to
the throw function are returned by (call/tf) as a list in the second element of
a list (the first element if #t if no non-local exit occurred and #f otherwise).

The call/rf function is similar. However it doesn't signal success or failure
and returns the list directly (not as a sublist).

-- Exceptions --

Exceptions are build upon call/tf and work roughly like this:

(try
 (begin
  __code_to_be_tried__)
 (catch
  (__exception_class__
   __code_to_be_executed_on_that_exception__)
  (__exception_class__
   __code_to_be_executed_on_that_exception__)
  ...)
 (finally
  __code_that_should_always_be_executed))

Pretty simple isn't it? The (throw) function is rigged to go to the nearest
exception handler at all times. It's not quite schemisch, but it looks pretty
good :-).

-- conditional evaluation of parameters --

Normally parameters are evaluated left to right. SilverScheme has an easy way to
create an exception on that however. For example:
(\ (`a b `(c (\ (val) (&gt; val 10)))
  (if (b)
   a
   c))

Right, stupid example, but it demonstrates my point. If you put a backquote
before the argument in the lambda list the argument will not be evaluated until
needed.

-- macros --

A macro is a function that returns a list that is evaluated in the scope of the
caller. A macro is also an ideal way to get a virus in a SilverScheme system. A
macro is made by simply creating a function and then attaching the (macro)
attribute to it.

Macros can be dangerous, they can be helpful too however. It depends on the
situation what they are. That's why I'm introducing set-macro-safe. The
set-macro-safe function takes one argument which is either a number or a symbol
and sets the macro-safe level to that argument. The possible arguments are:
0 'allow-all -- Allow normal macro behaviour for all macros.
1 'explicit-deny -- Allow normal macro behaviour for all macro's except when
explicitly told not to do that.
2 'allow-base -- Allow normal macro behaviour for all macro's in the Base
hierarchy (the baselib). Disallow normal macro behaviour for all other macros
unless explicitly told otherwise.
3 'explicit-allow -- The same as 'allow-base, except that the Base macro's
aren't automatically allowed anymore.
4 'deny-all -- Deny all macro's.

Some primitive macro's are allowed regardless of what the macro-safe level says.

Macro's that can't be called with normal macro behaviour can still be called,
but they only take a single argument (a list) and produce a list that must be
explicitly evaluated (using '(eval list)').

The standard macro level is 0. Note that that's not a safe level for any
production code.

At the first deny command the macro level automatically gets set to 1, if it's
not already at that or a lower level. Thus level 0 can be regarded as level 1,
however it's faster since the macro deny checks are off.

-- Dynamic binding and environment variables --

Sometimes it's handy to pass arguments to functions without putting them in the
argument list but by defining a variable and having the function read that
variable. In the case (begin (define a 10) (foo)) foo can't read a, and it
shouldn't. For environment variables like macro-safe it's another situation
however. That's why I'm introducing environment variables.

Environment variables are dynamically bound. They can't leave the scope in which
they are defined however (like any other variable). To define an environment
variable you need a special function (define-environment-variable) aka (defenv).
This function simply behaves like a normal define, except that the variable is
automatically set read-only (you can override, but normally it's what you want).
The variable can then be accessed using env.variable-name, note that 'env' is a
special variable.

Almost all the special variables can be accessed using env too (env.super,
env.owner, etc), they only have names without env in them because they are used
so much that it's reasonable to shorten them. The macro-safe variable is however
only accessible with env.macro-safe (it's a read-write variable btw).

A word of warning is due here, don't define environment variables unless you
really need them, it's bad style to depend on them for stuff you should pass in
a parameter list.

-- compilation --

SilverScheme is like any Scheme compilable. However SilverScheme has multiple
compiling modes.

The standard mode is keep-all, which basically creates a resource section in the
executable and puts the literal code files in it. The keep-all mode has the
advantage that the result (obj.source) will have the same markup and comments as
the original. Since the data is put in resource files the actual code can be
executed pretty fast. Needless to say this actually increases file size.

A second mode is keep-source, this mode only keeps the actual source code, not
comments. It helps keep the file size down.

A third mode is keep-minimum, removing all the comments and sources except those
referred to in the program. Good for really small files, bad for readability.
Note that since documentation is put into the objects it can't be removed by
this mode.

The fourth and most drastic mode is keep-minimum-remove-docs, this mode also
kicks out the documentation. Only useful if you really really want a small program.

An implementation may compress resource files with tar and gzip at any
compression level. I recommend not or very weakly compressing the actual sources
but strongly compressing the documentation.

The extension of a SilverScheme source file is .dgs, the extension of a SilverScheme
compiled file is .dgsb (SilverScheme Bytecode).

Note that the SilverScheme bytecode is not IL, Parrot or machinecode though
compiling to these is allowed as an optional feature. The SilverScheme bytecode is
a special bytecode designed for SilverScheme (probably looking like other LISP
bytecodes).

-- Permissions --

The permission system is aimed at providing flexible authorization for certain
objects to do certain things. Permissions are given with tokens. Access tokens
give an object A the power to get/set/invoke object B even if this is forbidden
by the access system (access system: public SUBSET-OF {'read 'write 'invoke},
private SUBSET-OF {'read 'write 'invoke}). Here's an example of access tokens:

(define a 10
  (read-only) ;;(public 'read 'invoke) (private 'read 'write 'invoke)
  (define giver
    (\ ()
      (a.give-token-to-caller 'a.write))
    (a.give-bag-access)))

In this example 'a is first declared read-only (that's the default actually),
then a function a.giver is declared and made read-only implicitly. The giver
function is given bag-access by 'a. Any object can give bag access during it's
definition or at any time through it's code. The giver function now gives write
permission for a to any object that calls it. There is no caller object by the way
since I consider it a bad idea if code can manipulate things up the stack except
in such special cases.

There is a second kind of tokens called custom tokens. Basically a custom token
is a token that doesn't have an implicit action associated with it. An example
of a custom token system:

(define nice 0
  (define set ;accessor
    (\ (value)
      (if (&lt; value 0)
        (if (caller-has-token? 'system.root-access)
          (set! nice value)
          (throw (Invalid-Rights-Exception &quot;You don't have root permissions&quot;))
        (set! nice value))))

Without the root-access token you can't use it.

To be honest, custom tokens don't feel right yet. I'd rather leave them out of
the language for now, letting them mature first, I included them only for
completeness sake.

-- Static --

The fields of an object can be divided into two parts: static and non-static.
Static fields are conceptually bound to the storage box of the object and stick
around when set! is used. However static and non-static fields are in the same
namespace, so if a non-static field is in the new value during set! it will
override the old value. Here's an example:

(define a 10
 (define set
  (\ ((value (\ (val) (&gt; val 10))))
   (set! owner value))
  (static)))
(set! a 20) ;set! obj -&gt; obj.set
(a.set.source) =&gt; (\ ((value (\ (val) (&gt; val 10)))) (set! owner value))

-- Overload and override --

When defining a subclass and overloading a field one often easily uses define.
This is a bad idea however since define creates a whole new field that doesn't
share any of the attributes and stuff like that with the old field. Instead
SilverScheme has a method called (overload) which is used like this:
(define-class Foo ()
  (define bar
    (\ () __some_code__)
    (private)))

(define-class Fred (Foo)
  (overload bar
    ((\ () __some_other_code__))))

And voila, bar is copied. Here's a template for overload: (overload __name__
(__new_value__) __attributes__). If the new value part is empty the value isn't
changed (that's why I have it between parenthesises).

The (define) function will do an override. In some cases it might be helpful to
warn or throw an error when define is used. In such cases the (override)
function (which is simply define with another name) is useful.

The override error checking can be turned on and off using the environment
variable check-override-errors.

-- Temporary environment variables --

It's possible to create temporary environment variables that only exist in a
certain scope. One can use the (let-environment-variable) function for this, it
takes the same kinds of arguments as let, but puts them under env. The advantage
over a set..body..unset construction is that let-environment-variable
automatically unsets on error.

-- Primitives --

SilverScheme's version of intercalls are called primitives. Primitives are always
functions (RPC functions to be exact), but they are not objects. Primitives can
only be called from Base (baselib). Any attempt to do weird things with
primitives may be punished with unexpected behaviour (rationale: it's internal
stuff, only a few core hackers will touch it and they will know what to do).
There is one primitive handler which is defined as (call-primitive name . args)
and is private in the top level of the Base module. The primitive handler can
take and return complex objects, however mostly it will operate on simple things.

The advantage of a single primitive handler over for example a primitive
attribute is that there is just one entry point that's easily documented. After
all the accepted function names will probably be visible in a switch statement.

-- Relative modification --

The basic idea behind serialization in SilverScheme is 'relative modification'.
Instead of saying &quot;send this object&quot; the serialization mechanism says &quot;I've got
an object with this identity, do you need it&quot;. Obviously you don't need the same
object twice, so the amount of data send over the network is decreased.

Another possibility with the serialization mechanism is sending in patches to
serialized libraries. This has a huge advantage, namely that you only need to
send the actual changes, instead of the textual changes (diff sometimes sends
over half the file for one line changed, SilverScheme would never do that).

The trick in serialization is the basic SilverScheme object itself. This is how
an object looks like:

    object                     field
+------------+              +-----------+
|  identity  |        +---&gt; |  subject  |
+------------+        |     +-----------+
|  prototype |        |     |  name     |
+------------+        |     +---------+-+
|  changed   |        |     |  object |C|
+----------+-+        |     +---------+-+
|  ivalue  |C|        |

The C subfields are change flags.

The identity of an object is to the outside world an uri like
'http://myproject/1003', internally it's a number. The identity of an object is
unique, no two different objects with the same identity can exist at any time.

The prototype of an object is the object that this object is a copy of. Often
this is the prototype of the class of the object, in case the object is copied
using for example define it's the original (the second arg to define). Objects
can have prototypes that are not in the current session (like a prototype from
the web).

The changed flag of an object is set on whenever the object is no longer a
perfect copy of the prototype. The changed flag is a kind of warning flag, it
doesn't tell what has changed only that something has changed.

The ivalue is the internal value of an object. It's were for example the value
of a String object is stored in the native representation of the string (or more
likely a pointer to the native representation of the string). It has a changed
flag to signal when the internal value has changed.

The code property is the code section of an object. It has a changed flag to
signal when the code has changed.

For each field in the scope there is a name, a subject reference and an object 
reference with a changed flag. If the field is bound to a new object (with a 
different identity) the change flag goes on.

To send over an object one first needs to ask the other party if he has the
prototype. If not the whole object is send over. If he has the prototype one
must look at the object's change flag, if it's off one can suffice with saying
&quot;it's a perfect copy of the prototype&quot;, otherwise one has to look up which
change flags are on and send over the information in those properties.

-- The library system --

SilverScheme has two types of libraries: source libraries and static
state libraries (I'll call them state libraries from now on). A source
library is simply a bunch of SilverScheme source files. A state
library is a serialized library. Typically a state library is a
relative serialization patch against it's dependencies (to keep lib
size down) and some extra files (like pictures, should it be needed).

State libraries are usually published on the WWW with an URI like
this: 'http://domain/prefix/name/build/', for example
'http://somedomain/home/peter/myproject/12/'. The prefix is just the
path to the project directory. The build is a number that increases
when you create a new build of the state files, it runs independent of
the version number and is the primary means of identifying a version
of the library. Additionally there may be something like
'http://somedomain/home/peter/myproject/0.0.1/' where the version
number is just an alias for a certain build number.

-- Introspection --

Static state files in SilverScheme are similar to the output of the
introspector, indeed they are the output of the build-in SilverScheme
introspector. Thus they contain all information about a program (at
the time of serialization), except the stack and some other
information needed for running (non-static state files contain these,
but that stuff is out of scope here (I'm not even sure if there will
ever be non-static state files)). Thus the (static) state files
contain all the information needed for analyzation of the library.
I'll create an ontology for the state files similar to the
introspector ontology for the introspected IL files so that the state
files will be processable with the introspector toolchain, given a few
small adaptions to cope with the language differences. Unfortunately I
can't use the introspector ontology due to the differences between
SilverScheme and IL.

-- The SilverScheme Repository --

This is really wishful dreaming, but a nice dream :-). The
SilverScheme Repository will be something like CPAN, but more extended
toward introspection.  It will keep libraries as both compressed
source and as state files, it will keep programs (executable programs)
as compressed source (you can't really serialize those to static state
files since there is no natural idle point where the program is loaded
but not executing). Due to an intelligent toolchain coupled to a
webservice and web interface it's possible to see the structure of
libraries, the documentation of libraries, etc, generated on demand
out of the state files.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a short example based tutorial of Knowledge Interchange Format. It's not complete nor very correct, but it should give you an idea about what you can do with KIF.

The knowledge base I'm using here is a simple representation of human relations. Basically two types of relation exist: family and friends. There are three kinds of family: father, mother, child. There is only one kind of friend. For our purposes partners are also friends. Let's start by entering some data:

    (male Fred)
    (male John)
    (female Martha)
    (female Joan)
    (female Betty)
    (female Alice)

Fred and John are males, Martha, Joan, Betty and Alice are females.

    (father Fred John)

John is the father of Fred

    (mother Fred Martha)

Martha is the mother of Fred

    (father Pete Fred)

Fred is the father of Pete

    (mother Pete Joan)

Joan is the mother of Pete

    (friend Pete Betty)

Betty is a friend of Pete

    (mother Alice Martha)

Martha is the mother of Alice

    (mother Betty Alice)

Alice is the mother of Betty


Now it's nice if we could get some information from these relations. For example _we_ know Fred is the child of Pete, but the computer doesn't. Let's tell him that.

    (defrelation child (?p ?c) :=
      (or (mother ?c ?p) (father ?c ?p)))

Know we say that somebody, called ?c for now, is a child of somebody, called ?p for now, if ?p is the mother of ?c or if ?p is the father of ?c.

Let's define some other relations:

    (defrelation son (?p ?c) :=
      (and (male ?c) (child ?p ?c)))
    
    (defrelation daughter (?p ?c) :=
      (and (female ?c) (child ?p ?c)))

A son is a male child. A daughter is a female child.

Now to querying, getting information from the knowledge base. Here are a few queries with their result behind the =&gt;.

    (male Fred) =&gt; true
    (female John) =&gt; false

That were simple queries that only return true or false. Note that your implementation may display the results in a different way (since I'm not using an interpreter at all (except my brains) while writing this it's kinda logical actually).

    (male ?x) =&gt; ?x = Fred, ?x = John

Here we ask the system: for each object (known as ?x for now) in the universe of discourse the set which contains every object that exists) that is a male ((male ?x) =&gt; true) tell me what the value of ?w is. 

Next example, querying with two variables:

    (daughter (?x ?y)) =&gt; (?x = Alice, ?y = Martha), (?x = Betty, ?y = Alice)

As you can see using two variables also yields the correct result.

Now let's select in queries. Say we want the sister of Fred.

    (and (daughter (?x ?y)) (son (?x Fred))) =&gt; (?x = Martha, ?y = Alice)

As you can imagine we can program relations out of this:

    (defrelation sister (?s ?o) :=
      (and (daughter ?x ?y) (child ?y ?o)))

Now to 'bottom'. Sometimes you want to say: this can be anything, but I don't care what it is. KIF supports this through bottom. If you write bottom you're saying: this can be anything, but you will not be informed of what it is. For example:
    
    (son bottom ?x) =&gt; ?x = Fred, ?x = Pete

In this query we asked for all sons, but not about their parents.


More to follow, when I update this wiki :-).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are all statements that are under one line

== Interfaces ==
Introspector interfaces are Import and export routines that allow RDF statements to be extracted from InternalDataStructures? of programs.

We will build interfaces to the following projects for data extraction

[CLanG C]
[CPlusPlus C++], ObjectiveC and JavaLang support from the GccProject
http://gcc.gnu.org/

[CsharpLang C#], [MicrosoftIntermediateLang MSIL] and other language support via the DotGnuProject
http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/

GnuMake

PerlInternals

ParrotMetaData

M4Language

AutoMake

AutoConf

BashDb


=== PerlDesignPatterns ===

http://search.cpan.org/src/SWALTERS/Object-PerlDesignPatterns-0.03/PerlDesignPatterns.html#SingletonPattern

=== Glade ===
Glade is just one of the many forms that can be imported into Luxor http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/

== DataRepository ==
The data repository will be a distributed RDFServer that stored and indexes the RDFFiles.

The Representation of the knowledge extracted by the introspector is simple :
It is a list of identifiers, labels, ids.
Things that have a semantic assigned to them, or that may be assigned to semantics.
These things are nodes, items, blocks. Basically they are the foundation of knowledge.
http://www.burningchrome.com/archives/unrev-ii/msg01818.html 

== Declaration management ==
the user should be able to declare new identifiers, replace them, and import and export them from the system 

We need ways for users to declare new data structures. The data declarations of the introspector provide a common naming system for all related tools

== DataExtraction ==
we need new tools to extract RDF metdata out of various other systems.
We support many different file formats for the introspector.
more to come here, TODO : add a table of file formats 
We need to be able to dump out tabular text files of various names and types in the system. Depends on the QuerySystem?
Doxygen like HTML output is important.
We will support various XML format inputs and outputs. The main focus is moving towards RDF, because of the power of the rdf notation. But Using RDF to annotate XML trees make sense for representing the object structure.

=== NTriples ===
NTriples are even simpler than n3. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/

=== N3 ===
n3 is a simple rdf alternative notation
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html
See also http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html 

== Used Projects ==
I would like to use the BootLib? http://www.boost.org/

=== BASHDB ===
The introspector needs to be acessable from the bash command line.

=== EMACS ===
The emacs interface promises many integration tools

== RDF == 
Rdf is a data format that is best described here http://www.w3.org/RDF/
What is Rdf? http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/24/rdf.html
Many people ask, why do you use Rdf instead of Xml.

 * Rdf is appropiate for the introspector because of its simple syntax. 

 * The nodes of the compiler are naturally graphs.

 * Rdf allows for information about resources to be added in when it is needed.

 * MetaData is naturally stored in RDF.

 * Rdf allows for the Ontology and Structure of the data to be added in after the fact.


=== Redland ===
I use Redland http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/ 
Redland is a RDF application framework with many SwigLanguageBindings?.
http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/
We use redland to interface with C modules. 

I use Perl http://www.useperl.com/
I use EulerSharp? http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/ 

== Ontology ==

I have posted the first version of the introspector ontology here
http://introspector.sourceforge.net/2003/08/16/introspector.n3
please review

== Used On Projects ==

On this node, you can find examples of introspected projects :

=== Parrot ===
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/14717?show_headers=1

=== M4 ===
http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/m4-discuss/2003-01/msg00001.html

== Vizualization ==
The visualization tools will be Built upon the following ToolChain :

   * Data Extraction of statements from the subject

   * Data filtering of only relevant information from the program

   * Breaking down the data set into pages and subgraphs

   * Conversion of the statements to nodes and arcs

   * emitting of the graph to the graph layout language 
   
   * invoking of the layout engine

   * importing the results of the layout

   * creation of a planar graph

   * drawing of that graph

   * allowing the editing of the graph by the user

   * exporting of the graph to other systems.

   * saving of the graph data as a resource in the introspector


== OUTPUT ==

=== Code Generators ===
It should be easy for a user to create new code generators

=== Graph layout ===
Graph Layout Tools
vcg graphvis tulip
xvpodb and more 

=== Dia Interface ===
Petal2Dia : see this http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2002-November/msg00111.html
AutoDia is a great module from Arron
http://droogs.org/autodia/

      <text xml:space="preserve">The new RDF::Laces module for Perl is designed to allow the statement of RDF triples in Perl using natural perl expressions. For example, here are the first 2 resources from the Dublin Core, in Perl:

 ;

The module currently prints out the ntriples for every statement made. More info will be forthcoming, as I'm planning to put it on CPAN.

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; you mentioned a version &quot;1.0&quot; which I misinterpretated as a typo, but
&gt; we discoverd a very old 1.0 package. As far as I can see it contains
&gt; not obfuscated source code and a GPL license, i.e. it is a proper GPL
&gt; release. As the version number indicates it has more bugs and fewer
&gt; features than the obfuscated version 1.3.
&gt;
&gt; Hence you can use the not obfuscated version 1.0 and the obfuscated
&gt; version 1.3 as base for a GPL project. I can also send you a copy of
&gt; the package if you do not have it already.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The introspector GUI will ideally be a c# windows application.

 == Abstract GUI Client ==

The [&quot;Abstract GUI Client&quot;] is a proposed API that will isolate you, the user
from a particular GUI toolkit. 


It is based on the [&quot;MVC Concept&quot;] which splits things into Model [&quot;MVC/Model&quot;], View [&quot;MVC/View&quot;] and Controller [&quot;MVC/Controller&quot;].

The user looks at the view, and enters data into the controller.

The [&quot;GUI User&quot;] provides events to the [&quot;MVC/Controller Elements&quot;].

The controller is basically a producer of events that are sent to the model.
A stream of updates are sent from the controller to to model, and that updates all the views that are watching a particular object.

The [&quot;GUI Application Server&quot;] serves [&quot;MVC/View&quot;] to the [&quot;GUI Client Application&quot;].
The [&quot;GUI Client Application&quot;] displays [&quot;MVC/View&quot;] to the [&quot;GUI User&quot;], and it offers multiple [&quot;MVC/Controller&quot;].

The [&quot;GUI Application Server&quot;] uses [&quot;MVC/Model&quot;] to store [&quot;Application Data&quot;].

The [&quot;Application Data&quot;] is able to be processed by any backend module.

 === RDF Data Architecture ===

The [&quot;MVC/Model&quot;] can be a [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Model&quot;].

The [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Model&quot;] can be composed of [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Graphs&quot;].

The [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Graph&quot;] can be managed on [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Storage Server&quot;].

 * GladeXml

 * XulLanguage 

 * LuXor

 * [&quot;Xwt&quot;]


== TaskProposal DotGNU RDF Gui ==

Implement a [&quot;DotGNU&quot;] [&quot;RDF&quot;] [&quot;Gui&quot;] using [&quot;Abstract GUI Client&quot;].

 0. Make a GUI that can read one n3 file and find the following things out.

 1. Graphical User Interface
 1. 1. Find relations between objects
 1. 2. Find domains of relations between objects
 1. 3. Find types of relations between objects
 1. 4. Find cardinality of relations between objects

 2. Select Subject/Object
 2. 1.   Select Attributes
 2. 2.   Select Components
 2. 3.   Select Contained Objects
 2. 4.   Select Relations

 3. Save the relations found as hypothesis in an Ontology

 4. Implement as [&quot;Abstract GUI Client&quot;] that Leverages [&quot;GTK#&quot;] ,and [&quot;QT#&quot;]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The definition of introspection : 

the Introspector is a ModeofMind, a StateOfAwareness. 
the IntrospectorModeOfMind has a LearningAndInteractiveNature.

The Introspective mind is a read only mode at first, 
it allows you to see into yourself.

The issues of OntologicalStructure and SymbolicDefinition come ito play when
you are Introspecting.

To introspect  means literaly to look inside. To spect is to spy, to watch. 
To externalized your internal ideas into *more* internal forms, but for you mind to see. 

This is the ExpansionPredicate, you expand on a symbol, and visualize it.

** To project internal thoughts onto your visual imagination.

To project images inside the mind.

It is a result of adding one InfQuant to an InternalMentalEvent in the VisualSphere. 

an InfQuant is a Quantity of Information

The InternalMentalSymbols, the SymbolDecls, the IconDecls, the GraphDecls 
that are visualized to the outside world are at first meaningless to a third party.

First via the assignment to a Meaning does a Symbol become valuable.
First when they are assigned a meaning via semantics can the value of them be understood.

This process is a stepwise process that involves an human partner that takes part in the introspector use case.
Via interfacing with a human, we are able, to extract &quot;meaning&quot; from them.

This meaning is into sentences, an human encoding, an understandable textual form. 
Sentences allow easy understanding, via direct expression of subject, predicate and object we can indicate the meaning.


Let us look to quotes 

http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html

    When Descartes set about the reconstruction of philosophy, his first step was to 
    (theoretically) permit scepticism and to    
    discard the practice of the schoolmen of looking to authority as the ultimate 
    source of truth. That done, he sought a
    more natural fountain of true principles, and thought he found it in the human mind; 
    thus passing, in the directest way,
    from the method of authority to that of apriority, as described in my first paper. :

    * Self-consciousness was to furnish us with our fundamental truths, 
    and to decide what was agreeable to reason. 

    But since, evidently, not all ideas are true, he was led to note, as the 
    first condition of infallibility, that they must be clear. 
    The distinction between an idea seeming clear and really being so, 
    never occurred to him. 

    Trusting to introspection, as he did, even for a knowledge of external things, 
    why should he question its testimony in respect to the contents of our own minds? 

    But then, I suppose, seeing men, who seemed to be quite clear and positive, 
    holding opposite opinions upon fundamental principles, he was further led 
    to say that clearness of ideas is not sufficient, but that they need also 
    to be distinct, i.e., to have nothing unclear about them. 

    What he probably meant by this (for he did not explain himself with precision) was, 
    that they must sustain the test of dialectical examination; that they must not only 
    seem clear at the outset, but that discussion must never be able to bring to light points 
    of obscurity connected with them.



Here is an interesting api that I found into the introspector,it externalizes an model, allowing it to be inspected. 
http://jade.cselt.it/doc/api/jade/content/onto/Introspector.html#method_detail
http://jade.cselt.it/doc/api/jade/content/schema/ObjectSchema.html

    Here in the jade object schema, you see that we can add slots
    to the objects, some manditory, some not, some with cardinality.

Quote from : http://www.quebecoislibre.org/030510-9.htm

    For Mises, economic behavior is a special case of human action.
    He contends that it is through the analysis of the idea
    of action that the principles of economics can be deduced. 
    Economic theorems are seen as connected to the foundation of 
    real human purposes. Economics is based on true and evident axioms, 
    arrived at by introspection, concerning the essence 
    of human action. 
    From these axioms, Mises derives logical implications or the truths of economics.


Quote from  http://www.gazettenet.com/04222003/entertai/5279.htm

    While the spontaneity of these pieces - and others on view at Hampden Gallery 
    - links them to the abstract art created half a century ago, 
    they also are good examples of the lyrical introspection 
    that today's artists bring to their work.
    
Quote from http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20030507/CASUCC/TPBusiness/General

    But in his recent book Growing People, Growing Companies 
    he warns that individual career &quot;pathfinding&quot; isn't easy.
    &quot;Pursuing personal success requires reflection, self-awareness and courage.
    The path is difficult to identify, as it is unique to each individual 
    and has never been found or taken before,&quot; 
    he writes. 
    &quot;You are constantly picking your way through virgin forest to create the 
    route with only the vague feeling that you are 
    heading in the right direction . . . [it] means 
    taking risks and experimenting with yourself.&quot;


From : http://electroniciraq.net/news/737.shtml

    This war (which never really ended – and perhaps has no solidly fixed 
    beginnings – as is the ephemeral nature of 
    slow-drip genocide) has shattered communities and served as 
    a grand example of a massive setback for humanity. 

    It has also highlighted a whole plethora of issues that the West tries 
    to ignore as we rush into condemnation of the more      
    blatantly visible players. 

    We – the alternative – in our finger pointing, our doling out of blame 
    to the figureheads, the passing array of
    politicians &quot;responsible&quot; for how far astray the human race has gone, 
    have somehow missed one of the lessons 
    so blatantly obvious in all of this: 

    that introspection and reflection, and admission of our own 
    complicity within this, is vitally important if we are to   
    move forward with any sort of cohesion as a movement. 

    That in the &quot;shaming,&quot; in the blaming of the other 
    (who really aren’t like us at all, because we care), perhaps we should
    be saying shame, too, on us – for twelve years of not managing to 
    break the sound barrier; shame for the suffocating 
    silence surrounding genocidal sanctions; shame for every victim of Israeli 
    apartheid in occupied Palestine;shame for the 
    slow and painful or quick deaths and the lives never given voice, never 
    fought for, never honored; shame for every victim
    of state-sponsored terrorism; and shame for the memory of 
    every Iraqi man, woman and child who lived with a virtual gun 
    to their heads for far too long.


Quote from http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//articles/mach/mach.html

    But there is another, one might almost say phenomenological, aspect to his thinking. 
    All Mach's arguments, however they
    are to be classified, are rigorously subordinated by him to a single goal: the goal  
    of increasing knowledge.(19) He is
    quite prepared to renounce any claim to the epithets 'physicist' or 'philosopher' if  
    this contributes to the advancement 
    of our understanding of the world ((1910), p. 11). He thereby stands in marked  
    contrast to those philosophers and 
    scientists who are all too ready to impose in advance requirements that  
    enquiry has to satisfy if it is to be 
    'scientific', for example by foisting abstract 'criteria of rationality' 
     on live traditions of research.

    He shares with Husserl and others in the Brentano tradition the conviction that 
     theoretical enquiry cannot afford to lose
    sight of the origins of our ideas (scientific and otherwise). Scientific ideas, 
     as Mach conceives them, must have their 
    origins in concepts - called by him 'inaugurating concepts' - derived directly  
    from experience (and, like the 
    phenomenologists, Mach was prepared to acknowledge the role played by introspection  
    in the foundations of scientific 
    enquiry). The science of heat, he argues, is derived from the concept of felt 
     warmth, the science of light from the 
    concept of intensity of illumination, the science of acoustics from the  
    concept of frequency, and so on.(20)

    Mach shares with members of the phenomenological tradition a conception of the philosophy 
     of science as something that 
    must be tied to the actual practice of science. As Husserl puts it: 'A fruitful theory  
    of concept formation in the 
    natural sciences can...only be a theory &quot;from below&quot;, a theory that has grown out of  
    the work of the natural sciences 
    themselves.' The passage occurs in the context of a discussion by Husserl of a  
    monograph by the Neo-Kantian Rickert in 
    which a conception of the philosophy of science is manifested 'which deals so 
     much in general constructions, is so much a
    theory &quot;from above&quot;, that not a single example is to be found in the entire 
    monograph and nor does this absence make 
    itself felt' (1979, p. 147).
 
    It is a recurring feature of Mach's deservedly famous conceptual analyses of the  
    ontological commitments of scientists 
    e.g. to space and time, that he proceeds by gradually stripping away from these  
    all purely conceptual baggage, all 
    metaphysical free play not directly related to sense experience - and thereby arrives,  
    step by step, at certain (as Mach 
    conceives things) unambiguous and precise components, such as the inaugurating concepts  
    mentioned above:
    
    I see the expression of... economy clearly in the gradual reduction of the  
    statical laws of machines to a single one, 
    viz., the principle of virtual work: in the replacement of Kepler's laws by 
     Newton's single law... and in the 
    [subsequent] reduction, simplification and clarification of the laws of dynamics. 
     I see clearly the biologico-economical 
    adaptation of ideas, which takes place by the principles of continuity (permanence) 
     and of adequate definition and splits
    the concept 'heat' into the two concepts of 'temperature' and 'quantity of heat'; 
     and I see how the concept 'quantity of
    heat' leads on to 'latent heat', and to the concepts of 'energy' and 'entropy'. ((1910), p. 6f.)

Quote from http://www.acooke.org/andrew/writing/lang.html

    In many OO languages it is possible to find out what class an object is  
    (run time type information) and even what
    functions are connected with it (introspection / reflection). Others, 
     like C++ have little run time information 
    available (at least in the standard language - individual libraries  
    of objects can support RTTI  with their own
    conventions).

from : http://www.singinst.org/LOGI/seedAI.html

    Better support for introspective perception and manipulation.  
    The comparatively poor support of the human architecture for 
    low-level introspection is most apparent in the extreme case of modifying code; 
    we can think thoughts about thoughts, but not thoughts about individual neurons.  
    However, other cross-level introspections are also closed to us. 
    We lack the ability to introspect on :
     * concept kernels, 
     * focus-of-attention allocation, 
     * sequiturs in the thought process, 
     * memory formation, 
     * skill reinforcement, et cetera; 
    We lack the ability to :
     * introspectively notice, 
     * induce beliefs about, 
     * or take deliberate actions in these domains.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|3|1986|Household Arts|General Conference}}

==1. Have the Nutrition Honor.==
Answers to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Nutrition|Nutrition]] Honor can be found in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts|Household Arts]] chapter of this book.

==2. Read a book about Nutrition.==
Suggested books include:
* '''Foods for Thought: Nutrition's Link to Mood, Memory, Learning and Behavior''' ''Bernell Baldwin, Vicki Griffin, Evelyn Kissinger'', Review and Herald, 152 pages.
* '''An Ounce of Prevention: Your Pathway to Abundant Health''', Review and Herald, 64 pages.
* '''Counsels on Diet and Foods''' ''Ellen G. White'', Review and Herald, 512 pages.
* '''Dynamic Living''' ''Hans Diehl, Dr.H.Sc., Aileen Ludington, M.D.'', Review and Herald, 208 pages.
* '''Foods that Heal''' ''George D. Pamplona-Roger, M.D.'', Review and Herald, 94 pages.

==3. Keep a food diary on yourself for one week.==
This can be done with pencil and paper or with an online tool such as the one provided by the USDA at [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov].

==4. Calculate the total nutrients of the following in your diet each day:==
*'''a. Calories'''
*'''b. Protein'''
*'''c. Iron'''
*'''d. Calcium'''
*'''e. Vitamin A'''
*'''f. Thiamine'''
*'''g. Riboflavin'''
*'''h. Niacin'''
*'''i. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid'''

If you have access to the Internet, you can visit the USDA's [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov] web site.  Once you register, you can enter all the foods you eat in a day, and it will analyze your nutrient intake (among other things) based on this information.  ChooseMyPlate can retain the information you enter for up to a year, so tracking it for a week will be easy.

If your Pathfinders do not have access to the Internet, have them record their diets on paper.  You can then use the website to extract the necessary data by entering each food individually, or you can find a cookbook that has nutrient values of various foods in an appendix.  Another option would be to meet in a place that has public Internet access, such as a library or Internet cafe.  Then your Pathfinders can enter the data they have collected for a week and analyze it there.

==5. How do the number of nutrients in your diet compare with the Recommended Daily Allowance chart?==
The USDA's [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov] web site will compare your nutrient intake with the RDA chart.

==6. Explain why a high fiber diet is important, and tell how this can be obtained.==
Fiber promotes the wavelike contractions that keep food moving through the intestine. Also, high-fiber foods expand the inside walls of the colon. This eases the passage of waste. Fibrous substances pass through the intestine undigested. They also absorb many times their weight in water, resulting in softer, bulkier stools. Insoluble fiber is found in wheat, rye, bran, and other grains. It is also the fiber found in most vegetables. See [http://www.gicare.com/pated/edtgs01.htm]

==7. Name three diseases due to malnutrition, and describe the symptoms of each.==
===Scurvy===
Scurvy is a disease that results from insufficient intake of vitamin C and leads to the formation of livid spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from almost all mucous membranes. The spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. Scurvy was at one time common among sailors whose ships were out to sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored and by soldiers who were similarly separated from these foods for extended periods.

===Beriberi===
Beriberi is a nervous system ailment caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine), the symptoms of which may include weight loss, emotional disturbances, impaired sensory perception, weakness and pain in the limbs, and periods of irregular heartbeat. Swelling of bodily tissues  is common. In advanced cases, the disease may cause heart failure and death. The origin of the word is from the Sinhalese (Sri Lankan) language meaning &quot;I cannot, I cannot&quot;.

Beriberi occurs in people whose staple diet consists mainly of polished white rice, which contains little or no thiamine. Therefore the disease has been seen traditionally in people in Asian countries (especially in the nineteenth century and before) and in chronic alcoholics with impaired liver function. If a baby is fed the milk of a mother who suffers from a deficiency in thiamine, the child may develop beriberi.

===Rickets===
Rickets is a disorder which most commonly relates directly to Vitamin D deficiency, which causes a lack of calcium being absorbed. It can also arise, however, from other causes such as certain types of rare tumors or any phosphate-wasting disease. Because calcium is an essential nutrient which aids bone rigidity, the lack of it being absorbed into the body causes fragile or malformed bones, which are unable to support the weight of a growing body.  Rickets causes bone pain, slowed growth in children, dental problems, muscle loss and increased risk of fractures (easily broken bones).

===Pellagra===
Pellagra is a vitamin deficiency disease caused by dietary lack of niacin and protein, especially the essential amino acid tryptophan.  Symptoms of pellagra are red skin lesions, diarrhea, dermatitis, weakness, mental confusion, and eventually dementia. This disease can be common for persons who obtain most of their food energy from corn, as corn is a poor source of tryptophan. Therefore this disease can be common amongst people who live in rural South America where — during winter — they live on corn. Usually the symptoms show during spring, and disappear over summer, to return the next spring, after another long winter.

==8. What are the symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency?==
Early, noticeable symptoms of Overt B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; Deficiency: Unusual fatigue, faulty digestion, no appetite, nausea, loss of menstruation. Also numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, nervousness, diarrhea, mild depression,etc. See [http://www.veganhealth.org/b12/sympt]

==9. What advice would you give a person who decided to be a total vegetarian?==
http://philipngcc.homestead.com/

http://www.dietobio.com/dossiers/en/vegetarism/index.html

http://www.giveusahome.co.uk/articles/vegetarianism.htm

Because Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be obtained through plant sources, total vegetarians are advised to eat foods with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; added (such as fortified soy milk, fortified margarines, or many commercial breakfast cereals), certain brands of nutritional yeast, or take dietary supplements (a good multivitamin will likely include B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in sufficient quantities).

==10. What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats? Which is the most healthful, and why?==
Saturated fats and trans fatty acids are the kinds of fats most likely to cause heart disease. Saturated fats are found mainly in animal products (eggs, butter, cheese, whole milk, and whole milk products), and in coconut, palm, and palm kernel oil. Trans fatty acids appear in foods containing hydrogenated fats like margarine and crackers. To reduce the risk of heart disease, replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats like canola oil, olive oil, flax seed oil, nuts, avocado, soy products, and nut butters. Choose margarine, cookies, crackers, and snack foods that do not contain hydro-genated fats (read the label). See [http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/heart.htm]

==11. Why is it advisable to use less sugar in the diet? List several ways in which this may be accomplished.==
There are a several reasons why sugar is ruining your health: Sugar can suppress the immune system;  Sugar leads to cancer of the ovaries; Sugar can cause heart disease; Sugar can cause appendicitis; Sugar can cause multiple sclerosis; Sugar can increase cholesterol; Sugar can increase the systolic blood pressure; Sugar can cause drowsiness and decreased activity in children; Sugar can contribute to Alzheimer’s disease; Sugar can lead to prostrate cancer; Sugar can cause liver tumors; etc. [http://www.rheumatic.org/sugar.htm] 

Several ways to use less sugar: Cut down slowly; go half and half; establish rules about dessert; If you must eat sweets, eat them with meals; Choose the right breakfast cereal; Don't skip meals; Don't add sugar to foods; ot for a walk when you crave sweetness; Go fat-free if you must have sweets.

==12. What are amino acids? How many are needed to make all the proteins in the body? What is meant by essential amino acids? How many of them are essential? Where can you get all the essential amino acids?==
;Definition of Essential Amino acids: the nine a-amino acids required for protein synthesis that cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained in the diet: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. 
Note: http://www.google.com enter definition essential amino acids to get this and other related definitions! [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&amp;q=definition+amino+acids]

Of the 28 amino acids needed by humans, 9 of them cannot be manufactured by the body and are thus termed &quot;essential.&quot;

Only some foods contain all the essential amino acids. These are: 
milk and dairy products, eggs, fish, meat and poultry. If you don't eat animal products, the only way you can get all the essential amino acids is by combining plant foods. For example: corn plus peas or beans, rice plus beans, lentils plus bread. [http://www.dietitian.com/protein.html] Google results:[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-28%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=amino+acids+needs+to+make+proteins]

Another term that comes up when we talk about protein nutrition is the term essential amino acid. Our bodies can make quite a number of amino acids from other chemicals that are contained in the body and can convert some amino acids into other amino acids. However, there are some amino acids we are not able to synthesize ourselves. Those particular amino acids and they must be provided to us in our diet. Those amino acids are referred to as the essential amino acids. It's not to say that the non-essential amino acids are not necessary, it's just that it is not necessary for them to be in our diet because other things in the diet can be used to make them.

==13. Know the difference between water and fat soluble vitamins. What are two common vitamins that are fat soluble? What are two vitamins that are water soluble?==
The fat soluble vitamins are soluble in lipids (fats). These vitamins are usually absorbed in fat globules (called chylomicrons) that travel through the lymphatic system of the small intestines and into the general blood circulation within the body. These fat soluble vitamins, especially vitamins A and E, are then stored in body tissues. Two common vitamins that are fat soluble (A, D, E, and K). Two vitamins that are water soluble (B and C). It determines how each vitamin acts within the body.

==14. Using the book Counsels on Diet and Foods by Ellen G. White, write a paragraph on the benefits of a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet.==
Use the &quot;search the writings&quot; feature on http://www.egwestate.org

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic prinicple of most automatic winding systems is simple.  The rotor is a relatively large unbalanced weight mounted in a way that it can turn around a pivot.  As the watch moves, the rotor will shift around the pivot.  The rotor is indirectly connected to the mainspring arbor in a way that causes the mainspring to be wound slightly when the rotor moves.  In some watches, only movement in one direction will wind, with bidirectional winding every motion of the rotor helps wind. 

==Auto Winding Systems==

Seiko most often uses the Magic Lever system, an extremely simple yet effective system, requiring only 3 or 4 more parts than a manual wind watch.  A gear with ratchet teeth is placed so it's pinion meshes with the mainspring winding gear.  The magic lever is a V shaped metal lever with flexible legs.   The open end of the V is placed around the ratchet gear--one end has a hook, the other an angled point.  When the magic lever moves away from the ratchet wheel, the hook pulls the wheel in the winding direction.  When the magic lever moves towards the ratchet wheel, the point pushes the wheel in the winding direction.  The base of the V is attached to an eccentric post, either part of the rotor or a secondary wheel driven by the rotor.  

Timex used a more complex version of this system in their automatics.  In the Timex system the equivalent to the Magic Lever was made of several pieces with pivots and springs, and the ratchet wheel had planetary reduction gears to increase leverage enough to wind the spring.    In both of these systems, the ratchet wheel can turn without turning the rotor, allowing handwinding with no decoupling wheel needed, although many Seiko automatics do not provide handwinding capability.  

Many ETA movements use reversing wheels.  In this system, there are two sets of gears, each with a top and bottom gear connected by a one-way clutch.  One top gear will be driven by the rotor and will in turn drive the other top gear.  Both bottom gears are connected (directly or indirectly) to the mainspring arbor.  When the first gear is turning in the direction that it can wind the watch, it's associated bottom gear will also turn with it, winding it.  The first gear will also turn the second gear in the opposite direction.  The second gear's one-way clutch will allow the bottom gear to disconnect.  When the first gear moves in the wrong direction for it to wind, it's bottom gear will be allowed to disconnect, but it will be turning the second gear in the opposite direction, allowing it to wind the watch.  

The rocker bar system has two gears (usually called wheels)  meshed together on a pivoting rocker bar, and will be driven by a gear when the rotor turns.  In this description, assume that the rocker bar is to the right of the driving gear, and the driven gear is above the rocker.  When the driving wheel turns counterclockwise, the rocker will rock slightly clockwise, so that the rocker gear meshing with the driving gear will also mesh with the driven gear, turning the driven gear counterclockwise.  When the driving wheel turns clockwise, it will cause the rocker to pivot slightly.  The rocker gear meshed with the driving gear will move down and away from the driven gear, while the opposite rocker gear will move upwards and mesh with the driven gear, again causing the driven wheel to turn clockwise. 

Most rocker-bar systems have handwinding capability, this requires a decoupling wheel so the rotor is not forced to turn with handwinding.  

All of the above watches have 360 degree rotating rotors.  An earlier form of automatic wind is the bumper-wind. In these, the rotor could not make a full rotation--Instead, at the ends of its allowed travel it would hit springs.   These were produced until the patents for the 360 degree rotor expired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This title speaks volumes: Christianity and the world's religions, the suggestion that Christianity is different from World Religions. It is. Fundamentally different, in its focus. The focus is on the person of Christ. This Jesus Christ who came to Earth to offer man salvation. A salvation not based on goodness, moral teaching or good behaviour. It is based not on Jesus's great teaching, which most acknowledge as sound, but on his work on the cross. 

No religion offers the believer perfect salvation. Others offer good codes, practices, rituals, teachings and wisdom. But none offer God himself, present in the believer's life through the Holy Spirit of God. Some offer an approach to God, through prophets or good teachers. However the eternal concept of Christ in me the hope of glory, is alien, to other religions. 

There is much to write on the differences between the religions of this world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I AM THE LORD AND I DO NOT CHANGE

God is bold enough to declare this simple statement, I AM. Together with this statement that ''&quot;I do not change&quot;''. This declaration is a majestic proclamation that God, whoever he is, does not change. If he is good, then that goodness never changes. Whatever his attributes, like mercy and justice, those do not change. Ever. This is the Doctrine of Immutability. God is Lord and he does not change.

If one is to believe in a God, it is essential that he is immutable. Faith is based on the trust that God says who he is. God must therefore be immutable for the Bible to be true. For the prophecies and the promises to be of any value, God must be the ultimate being. He must be who he has always been. Otherwise everything that faith calls for needs to change. 

If God makes a promise then he must be capable of fulfilling his word. Also he must be trusted to deliver on his promise. Trusting God is by definition believing in his unchanging nature. 

Changing is something humans have to do to regain their status before the fall of man. God is perfect, therefore does not need to change. Immutability and perfection are connected. If one is perfect then change is not required. The Bible teaches that God never changes. The promises are unchanging. God boldly declared in Malachi 3:6 that he is unchanging. The immutability of God is thus certain and an essential part of the doctrine of Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quantile Regression as introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978) seeks to complement classical linear regression analysis. Central hereby is the extension of &quot;ordinary quantiles from a location model to a more general class of linear models in which the conditional quantiles have a linear form&quot; (Buchinsky (1998), p. 89). In Ordinary Least Squares ([[w:en:OLS|OLS]]) the primary goal is to determine the conditional mean of random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, given some explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, reaching the expected value &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Quantile Regression goes beyond this and enables one to pose such a question at any quantile of the conditional distribution function. The following seeks to introduce the reader to the ideas behind Quantile Regression. First, the issue of [[w:en:quantiles|quantiles]] is addressed, followed by a brief outline of least squares estimators focusing on Ordinary Least Squares. Finally, Quantile Regression is presented, along with an example utilizing the Boston Housing data set.

==Preparing the Grounds for Quantile Regression==

===What are Quantiles===
Gilchrist (2001, p.1) describes a quantile as &quot;simply the value that corresponds to a specified proportion of an  (ordered) sample of a population&quot;.  For instance a very commonly used quantile is the [[w:en:median|median]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to a proportion of 0.5 of the ordered data. This corresponds to a quantile with a probability of 0.5 of occurrence. Quantiles hereby mark the boundaries of equally sized, consecutive subsets. (Gilchrist, 2001)  

More formally stated, let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous random variable with a distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt; (1)  F_Y(y) = P (Y\leq {y}) = \tau&lt;/math&gt;

which states that for the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; one can determine for a given value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of occurrence. Now if one is dealing with quantiles, one wants to do the opposite, that is one wants to determine for a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the sample data set the corresponding value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. A  &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}-&lt;/math&gt;quantile refers in a sample data to the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; for a value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; (2) F_Y(y_\tau) = \tau&lt;/math&gt;

Another form of expressing the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}-&lt;/math&gt;quantile mathematically is following:

&lt;math&gt; (3) y_\tau = F_{Y}^{-1}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_\tau&lt;/math&gt; is such that it constitutes the inverse of the function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; for a probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that there are two possible scenarios. On the one hand, if the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing, quantiles are well defined for every &lt;math&gt;\tau \in (0;1)&lt;/math&gt;. However, if a distribution function  &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; is not strictly monotonically increasing , there are some &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;s for which a unique quantile can not be defined. In this case one uses the smallest value that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can take on for a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. 

Both cases, with and without a strictly monotonically increasing function, can be described as follows:

&lt;math&gt; (4) y_\tau = F_Y^{-1}(\tau) = inf \left\{ y | F_Y(y) \geq \tau \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

That is &lt;math&gt;y_\tau&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the inverse of the function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; which in turn is equal to the infimum of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; is greater or equal to a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}-&lt;/math&gt;quantile. (Handl (2000))

However, a problem that frequently occurs is that an empirical distribution function is a step function. Handl (2000) describes a solution to this problem. As a first step, one reformulates equation 4 in such a way that one replaces the continuous random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the observations, in the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the empirical distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; (5) \hat{y}_\tau = inf \left\{ y | F_n(y) \geq \tau \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The empirical distribution function can be separated into equally sized, consecutive subsets via the the number of observations &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Which then leads one to the following step:

&lt;math&gt; (6) \hat{y}_\tau = y_{(i)} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{(1)},...,y_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; as the sorted observations. Hereby, of course, the range of values that &lt;math&gt;y_\tau&lt;/math&gt; can take on is limited simply by the observations &lt;math&gt;y_{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; and their nature. However, what if one wants to implement a different subset, i.e. different quantiles but those that can be derived from the number of observations &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;? 

Therefore a further step necessary to solving the problem of a step function is to smooth the empirical distribution function through replacing it a with continuous linear function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}(y)&lt;/math&gt;. In order to do this there are several algorithms available which are well described in Handl (2000) and more in detail with an evaluation of the different algorithms and their efficiency in computer packages in Hyndman and Fan (1996). Only then one can apply any division into quantiles of the data set as suitable for the purpose of the analysis. (Handl (2000))

===Ordinary Least Squares===
In regression analysis the researcher is interested in analyzing the behavior of a dependent variable &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; given the information contained in a set of explanatory variables &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Ordinary Least Squares is a standard approach to specify a linear regression model and estimate its unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors. This leads to an approximation of the mean function of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable.  OLS achieves the property of BLUE, it is the best, linear, and unbiased estimator, if following four assumptions hold:

1. The explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is non-stochastic

2. The expectations of the error term &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero, i.e. &lt;math&gt;E[\epsilon_i]=0&lt;/math&gt;

3. Homoscedasticity - the variance of the error terms &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; is constant, i.e. &lt;math&gt;var(\epsilon_i)=\sigma^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. No autocorrelation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;cov(\epsilon_i , \epsilon_j )=0&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt;

However, frequently one or more of these assumptions are violated, resulting in that OLS is not anymore the best, linear, unbiased estimator. Hereby Quantile Regression can tackle following issues: (i), frequently the error terms are not necessarily constant across a distribution thereby violating the axiom of homoscedasticity. (ii) by focusing on the mean as a measure of location, information about the tails of a distribution are lost. (iii) OLS is sensitive to extreme outliers that can distort the results significantly. (Montenegro (2001))

==Quantile Regression==

===The Method===
Quantile Regression essentially transforms a conditional distribution function into a conditional quantile function by slicing it into segments. These segments describe the cumulative distribution of a conditional dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given the explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; with the use of quantiles as defined in equation 4. 

For a dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given the explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;X=x&lt;/math&gt; and fixed &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\tau&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the conditional quantile function is defined as the &lt;math&gt;\tau-th&lt;/math&gt; quantile &lt;math&gt;Q_{Y|X}(\tau|x)&lt;/math&gt; of the conditional distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_{Y|X}(y|x)&lt;/math&gt;. For the estimation of the location of the conditional distribution function, the conditional median &lt;math&gt;Q_{Y|X}(0,5|x)&lt;/math&gt; can be used as  an alternative to the conditional mean. (Lee (2005))

One can nicely illustrate Quantile Regression when comparing it with OLS. In OLS, modeling a conditional distribution function of a random sample (&lt;math&gt;{y_1,...,y_n}&lt;/math&gt;) with a parametric function &lt;math&gt;\mu(x_i,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the independent variables, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding estimates and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the conditional mean, one gets following minimization problem:

&lt;math&gt; (7) min_{\beta\in\Re}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\mu(x_i,\beta))^{2} &lt;/math&gt;

One thereby obtains the conditional expectation function &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Now, in a similar fashion one can proceed in Quantile Regression. Central feature thereby becomes &lt;math&gt;\rho_\tau&lt;/math&gt;, which serves as a check function.
 
&lt;math&gt; (8)
\rho_{\tau}(x)=\begin{cases}\tau*x &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0 
\\ (\tau-1)*x &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \end{cases} 	
&lt;/math&gt;

This check-function ensures that

1. all &lt;math&gt;\rho_\tau&lt;/math&gt; are positive

2. the scale is according to the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Such a function with two supports is a must if dealing with L1 distances, which can become negative.

In Quantile Regression one minimizes now following function:

&lt;math&gt; (9) min_{\beta\in\Re}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{\tau}(y_i-\xi(x_i,\beta)) &lt;/math&gt;

Here, as opposed to OLS, the minimization is done for each subsection defined by &lt;math&gt;\rho_\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where the estimate of the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantile function is achieved with the parametric function &lt;math&gt;\xi(x_i, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;. (Koenker and Hallock (2001))

Features that characterize Quantile Regression and  differentiate it from other regression methods are following:

1. The entire conditional distribution of the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; can be characterized through different values of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;

2. Heteroscedasticity can be detected

3. If the data is heteroscedastic, median regression estimators can be more efficient than mean regression estimators

4. The minimization problem as illustrated in equation 9 can be solved efficiently by linear programming methods, making estimation easy

5. Quantile functions are also equivariant to monotone transformations. That is &lt;math&gt;Q_{h(Y|X)}(x_\tau)=h(Q_{(Y|X)}(x_{\tau}))&lt;/math&gt;, for any function

6. Quantiles are robust in regards to outliers ( Lee (2005) )

===A graphical illustration of Quantile Regression===
Before proceeding to a numerical example, the following subsection seeks to graphically illustrate the concept of Quantile Regression. First, as a starting point for this illustration, consider figure 1. For a given explanatory value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; the density for a conditional dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is indicated by the size of the balloon. The bigger the balloon, the higher is the density, with the  [[w:en:mode|mode]], i.e. where the density is the highest, for a given &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; being the biggest balloon. Quantile Regression essentially connects the equally sized balloons, i.e. probabilities, across the different values of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, thereby allowing one to focus on the interrelationship between the explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; for the different quantiles, as can be seen in figure 2. These subsets, marked by the quantile lines, reflect the probability density of the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image: Prob.jpg |center|thumb|550px| Figure 1: Probabilities of occurrence for individual explanatory variables]]

The example used in figure 2 is originally from Koenker and Hallock (2000), and illustrates a classical empirical application, Ernst Engel's (1857) investigation into the relationship of household food expenditure, being the dependent variable, and household income as the explanatory variable. In Quantile Regression the conditional function of &lt;math&gt;Q_{Y|X}(\tau|x)&lt;/math&gt; is segmented by the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantile. In the analysis, the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantiles &lt;math&gt;\tau \in\left\{0,05; 0,1; 0,25; 0,5; 0,75; 0,9; 0,95\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, indicated by the thin blue lines that separate the different color sections, are superimposed on the data points. The conditional median (&lt;math&gt;\tau=0,5&lt;/math&gt;) is indicated by a thick dark blue line, the conditional mean by a light yellow line. The color sections thereby represent the subsections of the data as generated by the quantiles. 

[[Image: Engel_Curve.jpg |center|thumb|550px| Figure 2: Engels Curve, with the median highlighted in dark blue and the mean in yellow]]

Figure 2 can be understood as a contour plot representing a 3-D graph, with food expenditure and income on the respective y and x axis. The third dimension arises from the probability density of the respective values. The density of a value is thereby indicated by the darkness of the shade of blue, the darker the color, the higher is the probability of occurrence. For instance, on the outer bounds, where the blue is very light, the probability density for the given data set is relatively low, as they are marked by the quantiles 0,05 to 0,1 and 0,9 to 0,95. It is important to notice that figure 2 represents for each subsections the individual probability of occurrence, however, quantiles utilize the cumulative probability of a conditional function. For example, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of 0,05 means that 5&lt;math&gt;\%&lt;/math&gt; of observations are expected to fall below this line, a &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of 0,25 for instance means that 25&lt;math&gt;\%&lt;/math&gt; of the observations are expected to fall below this and the 0,1 line.

The graph in figure 2, suggests that the error variance is not constant across the distribution. The dispersion of food expenditure increases as household income goes up. Also the data is skewed to the left, indicated by the spacing of the quantile lines that decreases above the median and also by the relative position of the median which lies above the mean. This suggests that the axiom of homoscedasticity is violated, which OLS relies on. The statistician is therefore well advised to engage in an alternative method of analysis such as Quantile Regression, which is actually able to deal with heteroscedasticity.

===A Quantile Regression Analysis===
In order to give a numerical example of the analytical power of Quantile Regression and to compare it within the boundaries of a statistical application with OLS the following section will be analyzing some selected variables of the Boston Housing dataset which is available at the md-base website. The data was first analyzed by Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980). The original data comprised 506 observations for 14 variables stemming from the census of the Boston metropolitan area. 

This analysis utilizes as the dependent variable the median value of owner occupied homes (a metric variable, abbreviated with H) and investigates the effects of 4 independent variables as shown in table 1. These variables were selected as they best illustrate the difference between OLS and Quantile Regression. For the sake of simplicity of the analysis, it was neglected for now to deal with potential difficulties related to finding the correct specification of a parametric model. A simple linear regression model therefore was assumed. For the estimation of asymptotic standard errors see for example Buchinsky (1998), which illustrates the design-matrix bootstrap estimator or alternatively Powell (1986) for kernel based estimation of asymptotic standard errors.

In the following firstly an OLS model was estimated. Three digits after the comma were indicated in the tables as some of the estimates turned out to be very small.

&lt;math&gt; (10) E [H_i | T_i, O_i, A_i, P_i] = \alpha + \beta T_i + \delta O_i + \gamma A_i + \lambda P_i  &lt;/math&gt;

Computing this via XploRe one obtains the results as shown in the table below.

Analyzing this data set via Quantile Regression, utilizing the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt; quantiles &lt;math&gt;\tau \in \left(0,1; 0,3; 0,5; 0,7; 0,9\right)&lt;/math&gt; the model is characterized as follows:

&lt;math&gt; (11) Q_H [\tau| T_i, O_i, A_i, P_i] = \alpha_\tau + \beta_\tau T_i  + \delta_\tau O_i  + \gamma_\tau A_i  + \lambda_\tau P_i   &lt;/math&gt;

Just for illustrative purposes and to further foster the understanding of the reader for Quantile Regression, the equation for the &lt;math&gt;0,1^{th}&lt;/math&gt; quantile  is briefly illustrated, all others follow analogous:

&lt;math&gt; (12) min\left[\rho_{0,1}(y_1-x_1\beta)+\rho_{0,1}(y_2-x_2\beta)+ ...+\rho_{0,1}(y_n-x_n\beta)\right]  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{ equation 12 with } 
\rho_{0,1}(y_i-x_i\beta)=\begin{cases}0,1(y_i-x_i\beta) &amp; \mbox{if }(y_i-x_i\beta)&gt;0
\\-0,9(y_i-x_i\beta) &amp; \mbox{if }(y_i-x_i\beta)&lt;0 \end{cases}

Now if one compares the results for the estimates of OLS from table 2 and Quantile Regression, table 3, one finds that the latter method can make much more subtle inferences of the effect of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable.  Of particular interest are thereby quantile estimates that are relatively different as compared to other quantiles for the same estimate.

Probably the most interesting result and most illustrative in regards to an understanding of the functioning of Quantile Regression and pointing to the differences with OLS are the results for the independent variable of the proportion of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt;. OLS indicates that this variable has a positive influence on the dependent variable, the value of homes, with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}=0,021&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the value of houses increases as the proportion of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; increases in regards to the Boston Housing data. 

Looking at the output that Quantile Regression provides us with, one finds a more differentiated picture. For the 0,1 quantile, we find an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_{0,1}= 0,087&lt;/math&gt; which would suggest that for this low quantile the effect seems to be even stronger than is suggested by OLS. Here house prices go up when the proportion of non-retail businesses &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; goes up, too. However, considering the other quantiles, this effect is not quite as strong anymore, for the 0,7th and 0,9th  quantile this effect seems to be even reversed indicated by the parameter &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_{0,7}= -0,021&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_{0,9}= -0,062&lt;/math&gt;. These values indicate that in these quantiles the house price is negatively influenced by an increase of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The influence of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; seems to be obviously very ambiguous on the dependent variable of housing price, depending on which quantile one is looking at. The general recommendation from OLS that if the proportion of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; increases, the house prices would increase can obviously not be generalized. A policy recommendation on the OLS estimate could therefore be grossly misleading.

One would intuitively find the statement that the average number of rooms of a property &lt;math&gt;(O_i)&lt;/math&gt; positively influences the value of a house, to be true. This is also suggested by OLS with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}=38,099&lt;/math&gt;. Now Quantile Regression also confirms this statement, however, it also allows for much subtler conclusions. There seems to be a significant difference between the 0,1 quantile as opposed to the rest of the quantiles, in particular the 0,9th quantile. For the lowest quantile the estimate is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,1}= 29,606&lt;/math&gt;, whereas for the 0,9th quantile it is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,9}=51,353&lt;/math&gt;. Looking at the other quantiles one can find similar values for the Boston housing data set as for the 0,9th, with estimates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,3}=45,281&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,5}=53,252&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,7}=50,999&lt;/math&gt; respectively. So for the lowest quantile the influence of additional number of rooms &lt;math&gt;(O_i)&lt;/math&gt; on the house price seems to be considerably smaller then for all the other quantiles.

Another illustrative example is provided analyzing the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 &lt;math&gt;(A_i)&lt;/math&gt; and its effect on the value of homes. Whereas OLS would indicate this variable has hardly any influence with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}=0,001&lt;/math&gt;, looking at Quantile Regression one gets a different impression. For the  0,1th quantile, the age has got a negative influence on the value of the home with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}_{0,1}=-0,022&lt;/math&gt;. Comparing this with the highest quantile where the estimate is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}_{0,9}=0,004&lt;/math&gt;, one finds that the value of the house is suddenly now positively influenced by its age. Thus, the negative influence is confirmed by all other quantiles besides the highest, the  0,9th quantile.

Last but not least, looking at the pupil-teacher ratio &lt;math&gt;(P_i)&lt;/math&gt; and its influence on the value of houses, one finds that the tendency that OLS indicates with a value of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}=-0,953&lt;/math&gt; to be also reflected in the Quantile Regression analysis. However, in Quantile Regression one can see that the influence on the housing price of the pupils-teacher ratio &lt;math&gt;(P_i)&lt;/math&gt; gradually increases over the different quantiles, from the 0,1th quantile with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_{0,1}=-0,443&lt;/math&gt; to the 0,9th quantile with a value of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_{0,9}=-1,257&lt;/math&gt;. 

This analysis makes clear, that Quantile Regression allows one to make much more differentiated statements when using Quantile Regression as opposed to OLS. Sometimes OLS estimates can even be misleading what the true relationship between an explanatory and a dependent variable is as the effects can be very different for different subsection of the sample.

==Conclusion==

For a distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y (y)&lt;/math&gt; one can determine for a given value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of occurrence. Now quantiles do exactly the opposite. That is, one wants to determine for a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the sample data set the corresponding value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In OLS, one has the primary goal of determining the conditional mean of random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, given some explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Quantile Regression goes beyond this and enables us to pose such a question at any quantile of the conditional distribution function. It focuses on the interrelationship between a dependent variable and its explanatory variables for a given quantile. Quantile Regression overcomes thereby various problems that OLS is confronted with. Frequently, error terms are not constant across a distribution, thereby violating the axiom of homoscedasticity. Also, by focusing on the mean as a measure of location, information about the tails of a distribution are lost. And last but not least, OLS is sensitive to extreme outliers, which can distort the results significantly. As has been indicated in the small example of the Boston Housing data, sometimes a policy based upon an OLS analysis might not yield the desired result as a certain subsection of the population does not react as strongly to this policy or even worse, responds in a negative way, which was not indicated by OLS.

'''Potato Skins''' is a dish made with Potato halves with cheese and sometimes bacon, green onions, and sour cream sprinkled on top.

==Ingredients==
*8 small baking [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]
*Vegetable oil
*Garlic salt
*2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (8 oz.) shredded [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar cheese]]
*12 slices [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]], cooked &amp; crumbled (optional)
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoons]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:chive|chives]], divided

==Procedure==
Scrub potatoes and rub skins with oil. Prick each potato several times with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until potatoes are done.
Allow potatoes to cool to touch. Cut top third off each potato; discard tops. Carefully scoop out pulp, leaving about 1/8 inch thick shells. (Reserve potato pulp for other uses.)

Fry potato skins in hot oil (375 degrees) for 3-4 minutes or until browned. Invert and drain on paper towels. Place potato skins, cut side up, on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with garlic salt and Cheddar cheese. Broil 6 inches from heat for 30 seconds or until cheese melts. Top potato skins with bacon if using them and 1 tablespoon chives.

Press green chiles between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Combine chilies, sour cream and red pepper in a small bowl; stir well. Top with remaining 1 tablespoon chives. Serve with potato skins.

Yield: 8 servings.

==Notes==
*You don't have to make the chili sour cream.  You can just put a spoonful of sour cream right onto of the potato skin.
*You can also bake these off in the oven to melt the cheese if you didn't want to fry them in oil.

Library and Information Science (LIS) is the academic and professional study of how information and information carriers are produced, disseminated, discovered, evaluated, selected, acquired, used, organized, maintained, and managed. This book intends to introduce the reader to both fundamental concerns and prominent current issues in the field of library and information science.

A secondary goal of this book is to introduce readers to prominent writers, articles, and books within the field of library science.  The book originated as a collection of annotations of important LIS articles.  Though these citations are being developed into a fuller text, we hope that this book remains firmly rooted in the literature of LIS and related fields, and helps direct readers toward important resources when a particular topic strikes their fancy.

''Some comments on your questions''
--[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

I've seen all three of the following in books or in Google searches:

* Aρέσω το αυτοκίνητο. I like the car. 
:''This is plain wrong!'' 
:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
* Με αρέσει το αυτοκίνητο. I like the car. (lit, &quot;The car pleases me.&quot;)
:''This is regional variation (Nothern Greece, especially Salonica)''
:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
* Μου αρέσει το αυτοκίνητο.
:'''''This is the correct one!'''''
:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

Are all three of these correct? Do they all mean the same thing? Am I confused? In the third example, why would the genitive be used?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 18:25, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:''No, only the third is correct.

:It is not ''μου'', it is ''μού''. When ''μού'' is accented, it means &quot;to me&quot; &quot;σε μένα&quot;. When it is not accented it means &quot;of me&quot;.

:Here is an example in order to differentiate: 

:''Μού'' έδωσε ένα αυτοκίνητο και τώρα το αυτοκίνητο είναι δικό ''μου''.

:He gave me a car and now the car is mine''

:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)


:The genitive is in reallity a dative, that is used mostly with pronouns:

:''I would say the dative (which is not used anymore) means &quot;to/at something/someone&quot;, while the genitive means &quot;of something/someone&quot;. It's like &quot;give&quot; and &quot;take&quot;.

:''Example:

:Δόξα τω Θεώ = Glory to God (dative)
:Δόξα του Θεού = Glory of God (genitive)''

=formatting, cognates=
Hi 83.146.62.97 - I didn't do a very good job of explaining in the text what I meant by stuff like ο λογαριασμός the bill (lit. the account, =&quot;logarithm&quot;). What I was trying to indicate with the equals signs was that the word was cognate with the English word after the equals sign. I've changed all the = to →, which I hope will lead to less confusion. I'll also add a note to the text the first time the → appears. The English word logarithm does come from the same roots as λογαριασμός (logos+arithmos).--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 04:56, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:Bcrowell λογαριασμός does not derive from λογος + αριθμός. The word that derives from these two words is λογάριθμος (which indeed is logarithm). It is a false cognate. --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 05:27, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

::Oops! Sorry about that. It was my favorite false cognate, too :-) --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 05:37, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

=fruit=
Can someone help me understand the difference between ο καρπός and το φρούτο? A Greek speaker wrote this:
:ο καρπός (also το φρούτο in the general sense of fruits, not as products of trees)
Is το φρούτο more general than ο καρπός? Is an orange both a φρούτο and a καρπός? I deleted the explanation from the list, because it was making the format of the table hard to read by separating the two columns from each other by a wide space. Maybe we could have a note below the vocabulary list about this?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:30, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:: The word καρπός is used only to indicate something that derives from something else therefore &quot;''Το μήλο είναι ο καρπός της μηλιάς''&quot; (&quot;The apple is the fruit of the appletree&quot;). There is also the famous religious phrase &quot;''Ο καρπός της κοιλίας της''&quot; (&quot;The fruit of her womb&quot;).

:: But if we just want to categorize the apple we say &quot;''Το μήλο είναι φρούτο''&quot; (&quot;The apple is a fruit&quot;). For our purpose the word φρούτο is the correct one.--[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 05:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Just to say that the name of the band was not translated to that in English, it WAS that. They had an English name, this is why I put it there. See http://www.athensguide.com/socrates/

== Verb forms ==

A table of verb forms is not complete without the present of the perfective aspect. Note that the imperfect is mostly formed regularly, whereas the derivation of the ; from the perfective present often shows slight variations:
πέρνω - έπερνα
να πάρω - πήρα

One exception is έχω that has no aorist stem but an irregular imperfect είχα. Similar for είμαι. Some verbs that have dropped an initial vowel have irregular augments in the imperfect, like ήθελα, ήξερα. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 02:30, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for participating on [[Computer programming]]. But I must tell you that your Prolog entry does not anwer the two important questions:

# Why should I learn Prolog?
# What paradims will Prolog it teach me?

Entries which do not answer these questions will be deleted :-( . Not imediatly - we only trim down the page once a year or so ;-).

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:42, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

: A lot better - but could do with some fine tuning. I don't mean content, I mean presentation. i.E. You in one place you begin a sentence with ''Prolog was designed to help''. However, the book is centered around learning so it would be better to begin the sentence with ''Learning Prolog will help you to''. Sadly most entries make that mistake, beeing to much like a litte wikipedia - and most changes are made my anonymous users so I can't discuss the entry with them :-( . --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:03, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prepayments, also called deferrals, result from cash payment proceeds an expense or revenue recognition.  The most common example of a prepaid expense is unearned revenue.
 
Often, businesses pay for services from which they have not yet benefited e.g. rent is often paid in advance.

The double entry for a prepayment is:

{{bookkeeping journal
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2005&lt;br/&gt;Feb | day = 1 | description = Prepaid Rent (Asset) | dr = 50 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Cash (Asset) | cr = 50 }}
}}


Later when the rent is actually due the entry is:

{{bookkeeping journal
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2005&lt;br/&gt;Mar | day = 1 | description = Rent (Expense) | dr = 50 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Prepaid Rent (Asset) | cr = 50 }}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">An accrual is the effect of receiving goods or services before cash payment. This will most often result in a liability on the company's books, usually as a payable.  Another type of accrual results from recognizing revenues before payment.  Note this does not include unearned revenue, which is a deferral.
 
Sometimes a business uses a service (e.g. electricity) which it has not yet been invoiced for.  The double entry for this is:
{{Drcr| date=2005&lt;br&gt;Feb | day=28 | dr = Electricity (Expense)| cr = Unpaid electricity (Liability) | amount = 130 }}

Later when this bill gets paid
{{Drcr| date=2005&lt;br&gt;Mar | day=12 | dr = Unpaid electricity (Liability)| cr = Cash (Asset) | amount = 130 }}

It is possible for an accrual to be made for telephone call charges in the period while the line rental (paid in advance) is a prepayment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS 
MEANING OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS 
Managerial economics, used synonymously with business economics, is a branch of economics that deals with the application of microeconomic analysis to decision-making techniques of businesses and management units. It acts as the via media between economic theory and pragmatic economics. Managerial economics bridges the gap between 'theoria' and 'pracis'. The tenets of managerial economics have been derived from quantitative techniques such as regression analysis, correlation and Lagrangian calculus (linear). An omniscient and unifying theme found in managerial economics is the attempt to achieve optimal results from business decisions, while taking into account the firm's objectives, constraints imposed by scarcity and so on. A paradigm of such optmisation is the use of operations research and programming. 
Managerial economics is thereby a study of application of managerial skills in economics. It helps in anticipating, determining and resolving potential problems or obstacles. These problems may pertain to costs, prices, forecasting future market, human resource management, profits and so on. 
DEFINITIONS OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS 
Edwin Mansfield: 	 &quot;concerned with application of economic concepts and economic analysis to the problems of formulating rational managerial decision.&quot;
McGutgan and Moyer: 	“Managerial economics is the application of economic theory and methodology to decision-making problems faced by both public and private institutions”. 
McNair and Meriam: 	“Managerial economics consists of the use of economic modes of thought to analyse business situations”. 
Spencer and Siegelman: 	Managerial economics is “the integration of economic theory with business practice for the purpose of facilitating decision-making and forward planning by management”. 
Haynes, Mote and Paul: 	“Managerial economics refers to those aspects of economics and its tools of analysis most relevant to the firm’s decision-making process”. By definition, therefore, its scope does not extend to macro­economic theory and the economics of public policy, an understanding of which is also essential for the manager. 
Managerial economics studies the application of the principles, techniques and concepts of economics to managerial problems of business and industrial enterprises. The term is used interchangeably with business economics, microeconomics, economics of enterprise, applied economics, managerial analysis and so on. Managerial economics lies at the junction of economics and business management and traverses the hiatus between the two disciplines. 
Managerial decision areas include:
•	assessment of investible funds
•	selecting business area
•	choice of product
•	determining optimum output
•	determining price of product
•	determining input-combination and technology
•	sales promotion.
Almost any business decision can be analyzed with managerial economics techniques, but it is most commonly applied to:
•	Risk analysis - various models are used to quantify risk and asymmetric information and to employ them in decision rules to manage risk.[6]
•	Production analysis - microeconomic techniques are used to analyze production efficiency, optimum factor allocation, costs, economies of scale and to estimate the firm's cost function.
•	Pricing analysis - microeconomic techniques are used to analyze various pricing decisions including transfer pricing, joint product pricing, price discrimination, price elasticity estimations, and choosing the optimum pricing method.
•	Capital budgeting - Investment theory is used to examine a firm's capital purchasing decisions
NATURE  AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS: 
Following points constitute nature of managerial economics 
Managerial Economics is a Science
Managerial Economics is an essential scholastic field. It can be compared to science in a sense that it fulfils the criteria of being a science in following sense:
Science is a Systematic body of Knowledge. It is based on the methodical observation. Managerial economics is also a science of making decisions with regard to scarce resources with alternative applications. It is a body of knowledge that determines or observes the internal and external environment for decision making.
	In science any conclusion is arrived at after continuous experimentation. In Managerial economics also policies are made after persistent testing and trailing. Though economic environment consists of human variable, which is unpredictable, thus the policies made are not rigid. Managerial economist takes decisions by utilizing his valuable past experience and observations.
	Science principles are universally applicable. Similarly policies of Managerial economics are also universally applicable partially if not fully. The policies need to be changed from time to time depending on the situation and attitude of individuals to those particular situations. Policies are applicable universally but modifications are required periodically.
Managerial Economics requires Art
Managerial economist is required to have an art of utilising his capability, knowledge and understanding to achieve the organizational objective. Managerial economist should have an art to put in practice his theoretical knowledge regarding elements of economic environment.
A scientific art: 
Science is a system of rules and principles engendered for attaining given ends. Scientific methods have been credited as the optimal path to achieving one's goals. Managerial economics has been is also called a scientific art because it helps the management in the best and efficient utilisation of scarce economic resources. It considers production costs, demand, price, profit, risk etc. It assists the management in singling out the most feasible alternative. Managerial economics facilitates good and result oriented decisions under conditions of uncertainty. 
Managerial Economics for administration of organization
Managerial economics aims at supporting the management in taking corrective decisions and charting plans and policies for future. Managerial economics helps the management in decision making. These decisions are based on the economic rationale and are valid in the existing economic environment.
Managerial economics is helpful in optimum resource allocation
The resources are scarce with alternative uses. Managers need to use these limited resources optimally. Each resource has several uses. It is manager who decides with his knowledge of economics that which one is the preeminent use of the resource.
Managerial Economics has components of micro economics
It studies the problems and principles of an individual business firm or an individual industry. It aids the management in forecasting and evaluating the trends of the market. 
Managers study and manage the internal environment of the organization and work for the profitable and long-term functioning of the organization. This aspect refers to the micro economics study. The managerial economics deals with the problems faced by the individual organization such as main objective of the organization, demand for its product, price and output determination of the organization, available substitute and complimentary goods, supply of inputs and raw material, target or prospective consumers of its products etc.
Managerial Economics has components of macro economics
Managerial economics incorporates certain aspects of macroeconomic theory. These are essential to comprehending the circumstances and environments that envelop the working conditions of an individual firm or an industry. Knowledge of macroeconomic issues such as business cycles, taxation policies, industrial policy of the government, price and distribution policies, wage policies and antimonopoly policies and so on, is integral to the successful functioning of a business enterprise. 
None of the organization works in isolation. They are affected by the external environment of the economy in which it operates such as government policies, general price level, income and employment levels in the economy, stage of business cycle in which economy is operating, exchange rate, balance of payment, general expenditure, saving and investment patterns of the consumers, market conditions etc. These aspects are related to macro economics.
Normative economics: 
It is concerned with varied corrective measures that a management undertakes under various circumstances. It deals with goal determination, goal development and achievement of these goals. Future planning, policy-making, decision-making and optimal utilisation of available resources, come under the banner of managerial economics. 
Managerial Economics is Pragmatic (practical in outlook) Managerial economics is pragmatic. In pure micro-economic theory, analysis is performed, based on certain exceptions, which are far from reality. However, in managerial economics, managerial issues are resolved daily and difficult issues of economic theory are kept at bay. 
Uses theory of firm: 
Managerial economics employs economic concepts and principles, which are known as the theory of Firm or 'Economics of the Firm'. Thus, its scope is narrower than that of pure economic theory. 
Managerial Economics is dynamic in nature
Managerial Economics deals with human-beings (i.e. human resource, consumers, producers etc.). The nature and attitude differs from person to person. Thus to cope up with dynamism and vitality managerial economics also changes itself over a period of time.
Prescriptive rather than descriptive:
 Managerial economics is a normative and applied discipline. It suggests the application of economic principles with regard to policy formulation, decision-making and future planning. It not only describes the goals of an organisation but also prescribes the means of achieving these goals. 

SCOPE OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS
Well scope is something which tells us how far a particular subject will go. As faras Managerial Economic is concerned it is very wide in scope. It takes intoaccount almost all the problems and areas of manager and the firm.ME deals with Demand analysis, Forecasting, Production function, Cost analysis,Inventory Management, Advertising, Pricing System, Resource allocation etc.Following aspects are to be taken into account while knowing the scope of ME:
Operational issues or internal issues
1. Resource Allocation
2. Demand Analysis and Forecasting
3. Cost and Production Analysis
4. Pricing Decisions, Policies and Practices
5. Profit Management
6. Capital Management
7. Strategic Planning

Environmental or external issues
• Economic Environment: 
• Social environment 
• Political Environment 
• Technological Environment 
• International environment
1. Demand analysis and forecasting:
Unless and until knowing the demand for a product how can we think of producing that product. Therefore demand analysis is something which is necessary for theproduction function to happen. Demand analysis helps in analyzing thevarious types of demand which enables the manager to arrive atreasonable estimates of demand for product of his company. Managersnot only assess the current demand but he has to take into account thefuture demand also.
Theory of Demand: According to Spencer and Siegelman, “A business firm is an economic organisation which transforms productivity sources into goods that are to be sold in a market”. 
a. Demand analysis: Analysis of demand is undertaken to forecast demand, which is a fundamental component in managerial decision-making. Demand forecasting is of 
importance because an estimate of future sales is a primer for preparing production schedule and employing productive resources. Demand analysis helps the management in identifying factors that influence the demand for the products of a firm. Thus, demand analysis and forecasting is of prime importance to business planning. 
b. Demand theory: Demand theory relates to the study of consumer behaviour. It addresses questions such as what incites a consumer to buy a particular product, at what price does he/she purchase the product, why do consumers cease consuming a commodity and so on. It also seeks to determine the effect of the income, habit and taste of consumers on the demand of a commodity and analyses other factors that influence this demand. 
2. Production function:
Conversion of inputs into outputs is known asproduction function. With limited resources we have to make thealternative uses of this limited resource. Factor of production called asinputs is combined in a particular way to get the maximum output. Whenthe price of input rises the firm is forced to work out a combination of inputs to ensure the least cost combination.
Theory of Production: Production and cost analysis is central for the unhampered functioning of the production process and for project planning. Production is an economic activity that makes goods available for consumption. Production is also defined as a sum of all economic activities besides consumption. It is the process of creating goods or services by utilising various available resources. Achieving a certain profit requires the production of a certain amount of goods. To obtain such production levels, some costs have to be incurred. At this point, the management is faced with the task of determining an optimal level of production where the average cost of production would be minimum. Production function shows the relationship between the quantity of a good/service produced (output) and the factors or resources (inputs) used. The inputs employed for producing these goods and services are called factors of production. 
a. Variable factor of production: The input level of a variable factor of production can be varied in the short run. Raw material inputs are deemed as variable factors. Unskilled labour is also considered in the category of variable factors. 
b. Fixed factor of production: The input level of a fixed factor cannot be varied in the short run. Capital falls under the category of a fixed factor. Capital alludes to resources such as buildings, machinery etc. 
Production theory facilitates in determining the size of firm and the level of production. It elucidates the relationship between average and marginal costs and production. It highlights how a change in production can bring about a parallel change in average and marginal costs. Production theory also deals with other issues such as conditions leading to increase or decrease in costs, changes in total production when one factor of production is varied and others are kept constant, substitution of one factor with another while keeping all increased simultaneously and methods of achieving optimum production. 
3. Cost analysis:
Cost analysis is helpful in understanding the cost of aparticular product. It takes into account all the costs incurred whileproducing a particular product. Under cost analysis we will take intoaccount determinants of costs, method of estimating costs, therelationship between cost and output, the forecast of the cost, profit,these terms are very vital to any firm or business.
4. Inventory Management:
What do you mean by the term inventory? Wellthe actual meaning of the term inventory is stock. It refers to stock of rawmaterials which a firm keeps. Now here the question arises how much of the inventory is ideal
stock. Both the high inventory and low inventory is not good for the firm.Managerial economics will use such methods as ABC Analysis, simplesimulation exercises, and some mathematical models, to minimize inventorycost. It also helps in inventory controlling.
5. Advertising:
Advertising is a promotional activity. In advertising whilethe copy, illustrations, etc., are the responsibility of those who get it readyfor the press, the problem of cost, the methods of determining the totaladvertisement costs and budget, the measuring of the economic effects of advertising ---- are the problems of the manager. There’s a vast difference between producing a product and marketing it.It is through advertising only that the message about the product shouldreach the consumer before he thinks to buy it.Advertising forms the integral part of decision making and forwardplanning.
6. Pricing system:
Here pricing refers to the pricing of a product. As you allknow that pricing system as a concept was developed by economics andit is widely used in managerial economics. Pricing is also one of thecentral functions of an enterprise. While pricing commodity the cost of production has to be taken into account, but a complete knowledge of theprice system is quite essential to determine the price. It is also importantto understand how product has to be priced under different kinds of competition, for different markets.
Pricing = cost plus pricing and the policies of the enterprise
Nowit is clear that the price system touches the several aspects of managerialeconomics and helps managers to take valid and profitable decisions.
Theory of Exchange or Price Theory: Theory of Exchange is popularly known as Price Theory. Price determination under different types of market conditions comes under the wingspan of this theory. It helps in determining the level to which an advertisement can be used to boost market sales of a firm. Price theory is pivotal in determining the price policy of a firm. Pricing is an important area in managerial economics. The accuracy of pricing decisions is vital in shaping the success of an enterprise. Price policy impresses upon the demand of products. It involves the determination of prices under different market conditions, pricing methods, pricing policies, differential pricing, product line pricing and price forecasting. 
7. Resource allocation:
Resources are allocated according to the needsonly to achieve the level of optimization.As we all know that we have scarce resources, and unlimited needs. Wehave to make the alternate use of the available resources. For the allocationof the resources various advanced tools such as linear programming are used toarrive at the best course of action.
8.Theory of profit: 
Every business and industrial enterprise aims at maximising profit. Profit is the difference between total revenue and total economic cost. Profitability of an organisation is greatly influenced by the following factors: 
• 	Demand of the product 
• 	Prices of the factors of production 
• 	Nature and degree of competition in the market 
• 	Price behaviour under changing conditions 
Hence, profit planning and profit management are important requisites for improving profit earning efficiency of the firm. Profit management involves the use of most efficient technique for predicting the future. The probability of risks should be minimised as far as possible. 
9.Theory of Capital and Investment: 
Theory of Capital and Investment evinces the following important issues: 
• 	Selection of a viable investment project 
• 	Efficient allocation of capital 
• 	Assessment of the efficiency of capital 
• 	Minimising the possibility of under capitalisation or overcapitalisation. Capital is the building block of a business. Like other factors of production, it is also scarce and expensive. It should be allocated in most efficient manner
10.Environmental issues: 
Managerial economics also encompasses some aspects of macroeconomics. These relate to social and political environment in which a business and industrial firm has to operate. This is governed by the following factors: 
• The type of economic system of the country 
• Business cycles 
• Industrial policy of the country 
• Trade and fiscal policy of the country 
• Taxation policy of the country 
• Price and labour policy 
• General trends in economy concerning the production, employment, income, prices, saving and investment etc. 
• General trends in the working of financial institutions in the country 
• General trends in foreign trade of the country 
• Social factors like value system of the society 
• General attitude and significance of social organisations like trade unions, producers’ unions and consumers’ cooperative societies etc. 
• Social structure and class character of various social groups 
• Political system of the country 
The management of a firm cannot exercise control over these factors. Therefore, it should fashion the plans, policies and programmes of the firm according to these factors in order to offset their adverse effects on the firm. 

ECONOMIC CONCEPTS  AND TECHNIQUES  USED IN MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS
Managerial economics uses a wide variety of economic concepts, tools, and techniques in the decision-making process. These concepts can be placed in three broad categories: (1) the theory of the firm, which describes how businesses make a variety of decisions; (2) the theory of consumer behavior, which describes decision making by consumers; and (3) the theory of market structure and pricing, which describes the structure and characteristics of different market forms under which business firms operate.
1.THE THEORY OF THE FIRM
Discussing the theory of the firm is an useful way to begin the study of managerial economics, since the theory provides a broad framework within which issues relevant to managerial decisions are analyzed. A firm can be considered a combination of people, physical and financial resources, and a variety of information. Firms exist because they perform useful functions in society by producing and distributing goods and services. In the process of accomplishing this, they use society's scarce resources, provide employment, and pay taxes. If economic activities of society can be simply put into two categoriesroduction and consumptionirms are considered the most basic economic entities on the production side, while consumers form the basic economic entities on the consumption side.
The behavior of firms is usually analyzed in the context of an economic model, an idealized version of a real-world firm. The basic economic model of a business enterprise is called the theory of the firm.
2.PROFIT MAXIMIZATION AND THE FIRM.
Under the simplest version of the theory of the firm it is assumed that profit maximization is its primary goal. In this version of the theory, the firm's owner is the manager of the firm, and thus, the firm's owner-manager is assumed to maximize the firm's short-term profits (current profits and profits in the near future). Today, even when the profit maximizing assumption is maintained, the notion of profits has been broadened to take into account uncertainty faced by the firm (in realizing profits) and the time value of money (where the value of a dollar further and further in the future is increasingly smaller than a dollar today). 
It should be noted that expected profit in any one period can itself be considered as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost in that period. Thus, one can, alternatively, find the present value of expected future profits by subtracting the present value of expected future costs from the present value of expected future revenues.
THE CONSTRAINED PROFIT MAXIMIZATION.
Profit maximization is subject to various constraints faced by the firm. These constraints relate to resource scarcity, technology, contractual obligations, and laws and government regulations. In their attempt to maximize the present value of profits, business managers must consider not only the short-term and long-term implications of decisions made within the firm, but also various external constraints that may limit the firm's ability to achieve its organizational goals.
The first external constraint of resource scarcity refers to the limited availability of essential inputs (including skilled labor), key raw materials, energy, specialized machinery and equipment, warehouse space, and other resources. Moreover, managers often face constraints on plant capacity that are exacerbated by limited investment funds available for expansion or modernization. Contractual obligations also constrain managerial decisions. Labor contracts, for example, may constrain managers' flexibility in worker scheduling and work assignment. Labor contracts may also determine the number of workers employed at any time, thereby establishing a floor for minimum labor costs. Finally, laws and regulations have to be observed. The legal restrictions can constrain decisions regarding both production and marketing activities. Examples of laws and regulations that limit managerial flexibility are: the minimum wage, health and safety standards, fuel efficiency requirements, antipollution regulations, and fair pricing and marketing practices.
PROFIT MAXIMIZATION VERSUS OTHER MOTIVATIONS BEHIND MANAGERIAL DECISIONS.
The present value maximization criterion as a basis for the study of the firm's behavior has come under severe criticism from some economists. The critics argue that business managers are interested, at least partly, in factors other than the firm's profits. In particular, they may be interested in power, prestige, leisure, employee welfare, community well-being, and the welfare of the larger society. The act of maximization itself has been criticized; there is a feeling that managers often aim merely to &quot;satisfice&quot; (seek solutions that are considered satisfactory), rather than really try to optimize or maximize (seek to find the best possible solution, given the constraints). 
Under the structure of a modern firm, it is hard to determine the true motives of managers. A modem firm is frequently organized as a corporation in which shareholders are the legal owners of the firm, and the manager acts on their behalf. Under such a structure, it is difficult to determine whether a manager merely tries to satisfy the stockholders of the firm while pursuing other goals, rather than truly attempting to maximize the value (the discounted present value) of the firm. 
BUSINESS VERSUS ECONOMIC PROFITS.
As discussed above, profits are central to the goals of a firm and managerial decision making. Thus, to understand the theory of firm behavior properly, one must have a clear understanding of profits. While the term profit is very widely used, an economist's definition of profit differs from the one used by accountants (which is also usually used by the general public and the business community). Profit in accounting is defined as the excess of sales revenue over the explicit accounting costs of doing business. This surplus is available to the firm for various purposes.
An economist also defines profit as the difference between sales revenue and costs of doing business, but includes more items in figuring costs, rather than considering only explicit accounting costs. For example, inputs supplied by owners (including labor, capital, and space) are accounted for in determining costs in the definition used by an economist. These costs are sometimes referred to as implicit cost their value is imputed based on a notion of opportunity costs widely used by economists. In other words, costs of inputs supplied by an owner are based on the values these inputs would have received in the next best alternative activity. For illustration, assume that the owner of the firm works for ten hours a day at his business. If the owner does not receive any salary, an accountant would not consider the owner's effort as a cost item. An economist would, however, value the owner's service to his firm at what his labor would have earned had he worked elsewhere. Thus, to compute the true profit, an economist will subtract the implicit costs from business profit; the resulting profit is often referred to as economic profit. It is this concept of profit that is used by economists to explain the behavior of a firm. The concept of economic profit essentially recognizes that owner-supplied inputs must also be paid for. Thus, the owner of a firm will not be in business in the long run until he recovers the implicit costs (also known as normal profit), in addition to recovering the explicit costs, of doing business.
As pointed out earlier, a given firm attempts to maximize profits. Other firms do the same. Ultimately, profits decline for all firms. If all firms are operating under a competitive market structure, in equilibrium, economic profits (the excess of accounting profits over implicit costs) would be equal to zero; accounting profits (equal to explicit costs), however would be positive. When a firm makes profits above the normal profits level, it is said to be reaping above-normal profits.

HOW A FIRM ARRIVES AT A PROFIT-MAXIMIZING POINT.
Let us assume throughout the discussion that a firm uses an economist's definition of profits. Assume that profit is the excess of sales revenue over cost (now assumed to be composed of both explicit and implicit costs). It can also be assumed, as discussed above, that the profit maximization is the firm's primary goal. Given this objective, important questions remain: How does the firm decide on the output level that maximizes its profits? Should the firm continue to produce at all if it is not profitable?
A manufacturing firm, motivated by profit maximization, calculates the total cost of producing any given output level. The total cost is made up of total fixed cost (due to the expenditure on fixed inputs) and total variable cost (due to the expenditure on variable inputs). Of course, the total fixed cost does not vary over the short runnly the total variable cost does. It is important for the firm to also calculate the cost per unit of output, called the average cost. In addition to the average cost, the firm calculates the marginal cost. The marginal cost at any level of output is the increase in the total cost due to an increase in production by one unitssentially, the marginal cost is the additional cost of producing the last unit of output.
The average cost is made up of two components: the average fixed cost (the total fixed cost divided by the number of units of the output produced) and the average variable cost (the total variable cost divided by the number of units of the output produced). As the fixed costs remain fixed over the short run, the average fixed cost declines as the level of production increases. The average variable cost, on the other hand, first decreases and then increases; economists refer to this as the U-shaped nature of the average variable cost. The U-shape of the average variable cost curve is explained as follows. Given the fixed inputs, output of the relevant product increases more than proportionately as the levels of variable inputs used increase. This is caused by increased efficiency due to specialization and other reasons. As more and more variable inputs are used in conjunction with the given fixed inputs, however, efficiency gains reach a maximumhe decline in the average variable cost eventually comes to a halt. After this point, the average variable cost starts increasing as the level of production continues to increase, given the fixed inputs. First decreasing and then increasing average variable cost lead to the U-shape for the average variable cost. The combination of the declining average fixed cost (true for the entire range of production) and the U-shaped average variable cost results into an U-shaped behavior of the average total cost, often simply called the average cost.
The marginal cost also displays a U-shaped patternt first decreases and then increases. The logic for the shape of the marginal cost curve is similar to that for the average variable costoth relate to variable costs. But while the marginal cost refers to the increase in total variable cost due to an increase in the production by one unit, the average variable cost refers to the average variable cost per unit of output produced. It is important to notice, without going into finer details, that the marginal cost curve intersects the average and the average variable cost curves at their minimum cost points.
In a graphic rendering of this concept there would be a horizontal line, in addition to the three cost curves. It is assumed that the firm can sell as many units as it wants at the given market price indicated by this horizontal line. Essentially, the horizontal line is the demand curve a perfectly competitive firm faces in the markett can sell as many units of output as it deems profitable at price &quot;p&quot; per unit (p, for example, can be $10 per unit of the product under consideration). In other words, p is the firm's average revenue per unit of output. Since the firm receives p dollars for every successive unit it sells, p is also the marginal revenue for the firm.
A firm maximizes profits, in general, when its marginal revenue equals marginal cost. If the firm produces beyond this point of equality between the marginal revenue and marginal cost, the marginal cost will be higher than the marginal revenue. In other words, the addition to total production beyond the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, leads to lower, not higher, profits. While every firm's primary motive is to maximize profits, its output decision (consistent with the profit maximizing objective), depends on the structure of the market it is operating under. Before we discuss important market structures, we briefly examine another key economic concept, the theory of consumer behavior.
3.THE THEORY OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
Consumers play an important role in the economy since they spend most of their incomes on goods and services produced by firms. In other words, they consume what firms produce. Thus, studying the theory of consumer behavior is quite important. What is the ultimate objective of a consumer? Economists have an optimization model for consumers, similar to that applied to firms or producers. While firms are assumed to be maximizing profits, consumers are assumed to be maximizing their utility or satisfaction. Of course, more goods and services will, in general, provide greater utility to a consumer. Nevertheless, consumers, like firms, are subject to constraintsheir consumption and choices are limited by a number of factors, including the amount of disposable income (the residual income after income taxes are paid for). The decision to consume by consumers is described by economists within a theoretical framework usually termed the theory of demand.
The demand for a particular product by an individual consumer is based on four important factors. First, the price of the product determines how much of the product the consumer buys, given that all other factors remain unchanged. In general, the lower the product's price the more a consumer buys. Second, the consumer's income also determines how much of the product the consumer is able to buy, given that all other factors remain constant. In general, a consumer buys more of a commodity the greater is his or her income. Third, prices of related products are also important in determining the consumer's demand for the product. Finally, consumer tastes and preferences also affect consumer demand. The total of all consumer demands yields the market demand for a particular commodity; the market demand curve shows quantities of the commodity demanded at different prices, given all other factors. As price increases, quantity demanded falls.
Individual consumer demands thus provide the basis for the market demand for a product. The market demand plays a crucial role in shaping decisions made by firms. Most important of all, it helps in determining the market price of the product under consideration which, in turn, forms the basis for profits for the firm producing that product.
The amount supplied by an individual firm depends on profit and cost considerations. As mentioned earlier, in general, a producer produces the profit maximizing output. Again, the total of individual supplies yields the market supply for a particular commodity; the market supply curve shows quantities of the commodity supplied at different prices, given all other factors. As price increases, the quantity supplied increases.
The interaction between market demand and supply determines the equilibrium or market price (where demand equals supply). Shifts in demand curve and/or supply curve lead to changes in the equilibrium price. The market price and the price mechanism play a crucial role in the capitalist systemhey send signals both to producers and consumers.
4.THEORIES ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT MARKET STRUCTURES
As mentioned earlier, firms' profit maximizing output decisions take into account the market structure under which they are operating. There are four kinds of market organizations: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
PERFECT COMPETITION.
Perfect competition is the idealized version of the market structure that provides a foundation for understanding how markets work in a capitalist economy. Three conditions need to be satisfied before a market structure is considered perfectly competitive: homogeneity of the product sold in the industry, existence of many buyers and sellers, and perfect mobility of resources or factors of production. The first condition, the homogeneity of product, requires that the product sold by any one seller is identical with the product sold by any other supplierf products of different sellers are identical, buyers do not care from whom they buy so long as the price charged is also the same. The second condition, existence of many buyers and sellers, also leads to an important outcome: each individual buyer or seller is so small relative to the entire market that he or she does not have any power to influence the price of the product under consideration. Each individual simply decides how much to buy or sell at the given market price. The implication of the third condition is that resources move to the most profitable industry.
There is no industry in the world that can be considered perfectly competitive in the strictest sense of the term. However, there are token examples of industries that come quite close to having perfectly competitive markets. Some markets for agricultural commodities, while not meeting all three conditions, come reasonably close to being characterized as perfectly competitive markets. The market for wheat, for example, can be considered a reasonable approximation.
As pointed out earlier, in order to maximize profits, a supplier has to look at the cost and revenue sides; a perfectly competitive firm will stop production where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In the case of a perfectly competitive firm, the market price for the product is also the marginal revenue, as the firm can sell additional units at the going market price. This is not so for a monopolist. A monopolist must reduce price to increase sales. As a result, a monopolist's price is always above the marginal revenue. Thus, even though a monopolist firm also produces the profit maximizing output, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, it does not produce to the point where price equals marginal cost (as does a perfectly competitive firm).
Regarding entry and exit decisions; one can now state that additional firms would enter an industryhenever existing firms are making above normal profits (that is, when the horizontal line is above the average cost at the profit maximizing output). A firm would exit the market if at the profit maximizing point the horizontal line is below the average cost curve; it will actually shut down the production right away if the price is less than the average variable cost.
MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION.
Many industries that we often deal with have market structures that are characterized by monopolistic competition or oligopoly. Apparel retail stores (with many stores and differentiated products) provide an example of monopolistic competition. As in the case of perfect competition, monopolistic competition is characterized by the existence of many sellers. Usually if an industry has 50 or more firms (producing products that are close substitutes of each other), it is said to have a large number of firms. The sellers under monopolistic competition differentiate their product; unlike under perfect competition, the products are not considered identical. This characteristic is often called product differentiation. In addition, relative ease of entry into the industry is considered another important requirement of a monopolistically competitive market organization.
As in the case of perfect competition, a firm under monopolistic competition determines the quantity of the product to produce based on the profit maximization principlet stops production where marginal revenue equals marginal cost of production. There is, however, one very important difference between perfect competition and monopolistic competition. A firm under monopolistic competition has a bit of control over the price it charges, since the firm differentiates its products from those of others. The price associated with the product (at the equilibrium or profit maximizing output) is higher than marginal cost (which equals marginal revenue). Thus, production under monopolistic competition does not take place to the point where price equals marginal cost of production. The net result of the profit maximizing decisions of monopolistically competitive firms is that price charged under monopolistic competition is higher than under perfect competition, and the quantity produced is simultaneously lower.
OLIGOPOLY.
Oligopoly is a fairly common market organization. In the United States, both the steel and automobile industries (with three or so large firms) provide good examples of oligopolistic market structures. Probably the most important characteristic of an oligopolistic market structure is the interdependence of firms in the industry. The interdependence, actual or perceived, arises from the small number of firms in the industry. Unlike under monopolistic competition, however, if an oligopolistic firm changes its price or output, it has perceptible effects on the sales and profits of its competitors in the industry. Thus, an oligopolist always considers the reactions of its rivals in formulating its pricing or output decisions.
There are huge, though not insurmountable, barriers to entry to an oligopolistic market. These barriers can exist because of large financial requirements, availability of raw materials, access to the relevant technology, or simply existence of patent rights with the firms currently in the industry. Several industries in the United States provide good examples of oligopolistic market structures with obvious barriers to entry, such as the automobile industry, where significant financial barriers to entry exist.
An oligopolistic industry is also typically characterized by economies of scale. Economies of scale in production implies that as the level of production rises, the cost per unit of product falls from the use of any plant (generally, up to a point). Thus, economies of scale lead to an obvious advantage for a large producer.
There is no single theoretical framework that provides answers to output and pricing decisions under an oligopolistic market structure. Analyses exist only for special sets of circumstances. One of these circumstances refers to an oligopoly in which there are asymmetric reactions of its rivals when a particular oligopolist formulates policies. If an oligopolistic firm cuts its price, it is met with price reductions by competing firms; if it raises the price of its product, however, rivals do not match the price increase. For this reason, prices may remain stable in an oligopolistic industry for a prolonged period.
MONOPOLY.
Monopoly can be considered as the polar opposite of perfect competition. It is a market form in which there is only one seller. While, at first glance, a monopolistic form may appear to be rarely found market structure, several industries in the United States have monopolies. Local electricity companies provide an example of a monopolist.
There are many factors that give rise to a monopoly. Patents can give rise to a monopoly situation, as can ownership of critical raw materials (to produce a good) by a single firm. A monopoly, however, can also be legally created by a government agency when it sells a market franchise to sell a particular product or to provide a particular service. Often a monopoly so established is also regulated by the appropriate government agency. Provision of local telephone services in the United States provides an example of such a monopoly. Finally, a monopoly may arise due to declining cost of production for a particular product. In such a case the average cost of production keeps falling and reaches a minimum at an output level that is sufficient to satisfy the entire market. In such an industry, rival firms will be eliminated until only the strongest firm (now the monopolist) is left in the market. Such an industry is popularly dubbed as the case of a natural monopoly. A good example of a natural monopoly is the electricity industry, which reaps the benefits of economies of scale and yields decreasing average cost. Natural monopolies are usually regulated by the government.
Generally speaking, price and output decisions of a monopolist are similar to a monopolistically competitive firm, with the major distinction that there are a large number of firms under monopolistic competition and only one firm under monopoly. Nevertheless, at any output level, the price charged by a monopolist is higher than the marginal revenue. As a result, a monopolist also does not produce to the point where price equals marginal cost (a condition met under a perfectly competitive market structure).
MARKET STRUCTURES AND MANAGERIAL DECISIONS.
Managerial decisions both in the short run and in the long run are partly shaped by the market structure relevant to the firm. While the preceding discussion of market structures does not cover the full range of managerial decisions, it nevertheless suggests that managerial decisions are necessarily constrained by the market structure under which a firm operates.
TOOLS OF DECISION SCIENCES AND MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS
Managerial decision making uses both economic concepts and tools, and techniques of analysis provided by decision sciences. The major categories of these tools and techniques are: optimization, statistical estimation, forecasting, numerical analysis, and game theory. While most of these methodologies are fairly technical, the first three are briefly explained below to illustrate how tools of decision sciences are used in managerial decision making.
5.OPTIMIZATION.
Optimization techniques are probably the most crucial to managerial decision making. Given that alternative courses of action are available, the manager attempts to produce the most optimal decision, consistent with stated managerial objectives. Thus, an optimization problem can be stated as maximizing an objective (called the objective function by mathematicians) subject to specified constraints. In determining the output level consistent with the maximum profit, the firm maximizes profits, constrained by cost and capacity considerations. While a manager does not solve the optimization problem, he or she may use the results of mathematical analysis. In the profit maximization example, the profit maximizing condition requires that the firm choose the production level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This condition is obtained from an optimization exercise. Depending on the problem a manager is trying to solve, the conditions for the optimal decision may be different.
6.STATISTICAL ESTIMATION.
A number of statistical techniques are used to estimate economic variables of interest to a manager. In some cases, statistical estimation techniques employed are simple. In other cases, they are much more advanced. Thus, a manager may want to know the average price received by his competitors in the industry, as well as the standard deviation (a measure of variation across units) of the product price under consideration. In this case, the simple statistical concepts of mean (average) and standard deviation are used.
Estimating a relationship among variables requires a more advanced statistical technique. For example, a firm may want to estimate its cost function, the relationship between a cost concept and the level of output. A firm may also want to know the demand function of its product, that is, the relationship between the demand for its product and different factors that influence it. The estimates of costs and demand are usually based on data supplied by the firm. The statistical estimation technique employed is called regression analysis, and is used to develop a mathematical model showing how a set of variables are related. This mathematical relationship can also be used to generate forecasts.
An automobile industry example can be used for the purpose of illustrating the forecasting method that employs simple regression analysis. Suppose a statistician has data on sales of American-made automobiles in the United States for the last 25 years. He or she has also determined that the sale of automobiles is related to the real disposable income of individuals. The statistician also has available the time series (for the last 25 years) on real disposable income. Assume that the relationship between the time series on sales of American-made automobiles and the real disposable income of consumers is actually linear and it can thus be represented by a straight line. A fairly rigorous mathematical technique is used to find the straight line that most accurately represents the relationship between the time series on auto sales and disposable income.
7.FORECASTING.
Forecasting is a method or a technique used to predict many future aspects of a business or any other operation. While the term &quot;forecasting&quot; may appear to be rather technical, planning for the future is a critical aspect of managing any organizationusiness, nonprofit, or otherwise. In fact, the long-term success of any organization is closely tied to how well the management of the organization is able to foresee its future and develop appropriate strategies to deal with the likely future scenarios. 
There are many forecasting techniques available to the person assisting the business in planning its sales. For illustration, consider a forecasting method in which a statistician forecasting future values of a variable of business interestales, for example examines the cause-and-effect relationships of this variable with other relevant variables, such as the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumers' disposable incomes, the interest rate at which consumers can finance their excess spending through borrowing, and the state of the economy represented by the percentage of the labor force unemployed. Thus, this category of forecasting techniques uses past time series on many relevant variables to forecast the volume of sales in the future. Under this forecasting technique, a regression equation is estimated to generate future forecasts (based on the past relationship among variables).
Risk analysis:
 Various models are used to quantify risk and asymmetric information and to employ them in decision rules to manage risk. 
Production analysis: 
Microeconomic techniques are used to analyse production efficiency, optimum factor allocation, costs and economies of scale. They are also utilised to estimate the firm's cost function. 
Pricing analysis: 
Microeconomic techniques are employed to examine various pricing decisions. This involves transfer pricing, joint product pricing, price discrimination, price elasticity estimations and choice of the optimal pricing method. 
Capital budgeting:
 Investment theory is used to scrutinise a firm's capital purchasing decisions. 

FIRMS OBJECTIVES 
Objectives of Business means the purpose for which the business is established. It is generally believed that the main objective of business is ta make profit and avoid loss. We do admit that profit is a driving force in undertaking any business activity but it is not the sole objective of any business. In the words of Urwick “earning of profit cannot be objective of a business any more than eating is the objective of living” . A business which is hunting after profits and ignores other objectives will not be doing service to the community. We here classify the objectives of business under three heads and then examine them briefly (1) Economic objectives (2) Social objectives(3)Humanobjectives. 

I. Economic Objectives:
Business, as we know. is primarily an economic activity. The major economic objectives to be achieved by business are:. 

1.Profit Maximization
The primary objective of business is to produce and sell goods for profit, of course, through the satisfaction of human wants. A business which does not earn profit cannot stay in the market for a longer period. The income of enterprise, therefore, must exceed expenditure over a period of time. Profit is necessary for the enterprise to. insure its own survival, growth and expansion. In the Words of Petter F Rucker NThe problem of any business is not the maximization of profitbut the achievement of sufficient profit to cover the fisk of economic activities and thus to avoid /osses”. It i clear from the above definition that a business enterprise should work for reasonable profit which should cover its own future risk. If the profit is made by over-charging customers, indulging in malpractices such as hoarding, blackmarketing, smuggling, etc, it will be against the ethics of business. It will be regarded robbery and not a business activity.
Profit maximization is the process of obtaining the highest possible level of profit through the production and sale of goods and services. This is the guiding principle underlying the analysis of short-run production by a firm. In particular, economic analysis is assumed that firms undertake actions and make the decisions that increase profit.
Profit is the difference between the total revenue a firm receives from selling output and the total cost of producing that output. Profit-maximization means that a firm seeks the production level that generates the greatest difference between total revenue and total cost. 
Alternative Aims of Firms
Profit Satisficing.
• In many firms there is separation of ownership and control. Those who own the company (shareholders) often do not get involved in the day to day running of the company. 

• This is a problem because although the owners may want to maximise profits. The managers have much less incentive to max profits because they do not get the same rewards (share dividends)

• Therefore managers may create a minimum level of profit to keep the shareholders happy but then max other objectives such as enjoying work, getting on with other workers (not sacking them)Problem of separation between ownership and manager. This can be overcome, to some extent, by giving mangers share options and performance related pay although in some industries it is difficult to measure performance

2. Creating Markets 
Every business tries to create customers for its products and services. The more the customers are treated, the wider will be the market for the goods and larger the profit.

3. Technological Improvements 
The business, if it is to stay in, the market, must offset stagnation by using efficient methods of production. The creation of new products, new designs and application of new techniques of production contributes to growth, change and expansion in the economy. 
4. Sales Maximisation.
Firms often seek to increase their market share even if it means less profit this could occur for various reasons:
a) Increased market share increases monopoly power and may enable to put up prices and make more profit in the long run.

b) Managers prefer to work for bigger companies as it leads to greater prestige and higher salaries

c) Increasing market share may force rivals out of business. E.g. supermarkets have lead to the demise of many local shops. Some firms may actually engage in predatory pricing which involves making a loss to force a rival out of business
5. Growth Maximisation. 
This is similar to sales maximisation and may involve mergers and takeovers.
6. Long Run Profit Maximisation

II.Pursuit of Personal Welfare
The people who make decisions for a business are, in fact, people. They have likes and dislikes. They have personal goals and aspirations just like people who do not make decisions for firms. On occasion these people use the firm to pursue their own personal welfare. When they do, their actions could enhance the firm's profit maximization or, in many cases, prevent profit maximization.
How about a few examples? Once again, consider William J. Wackowski, the president of The Wacky Willy Company. Perhaps Willy enjoys the finer things in life--a large house, fancy cars, and expensive vacations--which require a hefty income. As the primary stockholder of The Wacky Willy Company, when the business maximizes profit, then William J. Wackowski benefits with more income. In this case, the pursuit of personal welfare coincides with profit maximization.
Alternatively, suppose that the Mr. Wackowski hates the color purple. He simply refuse to produce ANY purple Stuffed Amigos. However, market studies clearly indicate that buyers want purple Stuffed Amigos. Moreover, the purple fabric that would be used to produce purple Stuffed Amigos is significantly less expensive than other colors. Mr. Willy clearly is wacky in this case. His purple-phobia prevents profit maximization.
William the Wackster might also decide to enhance his corporate lifestyle at the expense of corporate profit. He could, for example, give himself a bigger, more luxurious (but unneeded) office, a higher (but unneeded) salary, a company jet (also unneeded), season tickets to Shady Valley Primadonnas baseball team (clearly unneeded) and other (unneeded) amenities that are NOT needed to profitably produce Stuffed Amigos. These improve William's personal welfare, but at the expense of corporate profit.

III. Social Objectives: 
Pursuit of Social Welfare
The people who make decisions for firms also have social consciences. Part of their likes and dislikes might be related to the overall state of society. As such, they might use the firm to pursue social welfare, which could enhance or prevent the firm's profit maximization.
How might William J. Wackowski's pursuit of social welfare enhance or prevent profit maximization of The Wacky Willy Company? Suppose that William wants a cleaner environment. As such, he might implement more costly environmentally &quot;friendly&quot; production techniques and materials. He does his part to &quot;clean the environment,&quot; but at the expense of company profit.
Then again, Mr. Wackowski might feel that government environmental quality regulations restrict capital investment and economic growth. As such, William might have The Wacky Willy Company use part of its advertising budget to promote this view point. He might even use company revenue to set up the Wackowski Foundation for Policy Studies that is both a scientific think tank and a special interest lobbying organization with the goal of reducing environmental quality regulations.
While the pursuit of social welfare is likely to reduce company profit, it could have the opposite effect as well. Such activities could give The Wacky Willy Company a likeable public image that motivates people to buy more Stuffed Amigos than they would otherwise. In fact, some firms use the pursuit of social welfare as one aspect of their overall advertising efforts. They enhance their public image at the same time they do something &quot;good&quot; for society.
The social objectives of business are gaining more and more recognition with each passing year. The main social objectives of business are as follows:- 
 (i) Supplying desired goods at reasonable prices: 
Business is expected to supply the goods and services required by the society. Goods and services should be of good quality and these should be supplied at reasonable prices. It is also the social obligation of business to avoid malpractices like boarding, Black marketing and misleading advertising.

(ii) Fair Remuneration to employees:
Employees must be given fair compensation for their work. In addition to wages and salary a reasonable part of profits should be distrib¬uted among employees in recognition of their contributions. Such sharing of profits will help to increase the motivation and efficiency of employees.It is the obligation of business to provide healthy and safe work environment for employees. Good working conditions are beneficial to the organisation because these help to improve the produc¬tivity of employees and thereby the profits of business.
Employees work day and night to ensure smooth functioning of business. It is, therefore, the duty of employers to pro¬vide hygienic working and living conditions for workers.
 (iv) Fair return to investor: 
Business is expected to pay fair return to shareholders and creditors in the form of dividend and interest. Investors also expect safety and apprecia¬tions of their investment. They should be kept informed about the financial health and future prospects of business.

(v) Social welfare: 
Business should provide support to social, cultural and religious organisations. Business enterprises can build schools, colleges, libraries, dharam shalas, hospitals, sports bodies and research institutions. They can help non-government organisations (NGOs) like CRY, Help Age, and others which render services to weaker sections of society.

(vi) Payment of Government Dues:
Every business enterprise should pay tax dues (income tax, sales tax, excise duty, customs duty, etc.) to the government honestly and at the right time. These direct and indirect taxes provide revenue to the Government for spending on public welfare.Business should also abide faithfully by the laws of the country. Thus, businessmen should pursue those policies and take those actions which are desir¬able in terms of the objectives and values of our society.

(vii) Supply of standard quality of goods 
One of the social responsibilities of business is to produce goods of standard quality. If the enterprise is producinginferior, substandard and adulterated goods, it will be doing disservice to the society.

(viii) Avoidance of anti-social practices 
It is not fair on the part of a business to indulge in anti-social practices such as hoarding, black marketing, smuggling, overcharginq etc., to earn profit. A reasonable profit on a legitimate business is regarded a healthy sign and considered hi/al from Islamic point of view also.

(ix) Provision of more employment.  
Business provides employment to the people. It thus helps in increasing the standard of living of the members of the society. 

(x) Cooperation with the government 
The business community should adopt a positive approach towards the policies of the government of the country. They should pay all taxes and dues in time to the gqvernment. All business activity should be carried within the legal frame work of the country.

(xi) Use of national resources 
The business should use the national resources in the best interest of the country. Wastage should be reduced to the maximum. The motto should be more and more goods for more and more people at lower and lower prices. 


IV. Human Objectives:
The business’activity is carried on by the people (entrepreneurs) through the people (employees) and for the people (customers). Human factor is thus an important element in business. A business which overlooks the human factor cannot prosper and ultimately suffers losses. The human objectives of business are that (1) the employees working in a business should be fairly rewarded (2) A healthy climate is created by providing opportunities to the employers for deve new skills and abilities (3) The employees should have say in the affairs which directiy affect them. (4) thinking of modern business must go well beyond material benefits of its employees. It must reduce unpleasantness of work and plan forjob satisfaction to the workths. 

i.Labour welfare: 
Business must recognise the dignity of labour and human factor should be given due recognition. Proper opportunities should be provided for utilising indi¬vidual talents and satisfying aspirations of workers. Adequate provisions should be made for their health, safety and social security. Business should ensure job satisfaction and sense of belonging to workers.

ii. Developing human resources: 
Employees must be provided the opportunities for devel¬oping new skills and attitudes. Human resources are the most valuable asset of business and their development will help in the growth of business.Business can facilitate self- development of workers by encouraging creativity and innovation among them. Devel¬opment of skilled manpower is necessary for the economic development of the country.

iii. Participative management: 
Employees should be allowed to take part in decision mak¬ing process of business. This will help in the development of employees. Such participa¬tion will also provide valuable information to management for improving the quality of decisions. Workers' participation in management will usher in industrial democracy.

iv. Labour management cooperation: 
Business should strive for creating and maintaining cordial employer employee relations so as to ensure peace and progress in industry. Employees should be treated as honourable individuals and should be kept informed.

V. National Objectives
Every business whether operating on small or large scale must have an obligation towards nation also. It should help in achieving national goals such as promoting social justice, increasing valued added goods for exports, finding out better and cheaper substitutes for imports and helping in increasing exports for building the foreign exchange reserves to meet the import bills
 (i) Optimum utilisation of resources: 
Business should use the nation's resources in the best possible manner. Judicious allocation and optimum utilisation of scarce resources is essential for rapid and balanced economic growth of the country.Business should pro¬duce goods in accordance with national priorities and interests. It should minimise the wastage of scarce natural resources.

(ii) National self-reliance: 
It is the duty of business to help the government in increasing experts and in reducing dependence on imports. This will help a country to achieve economic independence. This requires development of new technology and its applica-tion in industry.

(iii) Development of small scale Industries: 
Big business firms are expected to encourage growth of small scale industries which are necessary for generating employment. Small scale firms can be developed as ancillaries, which provide inputs to large scale industries.

(iv) Development of backward areas: 
Business is expected to give preference to the industrialisation of backward regions of the country. Balanced regional development is necessary for peace and progress in the country.
It will also help to raise standard of living in backward areas. Government offers special incentives to the businessmen who set up factories in notified backward areas.


SOME OF THE MORE COMMON PRICING OBJECTIVES ARE:
•	maximize long-run profit
•	maximize short-run profit
•	increase sales volume (quantity)
•	increase monetary sales
•	increase market share
•	obtain a target rate of return on investment (ROI)
•	obtain a target rate of return on sales
•	stabilize market or stabilize market price: an objective to stabilize price means that the marketing manager attempts to keep prices stable in the marketplace and to compete on non-price considerations. Stabilization of margin is basically a cost-plus approach in which the manager attempts to maintain the same margin regardless of changes in cost.
•	company growth
•	maintain price leadership
•	desensitize customers to price
•	discourage new entrants into the industry
•	match competitors prices
•	encourage the exit of marginal firms from the industry
•	survival
•	avoid government investigation or intervention
•	obtain or maintain the loyalty and enthusiasm of distributors and other sales personnel
•	enhance the image of the firm, brand, or product
•	be perceived as “fair” by customers and potential customers
•	create interest and excitement about a product
•	discourage competitors from cutting prices
•	use price to make the product “visible&quot;
•	help prepare for the sale of the business (harvesting)
•	social, ethical, or ideological objectives

 ROLE OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMIST.
A managerial economist helps the management by using his analytical skills and highly developed techniques in solving complex issues of successful decision-making and future advanced planning.
Mangerial economics holds that the goal of the firm is to maximize the owners' wealth. 
Managerial Economics is a part of the study of economics that applies decision science theory, quantifying the concepts learned in microeconomics, or the study of the firm. The study of economics holds that all companies are in the business to maximize the wealth of its owners. Applying this goal requires quantitative methods or measurable objectives, to maximize owner wealth. 
1.	Maximize Efficient Use of Labor
o	In managerial economics, the concept of comparative advantage is used to maximize the output of employees. For example, in a hairstyling salon, Marissa and Joan both work as assistants to the stylists. Their duties are to shampoo clients, clean stylists' work areas, and to answer the telephone. If Marissa takes three minutes to shampoo a client, but in that time she could have cleaned two work areas, or taken three phone calls, Joan should perform the shampooing to allow Marissa to be efficient on cleaning work areas and taking phone calls.
Optimize Price and Output
o	In a purely competitive firm (assuming many sellers and buyers in the industry), managerial analysis holds that a company should set its price where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Marginal revenue is the amount of money earned on the last product sold. Similarly, marginal cost is amount of money spent on the last product made. While marginal revenue often stays static, marginal cost tends to increase. This is due to wear and tear on machinery, reduced productivity of the employees and other inputs. This is the law of diminishing returns. For example, if a t-shirt manufacturer sells each t-shirt for $10, this amount is also the marginal revenue. As marginal costs increase, the t-shirt manufacturer should sell t-shirts as long as the marginal costs are less than or equal to $10.
Minimize Uncertainty
o	In managerial economics, uncertainty is always an unknown input. In our salon example above, the hairstylist may not know how many haircuts she will do in the next month. She reduces her uncertainty by requesting that clients make an appointment for their next haircut to ensure they get the desired time slot. Other companies may reduce uncertainty by offering discounts if a client signs a long-term contract.
Minimize Opportunity Costs
o	Opportunity costs refer to the sacrifice made when one option is chosen over another. In a firm, the goal is to ensure that the foregone revenue is always less than the chosen option. If a t-shirt manufacturer could use the same machinery to produce jogging shorts that would sell for $7 each, his opportunity cost is $7 per t-shirt. The two objectives of reducing uncertainty and minimizing opportunity cost may sometimes seem to be in conflict with each other, but when uncertainty cannot be quantified, it is often preferable to take the less profitable, more certain option.
THE ROLE OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMIST CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:
1.	He studies the economic patterns at macro-level and analysis it’s significance to the specific firm he is working in. 
2.	He has to consistently examine the probabilities of transforming an ever-changing economic environment into profitable business avenues. 
3.	He assists the business planning process of a firm. 
4.	He also carries cost-benefit analysis. 
5.	He assists the management in the decisions pertaining to internal functioning of a firm such as changes in price, investment plans, type of goods /services to be produced, inputs to be used, techniques of production to be employed, expansion/ contraction of firm, allocation of capital, location of new plants, quantity of output to be produced, replacement of plant equipment, sales forecasting, inventory forecasting, etc. 
6.	In addition, a managerial economist has to analyze changes in macro- economic indicators such as national income, population, business cycles, and their possible effect on the firm’s functioning. 
7.	He is also involved in advicing the management on public relations, foreign exchange, and trade. He guides the firm on the likely impact of changes in monetary and fiscal policy on the firm’s functioning. 
8.	He also makes an economic analysis of the firms in competition. He has to collect economic data and examine all crucial information about the environment in which the firm operates. 
9.	The most significant function of a managerial economist is to conduct a detailed research on industrial market. 
10.	In order to perform all these roles, a managerial economist has to conduct an elaborate statistical analysis. 
11.	He must be vigilant and must have ability to cope up with the pressures. 
12.	He also provides management with economic information such as tax rates, competitor’s price and product, etc. They give their valuable advice to government authorities as well. 
13.	At times, a managerial economist has to prepare speeches for top management. 
WHY MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW ECONOMICS 
The contribution of economics towards the performance of managerial duties and responsibilities is of prime importance. The contribution and importance of economics to the managerial profession is akin to the contribution of biology to the medical profession and physics to engineering. It has been observed that managers equipped with a working knowledge of economics surpass their otherwise equally qualified peers, who lack knowledge of economics. Managers are responsible for achieving the objective of the firm to the maximum possible extent with the limited resources placed at their disposal. It is important to note that maximisation of objective has to be achieved by utilising limited resources. In the event of resources being unlimited, like air or sunshine, the problem of economic utilisation of resources or resource management would not have arisen. Resources like finance, workforce and material are limited. However, in the absence of unlimited resources, it is the responsibility of the management to optimise the use of these resources. 
HOW ECONOMICS CONTRIBUTES TO MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS 
Though economics is variously defined, it is essentially the study of logic, tools and techniques, to make optimum use of the available resources to achieve the given ends. Economics affords analytical tools and techniques that managers require to accomplish the goals of the organisation they manage. Therefore, a working knowledge of economics, not necessarily a formal degree, is indispensable for managers. Managers are fundamentally practicing economists. 
While executing his duties, a manager has to take several decisions, which conform to the objectives of the firm. Many business decisions fall prey to conditions of uncertainty and risk. Uncertainty and risk arise chiefly due to volatile market forces, changing business environment, emerging competitors with highly competitive products, government policy, external influences on the domestic market and social and political changes in the country. The intricacy of the modern business world weaves complexity in to the decision making process of a business. However, the degree of uncertainty and risk can be greatly condensed if market conditions are calculated with a high degree of reliability. Envisaging a business environment in the future does not suffice. Appropriate business decisions and formulation of a business strategy in conformity with the goals of the firm hold similar importance. 
Pertinent business decisions require an unambiguous understanding of the technical and environmental conditions under which business decisions are taken. Application of economic theories to explain and analyse technical conditions and business environment, contributes greatly to the rational decision-making process. Economic theories have many pronged applications in the analysis of practical problems of business. Keeping in view the escalating complexity of business environment, the efficacy of economic theory as a tool of analysis and its contribution to the process of decision-making has been widely recognised. 
 CONTRIBUTIONS OF ECONOMIC THEORY TO BUSINESS ECONOMICS 
According to Baumol, there are three main contributions of economic theory to business economics. 
1. The practice of building analytical models, which assist in recognising the structure of 
managerial problems and eliminating minor details, which might obstruct decision-making has been derived from economic theory. Analytical models help in eradicating peripheral problems and help the management in retaining focus on core issues. 
2. Economic theory comprises a founding pillar of business analysis-‘a set of analytical methods’, which may not be applied directly to specific business problems, but they do enhance the analytical capabilities of the business analyst. 
3. Economic theories offer an unequivocal perspective on the various concepts used in business analysis, which enables the manager to swerve from conceptual pitfalls. 
IMPORTANCE OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS 
Business and industrial enterprises aim at earning maximum proceeds. In order to achieve this objective, a managerial executive has to take recourse in decision-making, which is the process of selecting a specified course of action from a number of alternatives. A sound decision requires fair knowledge of the aspects of economic theory and the tools of economic analysis, which are directly involved in the process of decision-making. Since managerial economics is concerned with such aspects and tools of analysis, it is pertinent to the decision-making process. 
Spencer and Siegelman have described the importance of managerial economics in a business and industrial enterprise as follows: 
1. Accommodating traditional theoretical concepts to the actual business behaviour and conditions: Managerial economics amalgamates tools, techniques, models and theories of traditional economics with actual business practices and with the environment in which a firm has to operate. According to Edwin Mansfield, “Managerial Economics attempts to bridge the gap between purely analytical problems that intrigue many economic theories and the problems of policies that management must face”. 
2. Estimating economic relationships: Managerial economics estimates economic relationships between different business factors such as income, elasticity of demand, cost volume, profit analysis etc. 
3. Predicting relevant economic quantities: Managerial economics assists the management in predicting various economic quantities such as cost, profit, demand, capital, production, price etc. As a business manager has to function in an environment of uncertainty, it is imperative to anticipate the future working environment in terms of the said quantities. 
4. Understanding significant external forces: The management has to identify all the important factors that influence a firm. These factors can broadly be divided into two categories. Managerial economics plays an important role by assisting management in understanding these factors. 
• External factors: A firm cannot exercise any control over these factors. The plans, policies and programmes of the firm should be formulated in the light of these factors. Significant external factors impinging on the decision-making process of a firm are economic system of the country, business cycles, fluctuations in national income and national production, industrial policy of the government, trade and fiscal policy of the government, taxation policy, licensing policy, trends in foreign trade of the country, general industrial relation in the country and so on. 
• Internal factors: These factors fall under the control of a firm. These factors are associated with business operation. Knowledge of these factors aids the management in making sound business decisions. 
5. Basis of business policies: Managerial economics is the founding principle of business policies. Business policies are prepared based on studies and findings of managerial economics, which cautions the management against potential upheavals in national as well as international economy. 
Thus, managerial economics is helpful to the management in its decision-making process. 
 APPLICATION OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS 
Tools of managerial economics can be used to achieve virtually all the goals of a business organisation in an efficient manner. Typical managerial decision-making may involve one of the following issues: 
• Decisions pertaining to the price of a product and the quantity of the commodity to be produced 
• Decisions regarding manufacturing product/part/component or outsourcing to/purchasing from   another manufacturer 
• Choosing the production technique to be employed in the production of a given product 
• Decisions relating to the level of inventory of a product or raw material a firm will maintain 
• Decisions regarding the medium of advertising and the intensity of the advertising campaign 
• Decisions pertinent to employment and training 
• Decisions regarding further business investment and the modes of financing the investment 
It should be noted that the application of managerial economics is not restricted to profit-seeking business organisations. Tools of managerial economics can be applied equally well to decision problems of nonprofit organisations. Mark Hirschey and James L. Pappas cite the example of a nonprofit hospital making use of the managerial economics techniques for optimisation of resource use. While a nonprofit hospital is not like a typical firm seeking to maximise its profits, a hospital does strive to provide its patients the best medical care possible given its limited staff (doctors, nurses and support staff), equipment, space and other resources. The hospital administrator can employ concepts and tools of managerial economics to determine the optimal allocation of the limited resources available to the hospital. In addition to nonprofit business organisations, government agencies and other nonprofit organisations (such as cooperatives, schools and museums) can exploit the techniques of managerial decision making to achieve goals in the most efficient manner. 
While managerial economics aids in making optimal decisions, one should be aware that it only describes the predictable economic consequences of a managerial decision. For example, tools of managerial economics can explain the effects of imposing automobile import quotas on the availability of domestic cars, prices charged for automobiles and the extent of competition in the auto industry. Analysis of managerial economics reveals that fewer cars will be available, prices of automobiles will increase and the extent of competition will be reduced. However, managerial economics does not address whether imposing automobile import quotas is a good government policy. 
TOOLS OF DECISION SCIENCE AND MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS 
Managerial decision-making draws on economic concepts as well as tools and techniques of analysis provided by decision sciences. The major categories of these tools and techniques are optimisation, statistical estimation, forecasting, numerical analysis and game theory. Most of these methodologies are technical. The first three are briefly explained below to illustrate how tools of decision sciences are used in managerial decision-making. 
Optimisation:
 Optimisation techniques are probably the most crucial to managerial decision making. Given that alternative courses of action are available, the manager attempts to produce the most optimal decision, consistent with stated managerial objectives. Thus, an optimisation problem can be stated as maximising an objective (called the objective function by mathematicians) subject to specified constraints. In determining the output level consistent with the maximum profit, the firm maximises profits, constrained by cost and capacity considerations. While a manager does not resolve the optimisation problem, he or she may make use of the results of mathematical analysis. In the profit maximisation example, the profit maximising condition requires that the firm select the production level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This condition is obtained from an optimisation model/technique. The techniques of optimisation employed depend on the problem a manager is trying to solve. 
Statistical estimation: 
A number of statistical techniques are used to estimate economic variables of interest to a manager. In some cases, statistical estimation techniques employed are simple. In other cases, they are much more complex and advanced. Thus, a manager may want to know the average price received by his competitors in the industry, as well as the standard deviation (a measure of variation across units) of the product price under consideration. In this case, the simple statistical concepts of mean (average) and standard deviation are used. 
Estimating a relationship among variables requires a more advanced statistical technique. For example, a firm may desire to estimate its cost function i.e. the relationship between cost concept and the level of output. A firm may also wish to the demand function of its product that is the relationship between the demand for its product and factors that influence it. The estimates of costs and demand are usually based on data supplied by the firm. The statistical estimation technique employed is called regression analysis and is used to engender a mathematical model showing how a set of variables are related. This mathematical relationship can also be used to generate forecasts. 
An example from the automobile industry is befitting for illustrating the forecasting method that employs simple regression analysis. Let us assume that a statistician has data on sales of American-made automobiles in the United States for the last 25 years. He or she has also determined that the sale of automobiles is related to the real disposable income of individuals. The statistician also has available the time series data (for the last 25 years) on real disposable income. Assume that the relationship between the time series on sales of American-made automobiles and the real disposable income of consumers is actually linear and it can thus be represented by a straight line. A rigorous mathematical technique is used to locate the straight line that most accurately represents the relationship between the time series on auto sales and disposable income. 
Forecasting:
 It is a method or a technique to predict many future aspects of a business or any other operation. For example, a retailing firm that has been in business for the last 25 years may be interested in forecasting the likely sales volume for the coming year. Numerous forecasting techniques can be used to accomplish this goal. A forecasting technique, for example, can provide such a projection based on the experience of the firm during the last 25 years; that is, this forecasting technique bases the future forecast on the past data. 
While the term 'forecasting' may appear technical, planning for the future is a critical aspect of managing any organisation or a business. The long-term success of any organisation has close association with the propensity of the management of the organisation to foresee its future and develop appropriate strategies to deal with the likely future scenarios. Intuition, good judgment and knowledge of economic conditions enables the manager to 'feel' or perhaps anticipate the likelihood in the future. It is not easy, however, to metamorphose a feeling about the future outcome into concrete data for instance, as a projection for next year's sales volume. Forecasting methods can help predict many future aspects of a business operation, such as forthcoming years' sales volume projections. 
Suppose a forecast expert has been asked to provide quarterly estimates of the sales volume for a particular product for the next four quarters. How should he attempt at preparing the quarterly sales volume forecasts? Reviewing the actual sales data for the product in question for past periods will give a good start. Suppose that the forecaster has access to actual sales data for each quarter during the 25-year period the firm has been in business. Employing this historical data, the forecaster can identify the general trend of sales. He or she can also determine whether there is a pattern or trend, such as an increase or decrease in sales volume over time. An in depth review of the data may unearth some type of seasonal pattern, such as, peak sales occurring around the holiday season. Thus, by reviewing historical data, there is a high probability that the forecaster develops a good understanding of the pattern of sales in the past periods. Understanding such patterns can result in better forecasts of future sales of the product. In addition, if the forecaster is able to identify the factors that influence sales, historical data on these factors (variables) can also be used to generate forecasts of future sales. 
There are many forecasting techniques available to the person assisting the business in planning its sales. Take for example a forecasting method in which a statistician forecasting future values of a variable of business interest—sales, for example, examines the cause-and-effect relationships of this variable with other relevant variables. The other pertinent variable may be the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumers' disposable incomes, the interest rate at which consumers can finance their excess spending through borrowing and the state of the economy represented by the percentage of the labour force unemployed. This category of forecasting technique utilises time series data on many relevant variables to forecast the volume of sales in the future. Under this forecasting technique, a regression equation is estimated to generate future forecasts (based on the past relationship among variables). 
==Definitions==
An '''economy''' consists of a set of people or individuals and their environment. Each individual in an economy has an '''economic problem'''.

An '''economic problem''' arises because each individual has unique desires (defined as experiences he or she would like to have) and a limited set of assets (consisting of human capital, possessions, and time). This limitation prevents the individual from ever satisfying all his desires and dictates his behavior.

'''Human Capital''' includes physical attributes, mental capabilities, skill, personality, associates (people she knows or know her), creativity, influence, and a philosophy of life.

'''Possessions''' are the physical objects the individual posses or, more properly, has a claim on.

'''Time''' is limited to 24 hours each day for the remainder of an individual's life.

==Economics== 
The economic problem we face forces us to ''economize'', that is, to decide which desires to satisfy and which ones to leave unsatisfied. This behavior is both economically rational and the rationale behind economics.

It is important to note that the process of economizing occurs entirely in the context of uncertainty because the consequences of our actions happen in the future (of which we know nothing), and our decisions are made while being unaware of all things which exist in the present. 

'''Economics''' then is the study of the consequences of economizing in the context of uncertainty. 
Economics is relevant as an internal model against which we can compare our present situation and make better decisions about our behavior. It does not give a set of tools to use, but rather an understanding of the world in which we live.

Blender's user interface is very flexible and often provides more than one way to do something.  Many operations that can be done by clicking on buttons and menus can also be done with keyboard shortcuts called &quot;hotkeys&quot;.  The hotkey is usually much faster than the corresponding mouse action, so it's a good idea to learn them as soon as possible.

An entire WikiBook (titled ''[[Blender 3D: HotKeys]]'') is devoted to Blender hotkeys.  We encourage you to refer to it as often as necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you arrive at your house, there will probably already be a set docket of bills that you will be debating.

The Parliamentarian (Parli) or Points Recorder (PR) asks for all representatives (or senators) that wish to run for Presiding Officer (PO).

Each PO candidate will then have a trial time of x amount of minutes (set by the Parli/PR).  The first PO candidate takes the chair, and then the floor is opened up for motions.  When a PO candidate takes the chair, it is customary for them to introduce themselves and establish the time signals that they will be using.

PO candidates will all have tryouts during the regular cycle of debate.  When all candidates have had their turn, the house will vote a PO in, and that PO will take over for the remainder of the congress.

At this point a few motions might be made, these include:
* Suspending the rules (motions allowed under this category vary by region)
** Direct Questioning (allows speakers to call on people asking questions instead of the PO)
** Open Chambers (Eliminates usage of the motion &quot;Rise to a point of personal privilege&quot;)
* Main Motion (begin debate)

After Main motion is called and seconded, the vote will most likely be unanimous.

From here, debate proceeds into the docket of bills and/or resolutions.

The PO will say something similar to this:
 We will now proceed to &quot;A Bill Concerning the Issue&quot;  If there are no objections, I will not read this bill. (brief pause)
 Seeing no objections, is there a speech in authorship?

(TODO) add details of authorship/sponsorship vs. affirmative speech

If there is no Authorship speech, then PO asks if there is a Sponsorship speech, and then a First Affirmative speech.

After the first speech (authorship/sponsorship/first affirmation), then the PO calls for a speech in Negation.

After the negation speech, the PO asks if there are any motions.

Debate then falls into a loop that is similar to this pattern:
* Aff Speech
* Neg Speech
* Motions

This loop is followed until previous question is passed, or the bill is tabled.

Debate on other bills follows the same pattern as above.

At the end of the day, the PR and Parli will have a list of nominated members that the chamber ranks in order.

This ranking is combined with rankings by the PR and Parli to determine placing.

== Different Methods ==
Before we start, let's discuss the different methods of making this box. There are a couple different ways of putting it together:

*The Puzzle Piece Method (Recommended for this Tutorial): Make the separate lines (the x, y, and z axis) and put them together like a puzzle using copy and paste to duplicate the lines. Good for uniformity and if you aren't making different length of your lines. 
*The Line by Line Method: Create each line individually. Good if you don't like using copy and paste or if your shape is not uniform (like a person or animal) but is extremely easy to mess up. 
*(Not Recommended for this Tutorial)Pixel by Pixel Method: Pros: Makes for really good quality pictures with unparallel uniformity, if done right. Cons: Takes a extremely LONG TIME.  

== Math? IN ART? ==
That's right! We are going to do a quickly lesson in geometry. For your pixel line lengths, I suggest them being multiples of each other (ex: 2 x 2 = 4; 2 x 3 = 6). This makes it look more like a real cube. Also, we must remember that the lines must be of equal length for it to be a real cube. Isometric lengths make this really hard to do, because each axis has a different scale (ex: The X axis (up and down)compared to the Y axis (left to right)are equal, but they are both different from the Z axis (forward and backward)). Eyeball it and find out what looks right to you. 

*The &quot;Golden Rule&quot; of Isometric Pixel Art is that for every 2 pixels in the Z axis (front to back) there is one pixel for the X or Y axis (up and down, left and right). Although this may not always work for every single thing you draw isometrically, it is the general rule so remember it!

== Let's Begin! ==


[[File:Ispa_b_0.jpg|left|frame|I highly suggest drawing the X axis and Z axis first. Make one corner like this.]]
[[File:Ispa_b_1.jpg|left|frame|Then flip that vertically, to make this.  Mind the corner- it should be three pixels wide, as opposed to two like the rest of the box!]]
[[File:Ispa_b_2.jpg|frame|left|Duplicate what you have and move it down the X axis a bit]]
[[File:Ispa_b_3.jpg|frame|left|Now connect]]
[[File:Ispa_b_4.jpg|frame|left|Erase a few lines and fill in different shades for a nice, completed box]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;



Congratulations! You've just made your first isometric drawing!

==Is pixel art out-dated?==
Technology is used to create art, but once art exists, it transcends technology. Pixel art exists as a technique, and it remains infinite in potential. Pixel art is not replaced by any other newer art forms but rather exists alongside them and offers unique stylistic properties. It also allows for distinct individual artists' styles.Well-loved video game art from the pixel art era will remain celebrated and rediscovered indefinitely.In addition, with the rise in popularity of mobile phone games, pixel art has resumed its practical status. Thriving enthusiast and hobbyist communities also exist online.

==Do I have to buy a special program?==
By all means, NO! Do not go out and buy a program just for this Wikibook. Most Operating Systems come with a pixel-based art program and it is easy to obtain one for free if you do not have one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Multiple Document Interface''' (MDI) applications are a very common and popular type of application. MDI applications allow a single program window to contain multiple open workspaces simultaneously. Creating them isn't particularly tricky, and this chapter will attempt to explain the process in detail.

== Steps to Making an MDI ==

These are the steps to making an MDI application. We will explain each of them.

#Register the Frame and Child window classes.
#Modify the message loop.
#Create the frame window.
#Create the MDI Client
#Create MDI child windows with the client.

== Register the Window Classes ==

Like any other windows application, we need to register the window classes. The main window (the frame, or the &quot;parent&quot; window) needs to be created. Frame windows are just like any other window, but they generally have a background color of COLOR_APPWORKSPACE. Also, the child windows in an MDI application are not allowed to have their own menus, so the Frame window must manage the application menu. Remember, that different child windows usually require different menu choices (or different menus all together), so the Frame window needs to maintain a current record of the active child window, and set the menu accordingly.

The child window class (all of them) needs to be created with WS_CHILD class. An MDI application may have any number of different types of child windows (a famous example is the use of spreadsheets and charts in Microsoft Excel), and they all need to be registered before use.

== Modify the Message Loop ==

MDI applications use an almost-normal message loop, but if you want to use accelerators in your program, you need to add a new step:

 while(GetMessage(&amp;msg, hwndFrame, 0, 0))
 {
    if(!TranslateMDISysAccel(hwndClient, &amp;msg) &amp;&amp;
       !TranslateAccelerator(hwndFrame, hAccel, &amp;msg))
    {
        TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
        DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
    }
 }

This way the accelerators get routed to the correct destination among all the different child windows. If you are not using accelerators, you don't need to worry about this step.

== The Frame Window ==

Frame Windows get created like any other windows. Remember, however, that frame windows are just a backdrop for the action that is happening in the child windows, so you shouldn't get to crazy or fancy with your background artwork.

== The Client Window ==

You need to create a window of type &quot;MDICLIENT&quot;. MDICLIENT windows are defined internally in Windows, so you don't need to worry about what it is or what it does. When you create an MDI client window, you first need to fill out the fields in the CLIENTCREATESTRUCT structure. You pass a pointer to this structure as the LPARAM data field in the CreateWindow function.

== MDI Child Windows ==

Creating MDI child windows is a little bit different from creating normal windows. To create an MDI child window, you must fill out the MDICREATESTRUCT data structure. The MDICREATESTRUCT is very similar to the WNDCLASS structure, except it is more limited. After creating this structure, you must send it as a message to the MDICLIENT window:

 hwndChild = (HWND)SendMessage(hwndClient, WM_MDICREATE, 0, (LPARAM)mdicreatestruct);

The message function will return a handle to the newly created child window.

== The &quot;Window&quot; Menu ==

Many MDI applications will offer a &quot;Window&quot; popup menu on the menu bar, to manage the MDI child windows. This menu frequently has options to &quot;Tile&quot; or &quot;Cascade&quot; the child windows, and it frequently maintains a listing of the currently available child windows in the application. It turns out that the MDI Client window will manage this menu for you, if you just pass it the correct handle to the menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Role of Resource Analysis in Strategy Formulation ==

Intangible assets are often overlooked, but they are many times the only source of sustainable competitive advantage (ie. brand, technology, information, culture, etc).

Taking the lead from military campaigns in which the goal is to pitch &quot;strength against weakness&quot;(1), business strategy should be defined by resource analysis rather than the inverse.  Firms that base their strategy on the development of specific capabilities have shown better adaptability than those that base their strategy on their customers or on how to serve them. One can take Merrill Lynch, American Express and Sears as having examples of failed strategies (being too broad and having an emphasis on customer needs), and Honda and 3M Corporation as having examples of successful strategies (with a focus on the capability of making engines and adhesives respectively).

Basically, any element that is traditionally considered to support competitive advantage can be seen as stemming from the correct acquisition and use of resources. For example, barriers to entry can be created by owning a strong brand, patents, or retaliatory capacity. A monopoly is nothing more than ownership of market share. Cost advantages come from process technology, size of plants, and access to low-cost inputs. Finally, Differentiation advantage comes from a brand, product technology, or marketing, distribution, and service capabilities.

|Physical assets , financial assets
|Human technology, reputation, skills
|}

=== Tangible Resources ===
Tangible resources are the easiest to evaluate since they are visible and quantifiable. Two key questions underlie this procedure(2): 
*What opportunities exist for economizing on finance, inventories, and fixed assets?
*What are the possibilities for employing existing assets more profitable?

=== Intangible Resources ===
Much of a company's worth comes from less defined assets such as '''reputation''', '''technology''', or '''a particular set of cultural attributes within the company'''. Intel and American Express have successfully protected their intangibles, while Xerox has repeatedly over-looked its core assets. Brand is everything for Coca-Cola, and Gillette, while software and pharmaceutical companies depend mosty on their technology and patents. 

=== Human Resources ===
People in companies provide skills, knowledge, intuition, and reasoning (known as [[Managerial Economics/Introduction|human capital]]). Additionally, the culture inside an organization consists of relationships, values, and routines, and companies that have a strong set of managerial values have a strategic advantage over those that don't- through employees increased identity with corporation, increased stability and consistency as well as a guide for appropriate behaviour.

== Core Competences ==
Hamel and Prahalad introduced the term &quot;core competences&quot; (3) in 1990 to describe those competences that a) &quot;make a disproportionate contribution to ultimate customer value or to the efficiency with which that value is delivered,&quot; and b) &quot;provide a basis for entering new markets.&quot;

So the question to ask in this case is &quot;What can such and such firm do better than others?&quot;

The process of identifying core capabilities can begin in many ways; the two more common ones are through a classification of all capabilities according to function, or through a ''value chain'' analysis that separates a firm into small ''sequential'' activities.

Example of a value chain:

Technology (patents) &gt;&gt; Product Design (quality) &gt;&gt; Manufacturing (assembly) &gt;&gt; Marketing (brand) &gt;&gt; Distribution (warehousing) &gt;&gt; Service (warranty)

=== Benchmarking ===
Benchmarking is important because it brings objectivity into the process of identifying competences. It also brings vain imaginations down to the ground. 
To create a benchmark, one must identify areas of potential improvement; identify world-leading companies in each area; contact the companies (visit, talk to managers, discuss with workers); and define goals based on the learning done at those companies.

=== Integration mechanisms ===

== Appraising competitive advantage ==
A source of competitive advantage must be ''scarce'', ''relevant'', ''durable'', ''immobile'', and ''unreplicable''. 

== Appraising Resources and Capabilities ==
Resources and capabilities need to be appraised against two key criteria. First is their importance: which resources and capabilities are most important in conferring sustainable competitive advantage? Second, where are our strengths and weaknesses as compared with competitors?

Wondering what you can do with that silly old box? Here's some examples.

== Skyscraper! ==

Make the Y axis lines longer and check it out! It's now a skyscraper! 

[[Image:ISO_Skyscraper.GIF]]

== Chessboard! ==
Make the boxes black and white and make a chessboard!

[[Image:ISO_ChessBoard.GIF]]

== Table! ==
Make a rectangle composed out of boxes (2 x 3 should do)


Make a &quot;flattened&quot; box (less X axis)to make the table top.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_2.GIF]]

Then erase the middle lines in the front of the rectangle.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_3.GIF]]

Turn the three lines on the outside into legs and erase all the lines on the bottom.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_4.GIF]]

A table! Yay! Perfect for fancy dinner parties. Well, maybe not yet.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_5.GIF]]

First we have to talk about detailing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chain==
A group of stones that are all connected along the lines of the board (vertically or horizontally). All stones in one chain share their [[#Liberty|liberties]]. Also &quot;block&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, or &quot;[[#Group|group]]&quot;.

==Group==
Either a synonym for [[#Chain|chain]] or used to refer to several chains considered together that co-operate or that could be trivially connected.

==Liberty==
An empty point adjacent to a single stone or [[#Chain|chain]] of stones.

==Point==
Either the scoring unit or an intersection on the board. In [[Computer Go/Tromp-Taylor Rules|Tromp-Taylor]] terminology, a point may be colored black, white, or empty. Using boards, coloring a point black or white means placing a stone of that color on the point. Coloring a point empty, i.e. emptying a point, means removing the stone from it.

==Suicide==
Self-capture; a move that does not capture any stones and in which the stone just placed has no [[#Liberty|liberties]].

==Superko==
The rule that no move can repeat an earlier board position. In [[Computer Go/Tromp-Taylor Rules|Tromp-Taylor]] terminology, a move that repeats an earlier grid coloring violates the superko rule. Variants of the rule exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Representing the Board==

One of the first problems that all Go programs must solve is how to store the
current state of the game. The simplest representation needs to at least
implement:

* a way to determine whether a given [[Computer Go/Glossary#Point|point]] contains a black piece, a white piece, or is empty
* a way to place a piece, or remove a piece from a given point
* a way to store which point (if any) is illegal due to the Ko rule&lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Sample Code===
&lt;pre&gt;
public class Board {
	public Point koPoint;

	private int boardSize;
	private Color[][] board;

	public Color getColor(Point p) {
		board[p.x][p.y];
	}

	public void setColor(Point p, Color color) {
		board[p.x][p.y] = color;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some programs, like [[Computer Go/GNU Go|GNU Go]], use a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array. This has several advantages:
* a point on the board can be represented by a single integer
* one computation is often sufficient for a 1D-coordinate where two would be required for 2D-coordinates

For more information on this strategy, see [[Representing the board as a one-dimensional array]].

Most programs also store additional information that makes it easier to evaluate board positions; we will cover these strategies in a later section.

==Footnotes==
&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; For simplicity's sake, our program will assume the [[Computer Go/Tromp-Taylor Rules|Tromp-Taylor Rules]], ignoring [[Computer Go/Glossary#Superko|superko]], with the additional stipulation that [[Computer Go/Glossary#Suicide|suicide]] is illegal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recognizing Illegal Moves==

A non-passing move is legal if the point is unoccupied, the point is not illegal due to the Ko rule, and the move is not suicide. A move is not suicide if any of the following conditions holds true:
* any neighboring point is empty
* any neighboring point is the same color and has more than one liberty
* any neighboring point is a different color and has only one liberty

From the code we currently have, we can determine if a point is unoccupied and if a point is illegal due to the Ko rule. What we need now is code to loop through the neighbors of a particular point, as well as code that will determine the number of liberties of a given group.

The first is trivial:

&lt;pre&gt;
private List&lt;Point&gt; getNeighbors(Point p) {
	List&lt;Point&gt; neighbors = new ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;();

	if (p.x &gt; 0) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x - 1, p.y));
	if (p.x &lt; boardSize - 1) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x + 1, p.y));
	if (p.y &gt; 0) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x, p.y - 1));
	if (p.y &lt; boardSize - 1) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x, p.y + 1));

	return neighbors;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Determining the number of liberties of a given group is a little more difficult. Because the number of liberties of any given group is important information that is accessed frequently, most programs store a list of all groups on the board (and their liberties) and update it incrementally, rather than calculate it every time it is needed. We'll start out using a much simpler method: [[w:Flood fill|flood fill]].

This algorithm starts at the point in question, changes it to the opposite color, and then recursively performs the algorithm on every neighboring point of the original color. By remembering all neighboring empty points, we can determine the number of liberties of the group.

&lt;pre&gt;
private Set&lt;Point&gt; getLiberties(Point p) {
	Set&lt;Point&gt; liberties = new HashSet&lt;Point&gt;();

	Color myColor = getColor(p);
	Color floodfillColor = myColor.opposite();
	setColor(p, floodfillColor);

	List&lt;Point&gt; neighbors = getNeighbors(p);
	for (Point neighbor : neighbors) {
		if (getColor(neighbor) == myColor) {
			liberties.addAll(getLiberties(neighbor));
		} else if (getColor(neighbor) == EMPTY) {
			liberties.add(neighbor);
		}
	}

	return liberties;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately this algorithm changes the board, so we need to make sure that we only ever perform it on a copy of the board.

&lt;pre&gt;
private boolean inAtari(Point p) {
	return clone().getLiberties(p).size() == 1;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we have all the resources required to determine if a given move is legal.

&lt;pre&gt;
public boolean isLegal(Point p, Color c) {
	 // Is the point already occupied?
	if (getColor(p) != EMPTY) {
		return false;
	}
		// Is the move ko?
	if (p.equals(koPoint)) {
		return false;
	}

	// Is the move suicide?
	boolean suicide = true;
	for (Point neighbor: getNeighbors(p)) {
		if (getColor(neighbor) == EMPTY) {
			// if any neighbor is VACANT, suicide = false
			suicide = false;
		} else if (getColor(neighbor) == c) {
			// if any neighbor is an ally
			// that isn't in atari
			if (!inAtari(neighbor)) {
				suicide = false;
			}
		} else if (getColor(neighbor) == c.opposite()) {
			// if any neighbor is an enemy
			// and that enemy is in atari
			if (inAtari(neighbor)) {
				suicide = false;
			}
		}
	}
	
	if (suicide) {
		return false;
	}
	
	// If the point is not occupied, the move is not ko, and not suicide
	// it is a legal move.
	return true;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most movements have a caliber number-In most cases this will be below the balance wheel.  In some cases it will be on one of the bridges, and occasionally it will be on the dial side, only visible by removing the dial.  There may be several designations--It is common for the visible indications to mention the brand of the watch company, while the semi-hidden marks will tell who actually made the movement.  Bulova has its own movement codes, and generally have this code on a bridge.  Often however this Bulova movement was made by someone else and only minorly updated, this will usually have the maker's marks in their usual place under the balance.  [http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&amp;ranfft&amp;&amp;2uswk Ranftt.de] has a very good online database of movements, searchable by number, with pictures and a varying amount of info.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Scene Breakdown Page may be useful information if your play is structured in a series of formal Scenes in changing locations and time periods. It's also a good way to make a complicated Time Structure clear to a reader. But if you have fewer than 6 Scenes, it works as well to list them under each Act on the Setting &amp; Time Page. 
And it's a clear way to indicate what kind of demands you're really putting on the Scene and Lighting Designers. If what you're doing with design is out of the ordinary, it's also a good idea to add a brief statement about this to your description on the Setting &amp; Time page. 

Here's one way of doing it . .

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page contains general maintanence information applicable to most tractor models.

This page is part of the Chinese Tractor Maintenance book. Go to the [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance]] book.

== Fluids== 

This section is a summary of the recommendations of Chinese tractor owners for changing fluids in their tractors. The fluids of concern here are cooling, hydraulic fluid, engine oil and gear oil. Recommendations for fluids to change and the fluids to use when you first get your tractor are given. General procedures for changing fluids are described that are applicable to most tractors. Procedures for specific tractor models can be found in sections for the tractor model.

=== Changing Fluids After Delivery ===

Tractors are delivered in two likely conditions:
* Crate
* Assembled

If your tractor arrives disassembled in a crate (a crate tractor) then it is highly recommended that you change all of your fluids before running the tractor. Although fluids shipped with crate tractors are improving, there is a long history of these fluids being of substandard quality and causing mechanical problems long before the factory recommended first fluid change.

Another issue with the Chinese tractors is the metal shavings, chips, flakes, dust and dropped parts that the manufacturing process leaves in the fluid pathways that have not been cleaned out. By removing the original fluids, flushing, replacing filters and replacing the fluids you will remove most of the offending material. This will reduce clogging, premature wear and breakdown of your tractor.

If you are buying/have bought an assembled tractor from a dealer, ask the dealer if the fluids have been changed. If the dealer has changed the fluids you may want to ask some details about how it was done. If no flushing was done during the fluid change then you may still want to do your own fluid change.

Regardless of whether you change the fluids when you first receive your tractor you should replace them after you have run the tractor for a few hours (5-10 hours). During the first few hours of operation many mill marks on mating metal surfaces of moving parts will wear off and be suspended in the working fluid, caught in a filter or settled on the bottom of a pan. Any metal fragments that remain suspended in the fluid will cause additional wear on the tractor's working parts. These metal flakes should be removed after a few hours by flushing and replacing the fluids to prevent unneeded wear.

=== General Fluid Change/Flushing Procedure ===

This section contains general instructions for flushing out the fluids the first time you change the fluids in your tractor. Subsequent fluid replacement should not require flushing unless you detect excessive metal particles in the drained fluid.

Kerosene can be used as the flushing agent. It has sufficient lubrication that it can be used for a short time for running in your tractor for the engine oil, hydraulic oil and gear oil. It is thin enough to work as a solvent to break loose metal particles in pans and on the walls of fluid passageways.

Kerosene can be reused if it is filtered between uses. About 10 gallons will be sufficient for most Subcompact and Compact Chinese tractors if it is reused. It can be run through an oil filter for filtering.

Since gear oil is the heaviest oil in your tractor, if you are reusing the kerosene for flushing all of the oil based fluids, perform the gear oil flush last.

==== Engine Oil

The main function of engine oil is to keep the engine cool and maintain its temperature in cold weather too and to dissolve the dirt particle in it and set them down.The additive in engine oil work as a detergent and mix the dirt particles in it and keep away from the engine from friction.The good engine oil will always in its natural colour that is golden.The best engine oil does not contains any colour additives,it will be in pure golden colour.
The shell rimula and helix are the best engine oil of the world.

==== Injector Pump Fluid Change ====

(TBS)

==== Hydraulic Fluid Change/Flush ====

(Intro TBS)

The following is the procedure for replacing the hydraulic fluid:

* Drain the hydraulic fluid:
** Start tractor.
** Allow the engine to run a few minutes to warm up the hydraulic fluid and pump.
** Cycle the 3 Point Hitch (3PH) a few times. Leave the 3 Point Hitch fully raised.
** If you have a Front End Loader (FEL) cycle the lift and bucket on the Front End Loader a few times. Leave in the up position.
** Turn off engine.
** Place bucket under hydraulic fluid reservoir drain.
** Open drain on hydraulic fluid reservoir.
** Lower the 3PH.
** Lower the FEL.
** At this point for tractor owners with a single pump for both Hydraulics and power steering the following is done:
*** Follow the procedure in [[#Power Steering Fluid Change/Flush]]
** Close the reservoir drain.
** If there is fluid remaining in the reservoir then you can remove it with a suction device like a turkey baster.
** Locate the hydraulic fluid screen if you have one. Clean the screen and put it back in. If you have a hydraulic fluid filter then leave it in place for now.
* If you which to flush the hydraulic system (see [[#Changing Fluids After Delivery]]) then do the following:
** Fill the hydraulic reservior with kerosene.
** Follow the procedures to drain the hydraulic fluid.
* If you have a hydraulic fluid filter then replace it.
* Fill the hydraulic fluid reservoir.
* Start the engine and cycle the 3PH and/or FEL.
* If the hydraulics do not work then follow the procedure here [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Trouble Shooting#Replacing/Flushing Hydraulic Fluid Caused 3 Point Hitch/FEL/Power Steering To Quit Working]]

==== Power Steering Fluid Change/Flush ====

* Drain Power Steering:
** Raise front end of tractor (allows wheels to be turned).
** Remove the hydraulic hoses from steering cylidner.
** Turn steering wheel left and right.
** Reattach hydraulic hoses to power steering cylinder.
** Lower front end of tractor.

==== Gear Oil Change/Flush ====

The oil used in the transmission and rear axle is normally the same as in  is used in the 4x4 front axle. Also use the same procedure for flushing.

===== Transmission/Rear Axle Fluid Change Flush =====

* Drain out the old gear oil. See the section for your specific tractor for the location of the drain plugs.
* Fill the transmission and axle to the  normal level with kerosene.
* Start up the engine (you didn't drain the engine oil and forget to put it back in did you?) and drive the tractor. Use both forward and reverse gears so that the faces of the gears get flushed. This should only require a few minutes.
* Stop the tractor and park on a level surface.
* Drain the kerosene from the transmission and axle.
* Refill the transmission and axle with your choice of gear oil. 
** Fill until the dip stick shows full or oil drips out of the unscrewed weep hole in the housing (whichever is applicable). 
** Since gear oil can be thick it can take time for it to level out throughout its housing. When you think you have it full wait for 10 minutes and then check again. It may require several iterations of filling and waiting to completely fill the gear case.

===== 4x4 Front Axle Fluid Change Flush =====

Do the front axle flush at the same time as the transmission if you have sufficient kerosene. Follow the same procedure as with the transmission.

==== Fuel ====

Another &quot;fluid&quot; to change is the fuel. Just to be on the safe side it is a good idea to drain the fuel from the fuel system. You don't know how long the fuel has been in the tank or what its quality is. Replacing the fuel might prevent you from having to clean/replace your fuel injectors.


* Drain fuel tank.
* Drain sediment bowl.
* Replace the fuel filter.
* Fill fuel tank.

If there seems to be significant sediment or &quot;chunks&quot; in your drained fuel you may have algae in your tank. When you put new fuel in the tank obtain some biocide and add the recommended amount.

=== Replacement Fluids ===

There are a great variety of brands and types of fluids that can be successfully used in your Chinese tractor. Many of the fluids have been found by owners at Walmart and Napa.

==== Engine Oil ====

(Intro TBS)

In cold weather climates a lighter weight engine oil should be used to aid in cold cranking and to reduce the work load on the engine.

Engine oils used successfully by Chinese tractor owners include:
* Shell Rotella or Delo 400 15W/40
* shell Rimula 20w/40 is a multigrade oil and best for tractors

==== Injector Pump Fluid ====

Use non-detergent oil. Use a weight appropriate for your air temperature. 30wt is a good all-around choice.

==== Hydraulinc Fluid / Power Steering  ====

In cold weather climates a lighter weight fluid should be used to aid increase the operating speed of the equipment.

Hydraulic fuild that has been successfully used by Chinese tractor owners include:
* AW32  (for cold country). (will speed up operation).
* Walmart Super Tech Transmission/Hydraulic oil (not all walmarts have it).

==== Coolant ====

(TBS)

==== Gear Oil ====

Gear oil is used in the tractor transmission/rear axle and if the tractor has 4 wheel drive it us used in the front axle. 

Since Chinese tractors use &quot;yellow metal&quot; for some parts the gear oil must be yellow metal safe. Yellow metal is copper, brass, bronze etc. The gear oil that you buy should say on the label that it is &quot;yellow metal safe&quot;. Gear oil that does not say that it is &quot;yellow metal safe&quot; may have added agents to aid in its performance in high heat and/or high pressure environments. These additives will cause oxidation of the yellow metal. The oxidation will cause pits in the surface of the metal and eventually the part will fail. One sign that your yellow metal has oxidized is a black color on the surface.

Gear oil should show that it is low/anti foaming on the label.

Gear oils that have been successfully used by Chinese tractor owners include:
* Rotella GL-4 - walmart
* GL-5 80W/90
* Super Tech 85W/140
* Kubota Super UDT (true synthetic for winter).

==== Fuel ====

Diesel fuel obtained from your local filling station as well as truck stops can be used in your tractor.

== Cooling System ==

=== Radiator Fin Cleaning ===

The radiator fins, over time, accumulate dust and debri between the fins reducing the cooling efficiency of the radiator. This causes the engine to run hotter.

When dust and/or debri builds up between the fins the fins must be cleaned. One method of cleaning
is to use compressed air.
* Remove the radiator screen
* Blow the compressed air into the BACK of the radiator so that the debri goes back out the front of the radiator. Trying to blow air into the front of the raditor may cause debri to become lodged tigher into the radiator fins.
* Replace the radiator screen.

High pressure water is NOT recommended for cleaning the radiator. This can easily damage the radiator fins.

To reduce the amount of debri entering the radiator the radiator screen can be replaced by a filter or agugmented. See [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Modified Cooling System#Radiator Screen]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|right|Electromagnetic spectrum with light highlighted]]
'''Visible light''' (commonly referred to simply as '''light''') is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye, and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light has a wavelength in the range of about 380 nanometres to about 740&amp;nbsp;nm – between the invisible infrared, with longer wavelengths and the invisible ultraviolet, with shorter wavelengths.

Primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarisation, while its speed in a vacuum, 299,792,458 meters per second (about 300,000 kilometers per second), is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in vacuum.

In common with all types of EMR, visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny &quot;packets&quot; called photons, and exhibits properties of both waves and particles. This property is referred to as the wave–particle duality. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.

In physics, the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.

      <comment>/* Why Study Tagalog? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello fellow reader and welcome to this tutorial on the [[w:Tagalog language|Tagalog language]].  As a major [[w:Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]] and, as [[w:Filipino language|Filipino]], the national language of the Philippines, Tagalog can help you get by in the Philippines better.

==Why Study Tagalog?==
* The next time you visit the Philippines, you don't need to take your ''Tagalog-English'' ''English-Tagalog'' dictionary when asking where the toilet is.

* Speaking Tagalog helps you to gain more Filipino friends.

* You hate the Western Cold weather and finding some beaches to sunbathe in and communicating in Tagalog the next time you visit the country will help you to NOT-GET-LOST when touring around.  (The Philippines might have a large population of English speakers but this doesn't mean that everyone in the country understands English fluently.)

* You might get pissed when some of the Filipino people start talking in Tagalog and you might think they're talking about you, learning Tagalog will help you understand what they're talking about and the next time you see some talking in Tagalog you won't get misinterpretation of what they're talking about.

* You're obsessed of eating Filipino foods but you don't understand the menu because it's written in pure Tagalog.  After learning some Tagalog you will understand what the menu says and you'll know what you're consuming.

* You might also love reading literature, [[w:Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]] and [[w:El Filibusterismo|El Filibusterismo]] by [[w:José Rizal|José Rizal]] are mostly translated into Tagalog however its main form was in Spanish, you might not understand Spanish nor Tagalog, but after studying Tagalog the books will catch your heart.

==Demographics==
Tagalog is the native language of 22 million [[w:Filipino people|Filipinos]] and is the largest of all the [[w:Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].  More than 65 million people, roughly about three-fourths of the Philippine population, have learned Tagalog as their second language to varying degrees of comprehension.

Tagalog is one of the keys to Philippine culture.  By studying it, you unlock an amalgamation of Malay, Arab, Indian, Latin and European cultures.

However, there are catches to learning Tagalog.  For example, accentation can differentiate different forms of a word with the same spelling (as in ''hapon'', which can mean either &quot;afternoon&quot; or as a reference to Japan), as in [[Spanish]], but accents are usually not written.  This can create confusion at first.

Also, Tagalog can use different word orders but that mean the same thing: an example is the Wikipedia slogan, which can be translated as ''Ang Malayang Ensiklopedya'' (the English word order) or ''Ang Ensiklopedyang Malaya'' (the Spanish word order).

Learning Tagalog, however, can be made easier if one knows how to speak Spanish or languages such as [[w:Malay language|Malay]] or [[Indonesian]], which Tagalog either has cognates or has borrowed words from.  It helps create a better learning experience.

==Redundancy==

I notice a systematic occurence of redundancy. ...

''Yes. When I see it, I try to follow the advice in [[Help:Pages#Merging|Wikibooks:Duplicate_modules]]. (moved text to [[Help talk:Pages|Wikibooks talk:Duplicate modules]].) --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:09, 2 January 2006 (UTC)''

==Can I advertise a Wiki site on Wikipedia?==
Hello! I'm currently working on a website that is part Wiki, but will also present non-editable information (a compilation of experts' opinions) in HTML help format. Naturally it will be free to all visitors, but because I have to eat, I hope to sell advertising on it. 
When it's ready, I'd like to make current Wiki users aware of it -- what is the best way to do this? Can I buy an ad? If so, how much would it cost?

Many thanks!

*While this question would be better suited for Wikipedia (since that is what you are asking about), I think I can answer it. Wikipedia does not sell ad space. If your wiki is a valid source or resource, you can just add it to the bottom of the article on the topic that your wiki covers. WP does not allow too many vanity links, so make sure it is germane to the article. But, no, there is no rule stopping sites with ads from being placed on Wikipedia. Hope this helps. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

* I see that several other wiki already sell advertising. The biggest one I know of is http://wikicities.com/ . Wikicities sells advertising in the form of Google ads. To get an ad posted there, I think (?) you buy them from Google http://www.google.com/ads/ .

* There are over 1000 public wiki. You may be interested helping us find new wiki such as yours:

== Permission error &quot;deletedhistory&quot; ==

In the past, I could read edit histories of deleted pages, but now, I am being blocked from such pages with message like:

:''The action you have requested is limited to users with the &quot;deletedhistory&quot; permission assigned. See [[Wikibooks:Administrators]].'' [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/366_Photographs_on_the_Beach]

I cannot find anything at en.wikibooks.org, meta.wikimedia.org, www.mediawiki.org, bugs.wikipedia.org, or foundation-l that mentions &quot;deletedhistory&quot; permission. Thus I assume that this is a bug, and that I should be able to read histories of deleted pages.

Has anyone noticed this problem on wikis other than English Wikibooks? Also, is bugs.wikipedia.org the correct place for me to complain about this? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:37, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

:I know that the developers are experimenting with a few ideas, but I thought that was supposed to be on test wikis before it went &quot;live&quot; on major Wikimedia projects.  I havn't heard about this on Foundation-l, and yes, the MediaWiki bugzilla is an appropriate place to complain about this and other similar kinds of problems... or Foundation-l if it is really annoying changes.  I just tried it with my admin status and I'm able to get the history with sysop status, but when I'm logged in anonymously I get the same message you just listed above.  In the past I have had only the edit history show up without sysop status (you still can't undelete), and this may be a new &quot;permission&quot; the developers are experimenting with.  Let's see what else is going to happen with this in the near future, and bureaucrats ought to be able to &quot;grant&quot; this permission to individual users. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:24, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

::After some review, you should [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2005-December/033283.html read this e-mail message] on Wikitech-l that discusses this very issue.  I guess it is a new permission for now. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:28, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

I created '''[[Bugzilla:4414]]'''. While I was there, I voted for [[Bugzilla:939]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
----
Well we had this same issue just this morning. After trawling the Internet and the MediaWiki Forums with no answers, a Google search pointed us to this link http://dimer.tamu.edu/simplog/archive.php?blogid=7&amp;cid=0 
You have to edit LocalSetting.php and add this: $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['deletedhistory'] = true;

I've considered trying to update/change the navigation bar that appears at the left (or whereever on the skin you are using) that appears on all page views of Wikibooks.  What I'd like to get is some input from the community as to what should go there.

Some thoughts on the subject would be to add a link to this page ([[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]]) as well as possibly [[Wikiversity]] as well.  I'd also like to get rid of the Random Module link as it seems silly and not really useful for new users (although a cute play toy to put on the Community Portal page perhaps).  It is easier for us as admins to replace existing links with something else, but if we come up with a solid plan we can also get some developer support, including reording the links as well.  These should be links that would be useful to general users, but also keep in mind that we need to offer support to new users and visitors to Wikibooks as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

*Yeah, the random article is nice to have on 'pedia, when you just want to look up something random, but not as useful here(especially since a lot of modules by themselves aren't too useful or interesting, and a lot of individual articles don't have navigation links back to the whole book), so I don't really see any use for it. Maybe a link to [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves|All Bookshelves]] would be more useful there, although you can get to that from the front page. (My entry point is on Recent Changes, since I tend to look at that more than any other page, and the front page doesn't change too often--perhaps something else that could be taken into consideration.) [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 17:50, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

*Actually you don't need developer support for changing the navigation bar. Admins can customize [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]] and add or delete links, although the possible set of links seems limited. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:35, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

*A link to [[Project:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]] is a good idea. Many MediaWikis already have links like this.&lt;p&gt;Adding a link to [[Wikiversity]] is also a good idea. There is now a [[MetaWikipedia:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal|modified project proposal]] to create a wiki for Wikiversity. Until that happens, Wikibooks can encourage contributions to Wikiversity by adding it to the &quot;navigation&quot; box.&lt;p&gt;As for &quot;Random module&quot;, it might be appropriate to move this from &quot;navigation&quot; to &quot;toolbox&quot;. I occasionally use it to find random broken pages to fix or delete. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:09, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

-----

I've made the changes to the sidebar.  It is really easier than I thought, and this is a feature that is not used too often on other projects as well as it could be.  Well, if there are any other thoughts on what to add/remove from the sidebar, make sure you note it here on the Staff Lounge.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:31, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== [[How to Certify a Passport]] ==
&lt;s&gt;Erm, I stumbled upon this page, and I don't believe it is to be deleted, but what are we supposed to do with stubs like these? I doubt it would be turned into a complete book, and there are no books (to my knowledge) that this could be merged into. 

Another thing that scares me is tha we are becomming Wikipedia's dumping ground. [[Wikipedia:How-to]] How-to may fit here, but they should go into a book of some sort, and not just be dumped unorganized into wikibooks. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

I got one side question: were we informed about this dumping of how-to guides? I mean, i'd help out if I knew about it, that way, it'd get done correctly. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:04, 3 January 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Yeah... and then I find that everything has already been shelved in the how-to section. :-/ --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:08, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:Wikipedia is getting better, but any transfers to Wikibooks should be through the transwiki namespace first, unless the location for the new Wikibook is clear.  We need to simply hold the line on this issue and make sure that the editors on Wikipedia know what qualifies as Wikibooks material.  I guess they are trying to do some &quot;house cleaning&quot; on Wikipedia by a bunch of deletionists, and Wikibooks openly proclaims that we are a home to &quot;How-to&quot; books.  There is a lot of random junk all over Wikibooks unfortunately at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== Main pages in books should display their bookshelf ==

Is there any policy on this? If there isn't, could we create it? At least as a guideline? I think it'd be very helpful to have a link back to a book's bookshelf. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:32, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

: I've created two templates in my user space that can help with this.  Both are intended to be used at the bottom of the page.
:* [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]] presumes that it will only be used on the main page of a book.  It is called with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:JMRyan/Shelf1|Bookshelf_name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  To specify, for example, the Humanities bookshelf, the Bookshelf_name parameter should be &quot;Humanities&quot;, not &quot;Wikibooks:Humanities&quot; or &quot;Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf&quot;.
:* [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]] presumes that it will be used on every of a book.  It is called with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:JMRyan/Shelf2|Bookshelf_name|Book_name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; where the second parameter is optional.
: The idea here is to create a [[Template:Shelf]] page by copying one of these two templates.  If we want recommend that the bookshelf be linked from every page of a book, then copy from [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]]; if we want to recommend that the bookshelf be linked only from the main page of a book, then copy from [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]].  See [[User:JMRyan/Shelf templates]] for examples of use.  Please use [[User talk:JMRyan/Shelf templates]] for discussion and to make alternative suggestions.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 10:22, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

: I don't feel it's necessary to link back to the bookshelf from every page -- a link from the main page is sufficient. Some books may fit on 2 bookshelves. Such a book should link back to every bookself it is a part of. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 23:19, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

I've [[m:Talk:CheckUser Policy#Worst-case of Abuse|voiced my opinion, unanswered,]] about what is really lost when this privilege specifically is abused, and I fail to see why it can't simply be granted to all admins.  Still, let's get the votes together for this as best as we can, and it would be cool if we could elect some trusted people to be able to use this feature.

this site is so stupid and on top of that you guys want donations??

no non-fiction and no shakespeare!!!  amazing
no wonder nobody uses this site for anything, until now i didnt even know it existed.

my advice is drop the stupid restrictions and make this site a real open gateway for knowledge that u all seem to be pushing.
otherwise this page stinks

== References to books? ==

I figured out that if you type &quot;ISBN&quot; followed by a number, a link is displayed that enables your readers to buy the book from Amazon (or three other stores). I presume that Amazon then pays the 5% referral fee to Wiki. OK, so how do I format it so that &quot;ISBN&quot; and the number are hidden, and the title of book appears as a link? Here's the link I'm working on: ISBN 1573240648 &quot;The Open Mind&quot; by Dawna Markova. I tried various brackets, curly brackets, pipes, etc.

:http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:ISBN_links doesn't offer too much help. I don't believe it can be done due to the way pages are rendered. Your best bet may be to create a template for special use like the help suggests. Also, I don't think Wikimedia is getting any money out of those links. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 05:10, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

The wikibooks resources for a given ISBN seems to be a lot more sparse than the wikipedia equivalent, eg ISBN 0949853054 vs [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0949853054] . Is there any particular reason for this? Andjam 07:33, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

There's another danger. Let's say there's a standard way to reference books, and every time a book is referenced, the link goes to Amazon, and Wikimedia earns 5%. Sounds good, right? It won't be long until someone writes a script to spider every Wikimedia page looking for those standardized book references, and changes the account name that Amazon pays the 5% to. I.e., steals money from Wikimedia, and it could be a lot of money.

:That's certainly a likely thing... however if the referrer ID was automatically assigned it wouldn't. For example [http://www.hrwiki.org Homestar Runner Wiki] recognises when a homestarrunner.com URL has been entered (it has a different external link icon from everything else). Imagine if MediaWiki could automatically append--or, if one's already there, replace--the referrer ID with our own? That would bypass any and all attempts to divert it. And ''any'' way to make more money for us would be a Good Thing, [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Personal_Appeal especially considering Jimbo's just gone down on bended knee].

== Substantially finished books ==

I think there really is a need for books that are substantially finished to be in a list at the beginning of the Wikibooks main page.

This has been discussed as &quot;100% finished books&quot;.
See discussion:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_8#.22100.25_finished.22_list

Some books are substantially complete and extremely useful even though they are not 100% complete. A recent review of electronic publishing says:

&quot;I recently carried out a non-scientific attempt to survey the best books on Wikibooks. My sample, taken from the adult English-language site, consisted of all the books whose level of development was listed as &quot;comprehensive text&quot; (the highest level), plus all those that had been voted book of the month at some point, plus a list of four books suggested by a Wikibooks user with whom I happened to start up a dialog on Slashdot. This made a total of 20 books.[19] Of these: 

* 11 were not really books, ranging in length from 6 to 50 pages. 
* One was marked with a copyright violation banner. 
* Four or five were books that seemed to have been written entirely outside of Wikibooks, dumped into Wikibooks wholesale, and never really edited much by Wikibooks users. 
* Only three or four were complete books that appeared to have been created and written through Wikibooks itself. &quot; http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/infrastructure.html

I think the situation is a bit better than this and even if there are only about 6 books that are substantially complete they should be advertised to encourage other authors and demonstrate what is meant by a &quot;substantially complete&quot; textbook.

I like the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook cookbook] it is not complete and doesn't even have a green square but its certainly ready &quot;to go&quot;. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

: Yes, I read this article. I agree that we don't have much books we can show to the public and be really proud of them. Other problem is lack of print versions, author of this article also wrote that problem of Wikibooks is that books are hard to print. IMO the solution is to support [[Help:Print versions]] project. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:13, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the link. I have just had a look at a few sample printed pages from Python. The font is good and the auto format worked well. Its being &quot;picky&quot; but I would like to see a one inch left margin (at least, for binders etc.) and right justification with a half inch right margin. {&quot;font-family:verdana; margin-left='8%'; margin-right='8%'; text-align: justify; font-weight:normal; font-size:12pt} with perhaps a touch of blue in the text TEXT=&quot;#00000C&quot;? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::I have just been playing with this facility. Although automatically created printed versions are OK you cant beat PDF. Unfortunately. Perhaps there could be a section at the beginning of Wikibooks that lists substantially complete books and offers either the automatic printed version or a PDF if the authors have taken the trouble to create one.

== RSS Feed for &quot;my watchlist&quot; ? ==

Would it be possible to get an RSS feed for &quot;my watchlist&quot;?  This would be very nice and would make keeping tabs on a book a breeze.

Also, I had a difficult time figuring out if this question had ever been asked before.  I ''did'' look at the Table of Contents, but I did not look at the archives - there are a lot of them.  I looked for a &quot;search archives&quot; option, and didn't see that either.  That means one of the following: a) There isn't one; b) It's not in an obvious place; or c) I'm a dolt.

[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 21:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

:This is an [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471 oft-requested] feature, but one that hasn't been implemented. This is because many users would consider their watchlist to be private, and RSS feeds don't support logins as such, therefore allowing you to access the watchlist of any given user. Googling &quot;Watchlist RSS feed&quot; or the like will come up with endless discussion and some possible solutions.
:Using the live bookmark (or similar) feature of your web browser is probably the easiest way, although it means bookmarking every page you add to your watchlist. Doubtless someone will come up with a Firefox extension to do this quicker, but for now there is no ideal solution. :(
:I'm not sure if it's been asked ''here'' before, but certainly it's made its way onto Wikipedia's &quot;perennial proposals&quot; page.
:EDIT: as for a search archives function there isn't one, but Googling &quot;site:en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_Lounge &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;keyword&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; works just as well.

==Suspicious-looking groups of new non-contributing users==
The Maori [mi] Wikibooks (which is basically not progressing, though a few of us keep an eye on it for the sake of the reputation of our country's indigenous language) has recently had new users adding themselves, suspiciously close together, not doing anything yet. A week ago we got Bulban; Fiuyhfkurty; Pigmey; Pisuar over the space of a few hours. Earlier ones were even more jumbled words. Any other wikibooks got this happening? Is it a precursor to a massive spam attack?  [[User:Robin Patterson|Robin Patterson]] 06:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

:I don't know... when spam shows up on Wikicities it's always by anons.

I would suggest that some users create accounts to read Wikibooks (and set their preferences), not contribute. However [[:mi:Main Page|Maori Wikibooks]] seems to have almost nothing to read. &quot;Random page&quot; links me to the Main Page, which is in English.

I suggest that maybe these users are creating accounts so they can make interwiki links. (For example, if en:x linked to de:x and de:x linked to mi:x, you might want to add a link from mi:x to en:x.) They might have done this in expectation that someday mi will actually have books. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

I have reviewed your listing for Corset:Bibliography:Old English.
How can I access the old Periodicals on the list ?

Such as:

Anonymous. &quot;Death from Tight Lacing.&quot; The Lancet, May 23, 1869, 675. 

I have preparing a paper and would love access to these old articles.

: Hello Christine. If you're not already associated with an academic institution, how about enquiring at a large public library in the first instance? &amp;nbsp;Otherwise you might try contacting the kind of institutions that might carry the material you're after, or seeing if there's an affordable pay-to-view internet option or the like. Re ''The Lancet'', for instance, I'd hope any university offering biochemistry or physiology (if not medicine itself) would carry it, otherwise I'd look for a publisher's website &amp;ndash; all this assuming it's not possible / too expensive / too lengthy to obtain via a public library. Hope something in all that helps. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 21:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

::I might add here that any contributions of this sort to our sister project, [[s:|Wikisource]], would be significantly appreciated.  Another perhaps even better place to turn for help in digitizing text of older periodicals such as a 150 year old medical journal would be to enlist the support of [http://www.pgdp.net/ Distributed Proofreaders], where a number of older scientific journals have been scanned and are being proofread and reviewed for mistakes.  Distributed Proofreading is a sister project to [http://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg], which has a collection of over 7,000 books and periodicals from a wide variety of interests.  All of these places are free for viewing, and are run by volunteers.  A major problem at the moment is trying to index all of this content, but most of it has been indexed by Google and you can do serches on all of it by using the '''''site:''''' tag to narrow the search to one domain (I've done that to search for stuff on Wikipedia, for instance).  Unfortunately most works that have been published after 1923 are copyrighted, so you are going to have to use a commercial service to access most of the scientific literature that was recorded in the 20th Century.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== Questions from the New Guy ==

I've recently taken an interest in cleaning up the [[Astronomy]] Wikibook and making some contributions. This has been a real learning experience for me as well as a source of frustration. As a Wikibooks newbie, I'm kind of at a loss as to how things run around here

One user has been contributing material that I think is obviously inappropriate for an astronomy textbook. The contributions are very long tables of very obscure astronomical data. The material is the sort of thing you'd find in an astronomical almanac, not a basic astronomy textbook. 

While it makes sense for the Astronomy Wikibook to have some basic reference tables as an appendix, I don't see that the tables approach anywhere near this level of complexity or depth. Accordingly, I removed the tables from most of the sections. (The original contributor has now moved the tables to Wikisource and linked to them from the Wikibook. I'm not sure whether this is appropriate.)

There was also material that I haven't deleted. I didn't clean this out because I thought it better to delete the modules entirely, as these modules had no other content on them. Instead, I nominated them for speedy deletion. The articles ''did'' seem to qualify for this.

About two weeks have passed since then, and the material is still there. I would assume that the articles in fact ''didn't'' qualify for speedy deletion except that other articles that were nominated for speedy deletion at the same time also remain. Should I continue to wait for someone to delete the articles or should I go through the formal process for deletion?

Another concern I have is with the [[Wikiversity:School of Astronomy]]. Recently some off-the-wall material has been added. A lot of it makes only vague sense to me. I don't mean any disrespect to the contributor, but I just can't see where he/she is coming from with this. My inclination is to revert the edit, but I'm slow to do that -- the new material doesn't have the flavor of vandalism, after all. In all honesty, 

I'm not really so interested in this page, and I'm willing to ignore it. I regard it as an entirely separate project. At the same time, I'd like to see ''all'' the material on Wikibooks reflect the highest quality, and I don't feel like the new additions do that. I could use the wisdom of some more experienced users on this. --[[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 03:54, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:First, you look like you're doing good things here. A lot of books at Wikibooks are in a terrible state and need extensive cleanup. Try looking over [[WB:PAG|policy pages ]]to make sure you've got the right idea of how to edit books, but your listed actions seem valid. Wikibooks is much slower-paced than Wikipedia in most areas. An admin ''should'' check the speedy delete category every once in a while but I guess no one has. It'll get done in time. My advice would be to work on one thing for now, then address other problem pages as you get more experience with how people write pages around here. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 05:24, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

::I actually put the Astronomy Wikibook up for a VfD because I felt it was in such a bad state that it would be better to simply restart the whole concept from scratch.  The VfD was voted down, but it still does need help.  In this case, feel free to do some massive editing and rearranging of the contents there.  Much of the contents of that Wikibook are copies from other websites, including some NASA content and very stale forks of Wikipedia from almost two years ago.  While this is technically legal, it does diminish the value of such content here when it could be so much better.  [[Wikijunior Solar System]] is put together with much better content, and I would dare say that the content that was culled from Wikijunior due to being too verbose and above grade level (Wikijunior is aiming for grade school aged kids) would be a good candidate for inclusion into the Astronomy Wikibook, for instance.  The astronomy articles on Wikipedia are also maturing and often exceeding their 32K article limit, which is one instance where Wikibooks could do a much better job of expanding information about specific astronomical objects like Jupiter or Mars, where quite a bit of information is now available.  That is a specific reason for my trying to advertise this Wikibook on the Astronomy Wikiproject, and I hope that other individuals with interest in this area will help contribute to this major branch of science.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

== Capitalisation problems with watchlist ==

It appears that article capitalisation has changed, and that [[Cookbook:sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar]] both resolve to the same page (without redirects).  This is, imho, a Very Good Thing.  However, I now have several entries in my watchlist, e.g. Cookbook:sugar, which exist in a kind of limbo.  The links go to the capitalised version of the pages, but these pages are not marked as being watched.    If I try and remove these items from my watchlist, I get the error '''Couldn't remove item 'Cookbook:sugar'''' and the page is not removed.  Can this be fixed here, or is it a MediaWiki bug that needs to go into Mediazilla? --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 22:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

== Subproject namespace problem ==

In the wikibook subproject &quot;Movie Making Manual&quot;, there are several articles about scriptwriting, all included in the category [[:Category:Writing movies|Writing movies]]. Reading this category page is a difficult affair, however: All the articles start with &quot;Movie Making Manual-&quot;, so it's difficult to scan through the list. Now we could move all those articles to a title without those words in the beginning, but this is a question of general policy: articles like &quot;Movie Manual-Main page&quot; and &quot;Biology-Main page&quot; would then suddenly collide. Has somebody a solution for this problem - by implementing something else, or by using the available tools creatively? How about if &quot;Movie Making Manual&quot;-articles would be named with &quot;(mmm)&quot; '''at the end''' (instead of the beginning, plus shortened)? And how about if we would use this way of naming article generally? [[User:Cramer|Cramer]] 22:14, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

However, we use [http://www.mediawiki.org MediaWiki] at Wikibooks, so we must write &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Link/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (or the longer version, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Book/Link|Link]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:59, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== Of Mice, Men, and Annotated Texts ==
Forgive me if this has been discussed, but I've looked and don't see a lot of guidance just yet.

I'm working on the ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' module and notice that it is categorized under Category:Annotated Texts.  The problem is that ''Of Mice and Men'' is still protected by copyright, and this study guide (for that's what it will be) will never really be an annotated text until the copyright expires.  If we want people who need this module (and granted, nobody needs it in its current state, but I have high hopes for it) to be able to find it, should it not be categorized differently?  The same can be asked about ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' and ''[[Angels and Demons]]'', if anyone ever finishes that.  --[[User:Mitchell K Dwyer|Mitchell K Dwyer]] 01:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== BOTM voting rules ==

== The management of book publishing - a policy suggestion ==

Whilst Wikibooks textbooks are being written they are actually &quot;manuscripts&quot;. A textbook that is a manuscript is a rather dubious source. I would like to propose the following policy for '''publishing''' these manuscripts:

1. That the Wikibooks main page begins with substantially finished books.
:These would be books that a '''final editorial board''' for each book has read, reviewed and checked and preferrably where external comment has been sought.
:The substantially finished books would be in PDF or printable format.
:The editorial board for each book would be composed of those contributors who make themselves available for the board plus a subject area chairman who is also an administrator to mediate and arbitrate.

2. The existing editing framework is left in place for manuscript development.
:This would also be linkable from each substantially finished book.

3. Substantially finished books would be updated at a maximum rate of monthly but preferrably no more than twice a year. If the edition frequency is kept low the books will be more stable and become more highly rated as reference sources. It would also limit the work load on the final editorial board. Each update would be given an &quot;edition&quot; number that can be used as a reference in other publications and the world at large. These controls might raise the status of the books and make them into reliable sources for academic work.

The main page for Wikibooks would need to be amended to contain new general headings. I have provided a '''crude''' conceptual mockup at: (now removed - clogged up my talk page).

The following books are probably ready for an all-out effort to get them into a fit state to be published:

----

My own thoughts on this matter:

We already have a crude beginning of something at [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]] that was started about the same time this whole project was started and IMHO is substantially underused for what it could be in theory.  In terms of bringing books up in quality and not content quantity, such as what is happening right now at [[Wikijunior Solar System]], you indeed need to get an editorial group going and doing fact checking and other forms of verification.

One thing we need to stay away from is a hardcore formalism such as killed Nupedia (and is creeping back into Wikipedia in some forms).  One of the problems with Nupedia was forgetting that it was a volunteer project and insisting on not quality standards but arbitrary standards of formalism that normally would only be met by a paid professional staff... and that only because they are willing to slug it out with the bureaucracy because it is just another day, another paycheck.  Volunteers will drop like flies in heat if this sort of expectation occurs.

This is not to suggest that quality can't be achieved.  A very successful on-line volunteer editorial project can be found with [http://www.pgdp.net/ Distributed Proofreaders], and I would suggest that if we want to be serious about processing Wikibooks in terms of editorial content, it would be preferable to follow this sort of model to some extent at least.  This would, however, take on a unique Wikibooks quality and perhaps be even less formal.

As far as the front page of Wikibooks is concerned, I would encourage the work to be performed on a bookshelf basis and perhaps some standards of content to be applied in terms of what appears.  Up until now it has been encouraged to put brand-new Wikibooks on the front page as a sort of mission statement to show what kinds of content ought to be on Wikibooks.  We are now beyond the stage of doing a demonstration project to show what Wikibooks (at least on the en.wikibooks side) could be capable of, and the front page lists a huge variety of potential content, but for the most part that is all it is.  That can and must change simply due to the fact that Wikibooks is becomming an major player in the e-text market and people are now coming to Wikibooks to see finished content.

I would propose that some formal standards be established for the stages icons, with perhaps a slight expansion of the concept to include beyond the 0% to 100% icon range, but include editorial icons as well to document manuscript proofing and &quot;publication&quot; such as a PDF file.  There would be several stages of editorial review as well.  In addition, only those manuscripts (read individual Wikibooks here) that are near the &quot;best&quot; stage of review should be listed on each bookshelf that appears on the front page.  Obviously some bookshelves are going to be weaker than others, and on the Bookshelf pages themselves you can still list all of the books, including brand-new Wikibooks that are a mere stub.  This would likely result in about 80% of the current listings of Wikibooks to be culled from the front page.

The whole point here is that we need to make especially the front page more user-friendly to those who are not necessarily here to edit and contribute, but simply want to take a glance at what we've written.  By doing this, Wikibooks will have a larger impact in the electronic publishing world and may begin to have a real impact doing what the founders of this project intended:  To provide an alternative publishing forum for textbooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:12, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

:Your mention of Wikibook press is very relevant. What I am suggesting is an effort to get the 10 or so nearly complete books into a print format such as Wikibooks press offers and to put these prominently on the main page.  Perhaps the contributors for the nearly complete books could be contacted and asked to get these ready for publishing.

:Staying &quot;away from hard core formalism&quot; is indeed essential. This is a good point and might be answered by always forming the final editorial board from the contributors plus one admin person to resolve disputes etc..

:I agree that we need to keep the active bookshelves in a prominent position. To avoid &quot;about 80% of the current listings of Wikibooks to be culled from the front page&quot; we would need to have a small table of &quot;published books&quot; at the top of the main page and keep the rest of the main page as it is.  The issue of crowding out the manuscripts with published works would only occur when, say, 30 or 40 published books are available. The published books would remain on the bookshelves so that their manuscripts can be improved for the next edition. 

:The current bookshelves would certainly need at least one more icon to indicate &quot;published&quot;. 

:I agree entirely with your last paragraph: &quot;The whole point here is that we need to make especially the front page more user-friendly to those who are not necessarily here to edit and contribute, but simply want to take a glance at what we've written&quot;. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:50, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

It has just occurred to me that the change in the main page so that it lists published books &quot;up front&quot; would be an interim solution. Once 30 books have been published the density of published books in the bookshelves would be high enough for the bookshelves to be sufficient. Books that have been published could be listed in a different colour on the bookshelf.

By publishing the books in definitive editions we will also forestall the problems of vandalism and anonymous IPs found on Wikipedia. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:29, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

Nice idea, in theory, but most books suffer from a lack of content and a lack of active contributors.  Of course if someone wants to take on the job of 'publishing' a book to [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]] then they should be encouraged.  I also agree that the front page needs to be made more reader friendly but let's not forget that [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not paper|Wikibooks is not paper]] so hand in hand with layout improvements we really, desperately, need tools to assist in the searching and indexing of books.  Remember that you don't know who the reader is or what he or she wants to find. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 08:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

::BTW, I don't think that you need to completely rule out the potential of a paper version of Wikibooks either.  While I would agree that not all Wikibooks have to be written with the intention that they eventually be published on paper, there is a reason why physical books are still being used and published... even by and for computer users themselves.  Not all knowledge can be obtained easily through a computer terminal, and books have a number of other advantages as well, not the least of which is that you never lose power and for archival purposes it can last thousands of years with no need to provide decryption services directly or is at least easily obtained.  You can't say the same thing about 9-inch Floppy disks or Hollerith punch cards at the moment.  I would dare you to easily find a Zip-disc reader if you want an example of a slightly more recent storage technology that has become obsolete.  Paper books are here to stay, and we certainly need to be able to translate some of these Wikibooks we are working on to physcial paper books if this project is going to be something more than Wikipedia articles in depth.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:10, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

:::I didn't intend to give the impression that I think that paper copies have no potential, sorry if it looked like that.  After all my personal library contains over 2000 of them (no I'm not boasting, I'm sure lots of you can easily trump that).  Also I absolutely agree that for longevity and future accessibility there is nothing to beat paper.  I do think though that what most books need is more content rather than more rules.  Some indication as to which books are alive and which are dying from neglect might be useful so that readers could avoid looking at books that consist just of stubs.  The front page as it stands is pretty much useless because most of the books it lists are barely started never mind completed and thus of interest only to prospective contributors not readers.  By the way do we actually have any readers, or is Wikibooks just the worlds best vanity publisher? :-)) --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 19:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

::::As far as Wikibooks readership, we are listed in the Alexa rankings as one of the largest e-text websites in terms of a place that people go to actually download an e-text.  I would suspect that Gutenberg is more active, but there is a lot of interwiki links between Wikipedia and Wikibooks.  A developer for the Wikimedia Foundation has suggested that Wikipedia has something like over 50 page reads for each edit.  The numbers are not quite as good for Wikibooks, but I do see some of the projects I'm working on that only get a brief comment from a reader, usually a thanks or a minor question about the book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:59, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:::::So, 

1. If I were to contact editors of the books singled out above and ask them to get them into a final draft.

2. If an admin could volunteer to be editor in chief for each book.

3. I and other volunteers(?) were to get the text into PDF format.

4. The main page were to have an extra table listing 12 substantially complete books.

:If you can do all that go for it.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 14:27, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:I don't see any reason for having a person with MediaWiki Sysop privileges to be required in order to be &quot;editor in chief&quot; of each book.  It just takes an individual who is willing to take on a leadership role to help pull things together, and try to deal with organizational tasks like page formatting, setting up a table of contents, working on templates to &quot;pretty up&quot; the Wikibook dealing with navigation issues as well, and to search commons for some images that may relate to the book content.  None of those tasks require any special privileges.&lt;p&gt;As far as volunteering to help get text into a basic PDF format, I am willing to also help accomplish that task, and have done so on a number of Wikibooks already.  A forum does need to be established to help coordinate that effort, especially as making the PDF file is not a completely trivial task at the moment and does take some reformatting of the content to make it work better as a PDF takes some artistic flair.&lt;p&gt;Where an admin is going to be needed is to help do the actual work on the main page.  This is currently protected... for a good reason.  I support changing over the look of the front page, with perhaps the current full list of book titles being moved to another page and only a few select books being displayed on the main page.  For now, I would say to restrict this only to Book of the Month winners... including Wikijunior.  Are there any other metrics that can be used to help decide what would go on the front page?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:39, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I have just had a go at print versions of Botany and Special relativity. Botany turned out to be difficult and a bit empty SR looks good though see:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special_relativity/Print_version

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Botany/Print_version

On the subject of Wikipedia content, both books have some content &quot;snaffled&quot; from Wikipedia - a note to this effect will be added.

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 20:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

=== [[GNU Free Documentation License]] ===
I noticed that some of the books suggested for publication copied content from Wikipedia. As you make the published versions, you should remember to credit &quot;Wikipedia&quot; as an author of such books. See [[GFDL]], section 4, letters I and J.

Consider [[English]]... its [[English:Grammar]] page took material from [[Wikipedia:English grammar]]. The user who first created that page at Wikibooks included an obligatory credit to Wikipedia. However, on 15 September 2004, a user removed this credit. I (23 January 2006) recently restored it. I had previously edited some credits to Wikipedia to [[Introduction to Sociology]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:This is a mistaken notion.  Wikipedia is not the &quot;author&quot; of the book, nor is Wikibooks here.  Correctly you can say Wikipedia contributors or Wikibooks contributors if you want to do it at all.  Or simply name the principle authors by looking into the history, such as I've done with some of the PDF versions of Wikibooks.  As for citing sources of the text, especially if it is modified GFDL text, you should credit the source and potentially include the full edit history if it is available and put that into the talk page of the module.  This is precisely what should be done on a transwiki, such as what you are describing for the English Grammar Wikibook module.  That way the actual authors can be cited as appropriate.

:In theory MediaWiki software could go through and determine percentage of content that an individual author has contributed, which would be a better metric for determining authorship.  This would be done through a page diff and you could even assign authorship to each individual word in that manner.  If through this you could say that you must list all authors that have contributed more than 1% of the module or book, that might be a reasonable way to describe authorship.  The same is done for collaboratively written scientific papers, where you see sometimes a list of over 50 authors for a single publication.  Often the citation is simply something like &quot;Jones, D.E.; Franklin, J.R.; et. al&quot;, and sometimes some politicking for whom gets the lead citation.  The same can and should be done for Wikipedia articles and IMHO should be done for Wikibooks as well.  The U.S. Copyright and Trademark Office suggests you list the three or four principle authors when registering trademark, to use a benchmark.  The MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) will only let you list two people for credits like authorship or production of a screenplay, or under some exceptional circumstances four people.  If more that that are involved, the group submitting the credits to the MPAA must simply decide who are the principle authors.

:Also note that the Wikimedia Foundation nor any of the projects claim copyright on anything produced in these projects.  If copyright isn't even being claimed, why should it be even listed as an author?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:47, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== How to label and number figures, tables, etc. for citation? ==

Most paper text books number their figures, tables, etc.
How does one do the equivalent for wikibooks? In particular,
I'd like to have the figures numbered uniquely in a book,
and the tables labeled, so that I could refer to them
symbolically in wiki markup. Is there a preferred way to
do this with templates (or perhaps with a Special: page)
so that I can cite a figure by its name and MediaWiki
insert a link that works even if the figure is moved
from one page to another? If I do this with templates,
is there a convention to follow so that I can define templates
in a book-specific manner so that I don't step on someone
else's template names? I.e. something like namespaces,
but within the Template: namespace. --[[User:Djb|djb]] 03:47, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

:Take a look at [[w:Wikipedia:Citing sources]] and [[w:Wikipedia:Footnotes]], you're bound to find a method you like. If the template in question doesn't exist here yet just copy it over. I'm assuming you're wanting something for referencing ''between'' pages rather than within the same page; therefore you should find a template you like that allows a custom label to be defined (e.g. &quot;venusorbit&quot;), which then allows you to link to it from elsewhere using that same tag (e.g. [[Astronomy/The Planets/Venus#venusorbit]]). However this linking technique won't track the target to any page other than that specified, so any time it gets moved all links to it will have to be manually fixed.
:If you think a particular figure is going to be moving relatively frequently you could always put it on a &quot;hidden&quot; page that doesn't appear on the Table of Contents (e.g. [[Astronomy/venusorbit]]) and then transclude it in like a template (using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ }} instead of [[ ]], like this: {{Astronomy/venusorbit}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;). That way you could link straight to it ([[Astronomy/venusorbit]]) but this would mean that it would be seen out of context of any pages it has appeared on.

* This auto message box on all new pages is '''premature''', because the [[WB:NP|naming policy]] has not been accepted as policy, and the box refers users over to the proposal page which is not clearly written.  This does not give a good impression for new users.  Recommend removing the new page notice (message box on new pages) until the use of a message for this purpose has been discussed and until the naming policy has been actually approved (it appears to have lost an earlier vote, so more reason not to force books to adopt it before another vote).  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 20:37, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
** While [[WB:NP]] may not be formal policy, it is a good guideline and new Wikibooks ought to follow this suggestion closely.  One of the problems we are facing right now on Wikibooks is a little timidity to actually set policy down, and the lack of a good forum to ratify new policies.  The naming policy has been worked on for many months, and represents the best of current conventions that have worked out well for many Wikibooks.  While not a reason to delete content, it is still a good suggestion to try and link all of the modules for a particular Wikibook together through some sort of standardized naming convention '''within''' that collection of documents.  The arguments are over formalizing what sort of standard or standards should be considered acceptable here on Wikibooks, not that you shouldn't have a consistant naming pattern.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:26, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

== WikiProjects ==

Shouldn't we implement WikiProjects here? I work on two wikibooks, [[Mac OS X Tiger]] and [[iLife 06]], and am thinking about starting [[iWork 06]]. It would be great to bring these together under one roof and have them organized by a Macintosh &quot;Wikiproject&quot;. There are other Mac books that could be added as well.

I'd be happy to do this myself, but I thought everyone should vote on it or something first. [[User:Hyperpasta|Hyperpasta]] 20:57, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:We already do have Wikibooks themselves, which is a sort of Wikiproject unto itself in many ways.  There is also the potential to work together under a common interest through the Bookshelf system, and I for one would like to see that utilized more for organizational purposes in a manner similar to how Wikiprojects are run on Wikipedia.  Keep in mind that there aren't nearly as many people here on Wikibooks as there are on Wikipedia, and it may be harder to find a group of like minded people working toward the same goals... especially for collaborative writing purposes.

:At the same time, there is nothing really stopping you from starting anything like a Wikiproject group or even forming them here.  It just hasn't been done before mainly because of the numbers of people involved.  There have been some things like Wikiversity and Wikijunior that are run kinda like a Wikiproject as well, mainly due to the huge scale of the goals for what they want to accomplish.  Wikiversity is a big enough idea that the people involved with that are now seeking full sister-project status with the Wikimedia Foundation.  I don't think you want something that ambitious, but you can try to put something together.  If you want to put something about Wikiproject groups or something like that on [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]], all you really need to do is contact an admin to help make the changes on that page.  I would however suggest that you start by trying to put something into [[Wikibooks:Information technology bookshelf|the Information Technology Bookshelf]] first with a Macintosh-specific equipment subsection, or perhaps into [[Wikibooks:Computer software bookshelf]] where these books current are listed under.  I don't even see a seperate Macintosh software section on that bookshelf right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:50, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== in praise of the snippit ==

I have looked around here and I am a little worried that this site could be a little too book orientated. There seems to be a tendency towards devaluing the snippit the small piece of information that sits alone waiting to be retrieved and added to. Technical references are very much like a big collection of snippits really usually you need some specific information and the rest of the information isn't needed at that time. I've just contributed to a book that last saw an entry in 2003 its a very small book now and may never be  complete but its holding useful snippits of information. what has been written is useful and self contained and accessable. maybe this is all thats needed.

Second point does there need to be one book for a subject I know some information gets duplicated especially foundation material but surely thats good too different approaches to the same subject help greatly, one explanation may not click and the other illuminates.

it shouldnt be a problem for a started project to be abandoned and then retrieved years later. unless theres a chronic shortage of space. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Blackest knight|Blackest knight]] ([[User talk:Blackest knight|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blackest knight|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

That means the notice of the proposed widespread change on Wikibooks pages should be posted where book editors look (Staff Lounge, for example), not just on pages viewed by mainly computer experts. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
*Don't bite book editors.  Please remove widespread message boxes, which were applied unilaterally without observing etiquette or prior discussion or consensus.  The message boxes could be put back after they have observed Wikibooks etiquette.  For example, the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#New article notice]] here had already implemented the widespread message box before posting the notice, before discussion and consensus.  The widespread and automatic message box, which has suddenly appeared on existing books' talk pages, is potentially embarassing to book editors.  
::As an example of how to embarass a book editor, suppose that the main editor of this book, [[Wikiversity:School of Law]] has invited his colleagues to contribute articles for the book, and then an accusing message box appears on the book pages, along with a category box marking the page as a problem.  
:::The message box here is misleading and it could have been improved by discussion.  It trys to force book editors to conform to a proposed policy [[WB:NP]] which has not been approved, and which appears to have lost a previous vote, and which is presently unclear and not well written even as a proposal. 
::The spirit of Wikibooks is that many minds working together with goodwill make a better result.  We need that spirit in policy making as well. Bureaucrats should be helpful and courteous, and not use their powers to obtain their own preferences. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
:* I'm afraid I don't fully understand the your complaint.  As far as I know, the message box you refer to, namely [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]], appears on edit pages only.  It does not appear on the module itself or on the talk page.  I can't see how the notice counts as an accusation or an embarassment to any author or editor.   (I do understand that you disagree with the content and with the lack of notice before the change was made&amp;mdash;but that is a separate issue) in particular, I am unaware of any other messages automatically being placed on on hundreds of pages.  Could you give a few (maybe 2 or 3) examples where an automatic message was placed on a module page or a talk page so I can get a better idea of what you are talking about?  Thank you.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:16, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
::* The example of a way to embarrass an author was given as [[Wikiversity:School of Law]].  The current message box at [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]] is not embarrassing but is only cluttering for books which do not need any reminder about page naming.  It was also put on without discussion, and with a POV purpose. However, last week the message box on edit page for my book module had a different message which was not only embarassing, it was also incorrect.  The message from Wikibooks said that the page needed cleanup because it was in violation of the Wikibooks naming policy.  That incorrect message is now gone without leaving trace in the page history.  Wikibooks does not presently have an accepted page naming policy, so not possible to be in violation.  Anyway, I don't like the message box clutter on my book edit pages or the intention of the message box to induce newbie editors to change the page naming scheme because they have been mislead into believing that the naming scheme is incorrect (the message box points readers to [[WB:NP|page naming polciy]] which was, before last night, written in a misleading way to imply that only one type of page naming scheme is permitted).  I think that the message box at [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]] was just a more subtle attempt to implement the bureaucrat writer's policy POV, without discussion, than the cleanup message that appeared last week.  I don't like this sneaky method and would like to know that such things won't happen again. Also see [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy#Bad tactics]] -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 12:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

*Fair Treatment of book editors.  Please let book editors have as much freedom of choice as possible about how to set up the books.  Please do not create an enforceable policy (law) which unnecessarily limits other people's freedom of choice just to please your preference.  Sometimes consistency and standards are needed, but since these limit freedom of choice (and sometimes these limitations are justified), please do have a discussion first about the real need for the proposed limitation.  Why is the consistency needed?  Diversity is often a good thing; it allows creativity and new methods to evolve.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I think we should talk about concrete problems. I suppose that when you write about &quot;bureaucrats&quot; you mean generally all the people having sysop/bureaucrat permissions. Nonetheless, most of your objections seem to be addressed to myself, so I will try to explain few things.
:: You write about &quot;bureaucrat etiquette&quot; - does it mean that my behaviour was rude or aggressive?
:: Most of your objections concentrate on naming policy and actions connected with it. We can make philosophical discussions about spirit of Wikibooks, but the fact is that this project faces big problems with maintaining quality. We (I mean people doing maintenance tasks generally) are understaffed and can't take care of everything. Lots of new modules get orphaned because their author haven't linked them properly. There are plenty of pages that got lost because someone changed TOC of parent book. Modules which are not linked properly are less likely to be corrected by users and are good target for vandals. Reality is that Wikibooks has lots of rubbish in the database: pages in other languages (already transwikied in most cases), simply vandalism, gibberish, unused files, ultra-stubs, orphaned pages etc. Risk of such problems is reduced if a module is properly named (so you can reach its parent book), book is placed in a bookshelf and new books appear on list on main page. Unfortunately, most of our contributors either forget or don't know about these simply rules. We cannot correct every editor manually. Small box appearing in new pages reminding about neccessary actions will hopefully make contributors take care about their work without our assistance.
:: Now naming convention notice. Many books are written in way that makes reading them hard (because of lack of navigation). Sometimes parts of books are orphaned and not linked to main TOC. And there is a plenty of such modules, we can't cope with everything. That's why special template was created, it's fast in use. If I read discussion page of every book needing cleanup I see, checked if it is active or dead, I wouldn't have time to do anything. I can give my full attention to only a few books when I do cleanup.
:: You write about fair treatment of contributors. Firstly, you are exaggerating size of naming convention cleanup action. Look at the [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Cleanup-NC|page list]] - there are only a few books, it's completely microscopic scope. There were not bot actions, no massive template inserting you are suggesting here. We leave contributors freedom but contributors don't seem to be interested with the project standards. In many cases it's not contributors' fault that a book does not conform our polices - hence the book might be older than the policy. But there are some books that have illogical structure or contain serious meritorical or markup errors. Cleanup messages are not ment to &quot;punish&quot; book authors, yet they show what needs to be corrected clearly and invite other contributors to help.
:: Later, you write that decisions should be made after discussion and consensus. In my opinion, this is a wiki and philosophy of wiki is to be bold. There aren't many active contributors here and every discussion is usually quite long. When it comes to serious decisions, yes, we ought to sit and talk and we do it. I haven't invented things I have done. New article notice idea is taken from English Wikinews and naming policy isn't something new, I haven't written it and I even haven't worked on it at all. Similar cleanup messages are common at Wikipedia and noone screams that they are vandalisms or violate his/her freedom as an author there.
:: Finally: &quot;Bureaucrats should be helpful and courteous, and not use their powers to obtain their own preferences.&quot; It's not pleasant to hear such words after everyday peace of work. I'm not using my powers to force naming convention or other standards, because I haven't blocked or reverted anyone for such reasons. I always answer if someone asks me for help and I help newcomers if only I have enough time. I admit I can sometimes loose faith in &quot;Assume Good Faith&quot; rule after recent changes patrol, but why do you assume bad faith on &quot;bureaucrats&quot;? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:41, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

I would like to point out that generally I support most of Derbeth's actions here on Wikibooks.  We do need to be a little bit more casual with the cleanup notices, but the point being made here is that there are some (unfortunately few) people that are monitoring what is happening on Wikibooks.  Most of this effort is to raise the standards for content here, and turn Wikibooks into something more than just a random collection of textual thoughts.  There is a mission to Wikibooks, and I hope that new contributors cna take a look at what we've done here and the intentions of where we are going.

The most important thing anybody who is new to Wikibooks can do is to understand that one person's opinion on something is just that:  One single opinion.  There are places you can complain if you need to bring others into the discussion, and most changes on Wikibooks are generally reversable as well, including page deletion and user blocks.  If you disagree with a page markup tag, you can make a comment on the discussion page for that module and perhaps even remove the tag if you strongly disagree.  Try to find out why it was put there in the first place and understand we are mostly trying to help you as an author out with the content of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:23, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

== CVG is Dewey 794 ==

Computer and video game books were filed under Dewey 794 in every library I've been any in. Hence I think [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]] should be placed under [[Dewey 700]]. (It would get cluttered if we put each individual title there — one of the big differences between Wikibooks and a traditional library, IMO — unless we managed to break it down into further decimal places.) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Seahen|Seahen]] ([[User talk:Seahen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Seahen|contribs]]) 00:00, 29 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Feedback sought: Building a book TOC, sections, and navigational aid ==

I would like some comments about the way I've structures the [[Java Programming]]
book. My goals were to create a book table of contents which you see
on the main page and also have a navigational aid which we can include
via a template on all pages in the book. That nav aid will appear at
the bottom of each page. It links to the each of the main sections of the book,
as well as to the book's main table of contents and the [[:Category:Java Programming]].

To implement this, I created templates for each of the sections,
such as [[Template:Java Programming/Getting Started]] and [[Template:Java Programming/Language Fundamentals]]. The template
includes the outline for the section and perhaps a very brief introduction.
I then include the template in the main TOC and also include the template
in the pages I created for each of the main sections. For example,
see [[Java Programming/Getting Started]] and [[Java Programming/Language Fundamentals]]
which includes the aforementioned templates.
Finally, I also created a
template [[Template:Java Programming]] to put at the bottom of each page;
it puts the page in the [[:Category:Java Programming]] and also
includes the book's navigational aid: [[Template:Java Programming Nav]].

What do you all think? Is there a better way?

:Well, you need to fix [[Template:Java Programming/Overview]].  It has red links to blue-link pages.  (The main TOC gets it right.)  One other detail.  According to [[WB:NP]], templates are susposed to follow the false namespace (colon) convention.  The book pages are supposed to follow the slash convention (as you have done), but the book-specific templates are supposed to use the colon convention. &lt;small&gt;''- unsigned''&lt;/small&gt;
::''Thanks for noticing the broken links; I've fixed them. I'll try to migrate to the [[WB:NP]] recommendation (I had followed the pattern of the  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=Ada%2F&amp;namespace=10 Ada book's templates]) --[[User:Djb|djb]] 23:18, 29 January 2006 (UTC)''
: Most people put there navigational templates at the top or floating to the side&amp;mdash;so I suppose they think that works better.  Your navigational template sees too large for that, so maybe bottom is best for you.  Otherwise, looks fine. &lt;small&gt;''- unsigned''&lt;/small&gt;

:: There seems to no consensus on whether to use colon-slash ([[Template:Java Programming/Overview]]) or colon-colon (Template:Java Programming:Overview) convention. I used colon-colon in the past, but am switching to colon slash because &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Java Programming:Overview}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; looks like the namespace is &quot;Java Programming:&quot; instead of &quot;Template:&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:I can't find any sign that you've uploaded it (see [[Special:Contributions/GRAHAMUK]] for all your contributions thus far). What filename did you give it, and are you sure you didn't get an error message? One of our other programming projects ([[C++ Programming|C Plus Plus]] I think) set up a Sourceforge project for their source code. I'm not sure if zips can be uploaded here, but if not then that might be a good solution. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

::I get a warning &quot;.zip is not a recommended image format&quot;. Well, duh. I assumed that was just a warning and it had uploaded the file, but it appears as though it hasn't. Is there a a special upload for files other than images? [[User:GRAHAMUK|GRAHAMUK]] 23:05, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Yeah, I thought as much. Unfortunately file types are determined via PHP changes, which requires asking the devs, who in turn say they're too busy and/or it's too dangerous a filetype to enable. Hmpf. I guess Sourceforge is still the most probable option. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:41, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

==Variable Slope Curves==

The solutions to this are either, use the Multi-BP envelope Macro which provides a very flexible graphic breakpoint tool a bit like those in Absynth and FM7.  (Under no circumstances attempt to understand how the internals of this module work without a packet of asprin).

===Alternative Solutions===

Or take a regular envelope and raise the output to the power of something (numbers between 0 and 1 will make the envelope start more dramatically, numbers greater than 1 will produce a curve that starts gently then accelerates).

If you're working on a Mac, there's a very handy Grapher tool in the Utilities folder that you can plug equations into to experiment with.

Tagalog is the largest of the [[w:Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and, as Filipino, the national language of the Philippines.  It is a member of the Austronesian languages and is a relative to other languages such as Malay and Indonesian, to which it shares similarities to, like stops and sentence structure.

The language is natively spoken by 22 million Filipinos throughout the Philippines and as a second language by more than 65 million Filipinos nationwide.  It is the sixth-largest language in the United States and is the language of the large Filipino diaspora, totaling some 11 million Filipinos.

Tagalog also has a vocabulary enriched by its pre-colonial and colonial history.  Spanish is the single largest contributor to the Filipino vocabulary and as such Filipino seems to the foreign ear to sound somewhat like Spanish.  Other contributors include Arabic, Sanskrit, Min Nan Chinese, Malay, Nahuatl, Tamil, Persian and other Philippine languages such as Kapampangan and Ilocano.

As Filipino, the Philippines' national language, Tagalog is the language of the media, public and some private education, conversation, the clergy and even in adminstration.  It is a co-official language along with English and is the lingua franca of the Philippines.  As such, Filipino is one of the many symbols of nationhood that binds the Philippine nation together.

Tagalog was once written using Baybayin, more commonly known as Alibata, a script based on the Kavi script of Java.  The script enjoyed a high literacy rate until the Spanish arrival, which led to its extinction.  Today, Tagalog is written in the Latin alphabet, but with two different letter sets: the older Abakada (with 20 letters) and the newer Alpabetong Filipino (Filipino alphabet, with 28 letters).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) inserts [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13AB of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13AB of ICTA]], which is the legislation covering the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Non-corporate distribution rate|non-corporate distribution rate]].&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) inserts [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule A2 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A2 to ICTA]], which contains the detailed rules for the non-corporate distribution rate. Subsection (3) makes a consequential amendment to the introduction of the non-corporate distribution rate.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) provides that the inserted provisions apply to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Distribution|distributions]] made on or after 1 April 2004. Subsection (5) deems there, where necessary, to be two separate [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting periods]], one ending on 31 March 2004, the other beginning on 1 April 2004, for the purposes of this rule, with profits being allocated to the deemed accounting periods on a time basis unless that basis is unreasonable or unjust.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (5) sets the non-corporate distribution rate for the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Financial year|financial year]] beginning 1 April 2004 at 19%.

At the moment, one of the best documentation for Blender Stride features can be found here:
[http://www.telusplanet.net/public/kugyelka/blender/tutorials/stride/stride.html Blender Stride Tutorial], which takes on where the [http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Advanced_Stride_suppor.720.0.html Official Blender Stride Page] takes off.  Good luck!  A simpler and shorter, but still very good tutorial can be found here: [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/NLA_Editor_and_Stride_Path#Stride_Support Blender wiki: NLA Editor and Stride Path].
