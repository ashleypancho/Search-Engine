      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
When preparing your advertisement, you should first define your product's Unique Selling Proposition (USP). To find the USP, ask yourself &quot;How is this product different?&quot;

Make a list of your product's pros and cons. This will help you think about what message you want your ad to send.

'''Positioning''' is an attempt to place a product into a certain category in consumers' minds: &quot;the best&quot;, for example (best deodorant, best soda, etc.) (&quot;The best&quot; is, however, extremely difficult to establish for a new brand). Types of positioning are '''Against''' (eg, Hertz vs. Avis, 7-up vs. colas), '''Niche''' (a sub-division of a category), '''New''', and '''Traditional'''.

A Brand Character Statement sets the tone for an entire campaign.

A simple way to start preparing your advertisement is with this statement: &quot;Advertising will ____A_____ ____B_____ that ____C_____ is ____D_____. Support will be ____E_____. Tone will be ____F_____.&quot; where A is a verb, B is a target demographic (such as, &quot;girls between 14-18 years old&quot;), C is your product, D is an adjective or phrase. E is what the meat of your ad will be. F is your ad's &quot;attitude&quot;.

For example, &quot;Advertising will ''convince'' ''artistic types age 18-35'' that ''Apple computers'' are ''hip and cool.'' Support will be ''two men discussing Macs and PCs.'' Tone will be ''humorous.''&quot;

Part B of this strategy statement is the target audience. Advertisers use many methods to gain information about this group, including demographics, psychographics (how the target thinks), and focus groups.

Part C is the product itself. Advertisers spend time studying this as well. Important questions to ask are &quot;Why would anybody buy this?&quot; &quot;What's the product's advantage?&quot; and &quot;What is the client's image?&quot; The last one is important to consider in order to make sure that your ad doesn't jar with the public perception the company has created for itself. For example, hip or edgy ads probably won't go over well with a company that has a public image of being &quot;conservative&quot; and/or &quot;family friendly.&quot;

'''Support''' is anything that can demonstrate or otherwise back up the premise presented in the first sentence. Some examples are facts (e.g., statistics), images, or a scenario.
*'''Reason Why''' - How a product delivers a benefit.
*'''Combination''' - Two or more benefits are demonstrated.
*'''Permission to Believe''' - A clever story or character(s) make claim(s) believable.
*'''Nine-Wheel Logic''' - Specious support used when real support would be too awkward.
*'''Image''' - An attitude or lifestyle that advertiser attempts to link to product.

A strong &quot;call to action&quot; is another element used to good effect.

===Exercises===
#Pick 5 products and write up USPs for them.
#Pick 10 products and write a strategic statement for each one using the formula above.
#For each of the 5 types of support mentioned above, find one ad that exemplifies it.
#Choose a brand and reposition it.

==The FCB Grid==
[[Image:Fcb grid.png|right|thumb|300px|The FCB Grid.]]

The FCB Grid was created by Richard Vaughn. With this model, messages are categorized by &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot;, &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high.&quot;

*Low Think (practicality, pragmatism)
*High Think
*Low Feel (sensuality, pleasure)
*High Feel (product as extension of self)

A '''Low Feel''' commercial demonstrates the pleasure obtained by using the product. This approach is popular for foods.

A '''High Feel''' commercial could emphasize how the product makes the consumer hip or cool. This approach is popular for advertising products like clothing, shoes, or sportscars.
==The Harris Grid==
[[Image:harris grid.png|left|thumb|300px|The Harris Grid.]]

Tom Harris created the Harris Grid for preparing MPR campaigns. It measures a product's level of interest in consumers versus the level of interest in mass media.

Some examples:
*'''High Consumer/High Media'''. Computers, cars, movies, and high-tech gadgets fall into this category. These products ''make'' news, so they should have high-profile campaigns.

*'''Low Consumer/High Media'''. Cereals, vitamins, and medications fall into this category. These products also make news, but are not very interesting to consumers. It is therefore important to highlight new scientific findings that are beneficial to the product's image.

==Y&amp;R Creative Workplan==
The firm of Young &amp; Rubicam have a process called the &quot;Creative Workplan.&quot; This crafts a strategy that plans how to attain an ''objective'', which solves a ''problem'', defined by a '''key fact'''. In other words, the advertising is designed in order to solve a problem. For example, the problem may be low sales, or a need to change the corporation's image.

To start, define the problem and identify the key fact showing the cause of it. Then, state your objective (what to do to solve the problem).

The four parts of the Creative Workplan's Creative Strategy are:
#'''Prospect Definition''' - The &quot;prospect&quot; referred to here is the demographic you are aiming your ad at (also known as a target audience). How is the product used by the prospect? Use demographics and psychographics.
#'''Principal Competition''' - Why would the consumer buy the competition's product instead?
#'''Consumer Benefit or Promise''' - What does the product do for the prospect?
#'''Reason Why''' - Rationale for how a product delivers on its claim (e.g., &quot;Avocados are good for you because they contain 'heart-healthy' fats that help lower cholesterol&quot;)

==GE Focus System==
*'''Focus on the Receiver'''
*'''Focus on the Proposition'''
*'''Dramatize the Proposition''' - &quot;Break the boredom barrier!&quot;

==Return on Investment (ROI) System==
The ROI System was designed the firm of DDB/Needham. While covering the same territory as other systems (the target, a product claim, support for the claim) it also looks at creating a corporate &quot;personality&quot;, as well as personality of individual products. Another important aspect of the ROI System is &quot;aperture&quot;: the timing and placement of the ad to maximize success. The system helps you to determine the cheapest media for the greatest impact.

==The Ladder==

[[Image:Ladder.png|right|thumb]]

Types of advertising messages can be arranged in a hierarchical ladder, based on what perspective they use to discuss the product.

*Values (''This product makes me Y'')
*Consumer Benefit (''This product helps me Y'')
*Product Benefit (''X does Y'')
*Product Feature (''X can do Y'')
*Attribute (''X is Y'')

The further up the ladder you go, the more ''consumer-based'' the message becomes. The further down you go, the more ''product-based'' it becomes. You can see that the first two statements tell how the product helps the consumer (&quot;me&quot;), while the other statements focus more and more on the product (X).

Here are some examples:

*Values (''Axe Body Spray makes me irresistible to women'')
==Try/Keep/Retry==
This strategy works on three types of customers: future, current, and past. Instead of just trying to get new customers, work on maintaining current ones, and find out how to bring former customers back.

*TRY to get new customers
*KEEP current customers
*RETRY former customers

TRY techniques focus on offers to bring in new customers, and something to bring them back (a &quot;bounceback&quot;).

KEEP techniques work on increasing current customers' frequency of purchases and &quot;ticket size&quot; (how much money they spend).

RETRY techniques attempt to figure out why the customer left the company, and how to give them a reason to return.

==Brainstorming==
===Exploding the Dot===
===Learn/Feel/Do Circle===
==The Time/Money/Quality Triangle==
The Time/Money/Quality Triangle illustrates an advertising truism, that &quot;you can't have all three.&quot; If there is little time or money, then ad quality will suffer. The more time and/or money that is available to the project, the higher the quality can be. However, the level of quality must be appropriate to the product...not all products should have high-quality ads!

In her book ''Hitting the Sweet Spot: How Consumer Insights Can Inspire Better Marketing and Advertising'', Lisa Fortini-Campbell argues that an advertising &quot;sweet spot&quot; can be attained by combining consumer insight and brand insight.

A '''concept board''' can be used to demonstrate your ad campaign to your client. These boards (often quite large, so they can be appreciated by a group) outline the core idea of your campaign, a &quot;key visual&quot;, and perhaps some bullet points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Political==
Tony Schwartz pioneered the concept of &quot;resonance&quot;. Some of his most well-known work are his political ads. One of his TV ads for Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign against Barry Goldwater was legendary. As a little girl picked petals off a daisy, a voice counted down from 10, followed by a nuclear explosion. Known as ''Daisy'', this commercial is considered to be instrumental in Johnson's victory.

Another well-known political ad that is believed to have tipped an election are the anti-Dukakis, &quot;Willie Horton&quot; ads during the 1988 presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis and George Bush. Willie Horton was a convict serving time for murder in Massachusetts. When Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts, he escaped while on furlough and raped someone. This incident was alluded to in Republican ads, attempting to convince the public that Horton's escape showed that the Democrats were soft on crime. Like the Daisy ad, it is believed that the ad was instrumental in Bush's victory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Radio==
Important aspects of a radio ad are duration and tempo. Some ways to use tempo include pausing for emphasis, and making the tone competitive or mellow.
Radio advertisers try to make a &quot;natural rhythm&quot;: using emphasis to create beats in words and phrases.
===Types===
*'''Pitch''' - An announcer talking.
*'''Situation''' - A dramatization, or &quot;story&quot;
*'''Song'''

Other types of radio ads are combinations of these three:
*'''Bed''' - Pitch with a Song background.
*'''Donut''' - A Song with a Pitch in the middle.
*'''Tag''' - A Song with a Pitch at the end.
*'''Vignette''' - A Pitch, followed by a Situation, followed by a Song

The basic structure of a radio ad is Context (beginning), Content (middle), Conclusion (end).

      <comment>/* Direct Marketing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Print==

There are six types of print ads: '''One-Liner''', '''News''', '''Spiral''', '''Story''', '''Sermon''', and '''Outline.'''

Print ads use a combination of headlines, subheadings, body text and/or images. Often, there is a logo or slug, for brand identification, as well.

To be effective, headlines must be attention-grabbing. They should &quot;draw in&quot; a viewer. A headline should also be a complete message.

Types of headlines are '''News''', '''Questions''', and '''Testimonials'''.

However, it has been estimated that only 10% of readers will actually read an ad. So, make sure the product appears in a picture or is mentioned in the headline.

==Direct Marketing==
'''Direct Marketing''' is mailed to the target audience. One type of mailing is sent in a standard business envelope.  The envelope-mailing has many parts: the '''Insert''', '''Letter''', '''Brochure''', and '''BRE (Business Reply Envelope)''', as well as the '''Envelope''' itself. The mailing may have some of these elements, or all of them.

The first key to a successful envelope mailing is to get your target to open it. Obviously, if the target doesn't open the envelope and read some of the material, your money is wasted. The envelope may have exhortations to get the recipient to open the letter (e.g., &quot;URGENT!&quot;).

The Insert is a small one or two-sided sheet of paper with a summary of the mailing. If you want to use bullet points, here's a good place to put them.

For the Letter, have a good first line that hooks them. Try to hit on a topic of discontent for the reader (which your product will solve). Avoid talking about the company or the product's history. Talk about the reader, and his/her interests. Make sure to sum up the product's main points in the first paragraph. Repeat those benefits often throughout the letter.

The &quot;Lift&quot; Note is a trifold pamphlet, often with testimonials extolling the worthiness of the product. It may end with a closer (&quot;But wait...there's more!&quot;).

The Business Reply Envelope is a postage-paid, pre-addressed envelope to make it easy for the target to reply. You should use a BRE even if you supply a &quot;more convenient&quot; method of reply or payment.

A postcard is the most basic form of direct mail. The size can range from 4.25'' x 6''(minimum allowed by post office) up to a jumbo postcard (6'' x 10''). The larger the postcard the more visible it will appear in the mail. The typical postcard is printed four-color process on the front, and one-color black on the un-coated back side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Television==
One important thing to remember is that a TV commercial has many more variables than a print or radio ad. This means that there is much more that can go wrong. It is important to decide, during early planning stages, what the job positions for the ad will be (art directors, copywriters, video technicians, etc.), and who will fulfill each one.

To make a rough draft of the ad, storyboards or animatics are used. (Animatics are like an animated storyboard.)

The three stages of making a TV ad are: Planning, Production, and Post-production.

==Types==
The six types of TV commercials are '''Slice''', '''Talking Person''', '''Demo''', '''Visual''', '''Graphic Collage''', and '''Combination'''.

The '''Slice''', or &quot;Slice of Life&quot;, is a dramatization (story). To make an effective Slice, create a situation where the product plays a key role. Make it simple and interesting.

A '''Talking Person''' presents a spokesman for the brand (e.g. Jack-in-the-Box's Jack, or Wendy's Dave Thomas). A testimonial commercial is a type of Talking Person.

A '''Demo''' is a presentation of the product's usage. Typical Demo types are:
*''Side-by-Side'': The product is pitted against its competition (or imaginary competition, such as &quot;Brand X&quot;).
*''Before and After'': Demonstration of the problem and solution.
*''Product Performance'': An exhibition of the product's strengths.
*''In-Use'' and ''New-Use'': In-Use shows the product being used. New-Use shows a new use for an old product.
*''Torture Test'': An (often humorous) demonstration of the product's durability.
A torture test is an &quot;extreme&quot; demonstration of a product performance, not durability.

The '''Visual''' primarily uses imagery to sell the product.

'''Graphic Collage''' is a postmodern style often used in music videos. It appropriates audio and video, and may employ '''supers''' (super-imposition).

A '''Combination''' uses two or more of these types together.

==Planning==
Planning steps:
#Start at the end. Decide what the ad's final impact will be.
#Plan visuals.
#Plan movement.

The beginning provides context. Common mistakes encountered here are overwriting, audience confusion, and irrelevancy.

The middle connects the target to the brand. Here is where the support is given. This part requires extreme clarity.

The end presents the ad's punchline, or final thought. A logo or other brand identification is typically displayed here.

Make pre-production notes. Things to include are 
*Location (''Where will the footage be shot?'')
*Talent (''Who will be acting? Providing music?'')
*Special effects (if any)
*Props (if any)
*Bids &amp; budgeting (''How will we pay for this?'')
*Scheduling

Profiling consumers: Know your audience. Be careful not to offend them!

You're not just selling a product, you're selling an ''image''.

Extreme close-ups of the product are used to create a sense of intimacy.

Sometimes conceptual art (storyboards, etc.) turn out to be unrealistic (such as a winking dog in a dog food commercial). This is called the &quot;Winking Dog Syndrome&quot;. The question to ask is: &quot;Can the final cut meet the expectations made by the design?&quot;

A similar problem, the &quot;Rubber Pencil&quot;, comes about when impossible proportions or angles create problems with the ad during production. It is important to resolve all these issues during the planning stages.

==Production==
Make a &quot;shot list.&quot; Make sure that only one person talks to the director, to avoid confusion.

==Post-Production==
Audio post-production involves &quot;direct voice&quot; (synchronized to video) or &quot;voice tracks&quot; (such as announcers), as well as music and sound effects.

Video post-production includes usage of animation and addition of stock footage. ''Pre-scoring'' is preparing audio before video, and ''post-scoring'' is preparing audio after video.

Direct Response Television (DRTV) often takes the form of infomercials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ethics==
Advertisers, like lawyers, are sometimes criticized for the clients they accept, and the messages they send. Advertising is arguably a powerful tool that can be used to influence the masses to a large extent. Therefore, it is important that advertisers be made aware of their responsibilities to the public good.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Feminist Criticism==
Social critics like Jean Kilbourne have blamed many of women's image problems on commercials. In her film series ''Killing Us Softly'', Kilbourne argues that ads deliver powerful messages that shape women's self-images. She claims these ads equate romance and success with normalcy, and make it appear that beauty is the most important concern of women. Furthermore, ads perpetuate a stereotype of the &quot;perfect&quot; woman, implying that this goal is attainable by buying the right beauty products, diet aids, etc. In reality, only about 5% of women have model bodies. Kilbourne also points out that ads containing both sexes often have the male literally looking down on the female, implying a subtle sexism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Salad Brassicas==
I have found that in Rhode Island, if I broadcast brassica seed for salad and then disc it or rake it in, after September 6th, there is very little weed competition, and I get a better yield for the amount of bed space used.  

==Lettuce==
We get many more cuttings off of direct seeded salad mix when the soul has been amended with generous amounts of compost that if it is planted in poor soil, its usually sweeter as well.

==Melons==
Do well planted onto plastic mulch.

==Asparagus==
We are new to this, but we grew Asparagus from seed this year and transplanted it without digging a big trench, which is usually recommended when planting asparagus, our plants seem to be very healthy, I don't think you really need to dig a big trench.

==Carrots==
Seed carrots after a short bare fallow if you have a lot of weeds, and be sure to give them plenty of compost, then they will grow quickly and the bare fallow will take care of a lot of your weeds.

==Leeks==
We seed our leeks a few to a cell, shooting for 3 to a cell, then transplant them all together in their clumps of 3, with the clumps 9&quot; apart, we then either harvest them or thin out the small ones, selling them as early season baby leeks, and allow the biggest ones to become full size storage leeks.  Because they are competing with each other, they get taller and have longer shanks, we dont have as much trouble with weeds because the plants are easier to hoe and mulch, and we get a better yield out of a bed.

==Garlic==
We have landscapers bring leaves to our farm for us to use as mulch, this year we had one of the landscapers who brings already chopped up leaves (you don't want to use whole leaves because they will blow away) drive onto the field, being careful to drive in the pathway and not smush the bed, and dump the leaves directly on the field, where we could spread them out with a pitch fork, saving us the trouble of moving them our selves.

==Dry Beans==
At our five-acre vegetable farm in Western Washington, the two biggest issues with growing dry beans are 1) getting them to fully mature and dry before the autumn rain and 2) threshing and cleaning.  Some labor saving practices related to #1: Choose appropriate varieties and plant as early as possible.  Weed early and well.  Big weeds late in the season will harbor dew and soil moisture and keep your bean plants green when you want them to dry down.  We use a pretty close in-row spacing of two inches to reduce in-row weeds.  If you are watering, you'll want to cut off irrigation early enough.  NDSU extension recommends stopping irrigation when half of the plants' leaves or three-quarters of the pods are yellowing.  When beans are ready to harvest, we pull plants and windrow them in the field for a few sunny days if possible, flipping them over occasionally.  If only rain is ahead, you can bring plants into a greenhouse or other dry place until pods are crispy.  Burlap sacks work well for transporting and storage at this stage.  As for #2: We use an electric-powered, modified chipper-shredder to thresh the beans.  WSU has designs to make one at http://sustainableseedsystems.wsu.edu/nicheMarket/smallScaleThreshing.html.  I hear that driving over your beans with a truck and/or dancing on top of them will work, too.  After threshing, a good screening system will save you much time down the road.  You can make simple screens with hardware cloth and wooden frames.  I'd use a 1/2&quot; top screen to keep out large trash and an 1/8&quot; bottom screen to let the fines through.  A box fan works well for winnowing.  To cut down on the final cleaning time, leave moldy pods in the field at harvest.  Once moldy beans get mixed in with the rest, it is very tedious to get them out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers to supplement their income, help manage the supply of agricultural commodities, and bolster the supply of such commodities on international markets. Examples of such commodities include wheat, feed grains (grain used as fodder, such as maize, sorghum, barley, and oats), cotton, milk, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, and oilseeds such as soybeans.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is required by law to subsidize over two dozen commodities. Between 1996 and 2002, an average of $16 billion/year was paid by programs authorized by federal legislation dating back to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, the Agricultural Act of 1949, and the Commodity Credit Corporation, among others.

The beneficiaries of the subsidies have changed as U.S. agriculture changes. In the 1930s, about 25% of the U.S. population resided on the nation's 6,000,000 small farms. By 1997, 157,000 large farms accounted for 72% of farm sales, with only 2% of the U.S. population residing on farms.

Proponents of agricultural subsidies argue that they are necessary because of the unusual nature of the agricultural industry. For one, a big part of crop yield, and therefore price, is based upon the weather both at home and abroad in remote parts of the world. Because of the uncertain nature of the weather, price subsidies are necessary to ensure that farmers receive a liveable wage.

One criticism of subsidy comes from conservatives and libertarians arguing that subsidies are against the will of the free market. For example, poor store owners don't receive relief from the market, and therefore neither should poor farmers. Furthermore, justification of subsidies from the uncertain nature of the weather can be countered by considering that many other areas of economy experience equivalent risks for which the free market can provide solutions, e.g. insurance.

Economists strongly rebuke the benefits of reduced retail prices derived from subsidising over-production. If the government were to subsidize car manufacturers to produce more cars then this would indeed lower the showroom price, but it would be the consumer's own money collected through taxes that would be used to fund the over-production. It would be impossible for the lower retail costs to outweigh the additional production costs, otherwise the manufacturers could simply implement this technique themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Agricultural policy describes a set of laws relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Outcomes can range from guaranteed supply level, price stability, product quality, product selection, land use or employment.

Governments pay subsidies to encourage domestic production of a good. Such subsidies are necessary when a government wants to alter the free-market outcome in product markets. The subsidies transfer some costs of production from producers to the government, allowing production at above-market costs. The effect of Western food subsidies [360$ billion] is overwhelmingly to reduce world prices. For decades the 3rd world has earned only half the free market price for food, its primary product. Consumption subsidies can also be used to alter markets. A consumption subsidy offsets a portion of the purchase price of a product.

Price floors or ceilings set a minimum or maximum price for a product. Price controls alter free-market outcomes by encouraging over-production by a price floor or over-consumption by a price ceiling.

A government can erect trade barriers to limit the quantity of goods imported (in the case of a quota) or enact tariffs to raise the domestic price of imported products. These barriers give preference to domestic producers.

Some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption. Significant dependence on foreign food producers makes a country strategically vulnerable in the event of war, blockade or embargo. Maintaining adequate domestic capability allows for food self-sufficiency that lessens the risk of supply shocks due to geopolitical events. Agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share. This may be a short term way of encouraging an industry until it is large enough to thrive without aid. Or it may be an ongoing subsidy designed to allow a product to compete with or undercut foreign competition. This may produce a net gain for a government despite the cost of interventions because it allows a country to build up an export industry or reduce imports.

Subsidising farming may encourage people to remain on the land and obtain some income. This might be relevant to a third world country with many peasant farmers, but it may also be a consideration to more developed countries such as Poland. This has a very high unemployment rate, much farmland and retains a large rural population growing food for their own use. Price controls may be used to assist poor citizens. Many countries have used this method of welfare support as it delivers cheap food to the poorest without the need to assess people to give them financial aid.

See green economists. Some argue that small gardens and greenhouses should be favored, especially if produce is consumed locally. Some argue for tax, tariff and trade rules to exempt such production for local use, especially family farm or farm co-op production, and strongly deny that agricultural and industrial policy should be linked, or should be subject to the same law. One rationale is that local production of organic produce by families in their own gardens for their own consumption is not taxed or regulated, and that little or no use of the energy-and-land-intensive transport system, or energy-and-labor intensive regulation system is required for these same people to sell the same product to neighbors.
* Safe trade rules to encourage organic farming and self-reliance, led by opponents of genetically modified food and monoculture.
* Fair trade rules to ensure that poor farmers in underdeveloped nations that produce crops primarily for export are not exploited to put local farmers in developing nations out of work - which advocates consider a dangerous &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in agricultural labor and safety standards. Opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations (agribusinesses) which are hardly deserving of sympathy, and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty.

When rich countries subsidize domestic production, excess output is often given to the developing world as foreign aid. This process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world, because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies. In developing nations where these effects are most severe, small farmers could no longer afford basic inputs and were forced to sell their land.

&quot;Consider a farmer in Ghana who used to be able to make a living growing rice. Several years ago, Ghana was able to feed and export their surplus. Now, it imports rice. From where? Developed countries. Why? Because it's cheaper. Even if it costs the rice producer in the developed world much more to produce the rice, he doesn't have to make a profit from his crop. The government pays him to grow it, so he can sell it more cheaply to Ghana than the farmer in Ghana can. And that farmer in Ghana? He can't feed his family anymore.&quot;(Lyle Vanclief, Canadian Minister of Agriculture)

According to The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat and rice are sold below the cost of production, or dumped. Dumping rates are approximately forty percent for wheat, between twenty-five and thirty percent for corn (maize), approximately thirty percent for soybeans, fifty-seven percent for cotton, and approximately twenty percent for rice. For example, wheat is sold for forty percent below cost.

According to Oxfam, &quot;If developed nations eliminated subsidy programs, the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 %, plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium. ... exporters can offer US surpluses for sale at prices around half the cost of production; destroying local agriculture and creating a captive market in the process.&quot;

Free trade advocates desire the elimination of all market distorting mechanisms (subsidies, tariffs, regulations) and argue that, as with free trade in all areas, this will result in aggregate benefit for all. This position is particularly popular in competitive agricultural exporting nations in both the developed and developing world, some of whom have banded together in the Cairns Group lobby. Canada's Department of Agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about $4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved.

Many countries don't grow enough food to feed their own populations. These nations must buy food from other countries. Lower prices and free food save the lives of millions of starving people, despite the drop in food sales of the local farmers.

A developing nation could use new improved farming methods to grow more food, with the ultimate goal of feeding their nation without outside help. New greenhouse methods, hydroponics, fertilizers, R/O Water Processors, hybrid crops, fast-growing hybrid trees for quick shade, interior temperature control, greenhouse or tent insulation, autonomous building gardens, sun lamps, mylar, fans, and other cheap tech can be used to grow crops on previously unarable land, such as rocky, mountainous, desert, and even arctic lands. More food can be grown, reducing dependency on other countries for food.

Replacement crops can also make nations agriculturally independent. Sugar, for example, comes from sugar cane imported from Polynesia. Instead of buying the sugar from Polynesia, a nation can make sugar from sugar beets, maple sap, or sweetener from stevia plant, keeping the profits circulating within the nation's economy. Paper and clothes can be made of hemp instead of trees and cotton. Tropical foods won't grow in many places in Europe, but they will grow in insulated greenhouses or tents in Europe. Soybean plant cellulose can replace plastic (made from oil). Lemon oil can replace car oil for lubrication. Ethanol from farm waste or hempseed oil can replace gasoline. Rainforest medicine plants grown locally can replace many imported medicines. This is why Thomas Jefferson said that the best thing you can do for your country is to grow a new crop species. Alternates of cash crops, like sugar and oil replacements, allow the farmer to make more money on the real market, reducing the farmer's dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations.

The farmer population is approximately five percent of the total population in the E.U. and 1.7 % in the U.S.

The total value of agricultural production amounted to 128 billion euros (1998). About forty-nine percent of this amount was accounted for by political measures: 37 billion euros due to direct payments and 43 billion euros from consumers due to the artificially high price. Eighty percent of European farmers receive a direct payment of 5,000 euros or less, while 2.2 % receive a direct payment above 50,000 euros, totaling forty percent of all direct subsidies.

The average U.S. farmer receives $16,000 in annual subsidies. Two-thirds of farmers receive no direct payments. Of those that do, the average amount amongst the lowest paid eighty percent was $7000 from 1995-2003. (http://www.ewg.org/farm/findings.php) Subsidies are a mix of tax reductions, direct cash payments and below-market prices on water and other inputs. Some claim that these aggregate figures are misleading because large agribusinesses, rather than individual farmers, receive a significant share of total subsidy spending. The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 reduced farm subsidies, providing fixed payments over a period and replacing price supports and subsidies. The Farm Bill (2002) contains direct and countercyclical payments designed to limit the effects of low prices and yields.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has extracted commitments from the Philippines government, making it lower import barriers to half their present levels over a span of six years, and allowing in drastically increased competition from the industrialised and heavily subsidised farming systems of North America and Europe. A recent Oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30% over the six years as cheap imports from the US drive down prices in the local markets. The report estimates that in the absence of trade restrictions, US subsidised maize could be marketed at less than half the price of maize grown on the Philippine island of Mindanao; and that the livelihoods of up to half a million Filipino maize farmers (out of the total 1.2 million) are under immediate threat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Numbers ==
For example, let's set the value for the variable 'a'
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;a = 46;&lt;/source&gt;
And for the variable 'b'
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;b = 7;&lt;/source&gt;

=== Arithmetic operations ===
Let's output results of arithmetic operations with these variables.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
print(a + b);
print(a - b);
print(a * b);
print(a / b);
print(a % b); //Modulo
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Increment, Decrement, Unary operators ===
For enlarging or reducing some variable by one we can use increment and decrement operator. And we can change char of number by unary operator.
Decrement and increment have two types of recording - postfix and prefix.
Prefix - first the value is changed then the new value is returned.
Postfix - first the value is returned then value is changed.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = 5;
b = ++a; // b = 6 , a = 6
b = a--; // b = 6 , a = 5
b = -a; // b = -5
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Standart library functions ===
Also we can apply some functions to numbers. We will consider only most important.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
c = f.toFixed(b); //Rounding to 'b' digits after  dot
d = Math.abs(-6); //Absolute value (module) of number
e = Math.round(f); //Rounding to integer
g = Math.max(a,b); //Maximum value of variables 'a' and 'b'
h = Math.min(a,b); //Minimum value of variables 'a' and 'b'
k = Math.pow(a,b); //Variable 'a' in power 'b'
t = Math.sqrt(a); //Square root of variable 'a'
w = Math.random(); //Random number from 0 to 1
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Standart library constants ===
Standart library include some math constants. We will consider only the most important.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = Math.PI // π number
b = Math.E // e number
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Special values ===
Numbers in JavaScript also include two special values are Infinity and NaN(Not a Number)
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = 1/0 // Infinity
b = Math.sqrt(-1) // NaN
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Making Array ==
For making array it's better to use list literal because it's most popular and simple syntaxis
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = []; //Empty list
b = [1,2,3,4,5]; //List with 5 elements
&lt;/source&gt;

== Work with elements ==
And so, we have an array 'b' with five numbers and the empty array 'a'.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a[0] = b[2]; //1
delete b[2]; //2
b[3] = 6; //3
&lt;/source&gt;
# From array b - [1,2,'''3''',4,5] get element with index 2 (Numeration in arrays starts from 0).  Now array a = [2]
# We delete element with index 2 from array b. Now array b = [0,1,'''undefined''',3,4].
# We change value of element with index 3 from array b. Now array b = [0,1,undefined,6,4].

== Work with slices ==
Array.slice(start,end) - returns array with elements of '''Array''' from '''start''' index to '''end''' index without element with index '''end'''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b = a.slice(2,5); //2,3,4
&lt;/source&gt;
If '''start''' or '''end''' is negative number then index of start or end equal (length of array + '''start''' or '''end''').
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b = a.slice(2,-2); //2,3,4,5 because length = 8 and 8 + (-2) = 6 
&lt;/source&gt;
Array.splice(start,number,elem...) - return slice with '''number''' of elements from '''Array''' from '''start''' and it deletes this elements from '''Array''', and it replaces it's by '''elem'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b = a.splice(2,3,0,1,0);
print(b); // 2,3,4
print(a); // 0,1,0,1,0,5,6,7
&lt;/source&gt;

== Stack and row ==
You can use any Array as stack or row for it there are 4 function.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Action
|-
| Array.pop() || Delete and return last element of '''Array'''
|-
| Array.push(elem...) ||Insert '''elem''' to end of '''Array'''
|-
| Array.shift() || Delete and return first element of '''Array'''
|-
| Array.unshift(elem...) || Insert '''elem''' to start of '''Array'''
|}
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
Foo = [1,2,3,4,5];
Bar = Foo.pop(); //Bar = 5 , Foo = [1,2,3,4]
Foo.unshift(Bar); // Foo = [5,1,2,3,4]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sorting and reverse ==
Also Array.sort([predicate]) - If predicate not defined then sort elements in '''Array''' in lexicographical order else sort element in '''Array''' by results of function '''predicate''' that gets two arguements and returns '''-1''' if first argument less then second or '''1''' if second argument less then first or '''0''' if arguments equal.

Array.reverse() - reverse elements in '''Array'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr = [5,3,1,4,2];
arr.sort();
print(arr); //1,2,3,4,5
arr.reverse();
print(arr); //5,4,3,2,1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Concatenate and joining ==
Array.concat(elem1...) - returns array that containg elements from '''Array''' and '''elem''' if elem[n] is array then to the array that returns are added all elements from elem[n].

Array.join([separator]) - returns string with all elements and separator before every, if separator not defined then separator = &quot;,&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr1 = [0,1,2,3,4]
arr2 = [5,6,7,8,9]
elem = 10;
arr = arr1.concat(arr2,elem); //0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
str = arr.join(';'); //0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10
print(str);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Length of Array ==
Array.length - number of elements in '''Array'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
print(arr.length); // 6
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== While ==
While expression looks so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
while(condition){
  codeInCycle
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, if the condition is true then the code inside the loop and then the process goes first but if the condition is true then execution continues after the loop. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = 2;
nums = [];
while(n &lt; 16){
  nums.push(n++);
}
print(nums); //2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
&lt;/source&gt;

== For ==
&quot;For&quot; cycle is a short form of while.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for(exp1;exp2;exp3){
  code
}
//Equal for
exp1;
while(exp2){
  code;
  exp3;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's rewrite our code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for(n=2,nums=[];n&lt;16;n++){
  nums.push(n);
}
print(nums); // 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Do .. While ==
In this cycle, executing the code in it and then check the condition and if it is true then the loop is executed again, otherwise terminate the loop. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
names = [&quot;JavaScript&quot;,&quot;Python&quot;,&quot;Ruby&quot;];
i = 0;
do{
  name = names[i];
  i++;
}while(print(name) || i &lt; names.length);
&lt;/source&gt;
Do .. while loop can be used if code inside a loop set some values and in condition you call some function.

== For .. in ==
For .. in loop using if need iterate over all properties of object. For example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
obj = {name:&quot;Artem&quot;,
       country:&quot;Russia&quot;,
       interests:&quot;JavaScript&quot;};
for(i in obj){
  print(i + ':' + obj[i] + '\n')
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In this code on every iteration to variable 'i' set value with key of property.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Break ===
Break statement can interrupt the cycle. For example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str = &quot;&quot;;
i = 0;
j = 100;
while(true){
  i++;
  j--;
  if(j==i)break;
  str = str + i + ':' + j + ',';
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This code makes string with list of pairs of numbers while they are not equal.

=== Continue ===
Continue statement makes the transition to the next iteration of the loop.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr = [0,2,4,5,6,1,24,36,12,531,42,49,81];
for(i=0;i&lt;arr.length;i++){
  if((Math.sqrt(arr[i])%1) &gt; 0)continue;
  print(arr[i])
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This script output numbers from array which square roots is integer.

== Labels ==
Labels help use '''break''' and '''continue''' in nested loops.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
glob:for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++){
  for(j=0;j&lt;10;j++){
    if(i==j)continue glob;
    print(i*10 + j)
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conditional operator ==
If we need just set value for any variable in depent of condition, we can use conditional operator. It's shorter than &quot;if&quot; expression many times. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
name = &quot;Artiom&quot;;
cond = true;

//If expression
if(cond){
  name = &quot;Tom&quot;;
}else{
  name = &quot;Artem&quot;;
}

//Conditional operator
name = cond?&quot;Tom&quot;:&quot;Artem&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Nested conditional operator ===
As 'if' expression so and Conditional operator can be multiple.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
name = &quot;Artiom&quot;;
cond1 = false;
cond2 = true;

//Conditional operator
name = cond1?&quot;Tom&quot;:cond2?&quot;Artem&quot;:&quot;NoName&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Logic operators ==
There are three logical operators in JavaScript. It are &quot;not&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;or&quot;. Let's see example.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator !! Action
|-
| &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; || or
|-
| &amp;&amp; || and
|-
| ! || not
|}

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
!true; // False
!false; // True
false || true; // True
false &amp;&amp; true;// False
&lt;/source&gt;

== Comparison operators ==
In parts of the previous file you've already seen some of these operators, and certainly understand their meaning but in anyway.
There are 8 comparison operators in JavaScript.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator !! Condition
|-
| == || Equal
|-
| != || Not equal
|-
| === || Equal value and type
|-
| !== || Not equal value or type
|-
| &gt; || More
|-
| &lt; || Less
|-
| &lt;= || Less or equal
|-
| &gt;= || More or equal
|}
And for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
5 == 5; //True
5 === '5'; //False
5 != 3; //True
5 !== '3'; //True
5 &gt; 3; //True
5 &lt; 3; //False
5 &lt;= 5; //True
5 &gt;= 3; //True
&lt;/source&gt;

== XOR Hack ==
In JavaScript there is no operator XOR (also named Exclusive OR). But we can write function that use bitwise XOR and return booleadn XOR of two arguments.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
xor = function(a,b){
  return Boolean(a ^ b)
}
&lt;/source&gt;
And let's use it.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
xor(true,false); //True
xor(true,true); //False
xor(false,false); //False
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Splitting Fields ==

Let F be a field and p(x) be a nonconstant polynomial in F(x). We already know that we can find a field extension of F that contains a root of p(x). However, we would like to know whether an extension E of F containing all of the roots of p(x) exists. In other words, can we find a field extension of F such that p(x) factors into a product of linear polynomials? What is the &quot;smallest&quot; extension containing all the roots of p(x)? &lt;br /&gt;

Let F be a field and &lt;math&gt;p(x) = \alpha_0+\alpha_1x+\cdots+\alpha_n x^n&lt;/math&gt; be a nonconstant polynomial in F[x]. An extension field E of F is a '''splitting field''' of p(x) if there exist elements &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; in E such that &lt;math&gt;E = F(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(x) = (x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; in E[x].&lt;br /&gt;

A polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x) \in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; ''splits'' in E if it is the product of linear factors in E[x].&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;p(x) = x^4+2x^2-8&lt;/math&gt; be in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Then p(x) has irreducible factors &lt;math&gt;x^2-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2+4&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)&lt;/math&gt; is a splitting field for p(x).&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;p(x) = x^3-3&lt;/math&gt; be in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Then p(x) has a root in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3})&lt;/math&gt;. However, this field is not a splitting field for p(x) since the complex cube roots of 3, &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\sqrt[3]{3}\pm(\sqrt[6]{3})^5i}{2}&lt;/math&gt; are not in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem''' ''Let p(x) &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; F(x) be a nonconstant polynomial. Then there exists a splitting field E for p(x).''&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. We will use mathematical induction on the degree of p(x). If &lt;math&gt;deg(p(x)) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then p(x) is a linear polynomial and &lt;math&gt;E = F&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that the theorem is true for all polynomials of degree k with &lt;math&gt;1 \le k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;deg(p(x)) = n&lt;/math&gt;. We can assume that p(x) is irreducible; otherwise, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. There exists a field K such that p(x) has a zero &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; in K. Hence, &lt;math&gt;p(x) = (x - \alpha_1)q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q(x) \in K(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;deg(q(x)) = n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a splitting field &lt;math&gt; E \supset K&lt;/math&gt; of q(x) that contains the zeros &lt;math&gt; \alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; of p(x) by our induction hypothesis. Consequently,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E = K(\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n) = F(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

is a splitting field of p(x).&lt;br /&gt;

The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields. This question is answered in the affirmative. Given two splitting fields K and L of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x) \in F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a field isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; that preserves F. In order to prove this result, we must first prove a lemma.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Lemma Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\phi : E \to F&lt;/math&gt; be an isomorphism of fields. Let K be an extension field of E and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in K&lt;/math&gt; be algebraic over E with minimal polynomial p(x). Suppose that L is an extension field of F such that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is root of the polynomial in F[x] obtained from p(x) under the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; extends to a unique isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : E(\alpha) \to F(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi(\alpha) = \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; agrees with &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on E.''&lt;br /&gt;

'''Lemma Proof.''' If p(x) has degree n, then we can write any element in &lt;math&gt;E(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;1,\alpha,\cdots,\alpha^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking must be&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\phi(a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}) = \psi(a_0) + \psi(a_1)\beta + \cdots + \psi(a_{n-1})\beta^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;

where&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

is an element in &lt;math&gt;E(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation; however, it is easier to observe that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a composition of maps that we already know to be isomorphisms.&lt;br /&gt;

We can extend &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be an isomorphism from E[x] to F[x], which we will also denote by &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;, by letting&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\psi(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n) = \psi(a_1)x + \cdots + \psi(a_n)x^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

This extension agrees with the original isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : E \to F&lt;/math&gt;, since constant polynomials get mapped to constant polynomials. By assumption, &lt;math&gt;\psi(p(x)) = q(x)&lt;/math&gt;; hence, &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;\left \langle p(x) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\left \langle q(x) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, we have an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi} : E[x]/\left \langle p(x) \right \rangle \to F[x]/\left \langle q(x) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We have isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\sigma : E[x]/\left \langle p(x) \right \rangle \to F(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau : F[x]/\left \langle q(x) \right \rangle \to F(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, defined by evaluation at &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\psi = \tau^{-1}\overline{\phi}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the required isomorphism.&lt;br /&gt;

Now write &lt;math&gt;p(x)=(x-\alpha)f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q(x)=(x-\beta)g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where the degrees of f(x) and g(x) are less than the degrees of p(x) and q(x), respectively. The field extension K is a splitting field for f(x) over E(α), and L is a splitting field for g(x) over F(β). By our induction hypotheses there exists an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; agrees with &lt;math&gt;\bar{phi}&lt;/math&gt; on E(α). Hence, there exists an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; agrees with &lt;math&gt;psi&lt;/math&gt; on E.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Corollary''' ''Let p(x) be a polynomial in F[x]. Then there exists a splitting field K of p(x) that is unique up to isomorphism.''&lt;br /&gt;

== Algebraic Closures ==

Given a field ''F'', the question arises as to whether or not we can find a field ''E'' such that every polynomial ''p(x)'' has a root in ''E''. This leads us to the following theorem.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem 21.11''' ''Let E be an extension field of F. The set of elements in E that are algebraic over F form a field.&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta\in E&lt;/math&gt; be algebraic over ''F''. Then &lt;math&gt;F(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite extension of ''F''. Since every element of &lt;math&gt;F(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic over &lt;math&gt;F,\alpha\pm\beta,\alpha\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha/\beta\text{ }(\beta\ne 0)&lt;/math&gt; are all algebraic over ''F''. Consequently, the set of elements in ''E'' that are algebraic over ''F'' forms a field.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Corollary 21.12''' ''The set of all algebraic numbers forms a field; that is, the set of all complex numbers that are algebraic over'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; ''makes up a field.''&lt;br /&gt;

Let ''E'' be a field extension of a field ''F''. We define the '''''algebraic closure''''' of a field ''F'' in ''E'' to be the field consisting of all elements in ''E'' that are algebraic over ''F''. A field ''F'' is '''''algebraically closed''''' if every nonconstant polynomial in ''F[x]'' has a root in ''F''.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem 21.13''' ''A field F is algebraically closed if and only if every nonconstant polynomial in F[x] factors into linear factors over F[x].''&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. Let ''F'' be an algebraically closed field. If &lt;math&gt;p(x)\in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a nonconstant polynomial, then ''p(x)'' has a zero in ''F'', say α. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; must be a factor of ''p(x)'' and so &lt;math&gt;p(x)=(x-\alpha)q_1(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;deg(q_1(x)) = deg(p(x))-1&lt;/math&gt;. Continue this process with &lt;math&gt;q_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; to find a factorization&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(x)=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)q_2(x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;deg(q_2(x))= deg(p(x))-2&lt;/math&gt;. The process must eventually stop since the degree of ''p(x)'' is finite.&lt;br /&gt;

Conversely, suppose that every nonconstant polynomial ''p(x)'' in ''F[x]'' factors into linear factors. Let &lt;math&gt;ax-b&lt;/math&gt; be such a factor. Then &lt;math&gt;p(b/a)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, ''F'' is algebraically closed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Corollary 21.14''' ''An algebraically closed field F has no proper algebraic extension E.''&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. Let ''E'' be an algebraic extension of ''F''; then &lt;math&gt;F\subset E&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in E&lt;/math&gt;, the minimal polynomial of α is &lt;math&gt;x-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F=E&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Theorem 21.15''' ''Every field F has a unique algebraic closure.''&lt;br /&gt;

It is a nontrivial fact that every field has a unique algebraic closure. The proof is not extremely difficult, but requires some rather sophisticated set theory. We refer the reader to [3], [4], or [8] for a proof of this result.&lt;br /&gt;

We now state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, first proven by Gauss at the age of 22 in his doctoral thesis. This theorem states that every polynomial with coefficients in the complex numbers has a root in the complex numbers. The proof of this theorem will be given in [[Abstract Algebra/Galois Theory]].&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem 21.16 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra)''' ''The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let ABC be a triangle, its incentre be I and its three excentres be I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''excentral triangle''' of ABC.

A lies on the line I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and is the foot of the perpendicular from I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to that line, and similarly for B and C.  Thus ABC is the '''pedal triangle''' (see later) of its excentral triangle.  Further, these perpendiculars intersect at I, so I is the orthocentre of the excentral triangle.

I and I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; lie on the bisector of angle BAC and similarly for the other excentres.

The quadrilaterals IBCI&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, IACI&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and IABI&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; are cyclic.

I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthocentre of the triangle I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;I and similarly for the other excentres.

The distance II&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is 4Rsin({{frac|A|2}}) and similarly for the other excentres.

== Properties of the Excentral Triangle ==
The angles of this triangle are &lt;math&gt;90^0-\frac{A}{2}, 90^0-\frac{B}{2} \text{ and } 90^0-\frac{C}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Its sides are &lt;math&gt;4R\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right), 4R\cos\left(\frac{B}{2}\right), 4R\cos\left(\frac{C}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Its area is  &lt;math&gt;8R^2\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{C}{2}\right) = 2Rs = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \Delta \text{cosec}\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) \text{cosec}\left(\frac{B}{2}\right) \text{cosec}\left(\frac{C}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;Delta; is the area of the original triangle.

Its circumradius is 2R.

At the same time, consistent with other Wiki textbooks, we would like to retain our names on the chapters.   We would welcome readers who wish to edit text contacting us.  Retaining author names in various Wiki books is important for several reasons. First, readers, particularly practicing clinicians, want to be assured of the expertise of the authors. Second, writers, particularly those in academia, want some acknowledgment of their contributions. It will be interesting so see the quality of future edits, and whether authors are happy with these.

In function description variables are bolded. For example Math.sqrt('''num''') - square root of '''num'''

== Undefined number of arguments ==
Undefined number of arguments in function written as name... and function description name are all these variables in general, and name[n] either name. For example  Array.concat(elements...) - returns array that containg elements from '''Array''' and '''elements''' if '''elements[n]''' is array then to the array that returns are added all elements from '''elements[n]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ethelbert ruled from 860-866. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethelbert, the third son of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelwulf|Ethelwulf]] and Osburh, a Jutish princess, was born circa 835. The grandson of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Egbert|Egbert]], first King of the English, he succeeded his brother Ethelbald on 20th December, 860. Ethelbert had previously been sub-king of Kent, the traditional title given to the early heirs to the throne of Wessex. He was crowned at Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey. Almost immediately, the savage Viking invasions on Wessex were renewed. &lt;br /&gt;
The Vikings merciless raids of pillage, slaughter and rape struck abject terror into Saxon hearts, leaving destruction, desolation and smoking ruins in their wake. The people had good cause to utter the much repeated prayer &quot;From the fury of the Northmen , O Lord, deliver us.&quot; The Vikings who harried Wessex at this time were Danish. A huge Viking fleet landed in East Anglia in 865, under the curiously named Ivar the Boneless, who was for some time the driving force behind the Viking attacks on England. His army remained there for a while, garnering it's resources for a major invasion. The city of Winchester, the ancient capital of Wessex, was burned to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
A minor victory over the raiding Vikings was achieved by the Saxons of Hampshire and Berkshire under Aldermen Athelwulf and Osric. The Vikings occupied the Isle of Thanet, where they spent the Winter. They were bought off by the men of Kent, but characteristically, did not keep the agreement and began to ravage England with renewed force shortly thereafter. &lt;br /&gt;
Ethelbert died, unmarried and childless, in 866 at around the age of thirty-five. He had reigned for only five years. His body was interred at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ethelred I ruled England from 866 to 871. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethelred I was born around 834 and like his father [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelwulf|Ethelwulf]], was a man of great piety, who had been brought up very religiously by his mother, Queen Osburh. Ethelred succeeded his brother [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelbert|Ethelbert]]in 866 to a land that was being ravaged mercilessly by the full fury of savage Viking onslaughts. The Danes were beginning to settle in England and in 870 siezed control of York. Ethelred took up the struggle against them with renewed vigour.&lt;br /&gt;
The dynastic ties which allied the House of Wessex to that of Mercia were strengthened. Burghred, King of Mercia had married Ethelswitha, the daughter of Ethelwulf of Wessex. Ethelred's younger brother, Alfred, renewed the bond of alliance when he took his first cousin, Elswitha of Mercia, to be his wife. Ethelred himself married Wulfrida around two years after his accession to the throne of Wessex, they produced two sons Ethelwald, who was born around 868 and Ethelhelm, whose date of birth is unknown.&lt;br /&gt;

In the year prior to Ethelred's accession, a large Viking army had landed in East Anglia, under the leadership of Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless. After a few months it marched up to Northumbria, taking the city of York, the Vikings exacted a terrible vengeance on Aelle, the Northumbrian leader, who suffered a horrific death at their hands, as revenge for his issuing the order to throw the Viking chieftain, Ragnar Lothbrok into a pit of adders some twenty years previously. 
Ragnar's sons, Halfdane and Hingwar, subjected Aelle to the Viking form of execution known as the spreadeagle, or bloodeagle, whereby the victim was pinned face down on the ground and his ribs separated from his spine. The ribs were then forced outwards, forming a pair of wings. The Danes set up their own ruler in Northumbria, before crossing the border into Mercia, advancing into the province and taking the town of Nottingham. King Burghred of Mercia requested aid from his kinsmen, Ethelred and Alfred. They responded with alacrity, marching into Mercia at the head of an army, but the Danes retained possession of the town.&lt;br /&gt;
In 869 the seemingly unstoppable Viking army advanced into East Anglia. The sub-king of the province, Edmund, opposed them valiantly but the East Anglians were defeated and their King taken prisoner whilst fleeing to the town of Hoxne, in Suffolk. Chained and manacled, Edmund was murdered in a ferocious and barbarous fashion, believed to have been sacrificed to the Viking god, Odin. &lt;br /&gt;

He met his end with dignity and courage and was later canonized for remaining steadfast in his Catholic faith. Monasteries were raised to the ground, monks slaughtered and plundering took place on a massive scale.&lt;br /&gt;

By 870, the Vikings, spurred on by their success in Northumbria, prepared to attack the kingdom of Wessex. They were met by a force of Saxons under Ethelred and Alfred, their army blocking the ancient road across the Berkshire downs by an Iron Age hill fort on Whitehorse Hill, at a spot known to the Saxons as Nachededorne or the naked thorn. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, our chief source of information on the period, refers to the spot as Ashdown. Ethelred finally won victory over the Vikings in a bitter and bloody pitched battle which lasted until nightfall, leaving many of the bodies of the Danish leaders littering the battlefield. &lt;br /&gt;

For many centuries it was thought that the 325 feet long White Horse was cut in the hillside to commemorate Ethelred's great victory, but it is now known to be much older. This victory brought no permanent advantage, however, and the conflict continued. The Viking invaders descended again, skirmishing continued and an inconclusive battle was fought at Basing. Ethelred, supported loyally by his brother Alfred, refused to surrender. The raven banner of the Vikings and the dragon of Wessex were hoisted again at Meredune, which is believed to have been either Marden, near Devizes or Martin in Hampshire. In the furious conflict that ensued, the Danes emerged the victors. Ethelred died shortly after at Wimborne, from wounds sustained in the battle, according to one account he died in agony. He was no older than thirty at his death and was buried at nearby Wimborne Minster.&lt;br /&gt;

Ethelred was posthumously refuted as a saint. Although he left two sons he was succeeded by his youngest brother, Alfred known to history as the Great.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alfred the Great was the monarch of England from 871 to 899.

No other ruler in England's long and varied history has been honored with the title &quot;the Great&quot;. Alfred once declared it his intention &quot;To live worthily as long as I live and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.&quot; Few of the other monarchs have succeeded as spectacularly in their aims as he did.

==Early Life==

Alfred (Old English-Aelfred) was the fifth and youngest son of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelwulf|Ethelwulf of Wessex]] and his Jutish first wife, Osburh. He was born at Wantage between 847 and 849, his birthplace was a palace or vill which lay at the foot of the Berkshire Downs, which has now vanished. Ill health is reported to have marred Alfred's childhood.

One of the few stories that survive from Alfred's early life relates that his mother, Osburh, showed her sons a beautifully illuminated volume of Saxon poetry and promised to make a gift of it to the first of them who was able to read it. Alfred quickly learned to read it aloud, and was made a gift of the book when he was only six years old. His youngest son appears to have been Ethelwulf's favourite, his father took Alfred on pilgrimage to Rome, to receive the blessing of his godfather, Pope Leo IV. It was rumoured that King Ethelwulf wished to make Alfred his successor.

On Ethelwulf's return to England he found his eldest son, [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelbald|Ethelbald]], had usurped his throne in his absence. Nobly accepting the status quo in the hope that civil war and the consequent loss of life could be avoided, Ethelwulf retired to Kent, where he reigned as sub-king until his death in 858. Alfred was around eleven when his father died. He was studious as a child and grew to be a man of determination, intelligence and resolution, despite suffering from ill health for much of his life.

Alfred's three elder brothers’ reigned in turn before him. During the reign of the youngest of these, [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelred I|Ethelred I]] , Alfred emerges from the mists of obscurity to fight loyally by his side in the struggle against the Danish incursions into Wessex. At the Battle of Ashdown, in the Vale of the White Horse, the pious Ethelred remained so long in his tent praying for victory that Alfred became impatient and lead his men in a furious charge at the enemy without waiting for his brother to finish his prayers.

==The Conflict with the Danes==

The Witangemot, or Saxon council of wise men, met after Ethelred's death from wounds sustained in battle and elected the twenty-one year old Alfred, who had already demonstrated himself a confident leader of men, as King. His brothers between them had lasted barely a decade. In electing Alfred king the Witan passed over the two young sons of Ethelred. The law of primogeniture was not then established in Saxon England and it was normal practice for the King to be elected in this manner. The practice of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well-known among Germanic tribes.

The depressing series of defeats at the hands of the Vikings continued unabated and Alfred was forced into a strategy of buying them off. As a result they ceased their attacks and for a period of five years, peace reigned in Wessex. This peace was not likely to last for any considerable length of time and was at best a temporary measure. The Viking army, after taking Mercia, then divided. One part, under Halfdan, marched north to Yorkshire where they settled permanently. The other, under Guthrum, launched another attack on Wessex in 875. They withdrew again in 877 and began to colonize Mercia.

Wessex was savagely attacked for the third time in 878 and Alfred was driven into hiding at Athelney in the Somerset marshes, he remained there with his ally, Athelnoth, Ealdorman of Somerset and other thegns, biding his time. Legend has it that, in his preoccupation with the defence of his kingdom, he famously burnt some cakes he was supposed to be watching over and was set upon by an angry housewife.&lt;br /&gt;

Bishop Asser informs us that Alfred had a great love of jeweled ornaments. His crown, which unfortunately no longer survives, is listed in an inventory of jewels melted down by Oliver Cromwell at the establishment of the Protectorate, it is described as being studded with emeralds.

In 886, Alfred garnered his resources and managed to retake the city of London, but Viking raids continued. At the battle of Ethendun in 878, Saxon forces soundly defeated the Vikings lead by Guthrum and peace was concluded by the terms of the Treaty of Wedmore. Guthrum converted to Christianity with Alfred standing as godfather to his erstwhile enemy. Alfred accepted the Danish colonisation of much of England. A line was drawn which ran north-westwards from London to Chester, defining an area north of this line which was termed the Danelaw.

Alfred improved his army, making provision for it to be always available at short notice to defend Wessex. Part of the army was always kept in reserve in case of emergency. The navy was similarly improved, building ships which were bigger and better than those possessed by the Vikings.

King Alfred built up defenses and fortified townships to ensure the safety of his people. He established defended settlements, or burhs (from which derives the modern borough) These settlements were recorded in detail in the Burghal Hidage. A network of burhs was established to ensure that no part of Wessex was further than 20 miles from these strongholds. By 897 he had successfully halted the advance of the Vikings, a remarkable achievement.

==Peacetime Achievements==

The King turned his attention to the deterioration of learning in England. Due to the continued pillage of monasteries by the Vikings, which essentially formed a network of rudimentary education at the time, educational standards had diminished. Alfred founded a court school to educate the nobles and encouraged the great scholars of his day to take up residence in England. &quot;It is most needful for men to know&quot; he is recorded as stating &quot;and to bring it to pass, if we have peace, that all the youth now in England-may be devoted to learning.&quot; The royal court was to become a magnet for scholars.

On the insistence of the King, English became the official written language. Alfred personally translated into English 'The History of the Venerable Bede', 'Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy', 'Dialogues of Gregory the Great', Gregory's 'Pastoral Care'. and Orosius' Soliloquies of St. Augustine'. Prior to this, all books had been written in Latin.

Alfred is also noted for beginning the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in the 890's and had many copies made. The chronicle was written in Anglo-Saxon, rather than the usual Latin. Alfred decreed that these copies be placed in monasteries and churches and frequently updated. The chronicle was updated until the twelfth century, some of the original copies still survive to the present day. It remains one of the few literary sources we possess for English history from the departure of the Romans to the Norman Conquest.

Alfred established a legal code, forming a body of Saxon law, based on the laws of Offa of Mercia, which limited the practice of blood feuding and imposed heavy penalties on those in breach of sworn oath.

:&quot;I ... collected these together and ordered to be written many of them which our forefathers observed, those which I liked; and many of those which I did not like I rejected with the advice of my councilors ... For I dared not presume to set in writing at all many of my own, because it was unknown to me what would please those who should come after us ... Then I ... showed those to all my councilors, and they then said that they were all pleased to observe them&quot; (Laws of Alfred, c.885-99). 

Throughout his life, Alfred had suffered from a mysterious illness, about which little is known with certainty, but which left him incapacitated for long periods. This is one of the most puzzling and often discussed areas of Alfred's life. Bishop Asser informs us that Alfred suffered bouts of depression after each attack. The first attack apparently occurred at his wedding. It has been suggested that Alfred may have suffered from epilepsy, although there is no concrete proof as to what the illness he labored under for a large part of his life actually was.

==The Death of Alfred==

Alfred died at Wantage in 899 at the age of fifty-three. He remains the only English sovereign ever to be given the epithet the Great, which was bestowed on him in the seventeenth century. King Alfred was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester but a few years later, on the completion of the New Minster, which Alfred had founded, his body was translated there, it was soon to be named Hyde Abbey.

On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Hyde Abbey, in common with other religious houses was despoiled and in an act of historical vandalism, the tombs of the Saxon kings were destroyed. Some of the bones from the tombs, although mixed up, were collected into caskets and placed above the chancel in Winchester Cathedral. Alfred's remains are believed to be amongst these. The fame and reputation of King Alfred, one of the ablest of England's Kings, were never to diminish. Florence of Worcester, writing in the thirteenth century, has left us with a fitting statement on Alfred:

:&quot;Alfred the King of the Anglo-Saxons, the son of the most pious King Ethelwulf, the famous, the warlike, the victorious, the careful provider for the widow, the helpless, the orphan and the poor, the most skilled of Saxon poets, most dear to his own nation, courteous to all, most liberal, endowed with prudence, fortitude, justice and temperance; most patient in the infirmity from which he continually suffered; the most discerning investigator in executing justice, most watchful and devout in the service of God.&quot;

Many Kings could not wish for a finer epitaph.

==Alfred the Great==
===The Alfred Jewel===

In 1693, a remarkable discovery of a Saxon jewel was made near Athelney, now known as the Alfred Jewel and housed in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. As the Jewel contains no fastening, it is not thought to be a brooch or a clasp. It is probable that it formed the crown of a writing instrument. 

===The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle===

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle began to be compiled in around 890 A.D., at the command of King Alfred the Great (871- 899) and consists of a series of annals written in the Old English language. 

Alfred ordered that copies be made of the original manuscripts and distributed to monasteries across the length and breadth of England, which were to be regularly updated. One particular version of the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154 and dates to the end of King Stephen's reign. 
Nine versions of the chronicle have survived to the present day. Of these seven are written entirely in the Anglo-Saxon language. Another version survives in Old English with a translation of each annal into Latin. The other, known as the Peterborough Chronicle, is recorded in Old English with the exception of the last entry, which is in early Middle English. Six of these copies are kept at the British Library. 

The Chronicle is the oldest history of any European country in a vernacular language. Its early entries are essentially an official history of the Wessex dynasty and it is one of the few literary sources we possess for England's history during the period. Reporting on the reign of King Egbert, it states:- 

'The moon darkened on Christmas Eve. That year King Ecgbryht overcame the Mercian kingdom, and all that was south of the Humber. He was the eighth king who was ruler of Britain; the first was Aelle, king of Sussex, who had done this much. The second was Ceawlin, king of Wessex, the third was Aethelbryht, king of Kent, the fourth was Raedwald, king of East Anglia; the fifth was Edwin, king of Northumbria; the sixth, Oswald, who ruled after him; the seventh was Oswald's brother Oswiu. The eighth was Ecgbryht, king of Wessex, and this Ecgbryht led troops to Dore against the Northumbrians. They offered him submission, and a treaty; with that they parted'

The chronicle records the Battle of Hastings: 

:'Then Count William came from Normandy to Pevensey on Michaelmas Eve, and as soon as they were able to move on they built a castle at Hastings. King Harold was informed of this and he assembled a large army and came against him at the hoary apple tree. And William came against him by surprise before his army was drawn up in battle array. But the king nevertheless fought hard against him, with the men who were willing to support him, and there were heavy casualties on both sides. Then King Harold was killed, and Earl Leofwine his brother, and Earl Grythe his brother, and many good men, and the French remained masters of the field...'

The sufferings of the common people during the Civil War of Stephen and Matilda are also vividly described:

:'In the days of this King there was nothing but strife, evil and robbery, for quickly the great men who were traitors rose against him. When the traitors saw that Stephen was a mild good humored man who inflicted no punishment, then they committed all manner of horrible crimes. They had done him homage and sworn oaths of fealty to him, but not one of their oaths was kept. They were all forsworn and their oaths broken. For every great man built him castles and held them against the king; they sorely burdened the unhappy people of the country with forced labor on the castles; and when the castles were built they filled them with devils and wicked men. By night and by day they seized those they believed to have any wealth, whether they were men or women; and in order to get their gold or silver, they put them into prison and tortured them with unspeakable tortures, for never were martyrs tortured as they were. They hung them up by the feet and smoked them with foul smoke. They strung them up by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung coats of mail on their feet. They tied knotted cords round their heads and twisted it until it entered the brain. they put them in dungeons wherein were adders and snakes and toads and so destroyed them. 
Many thousands they starved to death. I know not how to, nor am I able to tell of, all the atrocities nor all the cruelties which they wrought upon the unhappy people of this country. It lasted throughout the nineteen years that Stephen was king, and always grew worse and worse. Never did a country endure greater misery, and never did the heathen act more vilely than they did. And so it lasted for nineteen long years while Stephen was King, till the land was all undone and darkened with such deeds and men said openly that Christ and his saints slept.'

      <text xml:space="preserve">Edward the Elder ruled England from the year 899 to the year 924.

During the reign of his father Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder had taken an active role in his campaigns against the Vikings. On the great Alfred's death the succession was disputed between Edward or Eadweard and Ethelwald, the son of Alfred's elder brother [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelred I|Ethelred I]] . The Witan elected Edward as King.

Ethelwald reacted by seizing the crown estates at Wimborne and Christchurch. Edward was quick to respond to the threat, but his cousin escaped and sought refuge with the Vikings of Northumbria. He returned in 905 at the head of an army, battle ensued at Holme in Essex, during the course of which Ethelwald himself was killed, but the Danes eventually emerged the victors. Edward escaped the battlefield unhurt and later negotiated a treaty with his enemies.

The treaty was broken on the arrival of Reginald, son of Guthred, in Northumbria, who quickly captured the city of York and occupied the northern kingdom of Bernica. At the same time, Mercia was yet again invaded, the Danes advancing as far as the Severn. Edward, leading a joint force from Wessex and Mercia, again encountered them in battle at Tettenhall in Staffordshire and on this occasion won a decisive victory.

Along with his sister Ethelfleda, the widow of King Ethelred of Mercia, who was known as the Lady of Mercia, Edward spent most of the early part of his reign engaged in the intermittent conflict with the Vikings. Ethelfleda embarked on a policy of fortifying towns against the Danes. A true daughter of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Alfred the Great|Alfred the Great]], she defeated them in battle in Wales, from where they had threatened Mercia's western border. Edward slowly gained ground against the Danes, eventually pushing the boundaries of Wessex and Mercia northwards.

Following his sister's example, the King secured his re-conquests by building strong fortifications to defend them. London and Oxford were turned into strong garrisons to support King Edward's campaign against the Danes.

The British princes, including Howel the Good, Prince of Wales, or Wealas (Anglo-Saxon for foreigner) and Cledauc accepted Edward the Elder as their overlord. In the year 920, the Kings of the North, including Sigtrygg Caech (the squinty), Constantine II, King of Scots and Donald Mac Aedh, King of Strathclyde, met King Edward at Bakewell in Derbyshire, fully recognising his overlordship. 
Edward also reorganized the Church in Wessex, creating new bishoprics at Ramsbury and Sonning, Wells and Crediton.

The first mention of Edward's eponym the Elder occurs in the tenth century, when it was used in Wulfstan's Life of St Æthelwold, to distinguish him from the later King of the same name, Edward the Martyr. Unusual for a member of the House of Wessex, Edward does not seem to have been a particularly devout son of the church. On the contrary, the church in Wessex appears to have been neglected in his reign, leading the Pope to deliver a reprimand to the king.

His sister Ethelfleda died in 920 and her daughter and heiress, Elfwina, suceeded to the province, she became known by the title her mother formerly had held, the Lady of Mercia. Elfwina in turn recognised her uncle, Edward, as her overlord. Although Mercia and Wessex remained two separate territories, they were now united under the same ruler.

Edward the Elder died while leading an army to combat a Cambro-Mercian rebellion, on 17 July 924 at Farndon-on-Dee, Mercia, his body was buried at the the New Minster at Winchester, which Edward himself had established. Following the Norman Conquest, the minster was replaced by Hyde Abbey and King Edward's body was transferred there. His grave is currently marked by a cross-inscribed stone slab within the outline of the old abbey marked out in a public park.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Athelstan whom he had named as his heir.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following is my ongoing translation of &quot;ЗАДАЧНИК&quot; by &quot;Григорий Остер&quot;.
This is being done as an on going effort to improve my Russian. I have tried to make the translations as close to the text as possible. Grammer was minimally changed to make sense in English.

== Preface ==
''Should I tell you a sadistic anecdote? A children's writer comes to his readers and says: &quot;I wrote you a new book – A collection of problems in mathematics.&quot;''&lt;br /&gt;
''This is almost like on a birthday instead of a cake, one places on a table, a pot of porridge. But to be truthful, the book open in front of you is not really a collection of problems.''

== For Teachers ==
No, no, the problems here are the most real. For second, third, and forth grade. They all have solutions and help strengthen the passing of associated classes of this material. Actually the main problem of the &quot;Problem Collection&quot; is not to strength material; in all, these problems have nothing to do with the naming &quot;busying mathematics.&quot; I think that there will be no professional interest at placing these problems in the finals of a mathematical olympiad. These problems are for people who don't like mathematics, who got used to thinking solutions to problems as dreadful and annoying difficulty. Let them try and figure it out!

== For Students ==
Dear guys, this book is purposely called &quot;Problem Collection,&quot; to be able to read it during math classes and not hide under the table. If the the teacher starts freaking out, say: &quot;I don't know anything - the Ministry of Education allowed it.&quot;

==== 1 ====
Firemen are taught to put on pants within three seconds. How many pants will a well trained fireman have time to put on within five minutes?

=== 2 ===
If one carefully crawls up to grandpa and dad from behind and suddenly shouts &quot;Yey!&quot;, dad will jump up 18 cm. Grandpa lived through hard years and isn't as so similar, jumps up 5 cm. How many centimeters above grandpa does dad jump, hearing the sudden &quot;Yey!&quot;?

=== 3 ===
Two numbers, 5 and 3 once came into a place where thrown everywhere were different differences, and they started looking for their own.
Find the difference of these numbers.

=== 4 ===
Tolya argued with Kolya, that he could eat 5 jars of shoe polish, but ate only 3. How many jars of shoe polish couldn't Tolya overcome.

=== 5 ===
Educating his failing son, dad uses up 2 trouser belts per year. How many belts were used up by dad within the whole eleven years of school, if it's known that in fifth grade his son, twice, got left back a year?

=== 6 ===
In an elevator the button for the first floor is 1m 20cm from the floor. The button of each next floor it higher than the previous by 10 cm. Up to what floor will a small boy, short heighted 90 cm, be able to ride in the elevator, if assuming he can reach to increase his height by 45 cm?</text>

Ribonucleic acid is popularly known as RNA. RNA is one of the three major macromolecules (along with DNA and proteins) that are essential for all known forms of life.The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, with two differences--(a) RNA contains the sugar ribose while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom), and (b) RNA has the nucleobase uracil while DNA contains thymine (uracil and thymine have similar base-pairing properties).
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome, the sites of protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. Many RNAs do not code for protein however (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes ).
These so-called non-coding RNAs (&quot;ncRNA&quot;) can be encoded by their own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of translation.There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome;these are known as ribozymes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of RNA==

Nucleic acids were discovered in 1868 by [[Friedrich Miescher]], who called the material 'nuclein' since it was found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dahm R| title=Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA | journal=Developmental Biology | year=2005| volume=278| issue=2| pages=274–88 | pmid=15680349 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids.

The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by [[Robert W. Holley]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | author=Holley RW ''et al.''| title=Structure of a ribonucleic acid | journal=Science| year=1965| volume=147| issue=1664| pages=1462–65| doi=10.1126/science.147.3664.1462 | pmid = 14263761  }}&lt;/ref&gt; winning Holley the 1968 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and [[Marshall Nirenberg]]).

In 1967, [[Carl Woese]] hypothesized that RNA might be catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions&amp;mdash;an [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Common sequence structure properties and stable regions in RNA secondary structures| author=Siebert S| year=2006| pages=1| url=http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=982323891.pdf| work=Dissertation, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg im Breisgau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | title=The origin of the genetic code: amino acids as cofactors in an RNA world| author=Szathmáry E| journal=Trends Genet.| year=1999| volume=15| issue=6| pages=223–9| doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01730-8 | pmid = 10354582  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s, [[retrovirus]]es and [[reverse transcriptase]] were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, [[David Baltimore]], [[Renato Dulbecco]] and [[Howard Temin]] were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.
In 1976, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of [[bacteriophage MS2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fiers W ''et al.''| title=Complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA: primary and secondary structure of replicase gene| journal=Nature| year=1976| volume=260| pages=500–7| pmid=1264203 | doi = 10.1038/260500a0 | last12=Ysebaert | first12=M | issue=5551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of RNA==

===RNAs involved in protein synthesis===

====Messenger RNA====
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a molecule of RNA encoding a chemical &quot;blueprint&quot; for a protein product. mRNA is transcribed from a DNA template, and carries coding information to the sites of protein synthesis: the ribosomes. Here, the nucleic acid polymer is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein. In mRNA as in DNA, genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides arranged into codons consisting of three bases each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons that terminate protein synthesis. This process requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA (tRNA) mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, while ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the central component of the ribosome's protein manufacturing machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA Messenger RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MRNA structure.svg|thumb|700px|center|The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA. A fully processed mRNA includes a [[5' cap]], [[5' UTR]], [[coding region]], [[3' UTR]], and poly(A) tail.]]

====Ribosomal RNA====
Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) is the RNA component of the ribosome, the organelle that is the site of protein synthesis in all living cells. Ribosomal RNA provides a mechanism for decoding mRNA into amino acids and interacts with tRNAs during translation by providing peptidyl transferase activity. The tRNAs bring the necessary amino acids corresponding to the appropriate mRNA codon.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ribosome shape.png|rRNA
&lt;gallery&gt;

====tRNA====

Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA molecule (usually about 73-95 nucleotides) that transfers a specific active amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has a 3' terminal site for amino acid attachment. This covalent linkage is catalyzed by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. It also contains a three base region called the anticodon that can base pair to the corresponding three base codon region on mRNA. Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, but because the genetic code contains multiple codons that specify the same amino acid, tRNA molecules bearing different anticodons may also carry the same amino acid.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===RNAs involved in post-transcriptional===


====Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA)====
Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA) is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III and are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing (removal of introns from hnRNA), regulation of transcription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining the telomeres. They are always associated with specific proteins, and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) or sometimes as snurps. These elements are rich in uridine content.

====Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)====
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs and small nuclear RNAs. There are two main classes of snoRNA, the C/D box snoRNAs which are associated with methylation, and the H/ACA box snoRNAs which are associated with pseudouridylation. snoRNAs are commonly referred to as guide RNAs but should not be confused with the guide RNAs that direct RNA editing in trypanosomes.

After transcription, nascent rRNA molecules (termed pre-rRNA) are required to undergo a series of processing steps in order to generate the mature rRNA molecule. Prior to cleavage by exo- and endonucleases the pre-rRNA undergoes a complex pattern of nucleoside modifications. These include methylations and pseudouridylations, guided by snoRNAs.
Methylation is the attachment or substitution of a methyl group onto various substrates. The rRNA of humans contain approximately 115 methyl group modifications. The majority of these are 2'O-ribose-methylations ( where the methyl group is attached to the ribose group). 
Pseudouridylation is the conversion (isomerisation) of the nucleoside uridine to a different isomeric form pseudouridine(Ψ). Mature human rRNAs contain approximately 95 Ψ modifications.
Each snoRNA molecule acts as a guide for only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of snoRNA molecule (see snoRNA guide families below). The snoRNA molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides) which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the chemical modification of the target base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_nucleolar_RNA Small nucleolar RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ribonuclease P (RNase P)====
Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a type of Ribonuclease which cleaves RNA. RNase P is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme – a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein based enzyme would. Its function is to cleave off an extra, or precursor, sequence of RNA on tRNA molecules

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Telomerase RNA ====
Telomerase RNA component, also known as TERC, is an RNA gene found in eukaryotes, that is a component of telomerase used to extend telomeres. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence. The vertebrate telomerase RNAs have a 3' H/ACA snoRNA-like domain.

&lt;gallery&gt;

==Regulatory RNAs==
===Antisense RNA===
Antisense RNA is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand transcribed within a cell. Antisense RNA may be introduced into a cell to inhibit translation of a complementary mRNA by base pairing to it and physically obstructing the translation machinery. This effect is therefore stoichiometric. An example of naturally occurring mRNA antisense mechanism is the hok/sok system of the E.coli R1 plasmid. Antisense RNA has long been thought of as a promising technique for disease therapy; the only such case to have reached the market is the drug fomivirsen. One commentator has characterized antisense RNA as one of &quot;dozens of technologies that are gorgeous in concept, but exasperating in &quot;. Generally, antisense RNA still lack effective design, biological activity, and efficient route of administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisense_RNA Antisense RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroRNAs (miRNAs)===
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, on average only 22 nucleotides long and are found in all eukaryotic cells. miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in translational repression and gene silencing. The human genome may encode over 1000 miRNAs, which may target about 60% of mammalian genes and are abundant in many human cell types.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Small interfering RNA (siRNA)===
Small interfering RNA (siRNA), sometimes known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA, is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 nucleotides in length, that play a variety of roles in biology. Most notably, siRNA is involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where it interferes with the expression of a specific gene. In addition to their role in the RNAi pathway, siRNAs also act in RNAi-related pathways, e.g., as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the chromatin structure of a genome; the complexity of these pathways is only now being elucidated.
siRNAs were first discovered by David Baulcombe's group at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, England, as part of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants.&lt;br /&gt;
'''IDENTIFICATION OF SMALL-INTERFERING RNA'''&lt;br /&gt;
By using mapping studies, it showed that target transcript cleavage corresponded to regions that they are complementary to dsRNA and occurred at 21–22-nt intervals which looks like the same size of dsRNA-derived small RNAs. To test if small RNAs mediate RISC activity, 21– 22-nt RNA duplexes with symmetric 2-nt 3′ overhangs were synthesized to mimic dsRNA- processing products. Certainly, these synthetic oligonucleotides induced target mRNA cleavage at sites corresponding to the middle of small RNA. Therefore, these dsRNA-derived small RNAs were designated as small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, a most important contribution was made by demonstration of target transcript silencing through transfection of synthetic siRNAs into mammalian cells. This work provided the foundation for numerous RNAi-based applications, including powerful &quot;shut down&quot; function strategy and a new potential therapeutics. As such, these milestone studies provided an spectacular example of the importance of basic science, including traditional biochemistry, in generating new areas for biomedical applications.

==Structure of RNA==
[[Image:Beta-D-Ribofuranose.svg|thumb|left|100px|Ribose.]]
[[Image:Deoxyribose1.PNG|thumb|Right|400px|Chemical equilibrium of deoxyribose in solution.]]
Each nucleotide in RNA contains a ribose sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or uracil (U). Adenine and guanine are purines, cytosine, and uracil are pyrimidines. A phosphate group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each at physiological pH, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases may form hydrogen bonds between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil.However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge, or the GNRA tetraloop that has a guanine–adenine base-pair.

An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. This results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.

Ribose is an aldopentose, that is a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde functional group at one end. In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The deoxyribose derivative, found in DNA, differs from ribose by having a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxyl group in carbon C2'.
Like many monosaccharides, ribose occurs in water as the linear form H-(C=O)-(CHOH)4-H and any of two ring forms: ribofuranose (&quot;C3'-endo&quot;), with a five-membered ring, and ribopyranose (&quot;C2'-endo&quot;), with a six-membered ring. The ribofuranose form is predominant in aqueous solution.
The &quot;D-&quot; in the name D-ribose refers to the stereochemistry of the chiral carbon atom farthest away from the aldehyde group (C4'). In D-ribose, as in all D-sugars, this carbon atom has the same configuration as in D-glyceraldehyde.
Ribose comprises the backbone of RNA, a biopolymer that is the basis of genetic transcription. It is related to deoxyribose, as found in DNA. Once phosphorylated, ribose can become a subunit of ATP, NADH, and several other compounds that are critical to metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==RNA base==

'''adenine (A)'''

Adenine (A,) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative) with a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration, in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and protein synthesis, as a chemical component of DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA.
 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Adenine.svg|Adenine
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''cytosine (C)'''

Cytosine (C) is one of the four main bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Cytosine chemical structure.png|Cytosine
&lt;/gallery&gt;


'''guanine (G)''' 

Guanine (G) is one of the four main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. 

&lt;gallery&gt;

Found in [[RNA]], it [[base pair|base-pairs]] with [[adenine]] and replaces [[thymine]] during [[DNA]] transcription. [[Methylation]] of uracil produces [[thymine]].It turns into thymine to protect the DNA and to improve the efficiency of [[DNA replication]]. Uracil can base-pair with any of the bases, depending on how the molecule arranges itself on the [[helix]], but readily pairs with [[adenine]] because the methyl group is repelled into a fixed position.&lt;ref name=&quot;madsci1&quot;&gt;www.madsci.org&lt;/ref&gt; Uracil pairs with adenine through [[hydrogen bonding]].  Uracil is the [[hydrogen bond acceptor]] and can form two hydrogen bonds. Uracil can also bind with a [[ribose]] sugar to form the [[ribonucleoside]] [[uridine]].  When a [[phosphate]] attaches to uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate is produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horton1&quot;&gt;Horton, Robert H.; ''et al.''Principles of Biochemistry. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uracil undergoes amide-imidic acid tautomeric shifts because any nuclear instability the molecule may have from the lack of formal [[aromaticity]] is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability. The amide [[tautomer]] is referred to as the [[lactam]] structure, while the imidic acid tautomer is referred to as the [[lactim]] structure. These tautomeric forms are predominant at [[pH]] 7. The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.

Uracil also recycles itself to form nucleotides by undergoing a series of [[phosphoribosyltransferase reaction]]s. Degradation of uracil produces the substrates [[aspartate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonia]].

:C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Oxidative degradation of uracil produces urea and maleic acid in the presence of [[hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or in the presence of diatomic [[oxygen]] and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Uracil is a [[weak acid]]; the first site of [[ionization]] of uracil is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zorbach1&quot;&gt;Zorbach, W.W. Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry: Physical and Physicochemical Aids in Determination of Structure. Vol 2.

The basic pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -3.4, while the acidic pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.38&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. In the gas phase, uracil has 4 sites that are more acidic than water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee1&quot;&gt;Lee, J.K.; Kurinovich, Ma. ''J Am Soc Mass Spectrom.'''''13'''(8), 2005, 985-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uracil is a common and naturally occurring pyrimidine derivative. Originally discovered in 1900, it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein that was found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. It is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light.

==DNA vs RNA==
[[File:RNA-comparedto-DNA thymineAndUracilCorrected.png|thumb|500px|[[RNA]] with its [[nucleobase]]s to the left and [[DNA]] to the right.]]
RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, but differ in three main ways. 

First, unlike DNA, which is, in general, double-stranded, RNA is a single-stranded molecule in many of its biological roles and has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. 

Second, while DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to hydrolysis. 

Third, the complementary base to adenine is not thymine, as it is in DNA, but rather uracil, which is an unmethylated form of thymine.

Fourth, DNA is generally stable in alkaline conditions while RNA is unstable during alkaline condition.


Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Structural analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins. In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis, like enzymes. For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome—an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.
==snRNA and snRNPs==

snRNPs (pronounced &quot;snurps&quot;), or small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, are RNA-protein complexes that combine with unmodified pre-mRNA and various other proteins to form a spliceosome, a large RNA-protein molecular complex upon which splicing of pre-mRNA occurs. The action of snRNPs is essential to the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a critical aspect of post-transcriptional modification of RNA, occurring only in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snRNP gives specificity to individual introns by &quot;recognizing&quot; the sequences of critical splicing signals at the 5' and 3' ends and branch site of introns. The snRNA in snRNPs is similar to ribosomal RNA in that it directly incorporates both an enzymatic and a structural role.
SnRNPs were discovered by Michael R. Lerner and Joan A. Steitz. Thomas R. Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.

At least five different kinds of snRNPs join the spliceosome to participate in splicing. They can be visualized by gel electrophoresis and are known individually as: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Their snRNA components are known, respectively, as: U1 snRNA, U2 snRNA, U4 snRNA, U5 snRNA, and U6 snRNA.
In the mid-1990s, it was discovered that a variant class of snRNPs exists to help in the splicing of a class of introns found only in metazoans, with highly-conserved 5' splice sites and branch sites. This variant class of snRNPs includes: U11 snRNA, U12 snRNA, U4atac snRNA, and U6atac snRNA. While different, they perform the same functions as do U1, U2, U4, and U6, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNP SnRNP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed core snRNP-snurportin 1 complex is transported into the nucleus via the protein importin β. Inside the nucleus, the core snRNPs appear in the Cajal bodies, where final assembly of the snRNPs take place. This consists of additional proteins and other modifications specific to the particular snRNP (U1, U2, U4, U5). The biogenesis of the U6 snRNP occurs in the nucleus although large amounts of free U6 are found in the cytoplasm. The LSm ring may assemble first, and then associate with the U6 snRNA.

Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA) is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III and are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing (removal of introns from hnRNA), regulation of transcription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining the telomeres. They are always associated with specific proteins, and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) or sometimes as snurps. These elements are rich in uridine content.
A large group of snRNAs are known as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). These are small RNA molecules that play an essential role in RNA biogenesis and guide chemical modifications of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and other RNA genes (tRNA and snRNAs). They are located in the nucleolus and the Cajal bodies of eukaryotic cells (the major sites of RNA synthesis).

==RNA as an enzyme==
[[File:Ribozyme.jpg|thumb|right|600px|Schematic showing ribozyme cleavage of RNA.]]
Before the discovery of ribozymes, [[enzyme]]s, which are defined as catalytic [[protein]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/enzyme Enzyme definition] Dictionary.com Accessed 6 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; were the only known biological [[catalysis|catalysts]]. In 1967, [[Carl Woese]], [[Francis Crick]], and [[Leslie Orgel]] were the first to suggest that RNA could act as a catalyst. This idea was based upon the discovery that RNA can form complex [[secondary structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Woese, The Genetic Code (New York: Harper and Row, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; The first ribozymes were discovered in the 1980s by [[Thomas R. Cech]], who was studying RNA [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]] in the [[cilia]]ted [[protozoan]] ''[[Tetrahymena thermophila]]'' and [[Sidney Altman]], who was working on the bacterial [[RNase P]] complex. These ribozymes were found in the [[intron]] of an RNA transcript, which removed itself from the transcript, as well as in the RNA component of the RNase P complex, which is involved in the maturation of pre-[[tRNA]]s. In 1989, [[Thomas R. Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]] won the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[chemistry]] for their &quot;discovery of catalytic properties of RNA.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1989/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989] was awarded to [[Thomas R. Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]] &quot;for their discovery of catalytic properties of RNA&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ribozyme'' was first introduced by Kelly Kruger ''et al.'' in 1982 in a paper published in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6297745&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kruger K, Grabowski PJ, Zaug AJ, Sands J, Gottschling DE, Cech TR | title = Self-splicing RNA: autoexcision and autocyclization of the ribosomal RNA intervening sequence of Tetrahymena | journal = Cell | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–57 | year = 1982 | month = November | pmid = 6297745 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, are still found in today's DNA-based life and could be examples of [[living fossil]]s. Ribozymes play vital roles, such as those in the [[ribosome]], which is vital for protein synthesis. Many other ribozyme functions exist, for example: the [[Hammerhead ribozyme]] performs self-cleavage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90562-9 |author=Forster AC, Symons RH |title=Self-cleavage of plus and minus RNAs of a virusoid and a structural model for the active sites |journal=Cell |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=211–220 |year=1987 |pmid=2436805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[RNA polymerase]] ribozyme can [[autocatalysis|autocatalyse]] its own synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnston W, Unrau P, Lawrence M, Glasner M, Bartel D |title=RNA-catalyzed RNA polymerization: accurate and general RNA-templated primer extension |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1319–25 |year=2001 |url=http://web.wi.mit.edu/bartel/pub/publication_reprints/Johnston_Science01.pdf |format=PDF|pmid=11358999 |doi=10.1126/science.1060786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the enzymatic properties important for the beginning of life are:
*The ability to self-duplicate, or duplicate other RNA molecules. Relatively short RNA molecules that can duplicate others have been artificially produced in the lab. The shortest was 165-base long, though it has been estimated that only part of the bases were crucial for this function. One version, 189-base long, had fidelity of 98.9%,&lt;ref&gt;W. K.

*The ability to catalyse the formation of [[peptide bonds]], in order to produce short [[peptide]]s, or—eventually—full [[protein]]s.

Although most ribozymes are quite rare in the cell, their roles are sometimes essential to life. For example, the functional part of the ribosome, the molecular machine that translates RNA into proteins, is fundamentally a ribozyme, composed of RNA tertiary structural motifs that are often coordinated to metal ions such as Mg2+ as cofactors. There is no requirement for divalent cations in a five-nucleotide RNA that can catalyze trans-phenylalanation of a four-nucleotide substrate which has three base complementary sequence with the catalyst. The catalyst and substrate were devised by truncation of the C3 ribozyme.

[[Image:RNase H fix.png|thumb|right|400px|Structure the ''E.coli'' RNAse H]]

Ribonuclease (commonly abbreviated RNase) is a type of nuclease that catalyzes the degradation of RNA into smaller components. Ribonucleases can be divided into endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases, and comprise several sub-classes within the EC 2.7 (for the phosphorolytic enzymes) and 3.1 (for the hydrolytic enzymes) classes of enzymes.

''Endoribonuclease''  A Endoribonuclease is a ribonuclease endonuclease. It cleaves either single or double stranded RNA depending on the enzyme. Example includes both single proteins like RNase III, RNase A, RNase T1 and RNase H but also, complexes of proteins like RNase P and the RNA-induced silencing complex.

''Exoribonuclease'' An exoribonuclease is an exonuclease ribonuclease, which are enzymes that degrade RNA by removing terminal nucleotides from either the 5' end or 3' end of the RNA molecule. Enzymes that remove nucleotides from the 5' end are called 5'-3' exoribonucleases and enzymes that remove nucleotides from the 3' end are called 3'-5' exoribonucleases.

Exoribonucleases can use either water to cleave the nucleotide-nucleotide bond (which is called hydrolytic activity) or inorganic phosphate (which is called phosphorolytic activity). Hydrolytic exoribonucleases are classified under EC number 3.1 and phosphorolytic exoribonucleases under EC number 2.7.7. As the phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave bonds they release nucleotide disphosphates), whereas the hydrolytic enzymes (which use water) release nucleotide monosphosphates).
Exoribonucleases exist in all kingdoms of life, the bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Exoribonucleases are involved in the degradation of many different RNA species, including messenger RNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA and miRNA. Exoribonucleases can be single proteins (like RNase D or RNase PH) but also can be complexes of multiple proteins, like the exosome complex (in which four of the major exoribonuclease families are represented)&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonuclease Ribonuclease]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RNase A''' 
RNase A is a relatively small protein (124 residues, ~13.7 kDa). It can be characterized as a two-layer α + β protein that is folded in half to resemble a taco, with a deep cleft for binding the RNA substrate. The first layer is composed of three alpha helices (residues 3-13, 24-34 and 50-60) from the N-terminal half of the protein. The second layer consist of three β-hairpins (residues 61-74, 79-104 and 105-124 from the C-terminal half) arranged in two β-sheets. The hairpins 61-74 and 105-124 form a four-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet that lies on helix 3 (residues 50-60). The longest β-hairpin 79-104 mates with a short β-strand (residues 42-45) to form a three-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet that lies on helix 2 (residues 24-34).
RNase A has four disulfide bonds in its native state: Cys26-Cys84, Cys58-110, Cys40-95 and Cys65-72. The first two (26-84 and 58-110) are essential for conformational folding; each joins an alpha helix of the first layer to a beta sheet of the second layer, forming a small hydrophobic core in its vicinity. The latter two disulfide bonds (40-95 and 65-72) are less essential for folding; either one can be reduced (but not both) without affecting the native structure under physiological conditions. These disulfide bonds connect loop segments and are relatively exposed to solvent. Interestingly, the 65-72 disulfide bond has an extraordinarily high propensity to form, significantly more than would be expected from its loop entropy, both as a peptide and in the full-length protein. This suggests that the 61-74 β-hairpin has a high propensity to fold conformationally.
RNase A is a basic protein (pI =8.63); its many positive charges are consistent with its binding to RNA (a poly-anion). More generally, RNase A is unusually polar or, rather, unusually lacking in hydrophobic groups, especially aliphatic ones. This may account for its need of four disulfide bonds to stabilize its structure. The low hydrophobic content may also serve to reduce the physical repulsion between highly charged groups (its own and those of its substrate RNA) and regions of low dielectric constant (the nonpolar residues).
The N-terminal α-helix of RNase A (residues 3-13) is connected to the rest of RNase A by a flexible linker (residues 16-23). As shown by F. M. Richards, this linker may be cleaved by subtilisin between residues 20 and 21 without causing the N-terminal helix to dissociate from the rest of RNase A. The peptide-protein complex is called RNase S, the peptide (residues 1-20) is called the S-peptide and the remainder (residues 21-124) is called the S-protein. The dissociation constant of the S-peptide for the S-protein is roughly 30 pM; this tight binding can be exploited for protein purification by attaching the S-peptide to the protein of interest and passing a mixture over an affinity column with bound S-protein. [A smaller C-peptide (residues 1-13) also works.] The RNase S model system has also been used for studying protein folding by coupling folding and association. The S-peptide was the first peptide from a native protein shown to have (flickering) secondary structure in isolation (by Klee and Brown in 1967)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ribonuclease_A&amp;oldid=417169401&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''RNase H'''
In a molecular biology laboratory, as RNase H specifically degrades the RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids and will not degrade DNA or unhybridized RNA, it is commonly used to destroy the RNA template after first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription, as well as procedures such as nuclease protection assays. RNase H can also be used to degrade specific RNA strands when the cDNA oligo is hybridized, such as the removal of the poly(A) tail from mRNA hybridized to oligo(dT), or the destruction of a chosen non-coding RNA inside or outside the living cell. To terminate the reaction, a chelator, such as EDTA, is often added to sequester the required metal ions in the reaction mixture.The enzyme RNase H is a non-specific endonuclease and catalyzes the cleavage of RNA via a hydrolytic mechanism. Members of the RNase H family can be found in nearly all organisms, from archaea and prokaryota and eukaryota.

The 3-D structure of RNase H commonly consists of a 5-stranded β-sheet surrounded by a distribution of α-helices. In some RNase H, such as the one found in HIV-1, the enzyme is missing one of the helices known as the C-helix, a positively charged α-helix whose protrusive shape increases substrate binding capacity. The active site of the enzyme is centered around a conserved DEDD motif (composed of residues: D443, E478, D498, and D549) which performs the hydrolysis of the RNA substrate. A magnesium ion is commonly used as a cofactor during the hydrolysis step. It is also a potential but unconfirmed mechanism in which multiple ions are necessary for to perform the hydrolysis. The enzyme also contains a nucleic acid binding cleft about 60 Å in length that can encompass a region of 18 bound RNA/DNA base pairs.
RNase H’s ribonuclease activity cleaves the 3’-O-P bond of RNA in a DNA/RNA duplex to produce 3’-hydroxyl and 5‘-phosphate terminated products. In DNA replication, RNase H is responsible for removing the RNA primer, allowing completion of the newly synthesized DNA&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNase_H&amp;oldid=422163070&lt;/ref&gt;.

Not long after, plant [[virologist]]s working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases observed a similar unexpected phenomenon. While it was known that plants expressing virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication.&lt;ref name=Covey_1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Covey S, Al-Kaff N, Lángara A, Turner D | title = Plants combat infection by gene silencing | journal = Nature | year = 1997 | volume = 385 | pages = 781&amp;ndash;2 | doi= 10.1038/385781a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse experiment, in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the targeted gene was suppressed in an infected plant.

Mello]] and [[Andrew Fire]]'s 1998 ''Nature'' paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor [[antisense RNA]] injections had an effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term ''RNAi''.  Fire and Mello's discovery was particularly notable because it represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2006 for their work.

RNAi is an RNA-dependent [[gene silencing]] process that is controlled by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's [[cytoplasm]], where they interact with the catalytic RISC component [[argonaute]]. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a [[virus]] with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by the enzyme [[Dicer]]. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-[[microRNA]]s expressed from [[non-coding RNA|RNA-coding gene]]s in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic [[stem-loop]] structure of pre-miRNA in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], then exported to the cytoplasm to be cleaved by Dicer. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15614608&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''dsRNA cleavage'''

Endogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by activating the ribonuclease protein Dicer, which binds and cleaves double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) to produce double-stranded fragments of 20–25 base pairs with a 2 nucleotide overhang at 3' end. Bioinformatics studies on the genomes of multiple organisms suggest this length maximizes target-gene specificity and minimizes non-specific effects.[10] These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are then separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC complex. After integration into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and induce cleavage of the mRNA, thereby preventing it from being used as a translation template.

'''RISC'''

RNA-Induced Silencing Complex, or RISC, is a multiprotein complex that incorporates one strand of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) or micro RNA (miRNA). RISC uses the siRNA or miRNA as a template for recognizing complementary mRNA. When it finds a complementary strand, it activates RNase and cleaves the RNA. This process is important both in gene regulation by microRNAs and in defense against viral infections, which often use double-stranded RNA as an infectious vector.

The active components of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, only one of the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation.

'''Dicer''' 

Dicer is an [[endoribonuclease]] in the [[RNase III]] family that cleaves [[dsRNA|double-stranded RNA]] (dsRNA) and pre-[[microRNA]] (miRNA) into short double-stranded RNA fragments called [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) about 20-25 [[nucleotide]]s long, usually with a two-base overhang on the 3' end. Dicer contains two RNase III domains and one PAZ domain; the distance between these two regions of the molecule is determined by the length and angle of the connector helix and determines the length of the siRNAs it produces. Dicer catalyzes the first step in the [[RNA interference]] pathway and initiates formation of the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC), whose catalytic component [[argonaute]] is an [[endonuclease]] capable of degrading [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) whose sequence is complementary to that of the siRNA guide strand.&lt;ref name=Jaronczyk_2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jaronczyk K, Carmichael J, Hobman T |title=Exploring the functions of RNA interference pathway proteins: some functions are more RISCy than others? |journal=Biochem J |volume=387 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=561–71 |year=2005 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15845026 | pmid=15845026 |doi=10.1042/BJ20041822 |pmc=1134985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human version of this gene is [[DICER1]].



===RNAi and Disease control===

It may be possible to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA mimics has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus, RNAi has also been shown to be effective in the reversal of induced liver failure in mouse models.

Other proposed clinical uses center on antiviral therapies, including topical microbicide treatments that use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard University Medical School; in mice, so far) by herpes simplex virus type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression,and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention being paid to the polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease. RNA interference is also often seen as a promising way to treat cancer by silencing genes differentially upregulated in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division. A key area of research in the use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method, which to date has involved mainly viral vector systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy.

==MicroRNA (miRNA)==
MicroRNAs were discovered in 1993 by Victor Ambros, Rosalind Lee and Rhonda Feinbaum during a study of the gene lin-14 in C. elegans development.They found that LIN-14 protein abundance was regulated by a short RNA product encoded by the lin-4 gene. A 61 nucleotide precursor from lin-4 gene matured to a 22 nucleotide RNA containing sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3’ UTR of the lin-14 mRNA. This complementarity was sufficient and necessary to inhibit the translation of lin-14 mRNA into LIN-14 protein. Retrospectively, the lin-4 small RNA was the first microRNA to be identified, though at the time, it was thought to be a nematode idiosyncrasy. Only in 2000 was a second RNA characterized: let-7, which repressed lin-41, lin-14, lin-28, lin-42, and daf-12 expression during developmental stage transitions in C. elegans. let-7 was soon found to be conserved in many species, indicating the existence of a wider phenomenon.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, on average only 22 nucleotides long and are found in all eukaryotic cells. miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in translational repression and gene silencing.

The function of miRNAs appears to be in gene regulation. For that purpose, a miRNA is complementary to a part of one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Animal miRNAs are usually complementary to a site in the 3' UTR whereas plant miRNAs are usually complementary to coding regions of mRNAs. Perfect or near perfect base pairing with the target RNA promotes cleavage of the RNA. This is the primary mode of plant microRNAs.In animals, microRNAs more often only partially base pair and inhibit protein translation of the target mRNA (this exists in plants as well but is less common).MicroRNAs that are partially complementary to a target can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. For partially complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its 'seed region') still have to be perfectly complementary.[68] miRNAs occasionally also cause histone modification and DNA methylation of promoter sites, which affects the expression of target genes.
Animal microRNAs target in particular developmental genes. In contrast, genes involved in functions common to all cells, such as gene expression, have very few microRNA target sites and seem to be under selection to avoid targeting by microRNAs.
dsRNA can also activate gene expression, a mechanism that has been termed &quot;small RNA-induced gene activation&quot; or RNAa. dsRNAs targeting gene promoters can induce potent transcriptional activation of associated genes. This was demonstrated in human cells using synthetic dsRNAs termed small activating RNAs (saRNAs), but has also been demonstrated for endogenous microRNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA MicroRNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''miRNA and disease'''

Just as miRNA is involved in the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells, so has dysregulation of miRNA been associated with disease. A manually curated, publicly available database miR2Disease documents known relationships between miRNA dysregulation and human disease.

'''miRNA and cancer'''
Several miRNAs have been found to have links with some types of cancer.
A study of mice altered to produce excess c-Myc — a protein with mutated forms implicated in several cancers — shows that miRNA has an effect on the development of cancer. Mice that were engineered to produce a surplus of types of miRNA found in lymphoma cells developed the disease within 50 days and died two weeks later. In contrast, mice without the surplus miRNA lived over 100 days. Leukemia can be caused by the insertion of a viral genome next to the 17-92 array of microRNAs leading to increased expression of this microRNA.
Another study found that two types of miRNA inhibit the E2F1 protein, which regulates cell proliferation. miRNA appears to bind to messenger RNA before it can be translated to proteins that switch genes on and off.
By measuring activity among 217 genes encoding miRNA, patterns of gene activity that can distinguish types of cancers can be discerned. miRNA signatures may enable classification of cancer. This will allow doctors to determine the original tissue type which spawned a cancer and to be able to target a treatment course based on the original tissue type. miRNA profiling has already been able to determine whether patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had slow growing or aggressive forms of the cancer.
Transgenic mice that over-express or lack specific miRNAs have provided insight into the role of small RNAs in various malignancies.
A novel miRNA-profiling based screening assay for the detection of early-stage colorectal cancer has been developed and is currently in clinical trials. Early results showed that blood plasma samples collected from patients with early, resectable (Stage II) colorectal cancer could be distinguished from those of sex-and age-matched healthy volunteers. Sufficient selectivity and specificity could be achieved using small (less than 1 mL) samples of blood. The test has potential to be a cost-effective, non-invasive way to identify at-risk patients who should undergo colonoscopy.

'''miRNA and heart disease'''
The global role of miRNA function in the heart has been addressed by conditionally inhibiting miRNA maturation in the murine heart, and has revealed that miRNAs play an essential role during its development. miRNA expression profiling studies demonstrate that expression levels of specific miRNAs change in diseased human hearts, pointing to their involvement in cardiomyopathies. Furthermore, studies on specific miRNAs in animal models have identified distinct roles for miRNAs both during heart development and under pathological conditions, including the regulation of key factors important for cardiogenesis, the hypertrophic growth response, and cardiac conductance.

'''miRNA and the nervous system'''
miRNAs appear to regulate the nervous system. Neural miRNAs are involved at various stages of synaptic development, including dendritogenesis (involving miR-132, miR-134 and miR-124), synapse formation and synapse maturation (where miR-134 and miR-138 are thought to be involved). Some studies find altered miRNA expression in schizophrenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The templating system uses Python string formatting

Create a template called page.tmpl :

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;{title}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello {name}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

then edit index.py and add this function :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def bar(name):
    return Template('page.tmpl',title='template test',name=name)&lt;/source&gt;

Enter &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost/index.py/bar?name=Joe&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to see how the templating engine replaced the placeholders {title} and {name} by the values passed to the function Template

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you have a document (image, JavaScript, CSS stylesheet) and you want to load them in a page, you pass an argument &quot;src&quot; or &quot;href&quot; to the tags &amp;lt;IMG&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&amp;gt;

If this argument is a &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; URL, remember that the script URL has the form &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/myscript.py/func&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. So if the document to load is in the same folder as the script, the relative URL must begin with &lt;i&gt;../&lt;/i&gt; : the relative URL &lt;i&gt;../foo.js&lt;/i&gt; will be resolved as the absolute URL &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/foo.js&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

If you forget the leading &lt;i&gt;../&lt;i&gt;, the relative URL &lt;i&gt;foo.js&lt;/i&gt; would have been resolved as the absolute URL &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/myscript.py/foo.js&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in a &quot;File not found&quot; error

The same goes for images and stylesheets :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    style = LINK(rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;,href=&quot;../default.css&quot;)
    body = IMG(src=&quot;../images/books.png&quot;)
    return HTML(HEAD(style)+BODY(body))&lt;/source&gt;

By default, protection lasts indefinitely. To specify an expiry, enter a length of time (e.g. &quot;31 hours&quot;, &quot;5 days&quot; or &quot;1 week&quot;) or an expiration date (e.g. &quot;1 {{#switch:{{CURRENTMONTH}}|1=February|2=March|3=April|4=May|5=June|6=July|7=August|8=September|9=October|10=November|11=December|12=January}}  {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTMONTH}}|12|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|{{CURRENTYEAR}} }}&quot;) in [http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Date-input-formats.html GNU standard format]. Expiry times for move-protection and edit-protection can be set for different lengths of time. This allows pages to be protected from editing for a definite period of time while move-protection can remain indefinitely.

== Several changes (2014-03) ==

{{Editprotected|answered=yes}}

Some of the links given here are out of date.  Specifically:
* &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;[http://toolserver.org/%7Eluxo/contributions/contributions.php?user={{urlencode:{{{1|$1}}}}}&amp;blocks=true Global contributions]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may be changed to just &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;[[luxo:{{{1|$1}}}|Global contributions]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (as per [[Special:Interwiki]]);
* judging per [[w:Template:Sp-contributions-footer]], &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/pcount/index.php?name={{urlencode:{{{1|$1}}}}}&amp;lang=en&amp;wiki=wikibooks&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be changed to &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;//tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/index.php?user={{urlencode:{{{1|Example}}}}}&amp;project=en.wikibooks&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;;
* &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?user={{urlencode:{{{1|$1}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may be changed &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;//tools.wmflabs.org/quentinv57-tools/tools/sulinfo.php?username={{urlencode:{{{1|Example}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which the former currently redirects to.)

(Generally, http://toolserver.org/ should be changed to //toolserver.org/ to allow for HTTPS access, but should the changes above be applied, there’d be no http://toolserver.org/ links anymore.)

TIA.

: Done.  I think. I hope.  Didn't work at first but then I realised that I was supposed to change all instances of &quot;example&quot; to $1.  Tested it from my own Contribs and it seems to be fine now.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:44, 28 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This special page takes some text and expands all [[Help:Templates|templates]] in it recursively. It also expands [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;#if:...}}, and [[mw:Help:Magic_words#Variables|variables]] like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;CURRENTDAY}}&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;mdash;in fact pretty much everything in double-braces. It does this by calling the relevant parser stage from MediaWiki itself. One can't supply values for template parameters (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/tt&gt;).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
On 2 November 1983, at a time when when the current President of Molossia, then still Prime Minister of Vuldstein, was stationed with the United States Army in (West) Germany, he wrote a declaration of war against East Germany for reasons including &quot;the disruption of sleep.&quot;  The declaration of war was rediscovered in September 2008 during a cleanout of the closets in the house of Kevin Baugh, President of Molossia.  The war was never formally ended.

Although it would seem that the end of East Germany, which took place on 3 October 1990, would also mark the end of the Molossian war with that nation, Molossia has claimed that East Germany lives on in an unlikely place, and thus the war lives on as well. The last remaining remnant of East German sovereignty, according to Molossia, is tiny Ernst Thälmann Island (Cayo Ernesto Thaelmann), off the coast of Cuba. The island is 15 kilometers long, but only 500 meters wide and is uninhabited except for the iguanas and birds that are indigenous there, and the occasional tourists stopping by. During a state visit to East Germany in June 1972 Fidel Castro made the island, then called Cayo Blanco del Sur, a gift to East Germany. The island was renamed in honor of German Communist politician Ernst Thälmann, who was the leader of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during much of the Weimar Republic and was later imprisoned and murdered during the Nazi regime. In August 1972, the East German ambassador to Cuba erected a bust of Ernst Thälmann on communist Germany’s one and only foothold in the tropics. The island wasn’t mentioned in the treaty unifying both Germanys, which makes it arguably the last remaining piece of East German territory.

Thus, claims Molossia, East Germany lives on on Ernst Thälmann Island. As the island is uninhabited, there is no one with whom to negotiate a peace treaty. Molossia is thus still at war with East Germany, with no end in sight. In response to this, the government of Molossia re-opened the War Department, closed since the successful prosecution of their 2005 war with the Sultanate of Mustachistan.

==[[Micronations/List of wars between or involving micronations/Molossian-East German War/2009 Ernst Thälmann Island Expedition|2009 Ernst Thälmann Island Expedition]]==

On 11 February 2009, a covert team of operatives from the Principality of Vikesland, headed by Prince Christopher of that nation, landed on Ernst Thälmann Island to conduct reconnaissance operations there. The purpose, claimed the expedition, was to determine the extent of East German activities on the island. Among other evidence of East German activities, the expedition discovered a massive communications tower and a fine specimen of the East German flag.

== Quenya to Neo-Quenya ==

May I ask why you moved a complete wikibook because of a question asked 3 years ago and to which no-one responded favourably?
Furthermore I removed the banner about &quot;the no longer featured&quot; because it isn't necessary to remind users of something from years ago.
[[User:Dirk math]] ([[User talk:Dirk math|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk math|contribs]]) 07:14, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
:&lt;[[w:WP:TPS|Talk page stalking]]&gt; Swift is a respected member of the Wikibooks community. As no one has opposed the proposition that the book is related to Neo-Quenya, I would have moved the book too. However, as you are the creator of the book and are disputing the move, I shall move it back in a jiffy.
:You also mentioned the no longer featured banner. While it may not be significant to you that a book was demoted from featured status years ago, it may to some others and in any case I don't think it's common to remove the banner. I have undone your edit, but you may start a discussion concerning such banners in the [[WB:RR|reading rooms]] (or any other place) if you wish. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

::The tag is merely informative and it's use is limited in time. I would substitute the tag by a post in the book's talk page, similar to what we do with surviving a RfD, in fact tagging the work with that tag without going deeply into why it was added in the talk page is not very useful, if we do indeed intent in keeping people working and improving the works...
::Also regarding the reversal of the move by Adrignola February 2011 executing Swift request from October 2008 my opinion is that it was wrong to undo the move without addressing Swift opinion (since the user is active and present) even if [[User:Dirk math]] is the creator, he failed to oppose the proposal in the proper way (talk page of the work or by talking to Swift directly) and time (2008 to 2011).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:56, 4 February 2011 (UTC)

:::I am not advocating Dirk math's opinions by reverting the move. Simply because another user disputes the move is reason enough to move it back because consensus is not reached, and if consensus is not reached the status quo should be maintained. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

::::Take a look at Darklama's statements in the recent RFD on the book (which Dirk math, one edit in Dec 2009 and hiatus in Dec 2007, did not participate in) for the rationale as to why Neo-Quenya is the more accurate descriptor of the book's content.  It was my hope that under the new name we wouldn't see a ''third'' RFD, thus avoiding putting the content in jeopardy again.  If Dirk math was opposed to the move, a statement should have been made there (as noted above, present since 2008), rather than simply removing tags I applied without even so much as an edit summary to explain.  Statements noting opposition would have been taken seriously, but as it stands this appears to be a case of [[WB:OWN|ownership]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:56, 4 February 2011 (UTC)

:::::DL's statements make sense, but I would like to see Dirk math's. Since he's opposing it, surely he has a reason. If he doesn't soon, or he 'loses' to DL's or other's arguments, then I see no reason why the book cannot be moved to Neo-Quenya, but I'd prefer to give him the benefit of doubt right now.

::::::Some thoughts about these statements:
::::::* Why should I have to change something in a book that I'm satisfied with? I didn't see any reason to change anything after its completion in 2007. So it seems a strange kind of reproach to say that someone didn't edit a book, to my knowledge continuous reworking isn't a requirement.
::::::* Neo-Quenya is the name given to all versions of Quenya that date from after the death of Tolkien. So just like a book about Modern English wouldn't be called Modern English (as opposed to e.g. a book about Middle English), it is strange to use the title Neo-Quenya when there is no Quenya without the Neo prefix (maybe the difference would be relevant if Quenya was restricted to describe Tolkien's research and not the language as it nowadays used by its fans).
::::::* And I didn't know that you have to reply to a remark someone makes on a talk page or somehow after three years it gets promoted to general opinion....
::::::* The RFD, I thought, was based upon the principle that invented languages aren't suitable for wikibooks. I don't want to become part of that discussion, but the reason I wrote the book was that I get a lot of questions about Quenya and it would be good to have the present state of the language all in one place. If wikibooks isn't the right place for invented languages, so be it.

== MerlLinkBot ==

Hi, why is my bot now unapproved again? [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMerlLinkBot&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=2051353&amp;oldid=1964593]. I think the bot was approved to run without flag. The bot flag discussion in 2009 was archived to [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions/Archive 8#MerlLinkBot.C2.A0.28_talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0_email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0_contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.29_.28Bot.29]] but this page was deleted, so i cannot give you a working link. But perhaps you can browse the archive. [[User:Merlissimo|Merlissimo]] ([[User talk:Merlissimo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Merlissimo|contribs]]) 14:41, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

:The archive is at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions/MerlLinkBot]].  You misunderstand the parameter.  It indicates that the bot is ''unapproved'' for the bot flag itself.  That is not to say that it cannot actually operate.  It just hasn't been ''approved'' for the flag. If you read the wording on the template as it appears on the bot page you'll see that it simply states that same information.  I just revised the template to distinguish between bots without the flag and those with, as well as those that had been approved for the flag but had it removed due to inactivity. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:26, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

== Thoughts on the main page! ==

I love it.  Who was working on the new code behind it?  I wish there were a better cross-Project wikicode crew that could share some of these techniques more readily.  Here we really need some way to help people page through or visaulize books the way Wikisource does it, especially when one is converting a sourcebook to a wikibook for editing.  It could be 'faux' page thumbnails, simply guessed at by some script by rendering the wikitext in longer Chapter-length wikipages... or one thumbnail per top level section... or? [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 08:24, 24 February 2011 (UTC)
:I give credit to [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] for the actual visual design.  Regarding code behind it, I used some templates imported from Wikipedia that were used to show random links over the recent changes there for wanted articles and modified their use to instead pull featured book templates.  While the code has some complexity to it, those wanting to feature new books don't have to know the details, as instructions are shown on [[Template:Goodbook]] and the other first-level templates shown in the wikicode for the Main Page.  This system is quite easier to get ahold of than the previous one where there were a bunch of parser functions right in the main page code, bewildering any admins trying to figure it out.  Now if we could only feature some more books... &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:05, 25 February 2011 (UTC)

== On CK12 ==

My friend Josh Gay was one of their techies and author-community organizers before leaving (he couldn't bear to stay after the license change) and he has some software that will complete the book conversions to mediawiki in a way that is compatible with wikibooks; you and he should perhaps work together on making the rest of the books better-formatted here.  

There's also a lot of work to be done to properly format the Light and Matter bokos and to keep them up to date; I Wuold like nothign better than to have some of thsoe atuhros use wikibooks (with suitable client software, perhaps) to update their works year over year.  When authors are able to actually use WB as their platform, the community will be able to grow more reasonably.

== No Fiction at Wikibooks?! ==

No fiction or poetry on WikiBooks?

But, they're books....??!!!

A book is a book.

There are wikibooks covering many topics which could be categorized as fiction.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various Cooking Instructions  &lt;strong&gt;(YUCK!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Why not something obviously listed as fiction?

Then we'd have a place to categorize all of those as well. Life would be less confusing for many, I'm sure.

Best Regards,

Pete

:I am a humble servant to policy.  [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] defines fiction as out of scope.  There were many in the past that liked strategy guides here as well, but they were deemed out of scope and removed.  Fiction can be especially poisonous to our reputation.  Having information that is not verifiable (based on facts) would lead readers to believe that nothing on Wikibooks can be taken seriously.  We are already quite lax in terms of not requiring references for information that appears to be reasonable on the surface.  But fiction would be over the line.  Books on religion can at least reference theological materials that represent the cornerstones of followers' beliefs, such as the Bible or Koran.  Political science books can reference real-life events and people and the campaigns and behaviors they have engaged in.  I'm not a fan of the Cookbook to be honest, but it's here to stay and is at least verifiable in that you can cook the recipe yourself and make corrections.  Fiction is not something you can verify, it is not textbook material, and it is something that would be deleted on sight.  I know the official slogan is &quot;open books for an open world&quot;, but as you'll read in our policy document linked above, we deal with textbooks in a much stricter definition of the word. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:52, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

Hello,

No sweat, I'll move it over to creative commons or something.

Pete
== Thank you for help with the Public Policy and Citizen Participation Book! ==

Wow. Import the history. I have no clue how that might work. 

I wonder how the copyright things works on print outs. Also, do User ID's have attribution rights, ''per se'', or is it just a courtesy?

I suppose it is covered by the link.

So if I edit over everything, I wonder if I still am required to cite? Probably no simple answer, 

but Wikibooks policies probably cover most issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Given any triangle ABC, let the altitudes through each vertex meet the opposite sides at G, H, K respectively.  As already noted, the altitudes intersect at the orthocentre O of the triangle.  The triangle GHK is the '''pedal triangle''' of ABC.  O is its incentre, and ABC is its excentral triangle.  If ABC is right-angled, the altitudes all pass through the right angle and the pedal triangle is a single point.

In the quadrilateral BKOG, the angles at K and G are by definition right angles, hence BKOG is cyclic; similarly, so are AHOK and CGOH.

If ABC is not an obtuse triangle and its sides are a, b and c, the angles of GHK are 180º-2A, 180º-2B and 180º-2C and its sides are a.cos(A), b.cos(B) and c.cos(C).  If the circumradius of ABC is R, we can write the sides as Rsin(2A), Rsin(2B) and Rsin(2A).  If ABC is an obtuse triangle, C being the obtuse angle, the angles of GHK are 2A, 2B and 2C-180º, and the third side is -c.cos(C).

== Properties of the pedal triangle ==
The area of GHK is {{frac|1|2}}(product of two sides)(sine of included angle) = {{frac|1|2}}Rsin(2B).Rsin(2C).Rsin(180-2A) = {{frac|1|2}}R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.sin(2A).sin(2B).sin(2C).

The circumradius of GHK is  &lt;math&gt;{HK \over {2\sin(HGK)}} = {{R\sin(2A)} \over {2\sin(180^0-2A)}} = {R \over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The circumcircle of GHK is the '''nine point circle''' of ABC.

The perimeter is 4Rsin(A)sin(B)sin(C).  The inradius is 2Rcos(A)cos(B)cos(C) and the three exradii are  2Rcos(A)sin(B)sin(C),  2Rsin(A)cos(B)sin(C) and 2Rsin(A)sin(B)cos(C).

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{OG}{AG} + \frac{OH}{BH} + \frac{OK}{CK} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If the sides are ''g'', ''h'' and ''j'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g}{a^2} + \frac{h}{b^2} + \frac{j}{c^2} = \frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2abc}&lt;/math&gt;.

 I am interested in learning the concepts on this page. However, I am unsure with which lesson I should start, 
because it would make learning calculus much more different if the lessons were not in an orderly fashion. 
Should I just take each lesson alphabetically? Or is there another recommended method for learning them? 
Thank you very much for your time spent answering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The encoding of a page can be set by the built-in name &lt;code&gt;ENCODING&lt;/code&gt;. It will define the Content-type header sent by the server

It affects both the encoding used to encode the data submitted by a form, and the encoding used to transform the bytestring received on the network connection to a string printed in the browser

Here is an example :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;ENCODING = &quot;utf-8&quot;

def index(**kw):
    form = FORM(action=&quot;show&quot;,method=&quot;POST&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(name=&quot;src&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
    return HTML(BODY(form))

def show(src):
    return src&lt;/source&gt;

By default, &lt;code&gt;ENCODING&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;sys.getdefaultencoding()&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cookies are managed by two variables available in the scripts :
* &lt;code&gt;COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary-like object holding the cookies sent by the browser and received by the script
* &lt;code&gt;SET_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary-like object used by the script to set cookies values, path, expiry date etc. and send them to the browser

Here is a simple script, cookies.py, that shows how to set, read and erase cookies :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def index(**kw):
    body = 'Received cookies'
    for cookie in COOKIE:
        body += BR()+B(cookie)+'&amp;nbsp;'+COOKIE[cookie].value
        body += A('Erase',href=&quot;erase?name=%s&quot; %cookie)
    form = FORM(action =&quot;set_cookie&quot;,method=&quot;post&quot;)
    form &lt;= 'Name'+INPUT(name=&quot;name&quot;)+BR()
    form &lt;= 'Value' + INPUT(name=&quot;value&quot;)+BR()
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
    return HTML(BODY(body+form))

def set_cookie(name,value):
    SET_COOKIE[name] = value
    SET_COOKIE[name]['path'] = '/'
    raise HTTP_REDIRECTION('index')

def cookie_expiry_date(numdays): 
    &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a cookie expiry date in the required format.
    `expires` should be a string in the format &quot;Wdy, DD-Mon-YY HH:MM:SS GMT&quot;
    &quot;&quot;&quot; 
    from datetime import date, timedelta 
    new = date.today() + timedelta(days = numdays) 
    return new.strftime(&quot;%a, %d-%b-%Y 23:59:59 GMT&quot;) 
    
def erase(name):
    SET_COOKIE[name] = ''
    SET_COOKIE[name]['path'] = '/'
    SET_COOKIE[name]['expires'] = cookie_expiry_date(-10)
    SET_COOKIE[name]['max-age'] = 0
    raise HTTP_REDIRECTION('index')
&lt;/source&gt;

In &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt;, the cookies sent by the browser are printed. Then a form allows the user to set another cookie, with a specified name and value

This form is submitted to the function &lt;code&gt;set_cookie(name,value)&lt;/code&gt;. In this function, a new entry is created in &lt;code&gt;SET_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; with the submitted data. The key 'path' of this entry is set to the server root. Then a redirection is performed to the &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt; function

When this redirection is done, the newly created cookie is sent to the browser. The browser stores the value and its attribute ; then it sends a request to the url &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/cookies.py/index&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

When this request is sent, the request headers include this cookie, received by the script in the variable &lt;code&gt;COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; : so the cookie name and value are printed at the top of the page

To erase the cookie, a link is provided, leading to the function &lt;code&gt;erase(name)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; is the cookie name. The function &lt;code&gt;erase()&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;SET_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; to erase the value, and set the expiry date to the past (10 days before today), using the function &lt;code&gt;cookie_expiry_date()&lt;/code&gt; to transform a datetime object to the format supported by the cookie specifications

At last, when these values are set for the cookie, another redirection is performed to &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt; : the browser receives the new information about the specified cookie. Since the expiry date is reached, it erases it. When it sends a request to &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/cookies.py/index&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it does not send a header for this cookie, which does not appear in the received cookies list

== Algorithm package ==

The algorithm package is not available.
Perhaps one of these should be used?
algorithm2e: Floating algorithm environment with algorithmic keywords. 
algorithmicx: The algorithmic style you always wanted. 
algorithms: A suite of tools for typesetting algorithms in pseudo-code. 
context-algorithmic: Algorithm handling. 

I am not sure which one is referred to so i hope someone can shed some light on it.

This is not correct.  \usepackage{algorithm} works just find on my Ubuntu 11.04 system.  Perhaps it is simply not installed on your machine? [[User:Karategeek6|Karategeek6]] ([[User talk:Karategeek6|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Karategeek6|contribs]])

== The naming of bundles/packages/environments appears wrong ==

On my ageing Ubuntu 10.04 system, I have the following packages:

* algorithms
* algorithmics
* algorithm2e

The first (algorithms) offers the environments:

* algorithmic
* algorithm

This page, as it stands, is not sufficiently clear on the distinction between bundles, packages, and environments.
Indeed, it is probably outright wrong in many places.
I am afraid I haven't the time to sort this out, but the issue is worth flagging.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==

Predacious diving beetles belong to the Order Coleoptera and the Family Dytiscidae. Thermonectus is their species name. 

They are aquatic beetles having a streamlined convex body. They are smooth and shiny—usually 1/8 to 1 inch long. Most species are dark brown or black in color. Some have distinctive patterns of spots, lines or mottling on the elytra (wing covers). They have filiform (thin and hairlike) antennae. Their flat hind legs are fringed with hairs to help them swim in water. The tarsi (hind legs) have claws at the end. Larvae are long with well-developed legs and large curved mandibles (jaws).
  
Acilius semisulcatus is a medium-sized predacious diving beetle with a black-margined square on the yellow prothorax. There are curved bands crossing the back of the elytra.
Predacious diving beetle larvae are called “water tigers.” They are shaped like a rounded rod tapering toward each end. They have long curved mandibles. There are openings on the back end for getting air at the water surface. They can also breathe through their skin or long gills in the abdomen.

==Where does it live?==

There are about 3500 Predacious diving beetle species worldwide and about 500 in North America. Different species live in a variety of aquatic habitats. Shallow, weedy ponds are good places to find them. They are also found in streams, lakes, ponds, and puddles. Sometimes they are found in salt water ponds. They do not live in fast-moving water. 

Adults and larvae can be seen in spring, summer and fall. Adults of some species move to deeper lakes in the winter, where they remain active under the ice.

==What does it eat?==

Adults and larvae are predators of other insects. They eat frogs, toads, salamanders and small fish. The larvae, called “water tigers,” have fierce appetites. They use their large, needle-like mandibles to inject digestive enzymes into prey to dissolve body tissue. The liquid is then sucked up through channels in the larvae’s jaws. 

Giant Diving Beetles are members of the Predacious diving beetle family. They belong to the genus Dytiscus. They are voracious aquatic predators that often take prey as large as or larger than themselves.

==How does it defend itself?==

Predaceous diving beetles are prey to birds and mammals. They are slow moving when on land, but in water they are fast swimmers. They are able to move through the water and quickly dive to avoid predators.

Larvae are smaller and hard to catch because of their fast movement. In a small pond, they may be at the top of the food chain without predators.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Predaceous diving beetles undergo complete metamorphosis. They grow from an egg to a larva, then to a pupa, and finally to an adult. 

Females cut slits in water plants to lay their eggs inside stems. Development time for many species is unknown. Larvae pupate in cells dug into wet soil under logs or rocks near the water. The soft-bodied, pale (teneral) adults stay inside their pupal cells to harden before emerging after the final molt.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

To swim, predaceous diving beetles move their hind legs simultaneously (at the same time) rather than alternately (one at a time). They hold the tip of the abdomen up to the water surface to obtain air. When they are under water, they breathe using stored air under the elytra. 

Adults leave the water at night to fly around. They use the moon to navigate. In populated areas, they are attracted to porch lights, street lights and gas station lights.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Predaceous diving beetles are beneficial because they eat harmful insects. They are capable of biting, but are generally harmless to people. 

They become a nuisance when too many fly around bright lights where people live and work.

They are sometimes harmful in fish hatcheries because they eat young fry (newly hatched fish).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plasmids are considered extrachromosomal DNA which are capable of self replication within a suitable host. Plasmids can be found in all three major organism, ''Archea, Bacteria and Eukaryote''. A plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from, and can replicate independently of, the chromosomal DNA. They are double stranded and, in many cases, circular. Plasmids usually occur naturally in bacteria, but are sometimes found in eukaryotic organisms (e.g., the 2-micrometre-ring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
Plasmid size varies from 1 to over 1,000 kilobase pairs (kbp). The number of identical plasmids within a single cell can range anywhere from one to even thousands under some circumstances. Plasmids can be considered to be part of the mobilome, since they are often associated with conjugation, a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.
The term plasmid was first introduced by the American molecular biologist '''Joshua Lederberg''' in 1952.

Similar to viruses, plasmids are not considered a form of &quot;life&quot; as it is currently defined. Unlike viruses, plasmids are &quot;naked&quot; DNA and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host, though some classes of plasmids encode the sex pilus necessary for their own transfer. Plasmid host-to-host transfer requires direct, mechanical transfer by conjugation or changes in host gene expression allowing the intentional uptake of the genetic element by transformation. Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is neither parasitic nor symbiotic in nature, since each implies the presence of an independent species living in a commensal or detrimental state with the host organism. Rather, plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and typically provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state. Plasmids may carry genes that provide resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental niche, or alternatively the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances. Plasmids also can provide bacteria with an ability to fix elemental nitrogen or to degrade recalcitrant organic compounds which provide an advantage under conditions of nutrient deprivation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to load a module in the Python standard distribution, or in a third-party package installed in the distribution, just use the usual

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;import mymodule&lt;/source&gt;

You might also want to import a module specifically designed for your web application. In this case ''you can't use &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;'', because of the algorithm used by the Python interpreter to find a module by its name : the interpreter searches for a module of the specified name in a list of folders, and you can't reliably modify this list to add your application folder, because in a multithreaded server you have no control on it

So for this kind of module, you should use a different syntax :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;mymodule = Import('mymodule.py')&lt;/source&gt;

The argument of &lt;code&gt;Import()&lt;/code&gt; is the url for the module, it is resolved by the server as for all other urls

This module can use all the built-in names defined by Karrigell : this means that an imported module can itself import other user-defined modules by &lt;code&gt;Import()&lt;/code&gt;, use the names in HTMLTags, etc

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Growing Bacterial culture ==
Plasmids are almost always purified from liquid bacteria cultures, usually E. coli, which have been transformed and isolated. Virtually all plasmid vectors in common use encode one or more antibiotic resistance genes as a selectable marker (Ex :kanamycin, Ampicillin), which allows bacteria that have been successfully transformed to multiply uninhibited.

== Harvesting and lysis of the bacteria ==
When bacteria are lysed under alkaline conditions both DNA and proteins are precipitated. Some scientists reduce the concentration of NaOH used to 0.1M in order to reduce the occurrence of ssDNA. After the addition of acetate-containing neutralization buffer the large and less supercoiled chromosomal DNA and proteins precipitate, but the small bacterial DNA plasmids can renature and stay in solution.

== Preparations of plasmid DNA ==
Kits are available from varying manufacturers to purify plasmid DNA, which are named by size of bacterial culture and corresponding plasmid yield. In increasing order, these are the miniprep, midiprep, maxiprep, megaprep, and gigaprep. The plasmid DNA yield will vary depending on the plasmid copy number, type and size, the bacterial strain, the growth conditions, and the kit.

=== Minipreparation ===
Minipreparation of plasmid DNA is a rapid, small-scale isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria. It is based on the alkaline lysis method invented by the researchers Birnboim and Doly in 1979. The extracted plasmid DNA resulting from performing a miniprep is itself often called a &quot;miniprep&quot;. Minipreps are used in the process of molecular cloning to analyze bacterial clones. A typical plasmid DNA yield of a miniprep is 20 to 30 µg depending on the cell strain.
==== Miniprep Protocols ====

The protocol is described below.

=== Midipreparation ===
The starting E. coli culture volume is 15-25 ml of LB broth and the expected DNA yield is 100-350&amp;nbsp;µg.

=== Maxipreparation ===
The starting E. coli culture volume is 100-200 ml of LB broth and the expected DNA yield is 500-850&amp;nbsp;µg.
==Small scale preparation of plasmid DNA or Miniprep ==

Inoculate single colony of E. coli DH5- bearing the plasmid in 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and  incubate overnight at 37C with shaking at 200 rpm. was Resuspende the Bacterial pellet from 3 ml of the overnight culture in 100 µl of ice-cold solution I (50 mM glucose, 25 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0) by vortexing. Add 200 µl of freshly prepared solution II (0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS) and the mix the contents  by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Then 150 µl of ice-cold solution III (3 M potassium- 5 M acetate) was added and mixed by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Incubate the tube  on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at room temperature. The clear supernatant containing the plasmid DNA was collected into a fresh 1.5 ml eppendorf tube leaving the cellular debris behind and precipitated with two volumes of 95% ethanol for 5 min on ice. The precipitated plasmid DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000g for 20 min at room temperature, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried and dissolved in 20 µl of water or TE pH 8.0 containing 20 µg/ml of DNase-free pancreatic RNase A (prepared by boiling RNase A for 20 min). The plasmid DNA was then checked on a 0.8% agarose gel and stored at -20C. The typical yield for a high copy plasmid from 3 ml of culture was about 12-16 μg and the DNA was suitable for routine procedures such as restriction enzyme digestion and preparation of radiolabelled probe.

==Solution==
Solution I 

50 mM glucose,
 
25 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.0

10 mM EDTA pH 8.0

Solution II 

0.2 N NaOH

1% SDS or SLS

Solution III 

3 M potassium- 5 M acetate

RNase A


Ampicillin: A stock solution of 100 mg/ml ampicillin was made in sterile double-distilled water. Working concentration was 100 µg/ml. (concentration may vary lab to lab)

Kanamycin: A stock solution of 50 mg/ml ampicillin was made in sterile double-distilled water. Working concentration was 50 µg/ml.(concentration may vary lab to lab)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Where to shift development of MINC=

This book/page is an attempt to record the history of the big MINC2.0
CVS change of 2011 with perhaps a well written rationale for the
choice that is to be made. For now it is nothing more than a bunch of
headings that need content added in them but I hope that others will
fill in more things so that we can all make a reasonably informed
choice.

Add your vote by adding your name and perhaps a reason why. If you have other choices, feel free to add them.

===Leave it at the BIC===

The BIC uses a CVS system that requires the user to have a BIC login (and be part of the coders group) in order to commit to CVS. This is done exclusively via SSH logins. There is no strictly used bug tracking system although mantis.bic.mni.mcgill.ca was proposed and used a little. Most of the tracking is still done via the minc-users and minc-development mailing lists.

Pros
* nothing changes
* CVS

Cons
* nothing changes
* CVS

===NITRC - http://www.nitrc.org/===

NITRC is a NIH funded initiative that was designed to host projects such as MINC, you can make a choice of CVS or SVN and nothing else that I can see. The bug tracking and others things are done via eForge.

Pros
* Made for the Neuroimaging community
* Uses eForge? for issue tracking/lists/etc
* GIT/SVN/CVS

Cons
* not as pretty of a code interface as github/others

Votes
* Andrew Janke

===Don't care as long as it's public and DVCS===

Options are:
* Github (Git), Sourceforge (Git), Launchpad (Bazaar), Google Code (Mercurial?), NITRC (Git)

Votes
* Jason Lerch

===NITRC + DVCS wherever===

NITRC : for users (mailing list, forum, MINC wiki books as a plugin ?)

Anything public and DVCS : for developpers (nice bug tracking &amp; project management a +, not too good on NITRC).

Votes 
* Pierre Bellec 

===GIThub===
Pros
* DVCS
* Awesome UI 
* Bug Tracking included
* Large Open Source community

Cons
* 

Votes
*

===launchpad===
Pros
* DVCS (Bazaar)
* makes package building for Ubuntu easier.

Cons
* 

Votes
*

===google code===
Pros
* DVCS

Cons
*

I am aware that this book, and its module [[Relationships/Sex]] have survived [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Relationships|1]], [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Relationships/Sex|2]], [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Relationships/Sex (2)|3]], requests for deletion in the past. This book does not satisfy [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]] policy. One look at the [[:Category:NPOV disputes]] speaks volumes about the content of this book.

Everything from the basic structure of the book to the content breathes sexist, heterosexist, and pseudo-scientific opinions. Content is tangled with rude or misogynist anecdotes. It is offensive, and it is un-salvageable. I strongly believe it should be deleted. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 05:50, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

: All 3 past nominations were based on NPOV issues and failed. POV alone is usually not enough reason to delete because with heavy edited it can be improved. Do you have anything new to add which hasn't already been thoroughly discussed before? I propose speedy keeping this if not. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:28, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete''' The theory behind not deleting a POV book is that just because it's POV now doesn't mean it has to stay that way.  That's a healthy attitude to take in most cases, but it breaks down when there's reason to think that the material cannot possibly ever be transformed into something NPOV.  I agree this is unsalvagable; and we ''do'' have objective evidence to support this that was not available to those who '''failed to reach consensus''' on the earlier book deletion nom: we have the lack of repair during the ensuing three plus years.  The problem is, as Thereen mentions, structural.  Symptomatically (as well as contributively), the [[Relationships/About This Book|About This Book]] section is focused on the author, is written in the first person, is signed, and promotes a view of the book as fixed except for formatting &amp;mdash; all violating the meta-principle of collaborativity.  It claims, note, that this was a published book that wasn't very successful and &quot;[m]any people were extremely offended by&quot;, whose author decided to make it available &quot;free as a Wikibook&quot;.  ''Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships''.  Speaking of which,
:[[File:Symbol question.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Question''' I don't deal with copyright issues much, but is there confirmation that the registered user involved really is the author of the published book, so that the whole thing isn't one massive copyvio?  It seems pretty weird to make it a wikibook and then charge fifteen bucks to get it on Kindle (though that doesn't mean it wasn't done, of course).
:--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:23, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
:: Copyright issues were discussed previously as well. Apparently the person that started the book here is also listed as the publisher at Amazon for the book. AFAIK the names being the same was the only confirmation that I know of that was done. I previously proposed moving this book to Wikisource as a solution upon that discovery. People believed Wikisource policy wouldn't allow its inclusion due to being self-published, though I wonder if that wasn't a stretch or misinterpretation of their policy. I would assume Wikisource policy was meant to exclude using Wikisource as a means to self publish rather than to exclude works that have already been published by a person. I do acknowledge this would likely mean any contributions to the book since being added to Wikibooks could not be kept. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:45, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
:: I've now edited the [[Relationships/About This Book|About This Book]] page to deal with the first-person perspective issue, the sense that the book is fixed, and the tone to be a bit more neutral. I think that should serve as a good example illustrating how the POV issues could be fixed by anyone at any time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:15, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
::: The more I think about the copyright situation here, the worse it seems.  The sentiment in the previous discussion, I read as &quot;well, we can't prove it's a copyvio&quot; &amp;mdash; but the registered user who originally wrote it ''claimed'' that it's the same as the published book, and I think we should be taking xyr word as our default position on the sameness of the books.  And if the books are the same, our default position on copyright has to be that it's a copyvio unless we have better proof of permission than the contributor's choice of user name and unsubstantiated claim of identity.

::: I noticed a flub in your rewrite of the &quot;About&quot; section:  all four parts of the book are from the published version.  I'd had trouble being sure about that when I read the &quot;About&quot; myself, so I checked the Amazon page for the print book &amp;mdash; and there, in a customer review, is the complete list of parts and chapters of the book as it occurs on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:13, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:::: The attitude about copyright could possibility have to do with the fact that there is an wikimedia essay that advices to [[meta:avoid copyright paranoia|avoid copyright paranoia]]. Maybe you (or someone else) can find a way to get in contact with Thomas David Kehoe to get the concern addressed? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:07, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:{{comment}} - Under  '''[[Wikibooks:WIW]]''',  &quot;Wikibooks is not a mirror or a text repository&quot; seems to sum up another important point about this wikibook. The original author dumped this sexist work into Wikibooks because few people bought it, and most were offended by its content. This is the authors own statement. Does wikibooks need this work? Does wikibooks as a community want to accept work which is admittedly offensive? The standard counter to an NPOV-centred RfD is that it may be dealt with down the line, in some unforeseeable future. As a person who went through the [[Relationships]] book with the intention to deal with the POV issues, I can say that the book itself is an NPOV issue. Every page. The structure. The anecdotes. If I was to sort out the NPOV issues entirely, I would be starting from scratch. Deleting the book would make more sense than taking out 95% of the content, renaming most of the pages, and entirely refocusing the book. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 07:31, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::Under certain circumstances Wikibooks can be a mirror and it is certainly a text repository (it all depends on the educational value of the text and the context). I really think that you are removing the WIW wording out of its intended context.  
::I think Darklama's views are to the point and that this RfD is without merit if it only centered on the NPOV rational and any of the already previously discussed issues. Nothing seems to have changed.
::I would on the other hand support a move to Wikisource, as proposed by Darklama, (that would result in losing any changes made to the original text so far) and would support anyone taking the context to create a better book, but that is not on the table and goes beyond simply deleting content. NPOV issues aren't resolved by deletions but by content that provides a balanced or neutral view point over the issues.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:51, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:: Arguments that this book isn't NPOV, both now and in the past, seem to be based on personal beliefs rather than objectivity. I think it is important to remember that NPOV and verifiability are linked. Wikibookians should attempt to teach/explain facts objectively without including their own opinions or commentary, and should cite sources for any viewpoints expressed. This book cites sources, which means to begin with there are a few possible objective questions to answer:

::* '''Q''': Are the cited sources reliable?
::* '''Q''': Were the sources accurately cited?
::* '''Q''': Was the citations complete?
::* '''Q''': Are there any other major opinions in the field? (cite sources)

:: I suggest before continuing down the line that this book in its entirety isn't NPOV, people must verify the answers to the above questions, and cite sources for other major opinions in the field to prove lack of NPOV. Facts are not always politically correct, neutral, covenant, or non-controversial, nor are facts required to be so. If for example a fact is controversial in the field than a book should explain this and cite a reliable source that mentions that the fact is controversial. Removing reliable and verified citations can actually bias a book further. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:52, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::: When a text is POV, the people most likely to ''notice'' that it's POV are those who disagree most strongly with that POV; likewise, the people most likely to ''object'' to its being POV.  If you only listen to objections of POV from people who ''agree'', you would conclude that FOX News is fair and balanced.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:34, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::: I don't expect people to agree, and I agree with you. My only hope, like you above, is to rely/expect objective reasoning and evidence to be used. We don't allow people to include their personal opinions in books just because they happen to disagree, we expect people to cite sources. We should also expect people to cite sources if they are going to use lack of NPOV as the main argument for deletion in order to keep discussion objective and productive. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:46, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::: I don't think that we should (on Wikibooks) rely heavily in sources (and that hasn't been done so far, but I have noted that you defended that they should have a greater importance also in previous discussion, hence this counterbalancing post).
::::: We, the community, have already established that this is necessarily a gray zone of the Wikibooks project in regards to original ideas, sources are important, but unlike Wikipedia, here they are not an end on themselves as to establish validity to the content. We do support &quot;personal&quot; interpretation (and some times projects focus exclusively on that), what we should focus is on permitting divergent opinions to be constructively expressed and enable, even promote, people to use critical thinking over the information presented and to express it freely, protecting works that have violations of the NPOV from deletion. This is a necessity due to the project relying on volunteer work. People will mostly only contribute content that they see as valid, even if others find it erroneous or skewed, this is why NPOV issues arise and a consideration that should be kept in mind when discussing the subject. Sources (among other factors, like even a prof of credentials) may be important to establish a valid common ground, but some leeway must be provided if we intend on keeping contributors, as every one has its own special view or opinion on a multitude of subjects. Minority opinions are extremely important and educative, we can even say that a NPOV violation issue in itself is educative as it demonstrate, even if sometimes in an uncomfortable way, that not everyone sees the issue in the same light and that may permit to have more valuable and abrangent content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:37, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::Though I resent the idea that keeping a 'minority opinion' that expounds sexist and and relies on stereotypes because it is educational (in fact, my feminist bias says it's counter-educational), I would definitely support a '''transwiki''' to Wikisource with it's original content intact. That does seem to be the most logical solution. Also, as a note to [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]], with the utmost respect, I do not believe I am using WIW out of its intended context, as it can be manipulated in what one would perceive as the educational value of the text. I would consider it to have none.--[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 17:50, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::: I'm concerned removing content solely on the basis of the potential to offend would set a bad precedent that we shouldn't want. What researchers learn from doing research can sometimes be offensive, or sound sexist, racist, etc. What is learned from sampling of research subjects is often generalized and statistics used to explain what percentage of or group of people in a populations are likely to fit into a specific classification. People should be able to refer to and cite peer reviewed research where that is the case in books at Wikibooks regardless if it may offend some people or sounds sexist, racist, etc. as part of any objective coverage of a topic. If there are other peer reviewed studies that found different results I think those results should be included too. I'm aware of studies where I personally find the results offensive, but I still think people should be able to cite them because it is what is currently known. BTW I'm against deletion, if Wikisource won't accept it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:42, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::::Opinions or bias only have problems when used to oppose, suppress or disregard alternative views, I don't see any other way that acknowledging the existence of minority opinions, especially if they aren't conventional, as beneficial and educative, the only alternative would be dismissal and suppression, in Wikibooks that can only occur by exerting editorial control or by the deletion of content, and that will always, in general terms, be objected to. Even if most of us at one time or another recognized or even supported silently or by inaction those actions, as I said is in our nature to act mostly on self interest, hence the need for protecting works that are tagged as NPOV violations, of course within reason...
:::::::I recall editing some of the pages on that work and there is indeed a post of mine on the book's talk page. I remember preventing the exacerbation of some o the sexist views and contributing some small content to it. I'm also a feminist, but I'm also a realist. Feminism to the extreme erodes and challenges the structures of society, with hopefully short term negative impact, it even contradicts biological imperatives and the evolutionary specification of the sexes, and in that respect I also have to state that I view most societies as flawed, unsustainable artificial social structures, that have imperatively to continue evolving as to be beneficent. In any case I have no bias (that word can have a broad interpretation) on the subject and do recognize that other views exist, that the subject is not black and white. One shouldn't intentionally or with awareness skew information to promote a view point or go out exclusively to promote it as the absolute truth by suppressing different view points. Have you contributed to the work, engaged its contributors before promoting the deletion?
:::::::My opinion is that any view point can only be defended if contrasted with an alternative, that this contrast is what is intended by providing a NPOV. In fact in this subject I also defend that a specific point of view could be implemented, to the exclusion of others, if clearly stated as part of the subject of a work (as a way to inform readers and contributors), in some regards this is already done in several works as a way to define what and how a subject should be covered.
:::::::Taking for instance the most objected page Relationships/Sex I see some minor issues but I would define it as having intrinsic educational value.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:39, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::: Your comments have nothing to do with what was actually written. I never suggested anything about a heavy reliance on sources. Interpretations are different from opinions. [[WB:NPOV]] mentions that NPOV is not necessary all encompassing, that non-mainstream views are almost always irrelevant, and there is a limit to what POVs are worth mentioning. I suggest the idea that minority opinions must be included/covered in our books might almost always go against NPOV. I think what is a minority opinion depends on the subject, scope, and audience. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:53, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::: Your wording could be (and I have) interpreted that way, that is why I have seen the need to provide a counterbalance, since this was not the first time I've read your position as promoting a heavier reliance upon sources on the Wikibooks project, am sorry if I got your position wrong and glad you made it clearer.
::::::: I also am having difficulty in understanding the last section of the above post, because of the use of the word &quot;must&quot;, did you mean &quot;if&quot;? or are you supporting the need for an imperative inclusion. I agree they &lt;u&gt;may&lt;/u&gt; be included and should be welcomed, but not as an obligation and disagree that by doing so &quot;might almost always go against NPOV&quot;, except in controversial issues, especially in relation to contemporaneous subjects (we had several issue regarding politics and prominent figures), it also depends on the level of activity on the work, doing so doesn't directly signify increasing tensions and conflicts and are beneficial to permit complete coverage of the subjects. (See also the above post on defining a specific view point on a book's subject).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:39, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::::: No I'm not suggesting a need for an imperative inclusion. I interpreted what you wrote as there being a need for an imperative inclusion of minority views. I consider an imperative to include minority views to almost always go against NPOV and to contradict NPOV. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:35, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Notes for conference call on the Future of MINC, held Feb 23, 20111 =

== Present ==
Patrick, Jim, Mallar, Marc, Samir (all the way from Singapore), John, Jason, Pierre, Alex, Mishkin, Anka, Dniel, Simon D, Simon E, Vlad &amp; Louis

==Topics ==

===What is the goal of MINC? What is our goal?===

* MINC is a complex, powerful image file format that is self documenting, self describing, extensible, portable and specific for n-dimensional medical images.  MINC has a standard API to ensure that files are read/written always conform to the MINC definition.
* Our goal is to guarantee a future for MINC (and the MINC tools) in the face of competing file formats and software packages by simplifying the installation and use of the MINC libraries and tools.

=== From the users – the main request is simplicity: ===
*	Simple installation, single point of contact for progs/docs
*	Up-to-date documentation
*	Example software
*	Example analyses
*	A user interface 

===Software Distributions/ Computer systems supported===
*	Linux ( Debian, ubuntu, redhat, )
*	Mac
*	Windows	
:This could open up a large user-base
:but have issues with effort/resources.  related to GUI
*	One package vs many small packages
*	License issues – what can be bundled and what can’t (MINC vs GPL license)
*	Testing 
** Comprehensive testing is required for each release
** Dashboard-style testing/reporting?

===I/O===
* Bindings for 
**	R (Jason’s RMINC and Jim's newer and better mincIO)
**	Python (Jason’s https://launchpad.net/pyminc)
**	Octave, Matlab( Pierre’s NIAK)
**	C/C++ 
***	Vlad’s EZminc, 
***	David’s volumeIO
***	CImg supports minc (http://cimg.sourceforge.net/)
* MINC1 vs MINC2 API support and use
*	ITK &amp; VTK – currently with limited support.
*	NIFTI support? 
**	Lots of advantages from user’s perspective at first glance, but…
**	Disadvantages: 
***	Viewer-centric definition of data ordering (radiological vs neurological) without this information in the file header
***	lack of robust coordinate system information
***	lack of intensity mapping info
***	will the users rise up and bite us?

===What to link/association with===
*	Neurodebian (Michael Hanke's neuro.debian.net)

===Integration with other software tools===
*	Osirix, ITK-snap, Elastix, ANTs

===Software development tools===
*	Needs:
**	include/integrate external developers (who can submit/ who do we trust?)
**	proper bug tracking
::(Jim): real, live minc bugs can make sure that the bug has been noted by minc-dev and have some idea WRT fix status. Perhaps such a system could be integrated with a compensation model in which fixes or (approved) feature requests would be assigned a monetary value and then devs would be free to &quot;sign-up&quot; to work on a given request?
**	distributed version control systems yet? (git, hg, bzr, etc.)
**	Possibilities:
***	CVS repository @ MNI (or elsewhere)
***	NITRC (www.nitrc.org, they are keen to have us join + do they have git?).
***	Launchpad (launchpad.net)
***	Google code,
***	track

===Documentation===
*	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC/
*	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC/Tutorials 
*     FAQ
* Example code

===MINC tools not in standard distribution===
*	structure segmentation tools
**      Brain extraction mincBET
**	ANIMAL structure segmentation (Collins)
**	Hippocampus + MTL structures fusion labelling (Collins)
**	thalamus + basal ganglia (Mallar)
**      Lateral ventricle segmentation (V.Fonov)
*	surface segmentation
**	CLASP (Evans)
*	Analysis tools
**	fMRI stat
**	NIAK (Pierre B)
**	ITK Snap (Vlad's mods for minc; if minc properly supported in ITK, then this mod not needed)
**	ElastiX (Dante)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Extraction of Genomic DNA from Eukaryotic cells==

Large scale isolation of genomic DNA from cells grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks or tissue samples (e.g. liver) from sacrificed animals. Briefly, to 10 ml of extraction buffer (10 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 0.1M EDTA pH 8.0, 20 g/ml pancreatic RNase, 0.5% SDS) in a polypropylene tube 2.5 x 107 PCC4 cells (trypsinised and suspended in TE pH 8.0) or 100 mg tissue (frozen in liquid nitrogen and powdered by crushing) was added. The contents were mixed completely by inversion and incubated for 1 hr at 37C. To the lysed cells 1 mg of proteinase K was added at a final concentration of 100 g/ml (from a 20 mg/ml stock) mixed gently by inversion and incubated at 37C for 3-5 hr or overnight with frequent mixing during incubations. After proteinase K digestion, a viscous solution completely free of debris was observed. The solution was cooled, an equal volume of Tris-saturated phenol was added, mixed on a roto-torque to mix the two phases and then centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at room temperature. The upper clear aqueous viscous phase was transferred using a 5 ml pipette with a cut tip. The aqueous phase was further subjected to two rounds of phenol-chloroform and one round of chloroform extraction. The aqueous phase was then transferred to a clean polypropylene tube, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.2) and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol were added at room temperature and the contents mixed. The genomic DNA precipitate was spooled using a 1 ml pipette tip and transferred to 1.5 ml eppendorf tube containing 70% ethanol and centrifuged briefly. The resultant pellet was washed further with two more rounds of 70% ethanol, briefly air-dried, 1 ml of fresh autoclaved water was added and the samples were stored at 4C overnight for the genomic DNA to dissolve. DNA was checked on a 0.7% agarose gel and the total yield was determined to be 100 g each for both PCC4 cells and tissue.

Extraction buffer 

10 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 

0.1M EDTA pH 8.0, 

20 g/ml pancreatic RNase, 

0.5% SDS

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Initial List of action items to improve MINC=

==Make list of code/programs/packages available==

We need to generate a list of all software tools written with MINC that have been created (in the BIC or elsewhere).  For each item in the list, we need to know at least
* the name of the software
* a short description of what is does, list of functions, list of parameters
* who is the author of the software
* who maintains the software
* is the software publicly available? and if not, can if be made available?
* is documentation available? and if so, where is it
* is the software stable or still in development (if the former it could potentially be in a massive MINC bundle).
* what are the software's dependencies
* minc1/minc2 compatibility

* need makefile for all of minc tools (Vlad has a build all makefile)
* need makefile to build minc library only (subset of Vlad's makefile)

an initial [[/minctoollist/|list of minc tools]] is here

==Make a list of documentation available==

For each piece of documentation, 
* what software or process does it document
* who wrote the doc, who maintains the documentation
* user doc or tech doc
* rating for the documentation (quality control, reviewed by pro)

==Need plan for future documentation==

* wiki.bic.mni.mcgill - should be open to the outside (I think)
:: I am not adverse to using a BIC hosted site for documentation but would prefer a most &quot;neutral&quot; hosted site to encourage others to contribute. - AJ
:: If we are to use NITRC as the main host of MINC, why not use the NITRC wiki as a developer's wiki for technical stuff, early stubs of documentation and discussion pages like &quot;the future of MINC&quot;. I suggest that the MINC wiki book should be reserved to clean, stable and user-oriented documentation. BTW, it would be good to be able to produce a PDF as well. - PB
* need examples of good documentation to use as a guide
:: FSL has good docs
:: SPM on wikibooks - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM - AJ
:: Check out the NIAK pdf overview - http://www.nitrc.org/frs/downloadlink.php/2726 - PB 
:: any other examples?
* API docs vs USER guides
:: they serve very different purposes.  users could be engaged to write user manuals
* need to find out what documentation already exists
* Training / courseware
:: a first step would be a workshop for existing minc users &amp; developpers. I volunteer to help set that up in June soon after or before HBM (probably after). We would probably need better documentation and a clear idea of what softwares can be considered part of the MINC suite before organizing an actual minc course, but this clearly could happen in the near future. - PB
* need a good MINC preamble
:: why is MINC worth the trouble? what makes it so good?
:: there are two &quot;introduction&quot; and &quot;history&quot; section on the wiki book. It might be better to merge those. - PB

== Evaluate NITRC as a host of MINC tool development ==

We need to evaluate NITRC ( http://www.nitrc.org ) to host the MINC development project.  We need to know 

* does NITRC use a distributed version control system
:: Yes, GIT.  I have already done a little test project with mincmorph and it works well. GIT is not yet integrated into their source code viewer thing but it is planned. At least with GIT you can clone to multiple repositories.  (https://github.com/andrewjanke/mincmorph)
* does it allow a forum? a wiki?
:: Yes and Yes.  And the wiki on NITRC would be a very good place to host discussions like this -AJ Agreed - PB
* any licensing issues?
:: Not that I can see. In addition, there is no restriction on the license you use for your own package -AJ
* does it have a long future?
:: I have been recently involved in a conference call re the future of NITRC. They are definitely going to be around for the next couple of years. It seems that the NIH is not ready to support them fully in the long term, but they are actively working on an alternative economic model (maybe involving fees or ads) for the future. They are apparently very much commited to exist as a long-term resource. - PB
* any issues wrt NeuroDebian ( http://neuro.debian.net )
:: None, you will note a number of MINC packages in there already (N3, mni_autoreg, minc, classify?) I helped Michael with these many years ago and have always meant to get back to it in deference to my own packaging.  I see neurodebian as the way forward for minc packaging at least for debian/ubuntu. My plan was then to use alien to convert these to RPM's for the distro impaired. (CentOS, RedHat, Fedora) - AJ

== Basic strategy for MINC tools development ==

* development of code / potential need for coding guidelines
* documentation for code
* testing suite
* packaging
* MINC1 vs MINC2 support

== Multiplatform development ==

* Platforms to be supported
** Linux (ubuntu, debian, redhat?, what else?)
** MAC 
** Windows (see below, next item)
:: I dont think native windows packages are worth the pain they invoke. It's all fine to get the core packages working but we will suddenly find ourselves re-packing parts of CPAN for ActiveState Perl (Perl on windows) to make all the various perl scripts work. That and things like grid engine is just not possible. The only real alternative here is Cygwin, but the packaging system leaves things to be desired. For one there is no way to automate an install with a script, it HAS to be point and click in the first instance. You can then install apt-cyg manually and script the rest from there. The approach of other major packages has been to suggest that windows users use a virtual machine. Most CPU's are now plenty powerfull enough to do this and it will make things a LOT easier for us. We can also piggyback on the neurodebian efforts in this area. -AJ

* how to achieve multiplatform support
** CMAKE? Cpack?
:: MINC already supports CMAKE, I will admit its a bit of a pain to keep both CMakeLists.txt and Makefile.am/Configure.ac up to date in parallel but I have been doing it. -AJ
** what are the options?
:: None. automake/CMAKE is the choice.  I still prefer automake as it integrates with deb a whole lot better. -AJ
::: If you want to support Windows, to any extent, CMake is a much better choice, because you only need to maintain the one CMakeLists.txt file, and from that CMake can generate Visual Studio project files (and Xcode projects on Mac OS X). --anon

* resulting packages must be easy to install
* resulting packages must not conflict with existing software
:: On this note, there are other packages out there (I'm looking at you freesurfer) that install a whole minc &quot;distribution&quot; as part of their install and cause all sorts of grief for users as they often contain older versions of the MINC. We have no real way of controlling this. The only &quot;fix&quot; is to add /usr/local/bic/bin after freesurfers path.  Still perhaps if we make our own install a whole lot easier then freesurfer would just use our packages. -AJ

== Evaluate pertinence of a MINC Windows .dll ==

* basic MINC API should be supported on windows
* we probably don't have the resources to support windows
* Bert has already done this. See Makefile.msvc-win32 in MINC CVS. It still works with Visual Studio but with Bert now gone I dont see us having the local expertise. (Bert was an ex-windows programmer, we did what we could for him). Still I question the motive of getting the minc API working in Windows. The only use I can see is so that a windows viewer could load MINC files. -AJ
:: re use of minc in windows : if we want minc to be widely used as a file format, it should be easy to interact with on a variety of plateform. For Matlab, it's either I have access to mincheader, rawtominc and minctoraw, or I code something directly based on netcdf/hdf5, which raise some concerns about full compliance to the MINC API.

==Determine how CBRAIN fits in==
I can't speak for Alan, but I would rather say that MINC fits in Cbrain. Cbrain offers a distributed platform for neurimaging analysis. MINC-based pipelines should be available in there (CIVET already does, NIAK fmri pipelines soon will). But Cbrain is not limited to the MINC tools (SPM for example is already integrated to some extent, maybe PLS and NPAIRS too, I am not sure. There are some talks about FSL-based pipelines). I believe there may be ways in which the Cbrain infrastructure could contribute in the future to the development of MINC-related software. This will depend very much on the type of funding that will be found to continue supporting Cbrain, and this is not settled at this stage. - PB

==Evaluate level of NIFTI support within MINC API and MINC Tools==

We need to evaluate the pros and cons of supporting NIFTI files within the MINC environment

points:

* need to verify/test nii2mnc to make sure floats properly supported
* do we want to read NIFTI files with MINC{1,2} API
* conversion nii-&gt;mnc and mnc-&gt;nii is not a serious overhead; but still a pain for some click&amp;point users

pros:
* could give minc access to lots of users
* There is already a stub function in volume_io to do this.

cons:
* issues with file compatibility in intensity mapping
* issues with spatial coordinate mapping
* MAJOR issues with user understanding of how they can control L-R neuro/radio mapping in their files. I do not want MINC to enter or indeed even entertain the thought of entering this world of pain and gnashing of teeth. I already have users telling that they &quot;dont like MINC because the images display 'funny'&quot;. ie: in neuro orientation.. -AJ

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Closure vs. nested function definition ==

I thought a closure was a more specific term than a nested function, specifically meaning a nested function that inherits some lexical bindings from the enclosing scope. Is it accurate to say that they are one and the same thing? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:53, 23 February 2011 (UTC)

:I thought a closure was an inner function that is defined and returned by the outer function, but I'm still new to Python, so I may be wrong. But the definition given would include functions that use Yield to return the next iteration. I'm not sure those are considered closures. The example given is much more specific than the definition. We either need to refine the definition or come up with a more general example. --[[User:MiguelMunoz|MiguelMunoz]] ([[User talk:MiguelMunoz|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MiguelMunoz|contribs]]) 19:30, 27 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;life cycle&quot; of an '''mRNA''' in a eukaryotic cell. RNA is [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]; processed, it is transported to the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] by the [[ribosome]].  At the end of its life, the mRNA is degraded.]]
In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase.In simple word or formation of RNA from DNA is known as transcription. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43 combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

==Transcription==

Transcription can be explained easily in 4 or 5 simple steps, each moving like a wave along the DNA.

Unwinding of DNA /&quot;unzips&quot; as the Hydrogen Bonds Break.

The free nucleotides of the RNA, pair with complementary DNA bases.

RNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms. (Aided by RNA Polymerase.)

Hydrogen bonds of the untwisted RNA+DNA &quot;ladder&quot; break, freeing the new RNA.

If the cell has a nucleus, the RNA is further processed and then moves through the small nuclear pores to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics) Transcription (genetics)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majour steps of trascription process are:

# Formation of Pre-initiation complex
# Initiation of transcription
# Promoter clearance
# Elongation of RNA
# Termination

==Formation of Pre-initiation complex==

In eukaryotes, [[w:RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase]], and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core '''promoter'''  sequence in the DNA. Promoters are regions of DNA that promote transcription and, in eukaryotes, are found at -30, -75, and -90 base pairs upstream from the start site of transcription. Core promoters are sequences within the promoter that are essential for transcription initiation. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific [[w:transcription factor|transcription factors]].

The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a [[w:TATA box|TATA box]], found 25-30 base pairs upstream from the start site of transcription. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as [[w:TATA-binding protein|TATA-binding protein]] (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called [[w:Transcription Factor II D|Transcription Factor II D]] (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a [[w:preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]]. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has [[w:helicase|helicase]] activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as [[w:activator (genetics)|activators]] and [[w:repressor|repressors]], along with any associated [[w:coactivator|coactivators or corepressors]], are responsible for modulating transcription rate.

Thus, preinitiation complex contains:
*Core Promoter Sequence,
*Transcription Factors,
*DNA Helicase,
*RNA Polymerase,
*Activators and Repressors.

The transcription preinitiation in [[w:archaea|archaea]] is, in essence, homologous to that of eukaryotes, but is much less complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Littlefield, O., Korkhin, Y., and Sigler, P.B. |year=1999 |title=The structural basis for the oriented assembly of a TBP/TFB/promoter complex |journal=PNAS |volume=96 |pages=13668–13673 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.24.13668| pmid=10570130| issue=24| pmc=24122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeal preinitiation complex assembles at a TATA-box binding site; however, in archaea, this complex is composed of only RNA polymerase II, TBP, and TFB (the archaeal homologue of eukaryotic [[w:transcription factor II B|transcription factor II B]] (TFIIB)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Hausner, W., Michael Thomm, M. |year=2001 |title=Events during Initiation of Archaeal Transcription: Open Complex Formation and DNA-Protein Interactions |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |pages=3025–3031 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.10.3025-3031.2001| pmid=11325929| last1=Hausner| first1=W| last2=Thomm| first2=M| issue=10| pmc=95201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Qureshi S.A., Bell S.D., Jackson S.P. |year=1997 |title=Factor requirements for transcription in the archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae |journal=EMBO Journal |volume=16 |pages=2927–2936 |doi=10.1093/emboj/16.10.2927| pmid=9184236| last1=Qureshi| first1=SA| last2=Bell| first2=SD| last3=Jackson| first3=SP| issue=10| pmc=1169900}}&lt;/ref&gt;Typically the PIC is made up of six general transcription factors: TFIIA (GTF2A1, GTF2A2), TFIIB (GTF2B), B-TFIID (BTAF1, TBP), TFIID (BTAF1, BTF3, BTF3L4, EDF1, TAF1-15, 16 total), TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Also, at some point during its assembly it is joined with RNA polymerase II and the remaining components of the holoenzyme.

#The TATA binding protein (TBP, a subunit of TFIID), TBPL1, or TBPL2 can bind the promoter or TATA box. Most genes lack a TATA box and use an initiator element (INR) or downstream core promoter instead. Nevertheless, TBP is always involved and is forced to bind without sequence specificity. TAFs from TFIID can also be involved when the TATA box is absent. A TFIID TAF will bind sequence specifically, and force the TBP to bind non-sequence specifically, bringing the remaining portions of TFIID to the promoter.
#TFIIA interacts with the TBP subunit of TFIID and aids in the binding of TBP to TATA-box containing promoter DNA. Although TFIIA does not recognize DNA itself, its interactions with TBP allow it to stabilize and facilitate formation of the PIC.
#The N-terminal domain of TFIIB brings the DNA into proper position for entry into the active site of RNA polymerase II. TFIIB binds partially sequence specifically, with some preference for BRE. The TFIID-TFIIA-TFIIB (DAB)-promoter complex subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II and TFIIF.
#TFIIF (two subunits, RAP30 and RAP74, showing some similarity to bacterial sigma factors) and Pol II enter the complex together. TFIIF helps to speed up the polymerization process.
#TFIIE joins the growing complex and recruits TFIIH. TFIIE may be involved in DNA melting at the promoter: it contains a zinc ribbon motif that can bind single stranded DNA. TFIIE helps to open and close the Pol II’s ‘Jaw’ like structure, which enables movement down the DNA strand.
#DNA may be wrapped one complete turn around the preinitiation complex and it is TFIIF that helps keep this tight wrapping. In the process, the torsional strain on the DNA may aid in DNA melting at the promoter, forming the transcription bubble.
#TFIIH and TFIIJ enter the complex together. TFIIH is a large protein complex that contains among others the CDK7/cyclin H kinase complex and a DNA helicase. TFIIH has three functions: it binds specifically to the template strand to ensure that the correct strand of DNA is transcribed and melts or unwinds the DNA (ATP dependently) to separate the two strands using its helicase activity. It has a kinase activity that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at the amino acid serine. This switches the RNA polymerase to start producing RNA. Finally it is essential for Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) of damaged DNA. TFIIH and TFIIE strongly interact with one another. TFIIE affects TFIIH’s catalytic activity. Without TFIIE, TFIIH will not unwind the promoter.
#TFIIH helps create the transcription bubble and may be required for transcription if the DNA template is not already denatured or if it is supercoiled.
#Mediator then encases all the transcription factors and Pol II. It interacts with enhancers, areas very far away (upstream or downstream) that help regulate transcription.
The formation of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) is analogous to the mechanism seen in bacterial initiation. In bacteria, the sigma factor recognizes and binds to the promoter sequence. In eukaryotes, the transcription factors perform this role.
===TATA-binding protein and Transcription factor II D===


TBP is a subunit of the eukaryotic transcription factor '''TFIID'''. TFIID is the first protein to bind to DNA during the formation of the pre-initiation transcription complex of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Binding of TFIID to the TATA box in the promoter region of the gene initiates the recruitment of other factors required for RNA Pol II to begin transcription. Some of the other recruited transcription factors include TFIIA, TFIIB, and TFIIF. Each of these transcription factors is formed from the interaction of many protein subunits, indicating that transcription is a heavily regulated process.TBP is also a necessary component of RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III, and is, it is thought, the only common subunit required by all three of the RNA polymerases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TATA-binding_protein TATA-binding protein]&lt;/ref&gt;

The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a transcription factor that binds specifically to a DNA sequence called the TATA box. This DNA sequence is found about 35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in some eukaryotic gene promoters. TBP, along with a variety of TBP-associated factors, make up the TFIID, a general transcription factor that in turn makes up part of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. As one of the few proteins in the preinitiation complex that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, it helps position RNA polymerase II over the transcription start site of the gene. However, it is estimated that only 10-20% of human promoters have TATA boxes. Therefore, TBP is probably not the only protein involved in positioning RNA polymerase II.

Transcription factor II D (TFIID) is one of several general transcription factors that make up the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. Before the start of transcription, the transcription Factor II D (TFIID) complex, consisting of TFIID, TBP, and at least nine other polypeptides, binds to the TATA box in the core promoter of the gene.
TFIID is itself composed of several subunits called TBP-associated factors (TAFs, of which there are 16) and the TATA Binding Protein (TBP). In a test tube, only TBP is necessary for transcription at promoters that contain a TATA box. TAFs, however, add promoter selectivity, especially if there is no TATA box sequence for TBP to bind to. TAFs are included in two distinct complexes, TFIID and B-TFIID. The TFIID complex is composed of TBP and more than eight TAFs. But, the majority of TBP is present in the B-TFIID complex, which is composed of TBP and TAFII170 (BTAF1) in a 1:1 ratio.

==RNA polymerase==
RNAP was discovered independently by Sam Weiss, Audrey Stevens, and Jerard Hurwitz in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jerard Hurwitz|year=2005|month=December|title=The Discovery of RNA Polymerase|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=280|issue=52|pages=42477–85|pmid=16230341|doi=10.1074/jbc.X500006200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

RNA polymerase (RNAP)  is an enzyme that produces RNA. In cells, RNAP is needed for constructing RNA chains from DNA genes as templates, a process called transcription. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential to life and are found in all organisms and many viruses. In chemical terms, RNAP is a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript.

==RNA polymerase in eukaryotes==
[[Image:Alpha-Amanitin–RNA polymerase II complex 1K83.png|thumb|Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (light blue) in complex with α-amanitin (red), a strong poison found in death cap mushrooms that targets this vital enzyme]]
Eukaryotes have several types of RNAP, characterized by the type of RNA they synthesize: The following RNA polymerases are very common in eukaryotic cells.

1 RNA polymerase I

2 RNA polymerase II

3 RNA polymerase III

4 RNA polymerase IV

5 RNA polymerase V

===RNA polymerase I===
[[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45S, which matures into 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs which will form the major RNA sections of the [[ribosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grummt I.|title=Regulation of mammalian ribosomal gene transcription by RNA polymerase I.|journal=Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol.|year=1999|volume=62|pages=109–54|pmid=9932453|doi=10.1016/S0079-6603(08)60506-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;Pol I consists of 8-14 protein subunits (polypeptides). All 12 subunits have identical or related counterparts in PolII and Pol III. rDNA transcription is confined to the nucleolus where several hundreds of copies of rRNA genes are present, arranged as tandem head-to-tail repeats. 

Pol I transcribes one large transcript, encoding an rDNA gene over and over again. This gene encodes the 18S, the 5.8S, and the 28S RNA molecules of the ribosome in eukaryotes. The transcripts are cleaved by snoRNA. The 5S ribosomal RNA is transcribed by Pol III. Because of the simplicity of Pol I transcription, it is the fastest-acting polymerase.
When rRNA synthesis is stimulated, SL1 (selectivity factor 1) will bind to the promoters of rDNA genes that were previously silent, and recruit a pre-initiation complex to which Pol I will bind and start transcription of rRNA.
Changes in rRNA transcription can also occur via changes in the rate of transcription. While the exact mechanism through which Pol I increases its rate of transcription is yet unknown, evidence has shown that rRNA synthesis can increase or decrease without changes in the number of actively transcribed rDNA.

====C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II====
[[Image: ARN pol II en accion.jpg| thumb|200px|left|RNA Pol II in action, showing the CTD extension to the C-terminal of [[POLR2A]].]]
RNAPII can exist in two forms: RNAPII0, with a highly phosphorylated CTD, and RNAPIIA, with a nonphosphorylated CTD.The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II is that portion of the polymerase that is involved in the initiation of transcription, the [[5' cap|cap]]ping of the [[Messenger RNA|RNA transcript]], and attachment to the [[spliceosome]] for [[RNA splicing]].&lt;ref name=Brickley&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brickey WJ, Greenleaf AL |title=Functional studies of the carboxy-terminal repeat domain of Drosophila RNA polymerase II in vivo |journal=Genetics. |volume=140 |issue=2 |pages=599–613 |year=1995 |month=June |pmid=7498740 |pmc=1206638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTD typically consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser.&lt;ref name=Meinhart&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature. |issue=6996 |volume=430 |pages=223–6 |month=Jul |year=2004 |title=Recognition of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain by 3'-RNA-processing factors |pmid=15241417 |author=Meinhart A, Cramer P |format=abstract |doi=10.1038/nature02679

The CTD is an extension appended to the C terminus of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. It serves as a flexible binding [[Scaffold protein|scaffold]] for numerous nuclear factors, determined by the [[phosphorylation]] patterns on the CTD repeats. Each repeat contains an evolutionary conserved and repeated heptapeptide, Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7, which is subjected to reversible phosphorylations during each transcription cycle.&lt;ref name=Phatnani&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Phatnani HP, Greenleaf AL |title=Phosphorylation and functions of the RNA polymerase II CTD |journal=Genes Dev. |month=Nov |year=2006 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=2922–36 |pmid= 17079683 |url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/20/21/2922.long |doi=10.1101/gad.1477006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This domain is inherently unstructured yet evolutionarily conserved, and in [[eukaryote]]s it comprises from 25 to 52 tandem copies of the consensus repeat heptad.&lt;ref name=Corden&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Corden JL |title=Tails of RNA polymerase II |journal=Trends Biol Sci. |month= |year=1990 |volume=15 |issue= |pages=383–7 |url= |pmid= |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(90)90236-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the CTD is frequently not required for [[general transcription factor]] (GTF)-mediated initiation and RNA synthesis, it does not form a part of the catalytic essence of RNAPII, but performs other functions.&lt;ref name=Phatnani/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase_II_holoenzyme&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorylation occurs principally on Ser2 and Ser5 of the repeats of CTD, although these positions are not equivalent. The phosphorylation state changes as RNAPII progresses through the transcription cycle: The initiating RNAPII is form IIA, and the elongating enzyme is form II0. While RNAPII0 does consist of RNAPs with hyperphosphorylated CTDs, the pattern of phosphorylation on individual CTDs can vary due to differential phosphorylation of Ser2 versus Ser5 residues and/or to differential phosphorylation of repeats along the length of the CTD. The PCTD (phosphoCTD of an RNAPII0) physically links pre-mRNA processing to transcription by tethering processing factors to elongating RNAPII, e.g., 5′-end capping, 3′-end cleavage, and polyadenylation.
Ser5 phosphorylation (Ser5PO4) near the 5′ ends of genes depends principally on the kinase activity of TFIIH (Kin28 in yeast; CDK7 in metazoans). The transcription factor TFIIH is a kinase and will hyperphosphorylate the CTD of RNAP, and in doing so, causes the RNAP complex to move away from the initiation site. Subsequent to the action of TFIIH kinase, Ser2 residues are phosphorylated by CTDK-I in yeast (CDK9 kinase in metazoans). Ctk1 (CDK9) acts in compliment to phosphorylation of serine 5 and is, thus, seen in middle to late elongation.
CDK8 and cyclin C (CCNC) are components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme that phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). CDK8 regulates transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of the general transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH), thereby providing a link between the mediator and the basal transcription machinery.
The gene CTDP1 encodes a phosphatase that interacts with the carboxy-terminus of transcription initiation factor TFIIF, a transcription factor that regulates elongation as well as initiation by RNA polymerase II&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase_II_holoenzyme&lt;/ref&gt;.

Therefore the regulation of Pol III transcription is primarily tied to the regulation of cell growth and the cell cycle, thus requiring fewer regulatory proteins than RNA polymerase II.
In the process of transcription (by any polymerase) there are three main stages:Initiation; requiring construction of the RNA polymerase complex on the gene's promoter.
Elongation; the writing of the RNA transcript.Termination; the finishing of RNA writing and disassembly of the RNA polymerase complex.

==Initiation of transcription==
[[File:simple transcription initiation1.svg|thumb|left|500px|Simple diagram of transcription initiation. RNA polymerase (RNAP)]]
  
Transcription initiation is more complex in eukaryotes.  Eukaryotic RNA polymerase does not directly recognize the core promoter sequences.  Instead, a collection of proteins called transcription factors mediate the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription. Only after certain transcription factors are attached to the promoter does the RNA polymerase bind to it. The completed assembly of transcription factors and RNA polymerase bind to the promoter, forming a transcription initiation complex. Transcription in the archaea domain is similar to transcription in eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mohamed Ouhammouch, Robert E. Dewhurst, Winfried Hausner, Michael Thomm, and E. Peter Geiduschek | title=Activation of archaeal transcription by recruitment of the TATA-binding protein| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | year=2003| volume=100| issue=9| pages=5097–5102 | pmc=154304 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0837150100 | pmid=12692306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bacteria, transcription begins with the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter in DNA. RNA polymerase is a core enzyme consisting of five subunits: 2 α subunits, 1 β subunit, 1 β' subunit, and 1 ω subunit. At the start of initiation, the core enzyme is associated with a sigma factor that aids in finding the appropriate -35 and -10 base pairs downstream of promoter sequences.

'''What is sigma factor?'''

A sigma factor (σ factor) is a prokaryotic transcription initiation factor that enables specific binding of RNA polymerase to gene promoters. Different sigma factors are activated in response to different environmental conditions. Every molecule of RNA polymerase contains exactly one sigma factor subunit, which in the model bacterium Escherichia coli is one of those listed below. E. coli has seven sigma factors; the number of sigma factors varies between bacterial species. Sigma factors are distinguished by their characteristic molecular weights. For example, σ70 refers to the sigma factor with a molecular weight of 70 kDa.

===Transcription Factors===
Transcription factors are essential for the regulation of gene expression and are, as a consequence, found in all living organisms. The number of transcription factors found within an organism increases with genome size, and larger genomes tend to have more transcription factors per gene.
There are approximately 2600 proteins in the human genome that contain DNA-binding domains, and most of these are presumed to function as transcription factors. Therefore, approximately 10% of genes in the genome code for transcription factors, which makes this family the single largest family of human proteins. Furthermore, genes are often flanked by several binding sites for distinct transcription factors, and efficient expression of each of these genes requires the cooperative action of several different transcription factors (see, for example, hepatocyte nuclear factors). Hence, the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately 2000 human transcription factors easily accounts for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development.

In molecular biology, a transcription factor (sometimes called a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the movement (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. Transcription factors perform this function alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA) to specific genes.

General transcription factors  or GTFs are intimately involved in the process of gene regulation, and most are required for life. TATA binding protein, (TBP) is a GTF that binds to the TATAA box (T=Thymine, A=Adenine) the motif of nucleic acids that is directly upstream from the coding region in all genes. TBP is responsible for the recruitment of the RNA Pol II holoenzyme, the final event in transcription initiation. These proteins are ubiquitous and interact with the core promoter region of DNA, which contains the transcription start site(s) of all class II genes.
Not all GTFs play a role in transcriptional initiation; some are required for the second general step in transcription, elongation. For example, members of the FACT complex (Spt16/Pob3 in S. cerevisiae, SUPT16H/SSRP1 in humans) facilitate the rapid movement of RNA Pol II over the encoding region of genes. This is accomplished by moving the histone octamer out of the way of an active polymerase and thereby decondensing the chromatin.

Transcription factors are modular in  structure and contain the following [[protein domains|domains]]:

'''[[DNA-binding domain]]''' ('''DBD'''), which attach to specific sequences of DNA enhancer  or Promoter: Necessary component for all vectors: used to drive transcription of the vector's transgene [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences) adjacent to regulated genes.  DNA sequences that bind transcription factors are often referred to as [[hormone response element|'''response elements''']].

'''Trans-activating domain''' ('''TAD'''), which contain binding sites for other proteins such as [transcription coregulators.  These binding sites are frequently referred to as '''activation functions''' ('''AFs''').&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12893880&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wärnmark A, Treuter E, Wright AP, Gustafsson J-Å | title = Activation functions 1 and 2 of nuclear receptors: molecular strategies for transcriptional activation | journal = Mol. Endocrinol. | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1901–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12893880 | doi = 10.1210/me.2002-0384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An optional '''signal sensing domain''' ('''SSD''') (''e.g.'', a ligand binding domain), which senses external signals and, in response, transmit these signals to the rest of the transcription complex, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression.  Also, the DBD and signal-sensing domains may reside on separate proteins that associate within the transcription complex to regulate gene expression.

== Elongation of RNA==

[[File:simple transcription elongation1.svg|left|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription elongation (RNA in blue color)]]

After the first bond is synthesized, the RNA polymerase must clear the promoter. During this time there is a tendency to release the RNA transcript and produce truncated transcripts. This is called abortive initiation and is common for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Abortive initiation continues to occur until the σ factor rearranges, resulting in the transcription elongation complex (which gives a 35 bp moving footprint). The σ factor is released before 80 nucleotides of mRNA are synthesized.Once the transcript reaches approximately 23 nucleotides, it no longer slips and elongation can occur. This, like most of the remainder of transcription, is an energy-dependent process, consuming adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
One strand of the DNA, the template strand (or noncoding strand), is used as a template for RNA synthesis. As transcription proceeds, RNA polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the DNA template to create an RNA copy. Although RNA polymerase traverses the template strand from 3' → 5', the coding (non-template) strand and newly-formed RNA can also be used as reference points, so transcription can be described as occurring 5' → 3'. This produces an RNA molecule from 5' → 3', an exact copy of the coding strand (except that thymines are replaced with uracils, and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose (5-carbon) sugar where DNA has deoxyribose (one less oxygen atom) in its sugar-phosphate backbone).
Unlike DNA replication, mRNA transcription can involve multiple RNA polymerases on a single DNA template and multiple rounds of transcription (amplification of particular mRNA), so many mRNA molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene.
Elongation also involves a proofreading mechanism that can replace incorrectly incorporated bases. In eukaryotes, this may correspond with short pauses during transcription that allow appropriate RNA editing factors to bind. These pauses may be intrinsic to the RNA polymerase or due to chromatin structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics) Transcription (genetics)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription termination==
[[File:simple transcription termination1.svg|left|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription termination. RNA is shown in blue color.]]

Bacteria use two different strategies for transcription termination. In Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C-rich hairpin loop followed by a run of Us. When the hairpin forms, the mechanical stress breaks the weak rU-dA bonds, now filling the DNA-RNA hybrid. This pulls the poly-U transcript out of the active site of the RNA polymerase, in effect, terminating transcription. In the &quot;Rho-dependent&quot; type of termination, a protein factor called &quot;Rho&quot; destabilizes the interaction between the template and the mRNA, thus releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.
Transcription termination in eukaryotes is less understood but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of As at its new 3' end, in a process called polyadenylation.

===Rho-dependent termination===

A Rho factor acts on an RNA substrate. Rho's key function is its helicase activity, for which energy is provided by an RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. The initial binding site for Rho is an extended (~70 nucleotides, sometimes 80-100 nucleotides) single-stranded region, rich in cytosine and poor in guanine, called the rho utilization site or rut, in the RNA being synthesised, upstream of the actual terminator sequence. Several rho binding sequences have been discovered. No consensus is found among these, but the different sequences each seem specific, as small mutations in the sequence disrupts its function. Rho binds to RNA and then uses its ATPase activity to provide the energy to translocate along the RNA until it reaches the RNA-DNA helical region, where it unwinds the hybrid duplex structure. RNA polymerase pauses at the termination sequence, which is due to the fact that there is a specific site around 100nt away from the Rho binding site called the Rho-sensitive pause site. So, even though the RNA polymerase is about 40nt per second faster than Rho, it does not pose a problem for the Rho termination mechanism as the RNA polymerase allows Rho factor to catch up.




===Rho-independent termination===

Rho-independent termination  (also known as Intrinsic termination) is a mechanism in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes that causes mRNA transcription to be stopped. In this mechanism, the mRNA contains a sequence that can base pair with itself to form a stem-loop structure 7-20 base pairs in length that is also rich in cytosine-guanine base pairs. These bases form three hydrogen bonds between each other and are therefore particularly strong. Following the stem-loop structure is a chain of uracil residues. The bonds between uracil and adenine are very weak. A protein bound to RNA polymerase (nusA) binds to the stem-loop structure tightly enough to cause the polymerase to temporarily stall. This pausing of the polymerase coincides with transcription of the poly-uracil sequence. The weak Adenine-Uracil bonds destabilize the RNA-DNA duplex, causing it to unwind and dissociate from the RNA polymerase.
Stem-loop structures that are not followed by a poly-Uracil sequence cause the RNA polymerase to pause, but it will typically continue transcription after a brief time because the duplex is too stable to unwind far enough to cause termination.
Rho-independent transcription termination is a frequent mechanism underlying the activity of cis-acting RNA regulatory elements, such as riboswitches&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_termination&amp;oldid=428278551&lt;/ref&gt;.

==mRNA and its modification==
The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.
===Capping of mRNA===

[[Image:5'_cap_structure.png|400px|thumb|5' cap structure]]
The 5' cap looks like the 3' end of an RNA molecule (the 5' carbon of the cap ribose is bonded, and the 3' unbonded). This provides significant resistance to 5' exonucleases.
Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. To achieve this, the terminal 5' phosphate requires removal, which is done with the aid of a phosphatase enzyme. The enzyme guanosyl transferase then catalyses the reaction, which produces the diphosphate 5' end. The diphosphate 5' prime end then attacks the α phosphorus atom of a GTP molecule in order to add the guanine residue in a 5'5' triphosphate link. The enzyme (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase (&quot;cap MTase&quot;) transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to the guanine ring.This type of cap, with just the (m7G) in position is called a cap 0 structure. The ribose of the adjacent nucleotide may also be methylated to give a cap 1. Methylation of nucleotides downstream of the RNA molecule produce cap 2, cap 3 structures and so on. In these cases the methyl groups are added to the 2' OH groups of the ribose sugar. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5'_cap 5'cap]&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point is the unaltered 5' end of an RNA molecule. This features a final nucleotide followed by three phosphate groups attached to the 5' carbon.

One of the terminal phosphate groups is removed (by RNA terminal phosphatase), leaving two terminal phosphates.

GTP is added to the terminal phosphates (by a guanylyl transferase), losing two phosphate groups (from the GTP) in the process. This results in the 5' to 5' triphosphate linkage.

The 7-nitrogen of guanine is methylated (by a methyl transferase).

Other methyltransferases are optionally used to carry out methylation of 5' proximal nucleotides.

The 5' cap has 4 main functions:

Regulation of nuclear export.

Prevention of degradation by exonucleases.

Promotion of translation (see ribosome and translation).

Promotion of 5' proximal intron excision.

Nuclear export of RNA is regulated by the Cap binding complex (CBC), which binds exclusively to capped RNA. The CBC is then recognized by the nuclear pore complex and exported. Once in the cytoplasm after the pioneer round of translation, the CBC is replaced by the translation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G. This complex is then recognized by other translation initiation machinery including the ribosome.
Cap prevents 5' degradation in two ways. First, degradation of the mRNA by 5' exonucleases is prevented (as mentioned above) by functionally looking like a 3' end. Second, the CBC complex and the eIF-4E/eIF-4G block the access of decapping enzymes to the cap. This increases the half-life of the mRNA, essential in eukaryotes as the export process takes significant time.
Decapping of an mRNA is catalyzed by the decapping complex made up of at least Dcp1 and Dcp2, which must compete with eIF-4E to bind the cap. Thus the 5' cap is a marker of an actively translating mRNA and is used by cells to regulate mRNA half-lives in response to new stimuli. Undesirable mRNAs are sent to P-bodies for temporary storage or decapping, the details of which are still being resolved. The mechanism of 5' proximal intron excision promotion is not well understood, but the 5' cap appears to loop around and interact with the spliceosome in the splicing process, promoting intron excision.
===Polyadenylation of mRNA===
[[Image:Alternative polyadenylation.svg|thumb|350px|Results of using different polyadenylation sites on the same gene]]
The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a [[poly(A) tail]]. The cleavage and adenylation reactions occur if a [[polyadenylation|polyadenylation signal sequence]] (5'- AAUAAA-3') is located near the 3' end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which is followed by another sequence, which is usually '''(5'-CA-3')'''. The second signal is the site of cleavage. A '''GU-rich sequence''' is also usually present further downstream on the pre-mRNA molecule. After the synthesis of the sequence elements, two multisubunit [[protein]]s called [[cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor]] (CPSF) and [[cleavage stimulation factor]] (CStF) are transferred from [[RNA Polymerase II]] to the RNA molecule. The two factors bind to the sequence elements. A protein complex forms that contains additional cleavage factors and the enzyme [[Polyadenylate Polymerase]] (PAP). This complex cleaves the RNA between the polyadenylation sequence and the GU-rich sequence at the cleavage site marked by the (5'-CA-3') sequences. Poly(A) polymerase then adds about 200 adenine units to the new 3' end of the RNA molecule using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as a precursor. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFBiochemistry1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hames|Hooper|2006|Ref=CITEREFHamesHopper2008|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poly(A)-binding protein or &quot;PABP&quot;'''

Poly(A)-binding protein (or &quot;PABP&quot;) is a RNA-binding protein which binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNA. The poly(A) tail is located on the 3' end of mRNA. The nuclear isoforms selectively binds to around 50 nucleotides and stimulates the activity of Polyadenylate polymerase.The expression of mammalian Poly(A)-binding protein is regulated at the translational level by a feed-back mechanism: the mRNA encoding PABP contains in its 5' UTR an A-rich sequence which binds Poly(A)-binding protein. This leads to repression of translation
The cytosolic isoform of eukaryotes Poly(A) binding protein binds to the initiation factor eIF-4G via its C-terminal domain. EIF-4G is bound to eIF-4E, another initiation factor bound to the 5' cap on the 5' end of mRNA. This binding forms the characteristic loop structure of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Poly(A)-binding protein interacting proteins in the cytosol compete for the eIF-4G binding sites. Poly(A)-binding protein has also been shown to interact with a termination factor (eRF3)

'''Alternative polyadenylation'''

Many protein-coding genes have more than one polyadenylation site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.
The choice of poly(A) site depends on the expression of the proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins.RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polyadenylation&amp;oldid=422375377&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Splicing of RNA==
[[Image:Pre-mRNA to mRNA.svg|right|thumbnail|420px|Simple illustration of a pre-mRNA, with introns (top). After the introns have been removed via splicing, the mature mRNA sequence is ready for translation (bottom).]]



Splicing is the process by which pre-mRNA is modified to remove certain stretches of non-coding sequences called introns; the stretches that remain include protein-coding sequences and are called exons. Sometimes pre-mRNA messages may be spliced in several different ways, allowing a single gene to encode multiple proteins. This process is called alternative splicing. Splicing is usually performed by an RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome, but some RNA molecules are also capable of catalyzing their own splicing&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA Messenger_RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A complex.jpg|thumb|Spliceosome A complex defines the 5' and 3' ends of the intron before removal]]
'''Introns'''
One plausible hypothesis for the observed distribution of introns is that ancient predecessors of modern-day eukaryotes contained large numbers of introns, and that selective pressure to control genome size in fast-growing species may have led to the elimination of many ancient introns. Complicating this issue is that finding that many introns are themselves mobile genetic elements, and can be inserted into and deleted from genes.
Shortly after the discovery of introns, investigators offered competing theories that offer alternative scenarios for the origin and early evolution of spliceosomal introns. Other classes of introns such as self-splicing and tRNA introns are not subject to much debate, but see for the former. These are popularly referred to as the Introns-Early (IE) and the Introns-Late (IL) views.
The IE model, championed by Walter Gilbert, proposes that introns are extremely old and numerously present in the earliest theoretical ancestors of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the progenotes. In this model, introns were subsequently lost from prokaryotic organisms, allowing them to attain growth efficiency. A central prediction of this theory is that the early introns were mediators that facilitated the recombination of exons that represented the protein domains. This model cannot account for some observed positional variation of introns shared among related genes.

The IL model proposes that introns were recently inserted into originally intron-less contiguous genes after the divergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In this model, introns probably originated from transposable elements. This model is based on the observation that the spliceosomal introns are restricted to eukaryotes alone. However, there is considerable debate over the presence of introns in the early prokaryote-eukaryote ancestors and the subsequent intron loss-gain during eukaryotic evolution. The evolution of introns and of the intron-exon structure may be largely independent of the evolution of coding-sequences.

Introns were first discovered in protein-coding genes of adenovirus , but are now known to occur within a wide variety of genes throughout all of the biological kingdoms.
The frequency of introns within different genomes can vary widely across the spectrum of biological organisms. For example, introns are extremely common within the nuclear genome of higher vertebrates (e.g. humans and mice), where protein-coding genes almost always contain multiple introns, while introns are rare within the nuclear genes of some eukaryotic microorganisms, for example baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In contrast, the mitochondrial genomes of vertebrates are entirely devoid of introns, while those of eukaryotic microorganisms may contain many introns.
===Spliceosome and its assembly===

[[Image:Minor spliceosome.jpg||thumb|280px|right|A comparison between major and minor splicing mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_spliceosome Minor spliceosome]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each spliceosome is composed of five small nuclear RNA proteins, called snRNPs, (pronounced &quot;snurps&quot;) and a range of non-snRNP associated protein factors.
The snRNPs that make up the nuclear spliceosome are named U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and participate in several RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. The RNA component of the snRNP is rich in uridine (the nucleoside analog of the uracil nucleotide).
The canonical assembly of the spliceosome occurs anew on each hnRNA. The hnRNA contains specific sequence elements that are recognized and utilized during spliceosome assembly. These include the 5' end splice, the branch point sequence, the polypyrimidine tract, and the 3' end splice site. The spliceosome catalyzes the removal of introns, and the ligation of the flanking exons.
Introns typically have a GU nucleotide sequence at the 5' end splice site, and an AG at the 3' end splice site. The 3' splice site can be further defined by a variable length of polypyrimidines, called the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), which serves the dual function of recruiting factors to the 3' splice site and possibly recruiting factors to the branch point sequence (BPS). The BPS contains the conserved Adenosine required for the first step of splicing.
A group of less abundant snRNPs, U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac, together with U5, are subunits of the so-called minor spliceosome that splices a rare class of pre-mRNA introns, denoted U12-type. These snRNPs form the U12 spliceosome are located in the cytosol.
New evidence derived from the first crystal structure of a group II intron suggests that the spliceosome is actually a ribozyme, and that it uses a two–metal ion mechanism for catalysis.

The model for formation of the spliceosome active site involves an ordered, stepwise assembly of discrete snRNP particles on the hnRNA substrate.  The first recognition of hnRNAs involves U1 snRNP binding to the 5' end splice site of the hnRNA and other non-snRNP associated factors to form the commitment complex, or early (E) complex in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Molecular and Cell Biology | volume=12 | author = Jamison SF, Crow A, and Garcia-Blanco MA | date= October 1, 1992 | title=The Spliceosome Assembly Pathway in Mammilian Extracts | pages=4279–87 | pmid=1383687 |pmc=360351 | issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Cell | volume=59 | pages=349–58 | title=Identification of functional U1 snRNA pre-messenger RNA complexes committed to spliceosome assembly and splicing| author=Seraphin B. and Rosbash M. | year=1989 | pmid=2529976 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(89)90296-1| issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commitment complex is an ATP-independent complex that commits the hnRNA to the splicing pathway.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3065622&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Legrain P, Seraphin B, Rosbash M |title=Early commitment of yeast pre-mRNA to the spliceosome pathway |journal=Mol.

The presence of a pseudouridine residue in U2 snRNA, nearly opposite of the branch site, results in an altered conformation of the RNA-RNA duplex upon the U2 snRNP binding.

Upon recruitment of the triple snRNP, several RNA-RNA rearrangements precede the first catalytic step and further rearrangements occur in the catalytically active spliceosome.

Upon recruitment of U2 snRNP, the branch binding protein SF1 in the commitment complex is displaced since the binding site of U2 snRNA and SF1 are mutually exclusive events.

Within the U2 snRNA, there are other mutually exclusive rearrangements that occur between competing conformations.  For example, in the active form, stem loop IIa is favored; in the inactive form a mutually exclusive interaction between the loop and a downstream sequence predominates.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9476892&quot; /&gt; It is unclear how U4 is displaced from U6 snRNAm, although RNA has been implicated in spliceosome assembly, and may function to unwind U4/U6 and promote the formation of a U2/U6 snRNA interaction.  The interactions of U4/U6 stem loops I and II dissociate and the freed stem loop II region of U6 folds on itself to form an intramolecular stem loop and U4 is no longer required in further spliceosome assembly.  The freed stem loop I region of U6 base pairs with U2 snRNA forming the U2/U6 helix I.  However, the helix I structure is mutually exclusive with the 3' half of an internal 5' stem loop region of U2 snRNA.

The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and may be involved in catalysis. Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (the major and minor) which contain different snRNPs.
Major
The major spliceosome splices introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site. It is composed of the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs and is active in the nucleus. In addition, a number of proteins including U2AF and SF1 are required for the assembly of the spliceosome.

E Complex-U1 binds to the GU sequence at the 5' splice site, along with accessory proteins/enzymes ASF/SF2, U2AF (binds at the Py-AG site), SF1/BBP (BBP=Branch Binding Protein);

A Complex-U2 binds to the branch site and ATP is hydrolyzed;

B1 Complex-U5/U4/U6 trimer binds, and the U5 binds exons at the 5' site, with U6 binding to U2;

B2 Complex-U1 is released, U5 shifts from exon to intron and the U6 binds at the 5' splice site;

C1 Complex-U4 is released, U6/U2 catalyzes transesterification, that make 5'end of introns ligate to the A on intron and from a lariat ,U5 binds exon at 3' splice site, and the 5' site is cleaved, resulting in the formation of the lariat;

C2 Complex-U2/U5/U6 remain bound to the lariat, and the 3' site is cleaved and exons are ligated using ATP hydrolysis. The spliced RNA is released and the lariat debranches.


This type of splicing is termed canonical splicing or termed the lariat pathway, which accounts for more than 99% of splicing. By contrast, when the intronic flanking sequences do not follow the GU-AG rule, noncanonical splicing is said to occur (see &quot;minor spliceosome&quot; below).
'''Minor spliceosome'''

The minor spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyses the removal (splicing) of an atypical class of spliceosomal introns (U12-type) from eukaryotic messenger RNAs in plant, insects, vertebrates and some fungi (Rhizopus oryzae). This process is called noncanonical splicing, as opposed to U2-dependent canonical splicing. U12-type introns represent less than 1% of all introns in human cells. However they are found in genes performing essential cellular functions.
The minor spliceosome is very similar to the major spliceosome, however it splices out rare introns with different splice site sequences. While the minor and major spliceosomes contain the same U5 snRNP, the minor spliceosome has different, but functionally analogous snRNPs for U1, U2, U4, and U6, which are respectively called U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac. Like the major spliceosome, it is only found in the nucleus&lt;ref&gt;Will CL, Lührmann R (August 2005). &quot;Splicing of a rare class of introns by the U12-dependent spliceosome&quot;. Biol. Chem. 386 (8): 713–24&lt;/ref&gt;.
Trans-splicing
Trans-splicing is a form of splicing that joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript

==Self splicing==



Self splicing occurs for rare introns that form a ribozyme, performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone. There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, Group I, Group II and Group III. Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein. This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome. Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an RNA world present before protein. 
Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.
3'OH of the 5'exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.
The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the lariat
The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site thereby joining the exons together.

'''Group I'''
Group I introns are distributed in bacteria, lower eukaryotes and higher plants. However, their occurrence in bacteria seems to be more sporadic than in lower eukaryotes, and they have become prevalent in higher plants. The genes that group I introns interrupt differ significantly: They interrupt rRNA, mRNA and tRNA genes in bacterial genomes, as well as in mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of lower eukaryotes, but only invade rRNA genes in the nuclear genome of lower eukaryotes. In higher plants, these introns seem to be restricted to a few tRNA and mRNA genes of the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Both intron-early and intron-late theories have found evidences in explaining the origin of group I introns. Some group I introns encode homing endonuclease (HEG), which catalyzes intron mobility. It is proposed that HEGs move the intron from one location to another, from one organism to another and thus account for the wide spreading of the selfish group I introns. No biological role has been identified for group I introns thus far except for splicing of themselves from the precursor to prevent the death of the host that they live by. A small number of group I introns are also found to encode a class of proteins called maturases that facilitate the intron splicing.

Splicing of group I introns is processed by two sequential ester-transfer reactions. The exogenous guanosine or guanosine nucleotide (exoG) first docks onto the active G-binding site located in P7, and its 3'-OH is aligned to attack the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site located in P1, resulting in a free 3'-OH group at the upstream exon and the exoG being attached to the 5' end of the intron. Then the terminal G (omega G) of the intron swaps the exoG and occupies the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer reaction, the 3'-OH group of the upstream exon in P1 is aligned to attacks the 3' splice site in P10, leading to the ligation of the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and free of the catalytic intron.
Two-metal-ion mechanism seen in protein polymerases and phosphatases was proposed to be used by group I and group II introns to process the phosphoryl transfer reactions, which was unambiguously proven by a recently resolved high-resolution structure of the Azoarcus group I 
intron.

'''Group II catalytic intron'''

Group II catalytic introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB, which differ in splice site consensus, and the distance of the bulged adenosine in domain VI (the prospective branch point forming the lariat) from the 3' splice site.

'''Group III introns'''

Montandon,P. and Stutz,E. (1984) and Hallick,R.B. et al. (1988 and 1989) reported examples of a novel type of introns in Euglena chloroplast. In 1989, David A.Christopher and Richard B.Hallick proposed the title, Group III introns to identify this new class with the following characteristics:
Group III introns are much shorter than other self-splicing intron classes, ranging from 95 to 110 nucleotides amongst those known to Christopher and Hallick, and identified in chloroplasts. On the other hand, Christopher and Hallick stated: &quot;By contrast, the smallest Euglena chloroplast group II intron ... is 277 nucleotides.&quot;
Their conserved sequences proximal to the splicing sites have similarities to those of group II introns, but have fewer conserved positions.
They do not map into the conserved secondary structure of group II introns. (Indeed Christopher and Hallick were unable to identify any conserved secondary structure elements among group III introns.)
They are usually associated with genes involved in translation and transcription.
They are very A+T rich.
In 1994, discovery of a group III intron with a length of one order of magnitude longer indicated that length alone is not the determinant of splicing in Group III introns (Copertino DW., Hall ET.)
Splicing of group III introns occurs through lariat and circular RNA formation. Similarities between group III and nuclear introns include conserved 5' boundary sequences, lariat formation, lack of internal structure, and ability to use alternate splice boundaries.

==RNA-editing==
[[Image:Editing.PNG|600px|thumb|Summary of the Various Functions of RNA Editing]]

The RNA-editing system seen in the animal may have evolved from mononucleotide deaminases, which have led to larger gene families that include the apobec-1 and adar genes. These genes share close identity with the bacterial deaminases involved in nucleotide metabolism. The adenosine deaminase of E. coli cannot deaminate a nucleoside in the RNA; the enzyme’s reaction pocket is too small to for the RNA strand to bind to. However, this active site is widened by amino acid changes in the corresponding human analog genes, APOBEC-1 and ADAR, allowing deamination.
The insertional editing seen in the trypanosome mitochondria has no relation with the nucleoside conversion process. The enzymes involved have been shown in other studies to be recruited and adapted from different sources. But, the specificity of nucleotide insertion via the interaction between the gRNA and mRNA are similar to the tRNA editing processes in the animal and Acanthamoeba mithochondria. Furthermore, the eukaryotic ribose methylation of rRNAs by guide RNA molecules may provide another link between RNA editing and modification.
As a consequence, the numerous studies suggest that RNA editing may have evolved in specific lineages of speciation, due to the subtle differences in their mechanism. The data does not support the existence of RNA editing in the RNA world, since its mechanism is not linked to any hypothesized process that may have existed at that time. Therefore, RNA editing appears to have evolved at a later time to compensate for the changes in gene sequences and to increase variation.

===Editing by insertion or deletion===

RNA editing through the addition and deletion of uracil has been found in kinetoplasts from the mitochondria of ''Trypanosoma brucei''. Editing of the RNA starts with the base-pairing of the unedited primary transcript with a guide RNA (gRNA), which contains complementary sequences to the regions around the insertion/deletion points. The newly formed double-stranded region is then enveloped by an editosome, a large multi-protein complex that catalyzes the editing. The editosome opens the transcript at the first mismatched nucleotide and starts inserting uridines. The inserted uridines will base-pair with the guide RNA, and insertion will continue as long as A or G is present in the guide RNA and will stop when a C or U is encountered. The inserted nucleotides cause a frameshift and result in a translated protein that differs from its gene.


'''The Editosome Complex'''
The mechanism of the editosome involves an endonucleolytic cut at the mismatch point between the guide RNA and the unedited transcript. The next step is catalyzed by one of the enzymes in the complex, a terminal U-transferase, which adds Us from UTP at the 3’ end of the mRNA. The opened ends are held in place by other proteins in the complex. Another enzyme, a U-specific exoribonuclease, removes the unpaired Us. After editing has made mRNA complementary to gRNA, an RNA ligase rejoins the ends of the edited mRNA transcript.
As a consequence, the editosome can edit only in a 3’ to 5’ direction along the primary RNA transcript. The complex can act on only a single guide RNA at a time. Therefore, a RNA transcript requiring extensive editing will need more than one guide RNA and editosome complex.




'''Editing by deamination'''

'''C-U editing'''
The editing involves cytidine deaminase that deaminates a cytidine base into a uridine base. An example of C-to-U editing is with the apolipoprotein B gene in humans. Apo B100 is expressed in the liver and apo B48 is expressed in the intestines. The B100 form has a CAA sequence that is edited to UAA, a stop codon, in the intestines. It is unedited in the liver.


'''A-I editing'''
A-to-I editing occurs in regions of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are the RNA-editing enzymes involved in the hydrolytic deamination of Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I editing). A-to-I editing can be specific (a single adenosine is edited within the stretch of dsRNA) or promiscuous (up to 50% of the adenosines are edited). Specific editing occurs within short duplexes (e.g., those formed in an mRNA where intronic sequence base pairs with a complementary exonic sequence), while promiscuous editing occurs within longer regions of duplex (e.g., pre- or pri-miRNAs, duplexes arising from transgene or viral expression, duplexes arising from paired repetitive elements). There are many effects of A-to-I editing, arising from the fact that I behaves as if it is G both in translation and when forming secondary structures. These effects include alteration of coding capacity, altered miRNA or siRNA target populations, heterochromatin formation, nuclear sequestration, cytoplasmic sequestration, endonucleolytic cleavage by Tudor-SN, inhibition of miRNA and siRNA processing ,and altered splicing&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNA_editing&amp;oldid=424324287&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using the form below will rename a page, moving all of its history to the new name. The old title will become a redirect page to the new title. Be sure to check for [[Special:DoubleRedirects|double]] or [[Special:BrokenRedirects|broken redirects]]. You are responsible for making sure that links continue to point where they are supposed to go.

Note that the page will '''not''' be moved if there is already a page at the new title, unless it is empty or a redirect and has no past edit history. This means that you can rename a page back to where it was renamed from if you make a mistake, and you cannot overwrite an existing page.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A conic section is defined as the locus of all points where the distance from the point to the focus and the point to a straight line known as the directrix is a constant ratio. This ratio is known as the eccentricity of the section.
* If the ratio is 1, the section is known as a parabola.
* If the ratio is less than one, the section is an ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.
* If the ratio is greater than one, the section is hyperbola.

All conic sections can be formed by taking the intersection of a cone and a plane, hence the name.

== Using the collection creator ==
After the ''collection creator'' has been enabled, the box as seen below is shown above each wiki page.
{|
|-
| [[File:Collection Extension - Create a collection box.png|frame|The collection creator interface]]
|-
|}

;''Add this page to your collection''
:Adds the currently viewed page to your collection.
;''Show collection''
:Opens a new page which will show a list of all pages that you added to your collection. On that page, you can '''change the order''' of the pages in your collection and '''structure''' them using chapters. Further, you can '''download''' the books as a [[w:PDF|PDF]] or [[w:OpenDocument|ODF]], or order a '''printed book'''.
;''Suggest pages''
:This tool analyzes the current set of pages in your book and '''suggests''' pages that might be also relevant to the overall topic of your collection. This tool allows to create collections '''quickly'''.
;''Disable''
:This will '''disable''' the ''Collection creator'' and '''delete''' your collection (unless you saved it first).

=== Adding pages without visiting them ===
A quick way to add pages is to simply hover on a linked page. If you wait about one second, a small box will pop up with the message &quot;Add linked wiki page to your collection&quot;. Click on this link, and the linked page will be added to your collection.

{|
|-
| [[File:Collection Extension - Hover and add page.png|frame|Hovering your mouse over links is a convenient way to add pages to your collection]]
|-
|}

=== Adding whole categories ===
If you are viewing a [[Wikibooks:Categories|category page]], you can add all the pages in that category at once. The ''Add this page to your collection'' link will have changed into ''Add this category to your collection''. Click on this new link, and all the pages in that category will be added to your collection. Relevant categories may be found at the very bottom of Wikibooks pages. Categories can also be added by hovering category links.</text>

There is a central [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Book_tool/Feedback page at meta.wikimedia.org]  gathering all major issues with this extension.  Issues that can't be solved and are not yet covered on the page at meta should be added there.

For obvious bugs the [http://code.pediapress.com/wiki/report/1 issue tracker] is the 
preferred place to directly issue and check tickets.

At IRC [irc://irc.freenode.net/pediapress #pediapress] some immediate support might be available.

==Question: Quiz ==

Is there a way to use the [[v:Help:Quiz|quiz]] together with [[mw:Extension:Collection|collections]]? For example: it would be nice if the software could show the answers that are in the quiz code in a section after the exercises... But until now, even the questions are not displayed correctly...

:As far as I know the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Quiz quiz extension] is not supported by wikibooks. If it was, you should be able to use the standard tricks to have a different on-screen and print version, i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; and &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you use the traditional print version approach and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Collections#Substituting_templates substitution templates] if you use collections. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:31, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
::I didn't realize that it is not enabled here... I use it at pt.wikibooks.

== Question: image and code ==

Hi,
I have made pdf from page :
[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set Julia set]].
It looks good. The only problem is that the code is on the image . See for example section &quot;External distance estimation&quot; in pdf file.
Here psedocode : &quot;if (LastIteration==IterationMax)
then { /* interior of Julia set: color = black */ }....&quot;
Is on the image : Julia set : image with C source code.
How can I change it ? Regards. --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 07:47, 30 May 2009 (UTC)

I found that this related to:
* Some links has &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; symbol
* There is some &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; markup
* Name of article has &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; symbol

But PDF generates sucessfully!

Can somebody fix this ODF book creation error?

==Bug: pdf book font is kinda small==
the book font look like it's a 8pt font, thats really small, it should be a 10 or 12 point font. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:16, 31 July 2010 (UTC)
:Did you check to see if you are viewing the PDF at 100% zoom or not?  It may be fitting the PDF to the window size. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:00, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== Images can be improperly positionned in generated PDF ==

Hi,

I've generated a PDF form the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro]] wikibook. Resulting PDF is : [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=download&amp;collection_id=0cd82511e39ba944&amp;writer=rl&amp;return_to=Wikibooks%3ACollections%2FBlender+3D%3A+Noob+to+Pro here] (A4 format).

Result is good, except for some pages where images (which appeared centered on the online version) are moved partially outside the right margin in the generated PDF. Example of such page incorreclty generated is [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Coordinate_Transformations|Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Coordinate_Transformations]] (the 3rd image of the LEM is centered online, but incorrect in the generated PDF).

Please help.

== Cannot save collection,using Collections tool ==

I use IE9, and I have been a user here for over a month.
I cannot fill in a collection file name for either my namespace or the wiki space -- the input field is disabled.
And so is the &quot;submit&quot; button for the field.

If I modify the HTML on-the-fly from my browser to fill in the collection name and enable the submit button, then hit the submit button, the save never happens. Yesterday, when I tried this, I got a bunch of wiki errors.--[[User:AngelinaBelle|AngelinaBelle]] ([[User talk:AngelinaBelle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AngelinaBelle|contribs]]) 11:25, 19 October 2011 (UTC)
:I have filed a [[bugzilla:31821|bug report]] for this, as I see it's also been reported at Wikipedia and I was able to reproduce the error when saving.  I had to try to save to the Wikibooks namespace, as I was able to fill in the text field for the Wikibooks namespace, but not the user namespace. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:20, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

== A few issues with PDF render ==
I like collections, but the output just isn't up to it at the moment and it looks like I'll have to go back to print versions. You can find the issues here in a collection I've been trying to build:[[User:Pluke/Collections/Unit2]]

* &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag not working
* passing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a template causes the template parameter to not be passed correctly, defaulting back to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* You can't have an exercise box that spreads over more than one page
** See Boolean gate combination
* internal wikipedia links are not highlighted, but present ie. using: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:apple|apple]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* inconsistent rendering of CSS / styles
** box widths not 100% when they are in wiki view
** background colours missing from most css
** style formatting of text in tables doesn't seem to work
* wikitable display is inconsistent
** table caption is displayed incorrectly &lt;nowiki&gt;|+ '''Examples of Boolean Algebra shown in a truth table'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (this may be a result of nested tables not being handled correctly)
* transparency on SVGs appears as plain black
* &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag not working
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; rendering is a little clumsy, the speech marks over lap the text

== Section Numbers ==

I'm in the process of adding chapter and section numbers for a collection, specifically [[Wikibooks:Collections/GLSL_Programming_in_Unity]]. The idea is to hard code chapter and section numbers in that page and to have a template ({{tlx|GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef}}) with hard coded chapter and section numbers to produce numbered references in the output for print. Whenever the numbering changes (e.g. when sections are added, removed, or moved around), these two pages but no other pages have to be changed. Is there an easier way to achieve a similar result? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 22:01, 19 May 2012 (UTC)

== Positive Feedback ==

I am not sure whether this is the proper venue for submitting such feedback, but it's the only one I've found so far.  I am very impressed with the quality of the output of the PDF generation.  I mean, I'm no document expert or anything, but it exceeds anything I expected.  Quite excellent.  If anyone could pass on my congratulations and my thanks to the people who made the PDF generation system possible, I would be grateful.  A job well done. -- 00:39 28 January 2013 (UTC)

== A request for HTML output ==

Some time ago I downloaded the wikibook [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]. Originally it was in three large HTML files, &quot;Beginner Tutorials&quot;, &quot;Advanced Tutorials&quot;, and &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot;. This was very convenient and made it very easy to use offline while teaching myself how to use Blender. Unfortunately, in the intervening period some misguided person has spent a lot of effort cutting up the three large pages into what are now 254 small pages, some consisting of only a single paragraph. I'm sure this person meant well and undoubtedly had in mind the oft-repeated saying that webpages should consist of little more than a screenful of data. (I have tried to find the origin of this suggestion that smaller pages are somehow &quot;better&quot;. It always seemed to me a rather patronising belief, as if we &quot;ordinary folk&quot; are not capable of maintaing our attention for more than a few minutes at a time. It seems very out of place on the Wikibooks site, where people have deliberately come to look for long-form content.) Sadly, this decimation has made what was a wonderful resource into something completely unusable for offline reading.

So I tried today to collect all 254 pages into a downloadable book, with disastrous results.

It took about 4 hours going through all the pages to click on the &quot;Add this page to your collection&quot; link at the head of each page. (The hover &quot;Add this page to your collection&quot; links on the main index page don't display.) I finally had the collection ready to be rendered and downloaded. Away it went rendering for what may have been half an hour, then presented me with the link to download the epub. (I intended to unzip the epub later and pull out the HTML files that comprise it.) I clicked the link and I'm not sure how long it took then displaying a blank page (20 minutes?) before finally saying that an error had occurred. I went back to the earlier page and tried downloading again. Another error and a note saying that my collection seems to have been deleted (though I don't think it was). I tried a few more times, including attempting to download as OpenDocument format (I could convert that to HTML later).

Interestingly I looked around in the /tmp directory on my machine and found three 13MB files that are incomplete PDF documents with times corresponding to my attempts to download the epub and OpenDocument files... but I never requested PDF. (I've since tried a test on a single page, and the collection process '''only''' delivers PDF.)

May I request adding HTML format to the book collection formats? It would be much easier to do than the other three formats. PDF is terribly bloated and suited only to printing on paper. OpenDocument format is similar, but at least possible to convert to other formats. The epub format is a conveniently compact reader format, but none of the three formats allow animated gifs or sounds and videos to play. HTML alone is capable of printing, displaying animated gifs and playing sound and video.

Can I also request that the policy of slicing pages into ever smaller and smaller pieces be reversed? It is a terribly retrograde step that makes books virtually unusable unless you are lucky enough to have cheap, fast, always-on internet. Most of the planet still has expensive, slow, occasional internet. Remember, this isn't Wikipages or Wikiparagraphs, it is Wiki'''books'''. People come here looking for large chunks of information: books. To serve it up to them in tiny chunks is to sorely underestimate them, and as it did for me today, makes life far more difficult than it need be. It has sadly made [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] completely unusable for offline work. It's like tearing the pages out of a paper book and handing them to a reader one at a time as they request them, instead of letting the reader have the whole book to read as they wish. It makes no sense.

[[File:Pedia-still-5.jpg|thumb|360px|Printed PediaPress books of Wikibooks content.]]
This page gives experienced users details on the advanced functions of the Collection tool.  Among other things, it explains how the layout of collections can be improved and how collections are stored on Wikibooks.
__TOC__
{{clear}}
==Saving books==
;Format of stored book pages:
When you save a book, it is stored in the format shown below.

{|
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; |&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt;
{{saved book
 |title=
 |subtitle=
 |cover-image=
 |cover-color=
 |text-color=
}}

== Title ==
=== Subtitle ===

;Chapter 1
:[[First page]]
:[[Page 2|Second page]]
:[[Third page]]

;Chapter 2
:[[Fourth page]]
:[[5th page|Fifth page]]
:[[Sixth page]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt;
&lt;-- The template appearing at the top of the page
&lt;-- This is only used to generate a preview of the cover
&lt;-- This is only used to generate a preview of the cover
&lt;-- The default* cover image of the collection (see note below)
&lt;-- The default* cover color of the collection (see note below)
&lt;-- This is only used to generate a preview of the cover

&lt;-- Title of the book
&lt;-- Subtitle of the book

&lt;-- First chapter's name (starts with a semicolon)
&lt;-- First page (starts with a colon)
&lt;-- Second page (renamed)
&lt;-- Third page

&lt;-- Second chapter's name
&lt;-- Fourth page
&lt;-- Fifth page (renamed)
&lt;-- Sixth page 

*   These parameters are not currently supported by the printed book creation system
    but will be at some point in the future. In the meantime, these can be used to
    give a preview of what the printed book cover could be like.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
|}

You can also manually create a collection from scratch by using the same format. To create a collection from scratch, start a new page such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Myusername/Collections/Mybookname]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Only [[Wikibooks:Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed users]] can save collections.

;Allowed syntax
Only the following syntax is allowed:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Title'''
| The title is contained in double equals signs.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;== Title ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
| '''Subtitle'''
| The subtitles is contained in three equals signs.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Subtitle ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
| '''Chapter headings'''
| Chapter headings are preceded with a semicolon.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;;Chapter name&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
| '''Adding a page'''
| A page is inserted as a wikilink after a colon.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:[[Book Name/Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
|'''Renaming a page'''
|You can use a pipe ('&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;') to rename the page in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:[[Python Programming/Classes|Classes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|}

;Location of collections
Books can either be saved in the user's namespace &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Name/Collections/Book Name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or as a community book at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikibooks:Collections/Book Name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. To be recognized as a collection, it must belong to the category [[:Category:Collections]] (automatically added by {{tl|saved book}}).

==Loading collections==

To load a collection, simply click on the 'load collection' link in the banner at the top of each collection. If the banner isn't present, then add {{tl|saved book}} at the top of the page.

==Improving the book layout==

Some wiki-markup can lead to problems in the generation of PDF documents as part of the book feature.  This mainly applies to templates, which will be displayed differently in the electronic or print version compared to how they look in the online version of a page.  This can be fixed by either substituting the current template or removing the template from the content that cause problems in the PDF.  As a rule of thumb, all content (especially templates) that is not useful for an offline version of the document, should be excluded from the print version.

===Identifying problems===

The most efficient way to identify problems is to go on the individual pages of your book and view the page as a PDF (click &quot;Download as PDF&quot; in the &quot;print/export&quot; box on the left hand side of your screen, towards the bottom). Preview the page, and if something doesn't look right, chances are there's a problem. While the printed books and OpenDocument version will differ from the PDF version, they share a lot of similarities. If something looks weird in the PDF version, chances are it will also look weird in the printed book or OpenDocument version.

Usually there are three kinds of problems:

* A template that is not content-related (such as [[Template:Navbox|a navigational box]]) is displayed. See below on how to fix this.
* Something looks weird, such as &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;234&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;margin-left:0.3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-family:monospace,'Courier New'; font-size:85%; text-align:right;&quot;&gt;+23&lt;br /&gt;&amp;minus;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; looking like 234+23-21 in the PDF, or having superfluous whitespace. This is usually due to a template being coded in a non-standard way, or to a problem with the rendering software. You can try to fix this yourself if you know your way around templates. If you don't know how to fix it or are simply intimidated by templates, leave a message on the discussion page of the template, and place a notice at [[Help:Collections/Feedback]] and someone will look into it.
* Content and style problems, such as spelling, grammar, different varieties of English, poorly worded sentences, ...

===Fixing problems===

There are four ways to resolve issues caused by templates:

*'''Exclude templates:''' A template can be excluded from content by adding it to [[:Category:Exclude in print]].
:''Note:'' Many templates use other templates to function.  Therefore groups/types of templates can be excluded by adding the commonly used template to this category.
*'''Exclude certain specific content:''' By using [[Template:Hide in print]], certain specific content, such as a few words or an image, can be excluded from printing.&lt;blockquote&gt;{{green|This content will be printed. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hide in print|This content will *not* be printed.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; This content will be printed.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''Include certain specific content only in print versions:''' The [[Template:Only in print]] can be used to insert content that shall only be visible in offline versions.&lt;blockquote&gt;{{green|This content will be printed. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Only in print|This content will only appear in PDFs or printed books, *not* with the browser.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; This content will be printed.}}

Content problems such as poorly worded sentences, or style problems such as variations in the citation style used, can be fixed only by editing the page.

==Multi-wiki Collections==
Using the extension it is [http://code.pediapress.com/wiki/ticket/408 currently impossible] to create a collection of content from multiple different wikis.  However, you can easily create books containing articles from multiple wikis using the [[w:bookmarklet|bookmarklet]] offered on [http://pediapress.com/collection/ this page].

[[File:Pedia-hill-2.jpg|right|250px|Printed books by PediaPress]]

Wikibooks offers users a service to order '''individually printed books''' based on collections created with the [[Help:Collections|Collection Tool]]. The service is offered in cooperation with [[w:PediaPress|PediaPress]] which is the official [[w:print on demand|print on demand]] partner of the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;sup class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[[wmf:Wikis_Go_Printable|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== How to order a printed version ===
&lt;table style=&quot;background: rgb(220,220,220); float:right; margin:0px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_1.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_2.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_3v2.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: white&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;1) Click on [[Special:Collection|&quot;Preview with PediaPress&quot;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) Collection gets loaded by PediaPress&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;3) Set up cover, choose country, get price&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:PediaPress_book_ordering_step_4.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_5.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_6.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: white&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;4) View preview&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;5) Add to cart&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;6) Enter shipping and billing information&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

First create your personal collections of pages as described on the [[Help:Collections|Collection Tool help page]].

Then simply click on &quot;Preview with PediaPress&quot; on the [[Special:Collection|'Show collection']] page. This uploads your collection to the PediaPress website. 
After choosing the destination country, an approximate number of pages and the price are shown. Title, subtitle, and editor can be set or changed here. Further, users can customize the cover by selecting an image from within the collection to appear on the front of the book, as well as setting a background color.

There is a preview which shows what your selected pages (only the first N pages) will look like in a printed book.  (''Note'': The typesetting and layout of printed books differs from downloadable PDFs, since the page size is half letter, not letter and it includes additional features like an index, references as footnotes, etc.)

At this point, your book can be ordered by adding it to the cart and checking out.  Available payment methods are MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal.  Softcover books are printed within 2–3 business days, hardcover or color books are printed within 15 business days, and shipping takes another 2–20 days.

=== How are books manufactured? ===
[[File:Pedia-still-5.jpg|thumb|250px|Printed Wikibooks books]]
PediaPress uses the [[TeX]] typesetting system to generate a digital pre-press reproduction. Books produced by this technique look just like conventional books. 

Book specification:
* Content
** Table of contents
** The selected pages
** Endnotes
** Licensing information 
** Index 
* Paper size: 8.5 inch × 5.5 inch (216 mm x 140 mm)
* Images are printed using the highest available resolution
* Books can contain 50 to 800 pages; larger collections are automatically evenly split up into multiple volumes

There is an [http://pediapress.com/resources/images/samplebook/samplebook.pdf example book] (PDF), which shows how printed books are typeset.

=== How much do printed books cost? ===
{| style=&quot;float:right; border:solid 1px; margin:1em;&quot;
|- 
!number of pages !! price
|-
|100 || US$&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8.90
|-
|200 || US$ 12.90
|-
|300 || US$ 16.90
|-
|400 || US$ 20.90
|-
|500 || US$ 24.90
|-
|600 || US$ 28.90
|-
|700 || US$ 32.90
|}

Pricing for printed books depends on the number of included pages (see table). Shipping costs depend on the shipping destination. To get a detailed quote, simply upload your book to PediaPress and select your country and currency.

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] receives 10% of the gross total for each book sold.

=== Which shipping options are available? ===
For the US and most European destinations express shipping options are available. For most other countries in the world a standard shipping option is the default. Delivery time varies from 2 to 20 business days depending on the destination.

=== What is PediaPress? === 
PediaPress is an online service which offers customized printed books from wiki content.  The web-to-print service works on any MediaWiki which has deployed the open source [[mw:Extension:Collection|Collection Extension]]. The company actively supports the MediaWiki community and established a long-term partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation ([[wmf:Wikis Go Printable|Wikis Go Printable]]). The company was founded in 2007 and is located in Mainz, Germany. For more information see [http://pediapress.com/about/].

== Printed books ==

:See [[Help:Collections/Printed books|About collections printed as books]]

== PDF export ==

=== Why are pages displayed differently than in the browser? ===
Books have no scroll bars, while a browser does, so printed content needs to be split up on several pages. To get an acceptable typesetting result, some page elements need to be displayed differently. This may result in some unexpected layouts, especially for tables and parts of wiki pages that use HTML instead of MediaWiki markup.

=== How can I improve the appearance? ===
You can edit the wiki pages themselves to make them print better. See [[Help:Collections/Advanced|Help for Experts]] for some ideas. 

== OpenDocument Text export ==

=== What is OpenDocument Text? ===
The [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] format (ODF) is an [[XML]]-based file format originally created and implemented by the [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] office suite. It is a free and open [[w:OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard aimed to replace the proprietary [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]] file format.

Storing books in this format is useful if one wants to modify the books. This option allows editors to generate arbitrarily styled books with additional content. Teachers may find this useful.

=== Which software is required to open this file? === 

[[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[w:KOffice|KOffice]] or others. There also is an [http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/ ODF-AddIn] for [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]]. Moreover, [[w:Microsoft Office 2007|Microsoft Office 2007]] with the latest service pack now supports the OpenDocument format.

== Collection tool ==

=== Where can I find stored collections? ===
All stored collections are placed in [[:Category:Collections]] and can be browsed at [[Wikibooks:Collections]].

=== How do the exports comply with license requirements? ===

==== PDF export ====
* link to each page and its version
* all contributors are mentioned
* images are linked to their image page on the wiki
* inclusion of the CC-BY-SA (English)

==== Printed books ====
* URL of each page and its version
* all contributors are mentioned
* URL of each image
* all contributors of an image are mentioned
* license name of the image is mentioned
* inclusion of the CC-BY-SA (English)

=== Can I use the collection tool with my MediaWiki installation? ===
Yes, the book tool is based on the [http://code.pediapress.com open source project mwlib]. The MediaWiki component [[mw:Extension:Collection|Collection extension]] works out of the box with most MediaWikis and the PediaPress service.

=== How do I delete my collection? ===
*If you saved your collection in your userspace (e.g. [[User:USERNAME/Collections/My book]]), you can simply request deletion by placing {{tlx|speedy|user request}} on top of the page.
*If you saved your book in the Wikibooks namespace (e.g. [[Wikibooks:Collections]]), several options are possible.
**If you created the book by mistake or as a test, place {{tlx|speedy|test page}} at the top of the page
**If you created a book, and ''no one else'' edited the book, place {{tlx|speedy|author request}} at the top of the page
**If someone else (other than [[Wikibooks:Bots|bots]]) edited the page, then you need to follow the steps listed at ''[[WB:RFD|Requests for Deletion]]'' (RFD).

== Known limitations ==

=== Skin support ===
The tool currently only works with the Monobook, Modern, and Vector skins.

=== Limitation of the book size ===
Printed books can not contain more than 500 pages, will contain 800 pages per volume (books more than 800 pages long will be split over two or more volumes). The A5 books have approximately double the number of pages than the equivalent A4 PDF.

Please keep in mind that generation of large PDFs can take a long time and results in high server load. Dividing collections into multiple books might be a solution.

=== Infoboxes and large tables ===
[[Template:Infobox|Infoboxes]] and other large tables are printed at full page size, not &quot;floated&quot; to the side as on the Web. This is a result of the limited size of A5 paper: if the infobox was shrunk to fit, the text within would be illegible. 

=== CSS &amp; HTML ===
CSS and HTML used in the wiki markup are only partially evaluated when generating PDFs. Templates can be adjusted for print to avoid some of the problems, see [[Help:Collections/Advanced|Help for Experts]] for details. 

=== TeX formulas ===

In PDF exports, math-tags are rendered as raster images and not in print-quality due to technical limitations.

== Bugs and general feedback ==
Bugs, feature requests and questions are best reported at the [[Help:Collections/Feedback|Feedback page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Napoleon's theorem''' (so called because some people have attributed it to Napoleon Bonaparte) states that if any triangle is taken, and an equilateral triangle constructed on each side, pointing outwards, the centroids of these three triangles are the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

The theorem is easily proved by calculating the separations of the centroids and showing that they are equal.

== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
About 800 thousand.

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==
Wicca is practiced mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom.

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Wicca is a very interesting religion. It is very eclectic, meaning that there are many different versions of it. 
Most people who practice Wicca believe in spirits, mystical creatures, elements, and multiple gods and goddesses. Many women find comfort in Wicca, and one of the main reasons for this is because feminine energy and spirit is largely represented. There is even a version of Wicca that only represents female energy and spirit. As previously stated, there are many versions of Wicca. To every person who practices it, it is unique. It's like going to a candy shop with a box to hold all the candy you want in it, and you pick out only the pieces you like. Wicca is so vast, and many people only choose parts of it to practice. In Wicca, you can incorporate other religions into it. It is a very flexible religion.

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Wiccans celebrate festivals which happen throughout the year. These holidays are called ''Sabbats''. One festival, called ''''Imbolc'''', is on January 31st or February 1st and is to celebrate the first day of Spring. ''''Beltane'''' is held on May 1st or April 31st.

      <comment>/* Rotating a Conic */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A conic is a second degree polynomial. When it is expanded, you get an equation of the form:
&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If the value of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero then the conic is not roated and sits on the x- and y- axis. If &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero, then the conic is rotated about the axes, with the rotation centred on the origin.

== Graphing ==
=== Graphing a Rotated Conic ===
If you are asked to graph a rotated conic in the form &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;, it is first necessary to transform it to an equation for an identical, non-rotated conic. This is then plotted onto new axes which are drawn onto the graph. The equation for the nonrotated conic can be found by: &lt;math&gt;AX^2 + BXY +CY^2 + DX + EY + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Note how capital letters are used for the pronumerals. This signifies that they reperesent different values to the original equaiton.

To determine the values of X and Y, you use the formulae:
* &lt;math&gt;tan 2\theta = \frac{B}{A-C}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \theta - Y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \theta + Y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting the new values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; into the original equation, a new one can be obtained which represents a non-rotated conic which can be plotted on a set of axes rotated at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (anti-clockwise) to the original x- and y- axes. When you do this, however, it will still be necessary to determine the new rotated location of points such as the vertex, foci and directrixes. This can be done using the following formulae:
* &lt;math&gt;X = x cos \theta + y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Y = -x sin \theta + y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
Where (X,Y) are the new rotated coordinates of the orginal point (x,y). 

The formula: &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC&lt;/math&gt; can be used to determine the type of conic from the original equation before you start graphing:
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC = 0&lt;/math&gt;: Parabola
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Ellipse
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Hyperbola

=== Rotating a Conic ===
If you wish to rotate a conic by a certain angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, it is relatively simple. All you do is make the following substitution from the previous section:
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \theta - Y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \theta + Y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
Replacing the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; values from the function with these new ones. Then simplify the answer, and it will be a function for the same conic rotated by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; counter-clockwise about the origin.

      <comment>/* Iterative geometric scaling */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Scaling is the process of applying linear transformations to the problem constraint matrix in order to improve its numerical properties.

The type of scaling to be deployed can be controlled using command-line options in the case of GLPSOL or via the GLPK API when calling GLPK directly from a program.

__FORCETOC__

== Overview ==

Scaling within GLPK is managed by the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt;.
The original information on this page was derived from the source code comments for this function and its subsidiary functions
&lt;tt&gt;scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;gm_scaling&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;gm_iterate&lt;/tt&gt;, and
&lt;tt&gt;eq_scaling&lt;/tt&gt;.
On that note, the GLPK codebase is well commented and a good place to look for detailed information.

Scaling in GLPK may consist of the following steps &amp;mdash;
with the respective [[w:Bitwise_OR#OR|bitwise or-able]] scaling options also shown:

* skip if the problem is well scaled : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_SKIP&lt;/tt&gt;
* perform iterative geometric scaling : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_GM&lt;/tt&gt;
* perform equilibration scaling : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_EQ&lt;/tt&gt;
* round scale factors to nearest power of two : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_2N&lt;/tt&gt;

The default scaling setting &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_AUTO&lt;/tt&gt; undertakes the first three steps in the order:
&lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_SKIP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_GM&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_EQ&lt;/tt&gt;.  
Use of the MIP presolver may also add &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_2N&lt;/tt&gt;.

Scaling normally also provides [[GLPK/Terminal_output#Scaling_output|terminal output]].
More details can be found in the 
[[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official documentation]]
or directly from the source code.

== Check whether problem is well scaled ==

The problem is considered well scaled if,

&lt;math&gt;
0.1 \leq \left|a_{i,j}\right| \leq 10, \forall a_{i,j} \neq 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is the constraint matrix coefficient for row ''i'' and column ''j''.

== Iterative geometric scaling ==

Geometric scaling can be applied equally to rows and columns.  Geometric scaling scales each row or column such that the product of the smallest and the biggest absolute value is unity.

&lt;math&gt;
a'_{i,j} = \frac{a_{i,j}}{ \sqrt{ \min(\left|a_{i,j}\right|) \times \max(\left|a_{i,j}\right|) } }
&lt;/math&gt;

Iterative geometric scalings applies geometric scaling alternatively to rows and columns until either a maximum number of iterations is reached or the  scaling does not improve significantly. The scaling quality ''r'' is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;
r = \frac{\max(\left|a_{i,j}\right|)}{\min(\left|a_{i,j}\right|)}
&lt;/math&gt;

GLPK defaults to a round-to-round improvement for ''r'' of at least 10% and a maximum of 15 rounds before termination.

== Equilibration scaling ==

Equilibration scaling can be both applied to both rows and columns.  Equilibration scaling divides each row or column by the biggest absolute value present in that row or column.

&lt;math&gt;
a'_{i,j} = \frac{a_{i,j}}{\max(\left|a_{i,j}\right|)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Equilibration scaling makes the [[w:Norm_%28mathematics%29#Maximum_norm_.28special_case_of:_infinity_norm.2C_uniform_norm.2C_or_supremum_norm.29|infinity norm]] of each row and column equal to one.

== Nearest power of two scaling ==
Scaling may produce rounding errors. These can be avoided if all scaling factors are powers of two as this will only influence the exponent and not the mantissa of the [[w:IEEE_754-2008|IEEE 754]] representation of double precision numbers.

The algorithm first iterates over all rows and then over all columns. The scaling factor each row/column is rounded to the closest power of two:

&lt;math&gt;
f \leftarrow 2 ^ { \lfloor log_2( \frac{4}{3} f ) \rfloor }
&lt;/math&gt;

== Recomputation ==

If you add or remove a row or column or modify an existing row/column, then you will need to call &lt;tt&gt;glp_scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt; again.  In the case of modification, this call may also change some row and/or column scale factors and thereby the basis matrix.  This then invalidates the current basis factorization stored in your &lt;tt&gt;glp_prob&lt;/tt&gt; object by the simplex solver, because the factorization is computed for the scaled matrix and not the original matrix.  This, however, is only a matter of efficiency (and not accuracy or stability) because, if the basis factorization becomes invalid, the simplex solver will simply compute a new basis matrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The lua programming language provides a set of comparative operators. The comparative operators are used to determine equality or inequality or otherwise make comparisons of numeric or string values, and produce a boolean [[/truth/]] based on the result. In lua, all values are true, except [[/nil/]] and [[/false/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A Unique Early History'''

California was originally settled by a First Nation which in its various tribes is called the Chumash. When the Spanish conquistadors entered the continent, the land became part of the Spanish empire. Father Juniper Serra pioneered a string of missions up the coast and the Catholic church was a major player inculcating the Chumash with Christianity. 

Subsequently, war broke out in Texas and swiftly engulfed the continent. A group of rebel white American settlers declared the Bear Flag Republic and seceded from Mexico, barely two weeks before the US Navy arrived at Monterey and declared US martial law. US troops marched into Mexico City and installed Santa Anna from whom the US exacted the Treaty of Guadalupe. Cash was paid for acquisition of California.

The U.S. Congress subsequently took California into the USA as a state. As a result, California has two US Senators and a House of Representatives delegation of 53, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
'''
The Gold Rush and Immigrant Scares'''

The California Gold Rush was a major influence, drawing Americans from the East and many Asians from the West. This led to a series of anti-Chinese scare which by all estimates are not a legacy of which to be proud.

'''Modernization''' 

This section is under construction. Please feel free to contribute.

'''Jumping to Modern Times'''

In the 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Democratic incumbent Gray Davis defeated Republican challenger Bill Simon.

On October 7, 2003, Davis was successfully recalled, with 55.4% of the voters supporting the recall (see results of the 2003 California recall). With a plurality of 48.6% of the vote, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was chosen as the new governor. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante received 31.5% of the vote, and Republican State Senator Tom McClintock received 13.5% of the vote.

Schwarzenegger began his shortened term with a soaring approval rating and soon after began implementing a conservative agenda. This initially resulted in sparring with the heavily Democratic Assembly and Senate over the state budget, battles which provided his infamous &quot;girly men&quot; comment but also began taking their toll on his approval rating. Schwarzenegger then embarked on a campaign to enact several ballot propositions in a 2005 Special Election touted as reforming California's budget system, redistricting powers, and union political fundraising. The union-led campaign spearheaded by the California Nurses Association contributed heavily to the defeat of every proposition in the Special Election. Since this conspicuous failure, Schwarzenegger has made a turn back to the left, criticizing the Bush Administration at many junctures, reviving his environmental agenda, and compromising with the legislature on the traditionally Democratic issue of education spending. His approval rating has also been revived, and he was re-elected in 2006. However continued paralysis in state government and the inability of the Legislature and Governor to work out the fundamental funding questions has resulted in voter disapproval of both the legislators and the Governor whose approval rating is among the lowest ever recorded pending the election of a successor in November, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''California Public Records Act''' (California Government Code
[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6250-6270 §§ 6250] through 6276.48) was a law passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the Governor in 1968 mandating disclosure of governmental records to the public upon request, unless there is a specific reason not to do so. The law is similar to the Freedom of Information Act, except for the fact that &quot;the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business&quot; is enshrined in Article 1 of the California Constitution due to California Proposition 59 (the Sunshine Amendment).

==Purpose==
When the legislature enacted CPRA, it expressly declared that &quot;access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6250.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in California &quot;access to government records has been deemed a fundamental interest of citizenship&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CBS v. Block, 42 Cal. 3d 646, 652 n.5, 230 Cal. Rptr. 362, 725 P. 2d 370 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and has emphasized that &quot;maximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations [is] to be promoted by the act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 651-52 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; By promoting prompt public access to government records, the CPRA is &quot;intended to safeguard the accountability of government to the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Register Div. of Freedom Newspapers Inc. v. County of Orange, 158 Cal. App. 3d 893, 901, 205 Cal. Rptr. 92 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; As the California Supreme Court recognized in CBS v. Block:

{{quote|Implicit in a democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 651.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public records and exemptions==
In accordance with this policy, public records are broadly defined to include &quot;any writing containing information relating to the conduct of a public's business prepared, owned, used or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristic[.]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't. Code § 6252(e).&lt;/ref&gt; Citing with approval an even broader definition of public records adopted by the California Attorney General, another court has stated:

{{quote|This definition is intended to cover every conceivable kind of record that is involved in the governmental process and will pertain to any new form of record-keeping instrument as it is developed. Only purely personal information unrelated to 'the conduct of the public's business' could be considered exempt from this definition, i.e., the shopping list phoned from home, the letter to a public officer from a friend which is totally void of reference to governmental activities.&lt;ref&gt;San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court, 143 Cal. App. 3d 762, 774; 192 Cal. Rptr. 415, 422 (1983)(internal citations omitted); see also Versaci v. Superior Court, 127 Cal. App. 4th 805, 813, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 92 (2005)(quoting Coronado Police Officers Ass'n v. Carroll, 106 Cal. App. 4th 1001, 1006, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 553 (2003)(citing with approval same definition)).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moreover, unless the public records of a local agency are exempt from the provisions of the CPRA, they must be made available for public inspection.&lt;ref&gt;Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337, 346, 19 Cal. Rptr. 2d 882, 852 P.2d 377 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  Exemptions must be narrowly construed and the public agency bears the burden of proving that an exemption applies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakersfield City School Dist. v. Superior Court, 118 Cal. App. 4th 1041, 1045, 13 Cal. Rptr. 3d 517 (2004); CSU Fresno Association v. Superior Court, 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 831, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 870 (2001); see also Lorig v. Medical Bd., 78 Cal. App. 4th 462, 467, 92 Cal. Rptr. 2d 862 (2000); County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court, 82 Cal. App. 4th 819, 825, 98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 564 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the exemptions under the CPRA are set forth under Section 6254 and are specific as to certain records or types of records, but under Section 6255 a general exemption exists where, on the facts of the particular case, &quot;the public interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6255 (commonly called the &quot;catch all&quot; exemption).&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the propriety of an agency decision to withhold records, a court is charged with ascertaining whether nondisclosure was justified under either of these statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6259(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the CPRA was modeled after the federal Freedom of Information Act (&quot;FOIA&quot;), 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq, courts may look to case law under FOIA in construing the CPRA.&lt;ref&gt;See Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, 53 Cal. 3d 1325, 1338, 283 Cal. Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240 (1991); ACLU v. Deukmejian, 32 Cal. 3d 440, 447, 186 Cal. Rptr. 235, 651 P.2d 822 (1982); but see Williams, 5 Cal. 4th at 348-54 (holding that CPRA's exemption for law enforcement investigatory records did not incorporate FOIA criteria and thus courts cannot look to FOIA cases to interpret Section 6254(f) of the CPRA, but must look to the statutory language of the CPRA provision to construe the statute).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orders and appeals==
To facilitate prompt public access to public records, court orders either directing disclosure of public records or supporting an agency's decision of nondisclosure are immediately reviewable by an appellate court by way of an emergency petition seeking issuance of an extraordinary writ.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6259(c).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the California Supreme Court made clear that under this writ procedure, trial court orders are reviewable on their merits.&lt;ref&gt;Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1336; see also State Bd. of Equalization v. Superior Court, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1177, 1185, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d 342 (1992) (echoing the decision in Times Mirror and stating that the scope of review by a writ of review is equivalent with the scope of review on appeal).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a trial court order under the CPRA is reviewed by an appellate court, the independent review standard is employed for legal issues and factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if they are based on substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1336 (citing Block, 42 Cal. 3d at 650-51).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Mandatory referendum */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
In California, a ballot is a proposed law that is submitted to the electorate for approval in a direct vote (or plebiscite). It may take the form of a constitutional amendment or an ordinary statute. A ballot proposition may be proposed by the California State Legislature or by a petition signed by members of the public under the initiative system. In California a vote on a measure referred to voters by the legislature is a mandatory referendum; a vote to veto a law that has already been adopted by the legislature is an optional referendum or &quot;people's veto&quot;; the process of proposing laws by petition is the initiative.

==Overview==

Referenda have been a part of the Constitution of California since 1849. The initiative and optional (or facultative) referendum were introduced in 1911, by a constitutional amendment called California Proposition 7 (1911). There are three forms of direct democracy in California.

===Mandatory referendum===

The State Legislature may pass an act which is signed by the Governor of California, proposing a state constitutional amendment, which is then submitted to the voters as a referendum at the next statewide election. If more than 50% of the voters approve the referendum then the constitutional amendment is approved and goes into effect.

===Optional referendum===

Laws already adopted by the state legislature may be vetoed by means of a referendum. To qualify a referendum for inclusion on the ballot, a referendum petition must have been signed by at least five per cent of the number of voters in the previous gubernatorial election. This is also known as a &quot;petition referendum&quot; or &quot;people's veto&quot;.

===Initiative===

A ballot proposition enacted by the initiative process may alter the State constitution, or amend the ordinary laws of the state, or do both. An initiative is brought about by writing a proposed law as a petition, and submitting the petition to the [[California Attorney General along with a submission fee (in 2004 this was $200), and obtaining signatures on petitions from registered voters amounting to 8% (for a constitutional amendment) or 5% (for a statute) of the number of people who voted in the most recent election for governor.  The signed petitions are then sent to the Secretary of State of California for validation of signatures.

Due to duplicate signing or invalid signatures, usually at least 50% more than the legal minimum number of signatures are collected to compensate for possible invalidated signatures.  If the number of validated signatures is more than the minimum number required, the proposed initiative measure is submitted to the voters, similar to a referendum as noted above.  If the proposition is approved by more than 50% of all voters who vote, it becomes a part of the state constitution (if it is a proposed amendment) or the state's statutes (if it is a proposed statute) in the same manner and having the same legal effect as if it had been passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor.

In order to pass, the &quot;yes&quot; votes on a proposition must exceed the &quot;no&quot; votes. Ballots which record neither a &quot;yes&quot; nor a &quot;no&quot; on the proposition are ignored in determining the outcome. In other words, the majority of voters required for passage refers to a majority of those voting on that proposition, rather than a majority of those voting in the election held at the same time or a majority of those who are registered to vote.

Originally, initiative and referendum petitions were given a number starting at one each year.  This tended to be confusing as often famous initiatives such as California Proposition 13(of 1978) might be confused with another initiative in a later year if there were more than twelve proposals on the ballot in any given year.  Starting in 1982, the proposition numbers were not re-used but would continue to increment until at least a decade had passed from when a particular one had appeared on the ballot, eventually resulting in proposition numbers exceeding 200.  Starting with the 1998 ballot, the count has been reset back to one; it will now be reset every ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;California Attorney General's Office&quot;&gt;[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/initiative-guide.htm California Attorney General's Office] Initiative Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nutshell|Government agencies have formal provision for public comment in response to proposed rules and finalization of official reports as well as opportunities to address agencies as part of public meetings. Various customs and rules apply at Federal, state, county, regional,inter-agency and local levels of executive, legislative and judicial branches, but they are all integral parts of  free speech provisions of constitutional democracy.}}

==Introduction==
'''Public comment''' is a specific term of art used by various government agencies in the United States, a constitutional democracy, in several circumstances. It is sometimes called &quot;''vox populi''&quot;. Generally these circumstances are open public meetings of government bodies which set aside time for oral public comments, or comments, usually upon documents. Such documents may either be reports such as Draft Environmental Impact Reports (DEIR's) or new regulations. There is typically a notice which is posted on the web and mailed to more or less ad hoc lists of interested parties known to the government agencies. If there is to be a change of regulations, there will be a formal notice of proposed rulemaking. &lt;P&gt;The basis for public comment is found in general political theory of constitutional democracy as originated during and after the French Enlightenment, particularly by Rousseau &lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jaques Rousseau, The Social Contract, late 1700's, Public Domain&lt;/ref&gt;. This basis was elaborated in the American Revolution, and various thinkers such as Franklin, Jefferson &lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Independence, Jefferson et al, 1776&lt;/ref&gt;and Thomas Paine &lt;Ref&gt; Common Sense, Thomas Paine, late 1700's, public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;are associated with the rejection of tyrannical, closed government decision making in favor of open government. The tradition of the New England Town Hall is believed to be rooted in this early American movement, and the distillation of formal public comment in official proceedings is a direct application of this format in the workings of public administration itself. 

==Overview: The Two Types of Public Comment==

Public comment embedded in actual meetings is typical of meetings convened by legislative or executive bodies; judicial units do not have public comment, but rather testimony from witnesses and procedural statements from attorneys. Public units such as city councils or county legislative bodies are typical examples of legislative public comment hearing bodies. Note that comment may be written, oral, or electronic. 

There are two types of comment period. One is when comment goes to a specific agenda item. Secondly there is a class of public comment which pertains to items which are not on the agenda for that day. However, it is necessary that comments be restricted to matters within the jurisdiction of the government body.

This latter requirement is seldom enforced except in those unusual cases in which commentators have set themselves at odds with policy makers and have been designated as a nuisance. In such cases, there are usually more explicit reasons given for restricting the rights of such speakers, however most undesirable comments tend to be outside the scope of legislative jurisdiction. The above distinction between agenda-item public comment and what is called &quot;General Public Comment&quot; pertains both to legislative type bodies as well as executive agencies. These are typically commissions, committees or boards. There are typically public comment periods during meetings of agencies such as city councils, county boards, and agencies which are concerned with matters such as water quality, fish and game, sewer runoff management and transportation. Time limits frequently range from one to five minutes for unscheduled presentations. It is not typical to require that the person commenting be a resident, a registered voter, a qualified elector, or even a citizen, simply that they be present and able to speak.

A whole different class of public comment is requested by agencies which are seeking input on draft policy documents such as Environmental Impact Reports which provide information which may be used in policy determinations by their own agency and other agencies at various levels of government.Typically there is a notice of completion of the draft which is posted in the newspaper, on the web, and is mailed to known interested parties who may be designated as &quot;stakeholders&quot; or simply &quot;interested parties&quot;. A public comment period is established and comments which are received by the cutoff date become part of the official public record. In some cases, there is a statutory mandate that those comments be replied to or incorporated in some fashion into the Final document.

==Oral public comment at public meetings ==

Comments provided at public meetings may be oral or written and not infrequently utilize audio visual aids such as thumb drives, CDs or overhead projectors (transparencies or opaque material). They may include video clips. A laser pointer, such as used by professional presenters, is useful but seldom utilized except by scheduled presenters on preset agendas, who are often credentialed professionals hired by the government agency to produce reports or provide consultation.

Public comment in some cases includes remarks from experts or public officials with some role in the issue at stake, but at a different time or level of process. Typically these kinds of comments may be ad hoc, not solicited by the governing agency which is conducting the hearing. There may be informal expectation that such a party may comment, but if it is an interested agency then there will be prior notification and a larger chunk of time may be allowed to such presenters. Surprisingly, however, these knowledgeable high level speakers, including office holders, often are limited to the same time constriction and queuing requirements as all other public commentors. They simply wait in line, their name is called when their speaker slip happens to come to the top of the pile, and they are subject to being cut off after their two minutes or three minutes are up.This equalization between expert and lay commentator is an example of social leveling which occurs in democratic process and which is often harshly criticized by elitist theorists such as Machiavellians, fascists, communist technocrats and other conservative social thinkers.

Persons preparing public comment often think about and express the value of the constitutional protection and a certain level of gratitude for the opportunity to speak. Such expressions are considered good etiquette the first few times a speaker presents to a board, and it is also common to state one's background, credentials, or interest. Persons who speak frequently to a particular agency become better known and typically refrain from repeating such formalities to excess, and may go directly into their substantive testimony.

==Variation of official attitude toward public meeting comment ==

In constitutional democracies which permit public comment, meeting facilitators can be relaxed, friendly and informal, allowing for errors on the part of public speakers such as exceeding allowable time. In some cases they are strict in enforcement of rules and may make somewhat hostile remarks to speakers. This attitude may be a result of prior episodes in which public commenters may have expressed accusations or hostility to seated officials. Frequently, such remarks result in warnings and may escalate to the point that the meeting chair may not recognize the public speaker and refuse to allow access to the microphone. Less frequently, speakers who are out of order are ordered to leave, escorted out of the building, or, rarely, placed under arrest for trespass or other charges. However, most government agencies in the United States are reluctant to resort to such measures, which may be viewed as restricting free speech protection of the US and various state constitutions. They may also result in litigation and in some cases do. For instance, Robert Norse filed suit against the City of Santa Cruz when he made a Nazi style straight arm salute to the Santa Cruz City Council as a protest for council not permitting one additional public speaker who had not put in a speaker's slip and would have exceeded the amount of time allowed for public comment. The suit, typical of a possible consequence of not permitting public comment, is based upon Title 42 Section 1983 of the US Code, and alleges that city council violated his First Amendment right to free speech by having him arrested for refusing to leave as ordered in response to his gesture. &lt;ref&gt;Norse vs. City of Santa Cruz, US District Court, North Central District, Public Record&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states and regions may differ widely in their policies and procedures with regard to public comment, ranging from the extremes of anarchist collectives in twentieth century Spain, in which many routine decisions were made by workers councils, to dictatorships in which making a comment on the performance of government officials can be proscribed by law as tantamount to slander or provoking insurrection. In such systems, even the very idea of exposure to risk of prosecution deters the flow of information needed for the system's self rationalization process, resulting in stifled innovation, accumulated inefficiencies, decline of group morale and trust levels, with  eventual system collapse.

Liberalized systems also typically proscribe slander, fabrications and personal attacks, however defined, and public commenters are discouraged from engaging in back and forth discussion with board or committee members. Comments which are directed from the floor towards persons who have the floor are generally classified as heckling.

==Public comment in authoritarian systems==
Authoritarian systems generally tend to take a dim view of public comment. In the writings of Benito Mussolini, he expressed the view that fascism offers &quot;free&quot; speech, but only to persons who were &quot;qualified&quot; to have an opinion.&lt;ref&gt; Readings on Fascism and National Socialism Selected by members of the department of philosophy, University of Colorado Contents The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini&lt;/ref&gt;Similarly, in the historical development of Nazism, public commentators at official NSDAP rallies were not infrequently beaten by the mob, or, if there were large numbers supporting the adverse commentator, brawls broke out. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Goebbels&quot; by Ralf Georg Reuth&lt;/ref&gt;today's People's Republic of China, public comment on government policy is considered inappropriate, and may result in long prison terms for persons such as Wei Jin Sheng.

==Public comment as an aid to editing of government publications==

As indicated above, there is a separate and distinct form of public comment, in the US, does not occur at meetings but is solicited in written or electronic form prior to a set deadline. This type of comment may pertain to an intended action, such as permit issuance, or the classification of a particular species of plant or animal as endangered. Other instances occur with regard to publication of draft environmental impact reports, which comments are then answered and may be reflected in subsequent revisions to the document. These public comments are often posted on the web in advance of the deadline, which provides commentators with an opportunity to view the remarks of others before committing themselves in writing. 

This type of comment process may be mandated in legislation or in regulations enforcing statutes such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) or California's Cxxxx Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Triggering events may include development proposals, mandated master plan updates or discovery of an endangered species. The NIH requested and received massive public comment pertaining to its own openness to its generally sophisticated public, and they did a thorough job of analyzing the voluminous submissions which is posted on their website. &lt;ref&gt;http://publicaccess.nih.gov/analysis_of_comments_nih_public_access_policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A government portal which may be useful allows review of comments and opportunity for making comment and can be searched by keyword&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regulations.gov/#!home&lt;/ref&gt;.
The keyword search crosses different government agencies and has drop-downs permitting a boolean exclusion algorithm narrowing the focus between alternative choices such as documents, rules, notice of proposed rule changes, etcetera.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Marine Life Protection Act''' (MLPA) was passed in 1999 and is part of the California Fish and Game Code. The MLPA requires California to reevaluate all existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and potentially design new MPAs that together function as a statewide network. The MLPA has clear guidance associated with the development of this MPA network. MPAs are developed on a regional basis with MLPA and MPA specific goals in mind, and are evaluated over time to assess their effectiveness for meeting these goals.

==Overview==
Unlike terrestrial conservation, marine conservation often lacks a systematic approach to conserving biodiversity&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;&gt;Gleason, Mary G. et al. 2006. Assessing gaps in marine conservation in California. ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment''. 4: 249-258.&lt;/ref&gt;. Little gap analysis has been performed on the marine environment, and there is a lack of knowledge into what is protected, what needs to be protected, and where the protection needs to occur&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;.  Over the last century there has been a rapid increase in the loss of marine biodiversity and habitat degradation. About 70% of California's population lives within one hour of the coast and the ocean provides resources to local, state, and national interests. As a result, species and habitat loss has become a major issue. Over 90% of California's coastal wetlands have been lost, coastal waters have become contaminated with a variety of urban and agricultural toxins, and a large number of targeted species have declined in the last 10–20 years&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;. Over the last two decades, California fish catches have decreased by over 50%&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;&gt;Avasthi, Amitabh. 2005. California tries to connect its scattered marine reserves. ''Science''. 305: 487-489.&lt;/ref&gt;. These impacts have decreased the health and value of the California's coastal ocean and imply a need for a more systematic approach to marine conservation&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;&gt;Avasthi, Amitabh. 2005. California tries to connect its scattered marine reserves. ''Science''. 305: 487-489.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although there is no single solution to conserving the marine environment, MPAs are a potentially valuable tool for marine conservation when designed and managed effectively. A well designed and managed network of MPAs helps to prevent degradation, fosters marine biodiversity, and may maintain a more sustainable fishing industry&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. The MLPA helps to promote a shift from single-species management to an ecosystem based management and is a more systematic approach to marine conservation.

==A Brief History of California MPAs==
California’s first six MPAs were created between 1909 and 1913; by 1950 all had been removed. After 1950 more than 50 other MPAs were created along the California coast. But these MPAs were established in a random manner and without regard to regional conservation goals&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2004. Marine Life Protection Act: sections 2850-2863. Sacramento, CA: California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region.&lt;/ref&gt;. Most have been thought to be too small and ineffective in protecting against habitat and species loss&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2004. Marine Life Protection Act: sections 2850-2863. Sacramento, CA: California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region.&lt;/ref&gt;. With these existing MPAs less than 1% of coastal waters were protected, and none extended to deeper waters&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;. In 1999 the MLPA was created in order to re-evaluate the current MPA system and to establish a better network of MPAs that would be more effective in protecting against habitat and species loss.

==The Marine Life Protection Act==
[http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/mlpa_language.pdf The Marine Life Protection Act language as amended to July 2004] 
===MLPA Findings===
The MLPA found that existing MPAs were not created under a coherent plan or scientific guidelines, and that there is a need to redesign the MPA system. Coastal development, water pollution, and other human activities are a threat to California’s diverse coastal waters. These coastal waters, along with the ecosystems and species which thrive within them are vital assets to the state and nation. An improved MPA system would help protect against habitat and ecosystem loss, conserve biological diversity, provide safe breeding grounds for fish and other marine species, improve research opportunities, create a reference point from which the rest of the ocean can be compared against, and may help to re-grow depleted fisheries&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG&quot;/&gt;.

===MPA Network===
The MLPA appointed the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) with the task of developing and managing a network of MPAs. The CDFG determines the final location and size of each MPA. The goal is to establish a network of MPAs that work together. This network takes into account the movement of adult and larval fish and also focuses on deepwater habitats for the first time&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. A proportion of the MPA network is to be designated as no-take zones. No-take zones allow for a large area of safe breeding grounds and a sanctuary for large, female fish. Large female fish produce more viable offspring and are vital in a population&lt;ref name=&quot;Palumi&quot;&gt;Palumbi, S.R. 2004. Why Mothers Matter. ''Nature'' 430: 621-622.&lt;/ref&gt;. With this idea, the MPA network has the potential to boost fish populations in areas out side of MPAs. Fishery growth has been successful along the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary after reserves were established in these areas&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. The final decision of the size and location of the MPAs depends on the species and habitats effected, stakeholder and conservation goals, and how each individual MPA will function on its own and as part of the network.

===MLPA Implementation===
After its passage in 1999, the CDFG began to implement the MLPA. The first attempt involved a Master Plan Team which included primarily scientific experts and governmental agencies, with little input from local [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Weible&quot;&gt;Weible, Christopher. et al. 2004. A comparison of a collaborative and top-down approach to the use of science in policy: establishing marine protected areas in California. ''The Policies Study Journal''. 32: 187-207.
&lt;/ref&gt;. This plan failed once it was brought to the public for approval, mostly because stakeholders and other members of the public were excluded from the process. Commercial and recreational fishers showed the most resistance, stating that MPAs produce no benefits for fisheries and objecting to the size and location of the proposed MPAs&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weible&quot;&gt;Weible, Christopher. et al. 2004. A comparison of a collaborative and top-down approach to the use of science in policy: establishing marine protected areas in California. ''The Policies Study Journal''. 32: 187-207.
&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2002, the CDFG implemented the MLPA for a second time. This plan involved members from the Master Plan Team, as well as seven Working Stakeholder Groups, which included governmental agency officials, recreational and commercial fishing interests, recreational divers, ocean vessel representatives, environmental interests, charter boat operators, harbormasters, and scientists/educators&lt;ref name=&quot;Weible&quot;&gt;Weible, Christopher. et al. 2004. A comparison of a collaborative and top-down approach to the use of science in policy: establishing marine protected areas in California. ''The Policies Study Journal''. 32: 187-207.
&lt;/ref&gt;. This attempt was more successful and gained public support, but the project lost funding in 2003 due to a poor fiscal year. 

In 2004 the CDFG gained new funding from several organizations to initiate the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The Initiative divided the coast into sequential regions and assembled a Blue Ribbon Task Force on Marine Protected Areas, Science Advisory Team, and Regional Stakeholder Group to develop and evaluate the first set of MPAs in the Central Coast region&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. On April 13, 2007, after nearly three years of public meetings and proposal reviews, the Fish and Game Commission evaluated and voted on a final MPA proposal for the Central California coast. The commission voted on a plan to establish 29 MPAs covering approximately 204 square miles (18%) of state waters with 85 square miles (8%) designated as no-take state marine reserves&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG 2007&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2007. Marine Life Protection Act initiative: commission gives final approval for Central Coast marine protected areas. [http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/ccmpas.html]. Viewed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. The network ranges from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County south to Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, and contains several types of MPAs with varying degrees of protection. Central coast MPA regulations will be effective starting summer 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG 2007&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2007. Marine Life Protection Act initiative: commission gives final approval for Central Coast marine protected areas. [http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/ccmpas.html]. Viewed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Central Coast plan has received high marks for scientific effectiveness.  Local stakeholders developed a balanced network that protects the region’s best habitat, including parts of the Big Sur Coast and Monterey Bay, while allowing continued access to most recreational and commercial fishing grounds.  California’s new Central Coast MPAs went into effect in September 2007 and scientific baseline data has been collected over the last two years.

The North Central Coast plan, adopted by the Fish and Game Commission on August 5, 2009, also represented a compromise between different interest groups, and protected iconic sites like the Farallon Islands, Point Reyes Headlands, and Bodega Head while leaving nearly 90 percent of coastal waters open for fishing.  Regulations for the North Central Coast MPAs, which extend from Alder Creek, near Pt. Arena in Mendocino County, to Pigeon Point in San Mateo County, went into effect on May 1, 2010. The regulations established 21 marine protected areas (MPAs), three State Marine Recreational Management Areas, and six special closures, in total covering approximately 153 square miles (20.1%) of state waters in the north central coast study region. Approximately 86 square miles (11%) of the 153 square miles are designated as &quot;no take&quot; state marine reserves, while different take allowances providing varying levels of protection are designated for the rest.

In 2008, South Coast Regional Stakeholders began a public planning process to design the part of the statewide MPA network that spans from Pt. Conception in Santa Barbara county to the U.S. border with Mexico. On Dec. 15, 2010 the CA Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations to create 36 new MPAs encompassing approximately 187 square miles (8 percent) of state waters in the study region. Approximately 116 square miles (4.9 percent) have been designated as no-take state marine reserves (82.5 square miles/3.5 percent) and no-take state marine conservation areas (33.5 square miles/1.4 percent), with the remainder designated as state marine conservation areas with different take allowances and varying levels of protection. Implementation of the new South Coast MPAs will take place in mid 2011.

The North Coast region, which stretches from Point Arena to the Oregon border, concluded the stakeholder planning process in August 2010.  Stakeholders developed a unified proposal for their regional MPA network supported by fishermen, conservationists, and tribal representatives.  The unified plan will be considered by the Fish and Game Commission beginning in 2011.

===The Science===
An extensive body of peer-reviewed studies on marine protected areas have concluded that well-designed networks of protected waters are effective in improving ocean health and making ocean waters more resilient&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern&quot;&gt;Halpern, Benjamin S. et al. 2010.  Placing marine protected areas onto the ecosystem-based management seascape. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Most recently, the February 2010 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) included several new studies that showed that scientifically-based MPA networks have a net positive impact on both ecosystem productivity and associated fisheries. One of the studies found that such well-designed networks can simultaneously improve the quality of ocean habitat, increase the size and abundance of sea life, and increase fishing yields and profits. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot;&gt;Gaines, Steven. et al. 2010.

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have stressed the importance of location: The location of protected areas is important. In order to be effective, marine reserves must be placed in the areas where fish and shellfish feed and breed&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern&quot;&gt;Halpern, Benjamin S. et al. 2010.

===MLPA Controversy / Conflict of Interest Investigation===
The MLPA Initiative recently began to receive negative press from fishing rights groups and individual fishermen due to the apparent conflict of interest of some MPA officials and unfair practices in the MLPA process&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland&quot;&gt;Richard Holland. 2009. Rules Disregarded, Changed. [http://www.wonews.com/Blog.aspx?id=608&amp;AuthorID=59062&amp;t=BLATANT%20FRAUD]. Viewed 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;. On May 14, 2009, Fish and Game Commission Member Jim Kellogg called for the Commission to put the MLPA process on hold due to the state budget crisis. Senate Majority Leader Dean Florez and North Coast Assemblyman Wes Chesbro requested investigation into conflicts of interest among Blue Ribbon Task Force members as well as sources of funding for the MLPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy Bay&quot;&gt;Indy Bay. 2009.

On May 19, 2009, the California Fair Political Practices Commission (CFPPC) disclosed that the Enforcement Division of the Fair Political Practices Commission has started a formal investigation into Fish and Game Commissioner George Michael Sutton, under charge of having violated the Political Reform Act (PRA) of 1974 due his conflicts of interest on votes on the MLPA while serving on the Fish and Game Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earthtimes.org&quot;&gt;Earth Times. 2009.

On June 24, after investigating the matter, the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) declared that Commissioner Sutton can participate in any and all public processes and deliberations surrounding the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) without conflict.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== MPLA process winds up ===

Despite staunch opposition from fishermen whose livelihood might be impacted, the final brushstrokes were put on the MPLA process at the Santa Barbara meeting in late 2010. Despite signifigant input from the industry, many of the provisions would apparently impact economically viable fisheries. Representatives indicated that they intend to file litigation with respect to one or more possible improprieties in the process. On the other hand, many contended that there was an unprecedented level of public involvement which provides a solid foundation of legitimation of the process.

Much of the criticism centered on putative irregularities with respect to the Blue Ribbon committee of experts. Specifically, it is alleged by many that the commission did not conform to the Brown Act and conducted some of its activities via informal meetings which nevertheless did cover public policy matters which the Act would require to have been public. The other side contends that there were never substantive disposition of issues at any such contacts and that they never met in quorum. 

It remains to be seen to what extent the industry will shrug off lingering resentment of the imperfections in the process and the outcome and to what extent there may be continuing litigation, non-compliance, or attempts to repeal or modify the MPLA as enacted. There are some who argue that the management of fisheries will benefit the industry long term, and possibly that viewpoint will gain traction going forward. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is significant disatisfaction within the fishing towns and it is unclear whether those views will taper or increase as the 2011 election season approaches. 

Much was said of the putative involvement of &quot;Hewlett Packard money&quot; and there is a perception that environmental interests are well funded by endowments of various kinds which are insensitive to the needs or working people. Sentiment against environmentalism runs high even in communities which pride themselves on maintaining high standards with respect to environmental stewardship. A similar dynamic occurs with respect to Coastal Commission regulation, in which agricultural interest bitterly contest permitting requirements which constrain crop rotation. 

If environmental successes provoke significant backlash, they may find many of their gains being reversed if the State Legislature switches to Republican, or if Democratic party leaders mitigate their environmental policies. It will be interesting to note to what extent political campaigns in 2011 bring out dissatisfaction with environmental controls such as the MLPA. Some business interests, such as residential realtors and tourism, are solidly in support of environmentalism. When the campaign dollars flow, perhaps those kinds of businesses will support candidates with strong Sierra Club endorsements, offsetting loss of votes and financial support such candidates may receive from fishing, agriculture and developers.

The '''Independent Media Center''' (a.k.a. '''Indymedia''' or '''IMC''') is a global Open publishing|participatory network of journalists that report on political and social issues. It originated during the Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999 and remains closely associated with the global justice movement, which criticizes neo-liberalism and its associated institutions. Indymedia uses an open publishing and democratic media process that allows anybody to contribute.

According to its homepage, &quot;Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage. Indymedia is a democratic media outlet for the creation of radical, accurate, and passionate tellings of truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml Indymedia global home page]&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was founded as an alternative to government and corporate media, and seeks to facilitate people being able to publish their media as directly as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanni&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Tanni|date=1 July 2007|title=Do citizen-based media of communication advance public journalism's ideals?

==Overview==
The first Indymedia project was started in late November 1999 to report on protests against the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meeting that took place in Seattle, Washington|Seattle, Washington (U.S. state)|Washington, and to act as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattle.indymedia.org/en/1999/11/2.shtml First ever Indymedia post, made November 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} This followed a successful experiment in June that year, reporting the events of the Carnival Against Capitalism in London, UK. The Media team there used software and unmediated reports from protest participants.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, &quot;June 18th 1999 Carnival Against Capital&quot;, in Days of Dissent!, 2004, accessed online at http://web.archive.org/web/20050508150407/daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The open publishing script was first developed by video activists in Sydney, Australia.

After Seattle the idea and network spread rapidly. By 2002, there were 89 Indymedia websites covering 31 countries (and the Palestinian territories),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indymedia.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020901125639/http://indymedia.org/ |archivedate=2002-09-01 |title= Wayback Machine - indymedia.org circa September 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-04-05 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; growing to over 150 by January 2006, not all of them currently active. Indymedia websites publish in a number of languages, including English, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Russian, Arabic and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.indymedia.org/Global/FrequentlyAskedQuestionEn#languages |date=25 July 2007|title=Indymedia's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  |publisher=Indymedia Documentation Project |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMC collectives distribute Printing|print, sound reproduction|audio, photo, and video media, but are most well known for their open publishing newswires, sites where anyone with internet access can publish news from their own perspective. The content of an IMC is determined by its participants, both the users who post content, and members of the local Indymedia collective who administer the site. While Indymedias worldwide are run autonomously and differ according to the concerns of their users, they share a commitment to provide copyleft content. The general rule is that content on Indymedia sites can be freely reproduced for non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity IMC &quot;Principles of Unity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indymedia sites run on a number of free software platforms, many developed especially for the purpose; these include DadaIMC, Mir, Oscait, Active, SF-Active, Activismo, Drupal and Plone (software)|Plone.

==Content and focus==

The origins of IMCs themselves came out of protests against the concentrated ownership and perceived biases in corporate media reporting. The first IMC node, attached as it was to the Seattle anti-corporate globalization protests, was seen by activists as an alternative news source to that of the corporate media, which they accused of only showing violence and confrontation, and portraying all protesters negatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991223&amp;slug=A19991224010135&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991218&amp;slug=3002212&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/22220_gag09.shtml?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=1732 Media center fighting FBI over Web data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/19980_security24.shtml FBI raids media center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/wto091.shtml An overflow crowd vents its anger at city, police&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratical.org///////////////co-globalize/NLG-REPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, between 1999 and 2001, IMC newswires tended to be focused on up-to-the-minute coverage of protests, from local Demonstration (people)|demonstrations to Summit (meeting)|summits where anti-globalization movement protests were occurring. In 2007, this was still the case,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but some IMCs are attempting to broaden their coverage to include more of what &quot;traditional&quot; journalism ignores.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Print projects===
There have been a number of print-based projects under the Indymedia banner, including short-run papers and longer-running newspapers. New York City IMC has produced The Indypendent, a bi-weekly &quot;free paper for free people&quot; for over five years. Winner of numerous awards from the Independent Press Association for original writing, photography, design and art, the Indypendent is currently the most widely circulated underground paper in North America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} During the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, the Indypendent printed hundreds of thousands of copies and briefly attained a mass circulation. Contentious issues have included consistent editorial practices, commercial advertising and a diversity of perspectives rare among radical publications. Short-run papers for protests have included the Unconvention during the Philadelphia &quot;R2K&quot; protests during the 2000 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention in 2000. Other newspapers include the Bay Area's Fault Lines (newsmagazine)|Fault Lines, and papers in Connecticut, Maine, Baltimore and St. Louis in the United States, as well as in Wellington, New Zealand.

===Radio projects===
They have a global radio project, which aggregates audio RSS feeds from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.indymedia.org/|title= Radio Indymedia|publisher=radio.indymedia.org|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video project===
They produce a regular DVD magazine, called newsreal, in the US, Europe and Australia.

Some of their footage has been used in evidence in several court cases, e.g. 27th G8 summit|Genoa.

==Organizational structure==
===Local===
Image:Indymedia Cuiabá.jpg|300px|thumb|Indymedia collective at Mato Grosso Federal University in Cuiabá, Brazil hosting a free radio broadcast in 2004.
Local IMC collectives are expected to be open and inclusive of individuals from a variety of different local anti-capitalist point of view (literature)|points of view, whether or not these have any definite political philosophy, so that even those without internet access can participate in both content creation and in content consumption. Editorial policies, locally chosen by any Indymedia collective, generally involve removing articles which the Indymedia editors believe promote racism, sexism, hate speech, and homophobia.&lt;ref name=principles&gt;

|last=Shine
|first=Simon
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; All Indymedia collectives are expected to have a locally chosen, thoroughly discussed and clearly stated editorial policy for posts to their website.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

===Global===
The overall Indymedia network is decentralized to the extent that the local IMCs operate independently once they are authenticated into the IMC network. The process of admission into the IMC network is somewhat centralized but is relatively relaxed and transparent compared to the occasionally contentious disputes within local IMCs and has not generated a great deal of criticism. Local IMC collectives vary widely in their openness, editorial policies and tolerance of different viewpoints. Along with the locally-organised collectives are IMC websites dealing with particular topics (such as biotechnology) or for different media (such as video). Along with contributing their own media, core organizers maintain IMC's open publishing infrastructure, enabling different people throughout the internet to publish their news. IMC editing is done by a system of layered admin which contributors apply to join for each site, by participating on open email lists and attending open meetings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

As an example of different models for collective internal organizing, the DC IMC (one of the older IMCs in the network) became a Coop with dues with a workshop/office, now closed.  In contrast, other IMC local collectives are without any formally-defined membership and have minimal organizational structure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Some IMC memberships require its members to sign a mission statement – not every IMC has a formalized policy. Some collectives do ban members for repeated rules violations. Some feel that membership includes only those actively doing organizing or other IMC work, while some feel that it actually extends to every IMC contributor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Funding===
IMCs tend to be funded solely by donations of money and equipment from individuals. In maintaining its independence and anti-corporate stance, Indymedia has had struggles with funding issues. For example, in September 2002, the Ford Foundation proposed funding for an Indymedia regional meeting{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. This was ultimately refused because many volunteers, especially some from IMC Argentina, were uncomfortable with accepting money from the Foundation, which some believe to be linked to the CIA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Reputation==
Image:Indymed2.jpg|300px|thumb|Indymedia workshop
Indymedia has a variable reputation, both among its users and outside critics.
Indymedia has been criticized for adopting a position hostile to the interests of capital, others believe that this is the purpose of the media. Its editorial policy on feature selection and hiding or deletion of articles has been criticized of being biased in certain topic areas, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some critics argue that since anyone can publish with little to no editorial process, unsubstantiated allegations and conspiracy theories are often published as fact, along with inaccurate articles and content that can offend.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In its favor, Indymedia is an alternative to corporate media. Its operations are conducted by activists around the world, who, though they may be lacking in journalistic training and corporate funding, tend to make up for this with enthusiasm for reporting issues of social justice and unique related events, which in their view, the corporate media under-reports or Project Censored|censors. For example, the Bolivian Gas War in 2003 was virtually unheard of in the US media, while it received extensive worldwide and multilingual reporting through Indymedia. Another example is the February 15, 2003 anti-war protest in many US and European cities, which received detailed coverage written by its participants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

While Indymedia has global aspirations, the vast majority of IMCs are in North America, Latin America and Europe. Although the Middle East is an area of considerable interest to Indymedia, there are only three IMCs in the region, located in Beirut, Lebanon; Cyprus and Israel, although there was a Palestine IMC in Jerusalem between 2001 and 2003. The Lebanon center is one of three IMCs in Muslim nations; the other two are in Jakarta, Indonesia and Istanbul, Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Temporary removal from Google News searches===
In early May 2003, after receiving numerous complaints about newswire stories that referred to the Israeli military (Israel Defence Forces|IDF) as &quot;Zionazi forces&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/11403/index.php example of Newswire posting using the term &quot;Zionazi forces&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or to Israelis as &quot;Zionazis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2003/02/52318.html example of Newsire posting using the term &quot;Zionazi&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Google temporarily stopped including some IMCs in Google News searches (many non-English IMCs remained in the search){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Google News described the term &quot;Zionazi&quot; as a &quot;degrading, hateful slur&quot; and refused to index the San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center|Bay Area IMC because it had appeared there; SF Bay Area Indymedia agreed that it &quot;could be considered hate speech&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2003/09/03/16398621.php Google News Bans SF Bay Area Indymedia Over Israel/Palestine Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt; This spawned a petition which sought to promise that content the Indymedia community finds offensive will be moderated from the front page as a matter of editorial policy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} IMCs were still included in normal Google web searches. As of October 2004, IMC articles were restored to Google News searches.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Controversy and criticism==
===Hate speech===
Naomi Klein has written, &quot;Every time I log onto activist news sites like Indymedia.org, which practice 'open publishing,' I'm confronted with a string of Jewish conspiracy theories about 9-11 and excerpts from the Protocol of the Elders of Zion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;klein&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2002/04/sharon-le-pen-and-anti-semitism|title='Sharon, Le Pen, and Anti-Semitism'|author=Naomi Klein|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open publishing has left some IMCs in Europe vulnerable to legal action or threats of Lawsuit|legal action related to questions of Defamation|libel or hate speech.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In some such cases, local IMC collectives took autonomous decisions to temporarily suspend the site while the different activist groups reorganized to find a consensual, constructive method of dealing with these problems and to increase openness and non-authoritarian organizing methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===FBI investigation===
In March 2006, the Los Angeles Times alleged that Indymedia had appeared with Food Not Bombs and the Communist Party of Texas on an Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI terrorist watchlist, revealed at a presentation at the University of Texas|University of Texas School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=2006fnb_fbii_spying Food Not Bombs, Indymedia investigated by FBI] [http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2006/03/66278.html Austin FBI Officer Says Indymedia, FNB, CP of Texas on Terrorist Watch List]&lt;/ref&gt; A reference to the 2005 IndyConference was made at the same presentation.

===Editorial policy===
Although attempts have been made to formalize global editorial standards, the autonomous and independent nature of Indymedia has meant that many IMCs prefer their own local policies. As a result, many deal with similar issues and complaints, particularly around matters of distinguishing between criticism and hateful comments (&quot;hate speech&quot;); and the criteria for selecting issues and authors for the websites' &quot;featured articles&quot;. While freedom of speech is valued by Indymedia collectives, it is rarely the overriding principle guiding editorial policy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Many IMCs now routinely remove from the front page &quot;newswire&quot; articles copied from corporate-run or state-run press sources. This policy (where implemented) is intended by those IMCs to keep Indymedia as an independent news source, rather than a blog of articles from existing news sources.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

There is generally an editorial electronic mailing list, to which questions and complaints may be directed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.indymedia.org/mailman/listinfo/imc-manila-editorial Imc-manila-editorial Info Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Servers seizures==
Indymedia has had interactions with authorities in USA and UK.

===Seizure of servers by the FBI===
On October 7, 2004, the FBI took possession of several Server (computing)|server hard drives used by a number of IMCs and hosted by US-based Rackspace Managed Hosting. The servers in question were located in the United Kingdom and managed by the British arm of Rackspace, but some 20 mainly European IMC websites were affected, and several unrelated websites were affected (including the website of a Linux distribution).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/1097089554894.html?oneclick=true FBI seizes Indymedia servers], ''Sydney Morning Herald, 2004-10-08&lt;/ref&gt; No reasons were given at first by the FBI and Rackspace for the seizure, in particular IMC was not informed. Rackspace claimed that it was banned from giving further information about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml Indymedia report]&lt;/ref&gt; Some (but not all) of the legal documents relating to the confiscation of the servers were unsealed by a Texas district court in August 2005, following legal action by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eff.org/press/releases/2005/08 EFF Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lettice, [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/03/indymedia_texas_docs_unsealed/ ''US court files reveal Italian link to Indymedia server grab''], The Register, 3rd August 2005, accessed 25th August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The documents revealed that the government never officially demanded the computer servers—the subpoena to Rackspace only requested server log files. This contradicted previous statements by the web host that it took the servers offline because the government had demanded the hardware. Thus, it is unclear whether it is correct to say the servers were seized by the FBI. The documents also contradicted Rackspace's claim that it had been ordered by the court not to discuss publicly the government's demand. The seized servers were returned on October 13, 2004.

A statement by Rackspace&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml ''FBI Seizes IMC Servers in the UK''], accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the company had been forced to comply with a court order under the procedures laid out by the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which governs international police co-operation on &quot;international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering&quot;. The investigation that led to the court order was said to have arisen outside of the U.S. Rackspace stated that they were prohibited on giving further detail. Agence France-Presse reported FBI spokesman Joe Parris,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200410/ai_n6865024 News website Indymedia says FBI seized server]&lt;/ref&gt; who said the incident was not an FBI operation, but that the subpoena had been issued at the request of the Italy|Italian and the Swiss governments. Again, no further details on specific allegations were given. UK involvement was denied in an answer given to a parliamentary question posed by Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 MP Richard Allan's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indymedia pointed out that they were not contacted by the FBI and that no specific information was released on the reasons of seizing the servers. Indymedia also sees the incident in the context of &quot;numerous attacks on independent media by the US Federal Government&quot;, including a subpoena to obtain IP logs from Indymedia at the occasion of the Republican National Conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11476prs20040830.html American Civil Liberties Union : Statement of Brian Szymanski Regarding Secret Service Investigation of Indymedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the shut-down of several community radio stations in the US by the Federal Communications Commission|FCC, and a request by the FBI to remove a post on Nantes IMC containing a photograph of alleged undercover Swiss police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi Indymedia's page on the FBI seizure]&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was condemned by the International Federation of Journalists, who stated that &quot;The way this has been done smacks more of intimidation of legitimate journalistic inquiry than crime-busting&quot; and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/more-intimidation-than-crime-busting-says-ifj-as-police-target-independent-media-network ''&quot;More Intimidation Than Crime-Busting&quot; Says IFJ As Police Target Independent Media Network''], IFJ press release, 8th October 2004, accessed 28th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was also voiced by European civil liberties organisation Statewatch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2004/oct/04uk-usa-indymedia.htm ''Was the seizure of Indymedia's servers in London unlawful or did the UK government collude?

In Italy, the federal prosecutor of Bologna Marina Plazzi confirmed that an investigation against Indymedia had been opened because of suspected &quot;support of terrorism&quot;, in the context of Italian troops in the Iraqi city of Nasiriyah. The Italian minister of justice, Roberto Castelli, has refused further details. In November 2003, 17 members of parliament belonging to the right-wing Alleanza Nazionale, including Alessandra Mussolini demanded that Indymedia be shut down. A senior AN member and government official had announced the co-operation with US authorities (AN was a member of the Italian coalition government), and AN spokesman Mario Landolfi welcomed the FBI's seizure of the Indymedia servers. Left-wing Italian politicians denounced the move and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Damiano Valgolio, ''The Censorers Trace leads to Rome and Zurich'', Junge Welt, 11th October 2004, cited at [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/112083.shtml ''Indymedia to U.S., U.K., Swiss and Italian Authorities: &quot;Hands Off Our Websites&quot;''], accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the Rackspace affair another server in the UK was seized by police in June 2005. An anonymous post on the Bristol Indymedia server, came to police attention for suggesting an &quot;action&quot; against a freight train carrying new cars as part of a protest against cars and climate change in the run up to that year's Gleneagles G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;John Leyden, ''[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/ Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server]'', The Register, 28th June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The police claimed that the poster broke the law by &quot;incitement to criminal damage&quot;, and sought access logs from the server operators.

===Other legal actions - IMC UK===
In 2005, Indymedia UK was threatened with a libel action by the US arms company EDO Corporation, for publishing articles accusing their UK branch EDO (UK) of EDO MBM Technology Ltd (who supply the US, UK, and Israel armed forces) of being 'warmongers'. Their lawyers ultimately withdrew the writ.

EDO Corporation|EDO MBM then launched a further High Court lawsuit against the protest group Smash EDO in April 2005, under anti-stalker laws, presenting as evidence articles that had been posted anonymously on Indymedia UK. Although a controversial interim injunction was imposed on this evidence, the suit collapsed without reaching a trial in early 2006.

===Other legal actions - IMC US===
On January 30, 2009, one of the system administrators of the server that hosts indymedia.us received a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana|Southern District of Indiana federal court. The subpoena asked the administrator to provide all &quot;IP addresses, times, and any other identifying information&quot; for every visitor to the site on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation [http://www.eff.org/wp/anatomy-bogus-subpoena-indymedia &quot;Anatomy of a Bogus Subpoena&quot;], Retrieved on 2009-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena also included a gag order that stated that the recipient is &quot;not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; The administrator of indymedia.us could not have provided the information because Indymedia sites generally do not keep IP address logs.

People had been demonstrating in the city since May as part of an 2006 Oaxaca protests|uprising prompted by a teachers strike. Lizbeth Cana, attorney general of Oaxaca, claimed the conflict was caused by the protesters and that the gunmen who engaged them were upset residents from the area{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.

==Social software==

The various php software that makes Indymedia, is available for download. It is released under the GPL licence. In 2006, a number of long-time Indymedia developers met at the Techmeet Summit in São Paulo, Brazil to begin work on a next-generation CMS for Indymedia, combining the efforts of the two main IMC content management systems. A prototype for the new CMS was released in 2008 and work continues on the project, coordinated at ''cms.indymedia.org''.

'''Concentration of media ownership''' (also known as '''media consolidation''' or '''media convergence''') refers to a process whereby progressively fewer individuals or organizations control increasing share of the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, 2009: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research demonstrates increasing levels of consolidation, with many media industries already highly concentrated and oligopoly,dominated by a very small number of firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Downing, John|title=The SAGE Handbook of Media Studies|publisher=SAGE|year=2004|isbn=9780761921691|page=296|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=isFAwqhITCUC&amp;pg=PA296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lorimer, Rowland &amp; Scannell, Paddy|title=Mass communications: a comparative introduction|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780719039461|pages=86–87|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5z7oAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the major media outlets are owned by a proportionately small number of conglomerates and corporations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Media concentration closely related to issues of editorial independence, media bias, and freedom of the press. In that sense, the term &quot;media consolidation&quot; is used especially by those who view such consolidation as sociologically detrimental, dangerous, or problematic.

==Debates==
Concentration of media ownership is very frequently seen as a problem of contemporary media and society.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= New Internationalist|title= Global Media |url= http://www.newint.org/issues/2001/04/01/|work= |publisher=New Internationalist |date= April 2001|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newint.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= New Internationalist|title= Ultra Concentrated Media - Facts|url= http://www.newint.org/features/2001/04/01/facts/|work= |publisher=New Internationalist |date= April 2001|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katharine Ainger&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Katharine Ainger|title= Empires of the Senseless|url= http://www.newint.org/features/2001/04/01/keynote/|work= |publisher=New Internationalist |date= April 2001|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When media ownership is concentrated in one or more of the ways mentioned above, a number of undesirable consequences follow, including the following:

*Commercially driven, ultra-powerful mass market media is primarily loyal to sponsors, i.e. advertisers and government rather than to the public interest.
*If only a few companies representing the interests of a minority elite control the public airwaves of 300 million US citizens, then calling them &quot;public airwaves&quot; is only lip service.
*Healthy, market-based competition is absent, leading to slower innovation and increased prices.

It is important to elaborate upon the issue of media consolidation and its effect upon the diversity of information reaching a particular market.  Critics of consolidation raise the issue of whether monopolistic or oligopolistic control of a local media market can be fully accountable and dependable in serving the public interest.  If, for example, only one or two media conglomerates dominate in a single market, the question is not only that of whether they will present a diversity of opinions, but also of whether they are willing to present information that may be damaging to either their advertisers or to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This despite the fact that before deregulation there were only the Big Three television networks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On the local end, reporters have often seen their stories refused or edited beyond recognition, in instances where they have unearthed potentially damaging information concerning either the media outlet's advertisers or its parent company.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

An example would be the repeated refusal of networks to air &quot;ads&quot; from anti-war advocates to liberal groups like MoveOn.org, or religious groups like the United Church of Christ, regardless of factual basis.  Journalists and their reports may be directly sponsored by parties who are the subject of their journalism leading to reports which actually favor the sponsor, have that appearance, or are simply a repetition of the sponsors opinion.  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lwr2SA5Pec]{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}

Consequently, if the companies dominating a media market choose to suppress stories that do not serve their interests, the public suffers, since they are not adequately informed of some crucial issues that may affect them.  If the only media outlets in town refuse to air a story, then the question becomes, who will?

Concern among academia rests in the notion that the purpose of the first amendment to the US constitution was to encourage a free press as political agitator evidenced by the famous quote from US President Thomas Jefferson, &quot;The only security of all is in a free press. The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to. It is necessary, to keep the waters pure.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Critics of media deregulation and the resulting concentration of ownership fear that such trends will only continue to reduce the diversity of information provided, as well as to reduce the accountability of information providers to the public.  The ultimate consequence of consolidation, critics argue, is a poorly-informed public, restricted to a reduced array of media options that offer only information that does not harm the media oligopoly's growing range of interests

For those critics, media deregulation is a dangerous trend, facilitating an increase in concentration of media ownership, and subsequently reducing the overall quality and diversity of information communicated through major media channels.  Increased concentration of media ownership can lead to the censorship of a wide range of critical thought

AAnother concern is that consolidated media is not flexible enough to serve local communities in case of emergency.  This happened in Minot, North Dakota, in 2002, after a train filled with anhydrous ammonia derailed.  None of the leading radio stations in Minot carried information on the derailment or evacuation procedures, largely because they were all owned by Clear Channel Communications and received automated feeds from the corporate headquarters in San Antonio, Texas.  1600 people were injured and one died &lt;ref&gt;http://www.in-forum.com/specials/minot/part5.cfm?id=106028{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}

== Determinants of media pluralism ==
Pluralism is a very complex issue that cannot be secured by creating one panacea solution. According to Gillian Doyle, the following have to be investigated in order to decide what sort of acts or policies are the best for any given country that want to support media pluralism: size and wealth of the market; diversity of suppliers; consolidation of resources; and diversity of output.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Size and wealth of the market===
“Within any free market economy, the level of resources available for the provision of media will be constrained principally by the size and wealth of that economy, and the propensity of its inhabitants to consume media.” [Gillian Doyle; 2002:15] Those countries that have relatively large market, like the United Kingdom, France or Spain have more financial background to support diversity of output and have the ability to keep more media companies in the market (as they are there to make profit). More diverse output and fragmented ownership will, obviously, support pluralism. In contrast, small ones like Ireland or Hungary suffer from the absence of all those that are given in bigger countries. It means that “support for the media through direct payment” and “levels of consumers expenditure”, furthermore “the availability of advertising support” [Gillian Doyle; 2002:15] are less in these countries, due to the low number of audience. Overall, the size and wealth of the market determine the diversity of both media output and media ownership.

===Diversity of suppliers/owners===
From the previous paragraph can be assumed that size/wealth of the market have a very strong relation to the diversity of supplier. If the first is not given (wealthy market) then it is difficult to achieve fragmented supplier system. Diversity of suppliers refers to those heterogeneous independent organizations that are involved in media production and to the common ownership as well. The more various suppliers there are, the better for pluralism is. However, “the more powerful individual suppliers become, the greater the potential threat to pluralism.” &lt;ref&gt;Doyle, 2002: p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation of resources===
The consolidation of cost functions and cost-sharing. Cost-sharing is a common practice in monomedia and cross media. For example, “for multi-product television or radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity possible between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a programme schedule which can be shared between ’different’ stations), the greater the opportunity to reap economies.” &lt;ref&gt;Doyle, 2002: p. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Though the main concern of pluralism is that different organization under different ownership may buy the same e.g. news stories from the same news-supplier agency. In the UK, the biggest news-supplier is The Press Association (PA). Here is a quoted text from PA web site: “The Press Association supplies services to every national and regional daily newspaper, major broadcasters, online publishers and a wide range of commercial organisations.” Overall, in a system where all different media organizations gather their stories from the same source, then we can’t really call that system pluralist. That is where diversity of output comes in

==Concentration of media ownership globally==
Globally, large media conglomerates which may operate in California at any time include, National Amusements, Viacom, CBS Corporation, Time Warner, News Corp, Bertelsmann AG, Sony, General Electric, Vivendi SA, The Walt Disney Company, Hearst Corporation, Organizações Globo and Lagardère Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newint.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katharine Ainger&quot;/&gt;

As of 2010, The Walt Disney Company is the world's largest media conglomerate, with News Corporation, Time Warner and Viacom ranking second, third and fourth respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/industries/145/index.html - Fortune 500]&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Many Californians may utilize UK media due to its good reputation and the common language.  United Kingdom|Britain and Ireland, Rupert Murdoch owns best-selling tabloids ''News of the World'', ''The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun'' as well as the broadsheet ''The Times'' and ''Sunday Times'', and 39% of satellite broadcasting network BSkyB. BSkyB in turn owns a significant part of ITV plc.
Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) own The ''Daily Mail'' and'' The Mail on Sunday'', ''Ireland on Sunday'', and free London daily ''Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro'', and control a large proportion of regional media, including through subsidiary Northcliffe Media, in addition to large shares in ITN and GCap Media.

Richard Desmond owns ''OK! magazine'', Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5, the ''Daily Express'' and the ''Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star''.

The ''Evening Standard'' and ''The Independent'' are both owned by Russian businessman and ex KGB agent Alexander Lebedev.

===Israel===
Many Californians may access Israeli media especially for opinions on international events. In Israel, Arnon Mozes owns the most widespread Hebrew newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, the most widespread Russian newspaper Vesti (newspaper)|Vesty, the most popular Hebrew news website Ynet, and 17% of the cable TV firm Hot (Israel)|HOT. Moreover, Mozes owns the Reshet TV firm, which is one of the two operator of the most popular channel in Israel, channel 2.

=== Mexico ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
Many Californians read Mexican media. In Mexico there are only two national broadcast television networks, Televisa and TV Azteca. The former has a 70% market share. Though concern about the existence of a duopoly had been around for some time, a press uproar sparked in 2006, when Ley Televisa|a controversial reform to the Federal Radio and Television Law, seriously hampered the entry of new competitors, like Cadena Tres.

Televisa also owns subscription TV entreprises Cablevisión (Mexico)|Cablevisión and SKY Latin America|SKY, publishing company Editorial Televisa, and the Televisa Radio broadcast radio network, creating a de facto media monopoly in many regions of the country.

===United States===
In the United States, movie production is known to be dominated by major studios since the early 20th Century; before that, there was a period in which Motion Picture Patents Company|Edison's Trust monopolized the industry. The music and television industries recently witnessed cases of media consolidation, with Sony Music Entertainment's parent company merging their music division with Bertelsmann AG's BMG to form Sony BMG and TimeWarner's The WB and CBS Corp.'s UPN merging to form The CW. In the case of Sony BMG, there existed a &quot;Big Five&quot; (now &quot;Big Four record labels|Big Four&quot;) of major record company|record companies, while The CW's creation was an attempt to consolidate ratings and stand up to the &quot;Big Four&quot; of United States|American network television|network (terrestrial) television.

There may also be some large-scale owners in an industry that are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. Clear Channel Communications, especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, acquired many radio stations across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded as oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensed a specific part of airwave by the Federal Communications Commission|FCC in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many markets local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, cable systems and newspaper industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.

In the United States, data on ownership and market share of media companies is not held in the public domain. Academics, for example at MIT Media Lab and NYU, have struggled to find data that show reliably the concentration of media ownership. 

====History====
Prior to 1927, public airwaves in the United States were regulated by the United States Department of Commerce and largely litigated in the courts as the growing number of stations fought for space in the burgeoning industry. The Federal Radio Act of 1927 (signed into law February 23, 1927) nationalized the airwaves and formed the Federal Communications Commission|Federal Radio Commission (later named the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC) to assume control of the airwaves.

The Communications Act of 1934 refined and expanded on the authority of the FCC to regulate public airwaves in the United States, combining and reorganizing provisions from the Federal Radio Act of 1927 and the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910.  It empowered the FCC, among other things, to administer broadcasting licenses, impose penalties and regulate standards and equipment used on the airwaves.  The Act also mandated that the FCC would act in the interest of the &quot;public convenience, interest, or necessity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf The Communications Act of 1934 ].&quot;  United States Public Law.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act established a system whereby the FCC grants licenses to the spectrum to broadcasters for commercial use, so long as the broadcasters act in the public interest by providing news programming.

Lobbyists from the largest radio broadcasters, ABC and NBC, wanted to establish high fees for broadcasting licenses, but Congress saw this as a limitation upon free speech. Consequently, “the franchise to operate a broadcasting station, often worth millions, is awarded free of charge to enterprises selected under the standard of ‘public interest, convenience, or necessity.’”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[Thomas I. Emerson, &lt;u&gt;The System of Freedom of Expression&lt;/u&gt; (New York: Vintage Books, 1970), p. 654-655 ].&quot; Thomas I. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, radio and television was dominated by the Big Three television networks until the mid-1990s.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 set the modern tone of deregulation, a relaxing of percentage constrictions that solidified the previous history of privatizing the utility and commodifying the spectrum. The legislation, touted as a step that would foster competition, actually resulted in the subsequent mergers of several large companies, a trend which still continues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klinenberg0607&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbusters.org/the_magazine/72/Fighting_For_Air_An_interview_with_Eric_Klinenberg.html |title=Adbusters : The Magazine - #72 The Fake Issue / Fighting For Air: An interview with Eric Klinenberg |accessdate=2007-06-29 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 4,000 radio stations were bought out, and minority ownership of TV stations dropped to its lowest point since the federal government began tracking such data in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting |title= Speak Out for Media Democracy: Why isn’t the FCC doing its job?|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1823 |work= |publisher=Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting |date= 3/9/2003|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Communications Commission|FCC held one official forum, February 27, 2003, in Richmond, Virginia in response to public pressures to allow for more input on the issue of elimination of media ownership limits. Some complain that more than one forum was needed.&lt;ref&gt;Casuga, Jay-Anne. [http://www.richmond.com/business/10399 Not Enough: FCC public hearing allows only one hour for citizen input] (Richmond.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2003, Federal Communications Commission|FCC, in a 3-2 vote under Chairman Michael Powell (politician)|Michael Powell, approved new media ownership laws that removed many of the restrictions previously imposed to limit ownership of media within a local area. The changes were not, as is customarily done, made available to the public for a comment period.

* Single-company ownership of media in a given market is now permitted up to 45% (formerly 35%, up from 25% in 1985) of that market.
* Restrictions on newspaper and TV station ownership in the same market were removed.
* All TV channels, magazines, newspapers, cable, and Internet services are now counted, weighted based on people's average tendency to find news on that medium.  At the same time, whether a channel ''actually contains'' news is no longer considered in counting the percentage of a medium owned by one owner.
* Previous requirements for periodic review of license have been changed.  Licenses are no longer reviewed for &quot;public-interest&quot; considerations.

The decision by the FCC was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in ''Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC'' in June, 2004.  The Majority ruled 2-1 against the FCC and ordered the Commission to reconfigure how it justified raising ownership limits.  The Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court later turned down an appeal, so the ruling stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Labaton, Stephen.  &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/business/media/18broadcast.html?pagewanted=all Plan Would Ease Limits on Media Owners].&quot; ''The New York Times,'' 18 Oct 2007.  Retrieved on 10 Dec 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-ownership proceedings====
The FCC voted December 18, 2007 to eliminate some media ownership rules, including a statute that forbids a single company to own both a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same city. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin circulated the plan in October 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  Martin's justification for the rule change is to ensure the viability of America's newspapers and to address issues raised in the 2003 FCC decision that was later struck down by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-278113A1.pdf Chairman Kevin J. Martin Proposes Revision to the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule].&quot; FCC. Press Release, 13 Nov 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The FCC held six hearings around the country to receive public input from individuals, broadcasters and corporations.  Because of the lack of discussion during the 2003 proceedings, increased attention has been paid to ensuring that the FCC engages in proper dialogue with the public regarding its current rules change.

FCC Commissioners Deborah Taylor-Tate and Robert McDowell joined Chairman Martin in voting in favor of the rule change.  Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, both Democrats, opposed the change.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712181340DOWJONESDJONLINE000561_FORTUNE5.htm FCC Votes to Relax Cross-Media Ownership Rule]&quot;  ''Associated Press,'' 18 Dec 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Brown Act''', officially known as the '''Ralph M. Brown Act''', was an act of the California State Legislature, authored by Assemblymember Ralph M. Brown and passed in 1953, that guaranteed the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The Brown Act: Open Meetings for Local Legislative Bodies | publisher= California Attorney General | volume= Foreword, Introduction, and Table of Contents | last= Lockyer | first= Bill | year= 2003 | url= http://ag.ca.gov/publications/2003_Intro_BrownAct.pdf | accessdate= 2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brown Act, originally a 686 word statute that has grown substantially over the years, was enacted in response to mounting public concerns over informal, undisclosed meetings held by local elected officials.  City councils, county boards, and other local government bodies were avoiding public scrutiny by holding secret &quot;workshops&quot; and &quot;study sessions.&quot;  The Brown Act solely applies to California city and county government agencies, boards, and councils.  The comparable Bagley-Keane Act mandates open meetings for State government agencies.

==History==

The introduction to the Brown Act describes its purpose and intent:&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code §54960&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.  It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.  The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.  The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.  The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A local newspaper opined of the act:

{{cquote|A law to prohibit secret meetings of official bodies, save under the most exceptional circumstances, should not be necessary.  Public officers above all other persons should be imbued with the truth that their business is the public’s business and they should be the last to tolerate any attempt to keep the people from being fully informed as to what is going on in official agencies.  Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case. Instances are many in which officials have contrived, deliberately and shamefully, to operate in a vacuum of secrecy. | 4= ''Sacramento Bee'' | 5= October 1952 }}

==Criticisms==
Supporters of the Brown Act say it still lacks enforcement, contending the law has been eroded by court decisions and government officials' efforts to block access to records.  &quot;The unfulfilled promise, I'm afraid, that 50 years has revealed, is enforcement,&quot; commented Terry Francke, of the California First Amendment Coalition, on the 50th anniversary of the bill's passage in 2003.

==Key provisionss==

* Open meetings are required of all county, city and special districts such as water boards. The Brown Act does not apply to the state legislature itself, to the consternation of some commentators.
* Closed sessions are only allowed for things like labor and real estate negotiations. The body must report back on the progress of closed session at the following open public session.
* Documents at meetings are public, all of them.
* Electronic communications auch as emails must not be allowed to be used to conduct a de facto closed private meeting. Back and forth emails constitute an illegal deliberation.
* Emergency situations allow some exceptions to rules such as the prohibition of back and forth emails between members of a board.
* Public is not required to provide their name or any information when viewing documents.
* Notice of meetings
* No action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not on the agenda so that the public will have notice, via the agenda, in advance, that the particular action is being taken or discussed. 


* Criminal penalties are written into the act if there is proven intent to deprive the public of information, although this is rarely even threatened or discussed.
* Public comment is permitted at all open public meetings but the chair has discretion as to the scope and length of such public comment.
* Public criticism of governemtnt action is allowed but most agencies specifically prohibit personal attacks. 
* Recording the proceedings is, by law, permitted, when it is done in a non-disruptive manner.
* Special meetings are subject to all of the same requirements as any other meeting.

== Exceptions ==
The Brown Act applies to &quot;legislative&quot; agencies such as school districts, which &quot;legislate&quot; policy, boards of supervisors, city councils etc.
&lt;ref&gt; Government Code Section 54952&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[California_Public_Policy_and_Citizen_Participation/glossary|Primordial Wikipedia Article]] on the Brown Act,as of the date it was transwiki'd, subcommittees that are less than a ''quorom'' do not count. According to that wikipedia article this section was based on, &quot;''Advisory'' committees that do not legislate do not count.&quot; However, this writer is on an advisory committee which does not legislate, and Brown Act compliance is enforced very rigorously at all times and, according to city staff, the city could be fined for violating the Brown Act in the conduct of its advisory committee activities. Be sure to consult with the city or county attorney if you are on such a committee or if you are a citizen seeking to enhance the performance of any such committee. 

According to the wikipedia article, state agencies are covered by the Bagley Keene Act. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ag.ca.gov/publications/bagleykeene2004_ada.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
==State agencies are covered by the Bagley-Keene Open meetings act==  

It is the public policy of this state that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business and the proceedings of public agencies be conducted openly so that the public may remain informed.
In enacting this article the Legislature finds and declares that it is the intent of the law that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly.
The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.

'''Gary Webb''' (August 31, 1955 &amp;ndash; December 10, 2004) was a Pulitzer prize-winning United States|American Investigative journalism|investigative journalist.

Webb was best known for his 1996 &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series of articles written for the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and later published as a book. In the three-part series, Webb investigated Nicaraguans linked to the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA-backed Contra (guerrillas)|Contras who had allegedly smuggled cocaine into the U.S.  Their smuggled cocaine was  distributed as crack cocaine in Los Angeles, with the profits funneled back to the Contras. Webb also alleged that this influx of Nicaraguan-supplied cocaine sparked, and significantly fueled, the widespread Crack Epidemic|crack cocaine epidemic that swept through many U.S. cities during the 1980s. According to Webb, the CIA was aware of the cocaine transactions and the large CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US|shipments of drugs into the U.S. by Contra personnel.  Webb charged that the Reagan administration shielded inner-city drug dealers from prosecution in order to raise money for the Contras, especially after Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which prohibited direct Contra funding.

Webb's reporting generated fierce controversy, and the ''San Jose Mercury News'' backed away from the story, effectively ending Webb's career as a mainstream media journalist. In 2004, Webb was found dead from Multiple gunshot suicide|two gunshot wounds to the head, which the coroner's office judged a suicide. Though he was criticized and outcast from the mainstream journalism community, his reportage was eventually vindicated as many of his findings have since been validated: since Webb's death, both the ''Los Angeles Times'' and the ''Chicago Tribune'' have defended his &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series. Renowned journalist and former Webb colleague Al Giordano states that &quot;the CIA’s internal investigation by Inspector General Frederick Hitz vindicated much of Gary’s reporting&quot; and observes that despite the campaign against Webb, &quot;the government eventually admitted to more than Gary had initially reported&quot; over the years.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Webb was born to a military family in Corona, California.  At 15, Webb began writing editorials for his suburban Indianapolis high school newspaper.  At the height of the protests against the Vietnam War, he created his first controversy when he criticized the use of a female drill team to rally students for the war.  Webb attended journalism school at Northern Kentucky University, where he was on staff at the student newspaper ''The Northerner'', but dropped out.  He started his professional career at the ''Kentucky Post'', then worked as a statehouse correspondent for the ''Cleveland Plain Dealer''.  Webb found a lifelong passion in investigating political corruption|government and corporate crime|private sector corruption.  In 1988, Webb joined the ''San Jose Mercury News'' as a staff writer.  He helped expose freeway retrofitting problems in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and wrote stories about computer software problems at the California Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV.

=== Dark Alliance ===
==== Series ====
In August 1996 the ''San Jose Mercury News'' published Webb's &quot;Dark Alliance,&quot; a 20,000 word, three-part investigative series which alleged that Nicaraguan drug traffickers had sold and distributed cocaine|crack cocaine in Los Angeles during the 1980s, and that drug profits were used to fund the CIA-supported Nicaraguan Contra (guerrillas)|Contras. Webb never asserted that the CIA directly aided drug dealers to raise money for the Contras, but he did document that the CIA was aware of the cocaine transactions and the large shipments of cocaine into the U.S. by the Contra personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Webb's 1999 book, ''Dark Alliance'', substantiated these allegations with copious references.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; received national attention. At the height of the interest, the web version of it on ''San Jose Mercury News'' website received 1.3 million hits a day. According to the ''Columbia Journalism Review'', the series became &quot;the most talked-about piece of journalism in 1996 and arguably the most famous&amp;mdash;some would say infamous&amp;mdash;set of articles of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CJR&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Webb supported his story with documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, subsequently including a 450-page declassified version of an October 1988 report by CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz.  According to Webb and his supporters, the evidence demonstrates that White House officials, including Oliver North, knew about and supported using money from drug trafficking to fund the contras, and these officials neglected to pass any information along to the Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA. The 1988 report from the Senate Subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism and International Operations of the Committee on Foreign Relations led by Sen.

Immediately, denials began to emerge refuting the assertions Webb made in &quot;Dark Alliance.&quot; Reports in the ''The Washington Post|Washington Post'' (Oct 4, 1996), ''Los Angeles Times'', and ''The New York Times|New York Times'' (Oct 21, 1996), tried to debunk the link between the Contras and the crack epidemic.

Robert Parry, who in 1985 became the first reporter to accuse the Contras of involvement in drug trafficking,[http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/total_coverage/coke.html] wrote that the ''Post'''s denunciation of Webb was ironic, because the paper &quot;had long pooh-poohed earlier allegations that the Contras were implicated in drug shipments&quot; but now &quot;the newspaper was finally accepting the reality of Contra Illegal drug trade|cocaine trafficking, albeit in a backhanded way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parry|Parry, Robert.

In response to these attacks, Webb created a web site that contained primary documents, transcripts, and audio interviews.   By January 1997, Webb's editors no longer contacted him about his stories.  In March, Webb was informed that the paper was going to address the readers about his series.  On May 11, 1997, ''Mercury News'' executive editor Jerry Ceppos published an editorial describing the series as an &quot;important work&quot; and &quot;solidly documented,&quot; but criticized the series for: a reliance on one interpretation of complicated, sometimes-conflicting pieces of evidence; failing to estimate the amount of money involved; for oversimplifying the crack epidemic; and for creating impressions that were open to misinterpretation through imprecise language and graphics.&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;Osborn, Barbara Bliss.

Retrieved Jul. 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb was reassigned to a suburban bureau 150 miles from his home.  Because of the long commute, Webb quit the paper in December 1997. 

Webb alleged that the 1997 backlash was a form of media manipulation.  &quot;The government side of the story is coming through the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''New York Times'', the ''Washington Post'',&quot; Webb stated.  &quot;They use the giant corporate press rather than saying anything directly. If you work through friendly reporters on major newspapers, it comes off as the ''New York Times'' saying it and not a mouthpiece of the CIA.&quot;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;  James Aucoin, a communications professor who specializes in the history of investigative reporting, wrote: &quot;In the case of Gary Webb's charges against the CIA and the Contras, the major dailies came after him.  Media institutions are now part of the establishment and they have a lot invested in that establishment.&quot;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;

====Book====
In 1999, Seven Stories Press published Webb's ''Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion'', complete with extensive source citations.  The book received mixed reviews.

The book includes an account of a meeting between a pilot (who was making drug/arms runs between San Francisco and Costa Rica) with two Contra leaders who were also partners with the San Francisco-based Contra/drug smuggler Norwin Meneses.  According to eyewitnesses, Ivan Gomez, identified by one of the Contras as a CIA agent, was allegedly present at the drug transactions.  The pilot told Hitz that Gomez said he was there to &quot;ensure that the profits from the cocaine went to the Contras and not into someone's pocket.&quot;

According to Webb, Judd Iverson, a San Francisco defense attorney who represented former Contra Julio Zavala, discovered compelling evidence demonstrating that &quot;agents of the U.S. government were intricately involved in sanctioning cocaine trafficking to raise funds for Contra revolutionary activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DarkAlliance&quot;&gt;Webb 1999, pp. 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, members of the Justice Department persuaded U.S. District Court Judge Robert Peckham to seal the documents in the case.

=== Critics ===
Webb’s reporting on the CIA’s dealings with cocaine dealers was not without its critics. ''The Nation'' magazine contributor David Corn, while crediting him that &quot;it is only because of Webb that US citizens have ''confirmation from the CIA'' that it partnered up with suspected drug traffickers in the just-say-no years and that the Reagan Administration, consumed with a desire to overthrow the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, allied itself with drug thugs,&quot;  also criticized Webb for overstating the case and for not proving &quot;his more cinematic allegations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&amp;pid=2066 Gary Webb Is Dead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reason (magazine)|Reason'' magazine’s Glenn Garvin was critical of Webb’s sources and of the evidence he presented. Garvin wrote that Webb’s evidence that the Contra leadership was selling cocaine is almost entirely drawn from the claims of a few Nicaraguan traffickers facing long jail terms, and argued that they were using the CIA as a convenient scapegoat. Garvin also wrote that every guerilla group, including the Mujahideen, FARC and Shining Path, has used the narcotics trade as a way of bolstering its funding efforts, and that far from the Contra-related drug trade being widespread it came down to a small handful of Contra pilots and their associates who were involved in narcotics. He also argued that while these covert narcotic relationships were alleged to be most rampant, the Contras had the least need for funds, as the United States was supplying them with millions of dollars a year in support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/9901/bk.gg.hookedon.shtml Reason Magazine - Hooked on Fantasies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporters and Corroboration ===
According to historian Mark Fenster,&lt;ref&gt;Fenster, Mark. (2008) Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture (revised edition). University of Minnesota Press. 0816654948, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[T]he common view among journalists and researchers who have reviewed Webb's stories and have expertise on the Contras and the CIA's role in Nicaragua is that the stories sometimes overstate and overplay the largely testimonial evidence Webb had gathered but were nevertheless neither false nor fantastic. This is true whether the commentators are sympathetic to or critical of Webb. The historical consensus -- to the extent that such a thing is possible concerning controversial covert operations -- indicate that the basic outlines of the ''Mercury News'' stories were largely correct.

In 2006 the LA Times published ''The Truth in `Dark Alliance,’'' in which L.A. Times Managing Editor Leo Wolinsky is quoted saying &quot;in some ways, Gary got too much blame...He did exactly what you expect from a great investigative reporter.&quot; The article surveys mainstream reporting at the time of Webb's pieces and states that while Webb had committed &quot;hyperbole&quot; and included some unproven allegations, articles by the New York Times &quot;didn’t include the success he achieved or the wrongs he righted – and they were considerable&quot; according to  Walt Bogdanich, now a New York Times editor, who had known Webb earlier.

The LA Times piece criticizes its own unfair portrayal of Webb -- &quot;we dropped the ball&quot; -- and notes that &quot;spurred on by Webb’s story, the CIA conducted an internal investigation that acknowledged in March 1998 that the agency had ''covered up Contra drug trafficking for more than a decade''&quot; and concludes that &quot;History will tell if Webb receives the credit he’s due for prodding the CIA to acknowledge its shameful collaboration with drug dealers. Meanwhile, the journalistic establishment is only beginning to recognize that the controversy over “Dark Alliance” had more to do with poor editing than bad reporting [on Webb's part]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/18/opinion/oe-schou18 L.A. Times - The truth in `Dark Alliance’]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2005 in the Chicago Tribune, about &quot;the Dangers of Questioning Government Actions,&quot; Don Wycliff, the Tribune's public editor, wrote, &quot;I still think Gary Webb had it mostly right. I think he got the treatment that always comes to those who dare question aloud the bona fides of the establishment: First he got misrepresented -- his suggestion that the CIA tolerated the Contras' cocaine trading became an allegation that the agency itself was involved in the drug trade. Then he was ridiculed as a conspiracy-monger.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0106-34.htm Chicago Tribune - Dangers of Questioning Government Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Media Critic Norman Solomon's analysis, &quot;The Establishment's Papers Do Damage Control for the CIA,&quot; includes various corroborating evidence that a witch-hunt to discredit Webb was pursued more vigorously than the truth of some of Webb's allegations, including corroboration internal to one such paper, the Washington Post. Notes Solomon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1374 FAIR - Snow Job The Establishment's Papers Do Damage Control for the CIA]&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Post's ombudsman, Geneva Overholser, was on target (11/10/96) when she re-raised the question of the U.S. government's relationship to drug smuggling and noted that the three newspapers &quot;showed more passion for sniffing out the flaws in San Jose's answer than for sniffing out a better answer themselves.&quot;

Citing &quot;strong previous evidence that the CIA at least chose to overlook contra involvement in the drug trade,&quot; Overholser found &quot;misdirected zeal&quot; in the Post's response to the Mercury News series: &quot;Would that we had welcomed the surge of public interest as an occasion to return to a subject the Post and the public had given short shrift.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Investigation timeline ===
Facing increasing public scrutiny from the fallout after Webb's &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series, the CIA conducted its own internal investigations. Investigative journalist Robert Parry credits Webb for being responsible for the following government investigations into the Reagan-Bush administration's conduct of the Contra war:

* On December 10, 1996, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block announced the conclusion of his investigation into the issue, publishing a summary of the investigation at a press conference.  He announced at the press conference that &quot;We have found no evidence that the government was involved in drug trafficking in South-Central.&quot;  Nevertheless, the report included information that supported some of the charges. Charles Rappleye reported in the ''L.A. Weekly'' that Block's &quot;unequivocal statement is not backed up by the report itself, which raises many questions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye, Charles. (Dec. 13, 1996). &quot;[http://www.csun.edu/CommunicationStudies/ben/news/cia/961213.law.html Sherman's Contra-Diction]&quot;. ''LA Weekly''. Retrieved copy of original article Jul. 21, 2006 from California State University Northridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the LAPD investigation centered on allegations made in a postscript article to the newspaper's &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series.
* On January 29, 1998, Hitz published Volume One of his internal investigation.  This was the first of two CIA reports that eventually substantiated many of Webb's claims about cocaine smugglers, the Nicaraguan contra movement, and their ability to freely operate without the threat of law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;s:CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 16, 1998,  Hitz admitted that the CIA had maintained relationships with companies and individuals the CIA knew were involved in the drug business.  Hitz told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that &quot;there are instances where CIA did not, in an expeditious or consistent fashion, cut off relationships with individuals supporting the Contra program who were alleged to have engaged in drug-trafficking activity or take action to resolve the allegations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pincus, ''Washington Post'', Mar. 17, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator John Kerry reached similar conclusions a decade earlier in 1987. (See:&lt;ref name=DLEFP/&gt;)
* On May 7, 1998,  Rep. Maxine Waters, revealed a [http://www.csun.edu/coms/ben/news/cia/7May98/waters2.html memorandum of understanding] between the CIA and the Justice Department from 1982, which was entered into the Congressional Record.  This letter had freed the CIA from legally reporting drug smuggling by CIA assets, a provision that covered the Nicaraguan Contras and the Afghan rebels.[http://www.vcsun.org/%7Ebattias/cia/980507.cr.txt]
* On July 23, 1998, the United States Department of Justice|Justice Department released a report by its Inspector General, Michael R. Bromwich.  The Bromwich report claimed that the Reagan-Bush administration was aware of cocaine traffickers in the Contra movement and did nothing to stop the criminal activity. The report also alleged a pattern of discarded leads and witnesses, sabotaged investigations, instances of the CIA working with drug traffickers, and the discouragement of Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA investigations into Contra-cocaine shipments. The CIA's refusal to share information about Contra drug trafficking with law-enforcement agencies was also documented.  The Bromwich report corroborated Webb's investigation into Norwin Meneses, a Nicaraguan drug smuggler. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* On October 8, 1998, CIA I.G. Hitz published Volume Two of his internal investigation.  The report described how the Reagan-Bush administration had protected more than 50 Contras and other drug traffickers, and by so doing thwarted federal investigations into drug crimes. Hitz published evidence that drug trafficking and money laundering had made its way into Reagan's United States National Security Council|National Security Council where Oliver North oversaw the operations of the Contras.[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm]  According to the report, the Contra war took precedence over law enforcement.  To that end, the internal investigation revealed that the CIA routinely withheld evidence of Contra crimes from the Justice Department, Congress and even the analytical division of the CIA itself.  Further, the report confirmed Webb's claims regarding the origins and the relationship of Contra fundraising and drug trafficking.  The report also included information about CIA ties to other drug traffickers not discussed in the Webb series, including [http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/product/cocaine2/south.html#20 Moises Nunez] and [http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/product/cocaine2/other.html#2 Ivan Gomez].  More importantly, the internal CIA report documented a cover-up of evidence which had led to false intelligence assessments.

=== Aftermath and death ===
After leaving ''San Jose Mercury News'' Webb went to work for the California Assembly Speaker's Office of Member Services and served as a consultant to the California State legislature Task Force on Government Oversight.  As a member of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, Webb investigated charges that the Oracle Corporation received a no-bid contract award of $95 million in 2001 from former California Governor Gray Davis. Webb was hired by the ''Sacramento News and Review'', after being laid off in 2003 with the rest of the former Speaker's staff as part of a house-cleaning when the new Speaker took over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymania.com/american_history/Gary_Webb The Ultimate Gary Webb - American History Information Guide and Reference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2004, he was found dead from two gunshot wounds to the head.&lt;ref name=sacbeedeath/&gt; Sacramento County coroner Robert Lyons determined that it was suicide.  Webb's ex-wife, Sue Bell, said that Webb had been depressed for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper.&lt;ref name=sacbeedeath&gt;Stanton, Sam.

[[Image:Cannabis 01 bgiu.jpg|thumb|right|Marijuana (''Cannabis sativa'')]]

The recent history of '''Cannabis in California''' comprises a number of legislative, legal, and cultural events surrounding use of marijuana, hashish, and cannabis. California was the first state to establish a Medical cannabis program, enacted by '''Proposition 215''' in 1996 and '''California Senate Bill 420'''. Prop. 215, also known as the ''&quot;Compassionate Use Act&quot;'', was approved by initiative with a 55% majority, allowing people with cancer, AIDS and other chronic illnesses the right to grow or obtain marijuana for medical purposes when recommended by a doctor. SB 420, or the '''Medical Marijuana Protection Act''', was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis and established an identification card system for medical marijuana patients.

In 2009, Tom Ammiano introduced the Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act, which would remove penalties under state law for the cultivation, drug possession, and use of marijuana for persons over the age of 21. When the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote in January 2010, this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee. While the legislation failed to reach the Assembly floor, Ammiano stated his plans to reintroduce the bill later in the year, depending on the success of '''California Proposition 19''', the ''Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act'', which appeared on the November 2010 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/29/local/la-me-banks30-2010mar30|title=Pot breaks the age barrier|last=Banks|first=Sandy|date=March 29, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 31, 2010|publisher=Tribune Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposition lost 46% to 54%. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxcannabis.org/index.php/pages/initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30th, 2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law CA State Senate Bill 1449, effectively reducing the charge of possession of up to one ounce of cannabis from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic violation, with a $100 fine and no mandatory court appearance or criminal record.&lt;ref&gt; http://dl5.activatedirect.com/fs/distribution:letterFile/yvcee9xanplikz_files/z65ij4mzqc9pon?&amp;_c=d%7Cyvcee9xanplikz%7Cz65p1zm6c0d0km&amp;_ce=1285923483.e22c10cbdfb613cdd335475c0f46b779&lt;/ref&gt; The law became effective January 1, 2011.

'''California Proposition 36''' (also known as the ''Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000'') was approved by 61% of voters, requiring that &quot;first and second-offense drug violators be sent to drug treatment programs instead of facing trial and possible incarceration.&quot;&lt;ref name=Prop36&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/11/15/MN108231.DTL|title=Money, Opinion Propelled Prop. 36|first=Bill|last=Wallace|date=November 15, 2000|accessdate=January 15, 2010|work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marijuana remains decriminalized in California today.&lt;ref name=NORML/&gt;

Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law CA State Senate Bill 1449, effectively reducing the charge of possession of up to one ounce of cannabis from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic violation, with a $100 fine and no mandatory court appearance or criminal record. &lt;ref&gt; http://dl5.activatedirect.com/fs/distribution:letterFile/yvcee9xanplikz_files/z65ij4mzqc9pon?&amp;_c=d%7Cyvcee9xanplikz%7Cz65p1zm6c0d0km&amp;_ce=1285923483.e22c10cbdfb613cdd335475c0f46b779&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Medical marijuana===

California's Medical medical marijuana program was established when state voters approved California Proposition 215 (also known as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996)&lt;ref name=CACodes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=hsc&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11357-11362.9|title=Health and Safety Code Section 11357-11362.9|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the November 5, 1996 ballot with a 55% majority.&lt;ref name=MedicalMarijuana&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/article_46eee9d6-f440-539f-8ec7-c1052fc0b917.html|title=County, medical marijuana users head to showdown|first=Gig|last=Conaughton|date=November 12, 2006|accessdate=January 12, 2010|work=North County Times|publisher=Lee Enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition added Section 11362.5 to the California Health and Safety Code, modifying state law to allow people with cancer, anorexia, AIDS, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraines or other chronic illnesses the &quot;legal right to obtain or grow, and use marijuana for medical purposes when recommended by a doctor&quot;. The law also mandated that doctors not be punished for recommending the drug, and required that Federal government of the United States|federal and State governments of the United States|state governments work together &quot;to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need.&quot;&lt;ref name=CACodes/&gt;&lt;ref name=MedicalMarijuana/&gt; Proposition 215 does not affect federal law, which still prohibits the cultivation and possession of marijuana.

Vague wording became a major criticism of Prop. 215, though the law has since been clarified through the Supreme Court of California's rulings and the passage of subsequent laws. In January, 2010, the California Supreme Court ruled that the amendments to Prop 215 were illegally done, and all limits on medical marijuana in California were lifted. Presently, within the state of California, Medical Marijuana users with a valid Doctors recommendation may grow and possess as much marijuana as they require, provided that it is strictly for personal use (as was clarified and published in the LA Times){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Currently there is a bill waiting for California voters this November (Proposition 19) that would effectively make possession and cultivation of marijuana legal for everyone over the age of 21, and would regulate it similarly to alcohol. If passed, Proposition 19 would not only provide much needed revenue for the Californian budget, but would virtually eliminate marijuana grown illegally on public lands, removing the threat of hikers, hunters, fishermen and others walking into illegal grow operations and quite possibly boobytraps setup by illegal growers. California's Proposition 19 has the support of many law enforcement agencies as it would free up much needed resources and allow them to direct them into areas of law enforcement that they are really needed, such as the eradication of illegal drug labs where methamphetamine is manufactured.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/sunletters/la-oew-gutwillig-imler6-2009mar06,1,7457273,full.story|title=Medical marijuana in California: a history|first1=Scott|last1=Imler|first2=Stephen|last2=Gutwillig|date=March 6, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate patients from non-patients, Governor Gray Davis signed California Senate Bill 420 (also known as the Medical Marijuana Protection Act) in 2003, establishing an identification card system for medical marijuana patients.

Critics of California's program argue that marijuana has become quasi-legal, as &quot;anyone can obtain a recommendation for medical marijuana at any time for practically any ailment&quot;.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Acknowledging that there are instances in which the system is abused and that laws could be improved, Stephen Gutwillig of the Drug Policy Alliance Network&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14173190?nclick_check=1|title=Committee passes marijuana legalization bill|date=January 12, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=Steven|last=Harmon|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=MediaNews Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; insists that the passages of Proposition 215 is &quot;nothing short of incredible&quot;.

===Legalization of non-medical cannabis===
On February 23, 2009,&lt;ref name=AB390&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0351-0400/ab_390_bill_20090223_introduced.html|title=AB 390 - Assembly Bill|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; California State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (Democrat) introduced the '''Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act''', a proposed bill that would &quot;remove all penalties under California law for the cultivation, transportation, sale, purchase, possession, and use of marijuana, natural THC and paraphernalia by persons over the age of 21&quot; and &quot;prohibit local and state law enforcement officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/comments_blog/2009/02/marijuana-legal.html|title=Could Measure AB 390 put a 360 on California's budget woes?|date=February 24, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|first=Tony|last=Pierce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would help with battling the 2008–2010 California budget crisis by allowing the state to regulate and tax its sale at $50 per ounce.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1884956,00.html|title=Can Marijuana Help Rescue California's Economy?|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=Alison|last=Stateman|work=Time (magazine)|Time|publisher=Time Inc.|Time Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Time'' magazine, California tax collectors estimate the bill would raise about $1.3 billion a year in revenue.

Critics such as John Lovell, lobbyist for the California Peace Officers' Association, argue that too many people already struggle with alcohol and drug abuse, and legalizing another Psychoactive drug|mind-altering substance would lead to a &quot;surge&quot; of use, making problems worse.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Apart from helping the state's budget by enforcing a tax on the sale of cannabis, proponents of the bill argue that legalization will reduce the amount of criminal activity associated with the drug. Orange County Superior Court Judge James Gray estimates that eliminating arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment for nonviolent offenders due to legalization could save the state $1 billion a year.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

The bill was delayed until January 2010, when the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote—this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt; However, the bill was unable to move forward to the Health Committee, where it was required to be heard before reaching the Assembly floor, before the January 15 deadline for proposed 2009 legislation. Ammiano plans to re-introduce the bill later this month or wait to see how a ballot measure for legalization fares in November 2010.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

There were three separate marijuana related initiatives put forth to qualify for the California state elections, November 2010|November 2010 elections. Two of these failed to gather the required number of signatures.

On March 24, 2010 California Proposition 19, titled the '''&quot;Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act&quot;''', qualified for the November ballot for the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/29/local/la-me-banks30-2010mar30|title=Pot breaks the age barrier|last=Banks|first=Sandy|date=March 29, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 31, 2010|publisher=Tribune Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it had passed, this initiative would have legalized marijuana in California and allowed local governments to tax and regulate the sale of marijuana and its related activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxcannabis.org/index.php/pages/initiative/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposal was defeated during the November 2 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vote.sos.ca.gov/maps/ballot-measures/19/|title=CA Secretary of State: Results for Proposition 19|date=November 7, 2010|publisher=Secretary of State|Secretary of State's office|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Identifying Conics ==
Conics are reasonably easy to graph if they are given in their standard form. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. Conics can be represented by polynomials of the form: &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and to graph these it is necessary to convert them back to their standard form. Before you do this, though, the formula: &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC&lt;/math&gt; can be used to determine the type of conic from the original equation before you start graphing:
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC = 0&lt;/math&gt;: Parabola
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Ellipse
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Hyperbola

Firstly, if B is not zero then the graph represents a rotated conic. Follow the instructions given on [[Conic_Sections/Rotation_of_Axes|Rotation of Axes]] to determine how to convert this to a non-rotated form. Then convert this to the standard form of a conic as detailed later in this section, and graph it on a set of axes at the appropriate angle to the x- and y- axes.

If B is equal to zero, then use completing the square and algebraic manipulation to obtain standard forms of the conics.

=== Examples ===
==== Example 1: (Ellipse) &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9}x^2+\frac{1}{25}y^2-\frac{2}{3}x-\frac{8}{25}y+\frac{16}{25}=0&lt;/math&gt; ====
It is first necessary to complete the square for the x and y terms. First we will start with x. While it appears that in this case b is &lt;math&gt;-\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, you must remember that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to 1. Therefore:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9}x^2-\frac{2}{3}x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}[x^2-6x]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, b = -6. &lt;math&gt;(\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{-6}{2})^2=9&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}[x^2-6x+9-9]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}[(x-3)^2-9]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}(x-3)^2-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Doing the same for the y:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{25}y^2-\frac{8}{25}y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}[y^2-8y]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, b = -8. &lt;math&gt;(\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{-8}{2})^2=16&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}[y^2-8y+16-16]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}[(y-4)^2-16]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}(y-4)^2-\frac{16}{25}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These can then be placed back into the original equation:
&lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{9}(x-3)^2-1)+(\frac{1}{25}(y-4)^2-\frac{16}{25})+\frac{16}{25}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-3)^2}{9}+\frac{(y-4)^2}{25}=1&lt;/math&gt; Which is the standard form for an ellipse. To check our answer, we can use the formula &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC&lt;/math&gt; getting the values from the original equation. Substituting these in gives: &lt;math&gt;(0)^2 -4(\frac{1}{9})(\frac{1}{25})=-\frac{4}{225}&lt;/math&gt; which is less than zero. Therefore the conic is an ellipse, confirming our previous answer.

==== Example 2: &lt;math&gt;Circle&lt;/math&gt; ====
==== Example 3: &lt;math&gt;Parabola&lt;/math&gt; ====
==== Example 4: &lt;math&gt;Hyperbola&lt;/math&gt; ====
==== Example 5: (Rotated Ellipse) &lt;math&gt;6x^2 + \sqrt{3}xy+7y^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt; ====
The fact that it has an xy term means that this is a rotated conic. The angle that it has been rotated is given by: &lt;math&gt;tan 2\theta = \frac{B}{A-C}=\frac{(\sqrt{3})}{(6)-(7)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore &lt;math&gt;2\theta=atan \frac{(\sqrt{3})}{(6)-(7)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\theta=atan -\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\theta=\frac{-\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This tells you that the conic has been rotated &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; radians, or -30°, anticlockwise, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; radians or 30° clockwise about the origin.&lt;br /&gt;
You can then make the following substitutions to obtain the polynomial for an identical, non-rotated conic:
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \theta - Y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \theta + Y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this case, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;. Make sure you do not confuse the sign as this will make further calculations invalid. the value for the angle used is always the amount anti-clockwise. Therefore, substituting &lt;math&gt;\theta = -\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; into the previous will give you:
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \frac{-\pi}{6} - Y sin \frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \frac{-\pi}{6} + Y cos \frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which simplifies to 
* &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}Y &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = -\frac{1}{2}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}Y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When these are substituted into the rotated equation, you get:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}Y)^2 + \sqrt{3}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}Y)(-\frac{1}{2}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}Y)+7(-\frac{1}{2}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}Y)^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Expanding the brackets gives:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6(\frac{3}{4}X^2+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}XY+\frac{1}{4}Y^2)+\sqrt{3}(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}X^2+\frac{1}{2}XY+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}Y)+7(\frac{1}{4}X^2-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}XY+\frac{3}{4}Y^2)-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you expand the brackets and collect like terms, you end up with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(6\times\frac{3}{4}+\sqrt{3}\times\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{4}+7\times\frac{1}{4})X^2+(6\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\sqrt{3}\times\frac{1}{2}+7\times\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2})XY+(6\times\frac{1}{4}+\sqrt{3}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}+7\times\frac{3}{4})Y^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which simplifies to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{2}X^2+0XY+\frac{15}{2}Y^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that there is now no XY term means that this is an equation for a non-rotated conic. Now all that remains is a little algebraic manipulation to get it into its standard form:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{2}X^2+\frac{15}{2}Y^2=36&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{X^2}{\frac{2}{11}}+\frac{Y^2}{\frac{2}{15}}=36&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{X^2}{\frac{2}{11}\times36}+\frac{Y^2}{\frac{2}{15}\times36}=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{X^2}{\frac{72}{11}}+\frac{Y^2}{\frac{24}{5}}=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which is the standard form of an ellipse which you can use to find the axis lengths, eccentricity, foci and anything else. Remember though that this must be graphed at the angle found earlier of &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; to the x-axis. You can use the same formulae from above to find the rotated location of points from the non-rotated ellipse:&lt;br /&gt;
The point (x,y) when rotated by an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; about the origin becomes (X,Y) where:
* &lt;math&gt;X = x cos \theta + y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Y = -x sin \theta + y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Memory ==
One of the most common depiction of hypnosis in todays media is its use to recall past events, but there is more to it than that. This section will attempt to provide a framework to understand how [[w:Memory|memory]] is stored and how to make use of that faculty of the brain under hypnosis.

Memories can be said to be stored in seven dimensions, the normal three dimensions plus time, smell, taste and emotions. Not all persons are capable of the same capacity in regards to the observation and storage of the memories. For instance age, sex, duration and number of repetitions (even of similar experiences) will have a distinct influence on the accuracy of the recollection of these variables. Emotional memory seems to be the stronger variable, emotions attached to memories are what makes them have a meaning, a value.

One need also to comprehend that memories are stored in a biological medium, that depends not on chemical reactions to induce physical restructure in the brain. Our brains have regions dedicated to tasks (processing of information) but also to memory that ultimately can be defined as the processes by which information is utilized.

=== Memory vs Imagination ===
Memory is also close related to imagination and visualization. As we will discuss later on, people diverge in how they visualize events, some can see images as in watching a movie or a photo others can only get a sensation about the form, they can &quot;imagine&quot; but they cannot &quot;see&quot;, this is valid also to the other variables, some people will be more aware of emotions, smells or tastes than others. The brain also has the tendency to fill any blanks and inconsistencies of a memory by making use of the imagination using similitudes with any other memories or even adding details only due to the expectation of their presence even more if any external reinforcement is given, even if in an subconscious way.

;'''Creativity'''
Memory and mental visualization are the core of the creativity, it is using free association, extrapolation and deduction that new concepts are developed. Imagination only on it broader sense can be said to be an act of creating something new, more often than not it is a simply the recollection of a stored memory within a new idealized context.

=== Type of memory ===
The prevailing model ([[w:cognitive architecture|cognitive architecture]]), named [[w:ACT-R|ACT-R]] (pronounced ''act-ARE'': Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) was mainly developed by [[w:John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Robert Anderson]] at [[w:Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University]] and divides long-term memory into [[w:declarative memory|declarative (explicit)]] and [[w:procedural memory|procedural (implicit)]] memories.

[[w:Declarative memory|Declarative memory]] requires conscious recall effort, in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called ''[[w:explicit memory|explicit memory]]'', since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.

Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into [[w:semantic memory|semantic memory]], which concerns facts taken independent of context; and [[w:episodic memory|episodic memory]], which concerns information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as &quot;Paris is the capital of France&quot;. Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. [[w:Autobiographical memory|Autobiographical memory]] (memory for particular events within one's own life) is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. [[w:Visual memory|Visual memory]] is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Since visual memory can also enable indirect priming (activating related memories) it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon. The pathways of importance seems to be the medial [[w:temporal lobe|temporal lobe]].

In contrast, [[w:procedural memory|procedural memory]] (or ''[[w:implicit memory|implicit memory]]''), often referred muscle memory, is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in [[w:motor learning|motor learning]] depends on the [[w:cerebellum|cerebellum]] and [[w:basal ganglia|basal ganglia]].

{{NOTE|Procedural memory has a specific importance for instance in the context of [[Hypnosis/Chapters/Uses#Sports|hypnosis applied to sports]].}}

'''Topographic memory''' (a subset of [[w:Spatial memory|spatial memory]]) is the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places. Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory. This is often reported among elderly patients who are evaluated for dementia. The disorder could be caused by multiple impairments, including difficulties with perception, orientation, and memory.

'''Flashbulb memories''' are clear [[w:episodic memories|episodic memories]] of unique and highly emotional events, often traumatic. For instance remembering where you were or what you were doing when you first heard the news of 9/11.

=== New memories ===
Hypnosis can create new memories but the subject has to be able to accept them as valid (interiorize) to incorporate them into his reality, in most cases this can only be archived if there is a strong predisposition to do so. In any case, memory alteration of any kind, it is generally accepted as dangerous and can have unforeseen consequences. Memories more than any other aspect is what defines us.

{{NOTE|New memories in this context do not refer to the shaping of perception of an event, but the full synthesizing of a false memorized experience.}}

Memories are created and accessed by generic but different internal phases:
*Cognitive apprehension.
*Storage (Encoding done via associative, referencing and correlation processes).
*Recall.

In the next section we will look on how memories stored.Cognitive apprehension was already covered in the previous chapter, in the [[Hypnosis/Chapters/Mind#Self_and_reality|section about self and reality]].

=== Storage ===
[[w:Storage (memory)|Memory storage]], the retention of information, is achieved through the encoding process. There seems to be two distinct types of memory storage, '''short term memory''' and '''long term memory''' and there are several varieties proposed memory models.

It is hard to define each memory operation as insulated tasks, like for instance in computers, biological memory are fuzzy in nature they seems to have specific qualities like strength and priority, something that digital memory does not replicate. One interesting parallelism that does seems exist is locational optimization, that is depending the type of memory they have specific locations on the brain, this occurs in a way that it is very similar to digital systems, as a way to optimize communication between subsystems.

{{NOTE|Hypnosis can shape perception, by exponentiating, creating or removing sensory and emotional information.}} 

Memory is associative by nature, commonalities will not only reinforce old memories and serve to ease establishing new ones. A study from Northwestern University verified that sound can help the creation of stronger memory. That if a sound is present when committing something to memory, playing that same sound later will also reinforce the memory, even while sleeping in a modest way (not to be confused with Sleep-learning that we covered before). This is an example of anchoring (creation of the connection between to simultaneous events) and priming (activating the association). 

==== Short Term Memory ====
[[w:Short-term memory|Short-term memory]] refers to the memory of the immediate past, a short duration of time, that seems to be continuously deteriorating. In the process of memory encoding, all input events, after several layers of filtering, will first enter the brain's short-term memory.

{{NOTE|It is important to distinguish that consciously and subconsciously, memorized events are related but the particulars that have been not consciously perceived will less importance to the conscious mind. Some of the information processing is done subconsciously for example correlation and similitudes occur without a conscious effort.}} 

Short-term memory will degrade in a short time, if not refreshed by any subsequent memory operation. Studies suggest that the conscious capacity of the short-term memory for storage is approximately seven &quot;focal&quot; items, plus or minus two. It may depend on the type (modality) and complexity of the event and so this limit may be subject to a larger variability.

There are chemical way to prevent the formation of new memories ('''[[w:Anterograde amnesia|Anterograde amnesia]]'''). For instance the drug [[w:Midazolam|Midazolam]] (marketed in English-speaking countries under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel or Versed) is used in surgery to inhibit unpleasant memories formation.

{{NOTE|This control over memory formation we start to have can be extremely illusory considering that we still have a limited understanding on memory operations, just because one is not conscientious of the what transpired, subconsciously there may be implications that are not as easily to detect. Just because one can not remember an event, one has never the less experienced it.}}

The most powerful methodology is to guide the subconscious to perform the memory refreshing of the information, this is best done using incomplete patterns. Like the jingle that from time to time will return to our mind out of nowhere by using an interrupted pattern of attractive bit of information, especially if the expected outcome/conclusion is thwarted, the operator can introduce other ideas and piggy back on the effort that the subconscious will make to make sense of the data, this works even outside of trance and is often used in commercials that will convey an incomplete event or build up for an event that never happens on screen or goes completely against what was expected.

One could even speculate that this capability, cognitive response is an evolutionary trait that is linked to the development of human culture. As we have seen in the history chapter, storytelling can create trance states, this boost to memorization may have been been important to early humans as to preserve oral lore and promote survivability. Under trance the effect is potentiated. Using hypnosis there is a limited control over short-term memory or natural memory creation outside of previous conditioning, for instance hypnosis can be used to alter immediate perceptions of events, even their suppression or making them stronger, especially by linking them to emotions.

==== Long Term Memory ====
[[w:Long-term memory|Long-term memory]], is all information that is held for a prolonged period of time. Short-term memory that the subconscious agrees to define as important is moved to this type of long duration storage, that is more vast but more costly for direct consciously access. Some models assume long-term memory is capable of unlimited memory, but there may be some limits it all seems to hinge on subsequent processes that optimizes not only storage but access, in a way that is similar to a lose digital compression (details may be dropped) and correlations and similitudes are used to reduce duplication. Because there is no specific way to consciously assess all that is memorized some models defend that memory may not be permanent at all and that unless memory is occasionally recalled, it degrades to a point that it is no longer remembered.

;'''Sleep'''
Today it is commonly accepted that one of the functions of sleep, and dreams is to process and optimize memory storage, even to preemptively create responses to hypothetical scenarios extrapolated from our experiences. 
While we sleep, the brain categorizes, discards and analyses recent memories, not only of past events or experiences but every recent thought it decides as important.

{{NOTE|A 2011 study at University of Tübingen in Germany by [http://www.kfg.uni-luebeck.de/html/gb/born.htm Prof. Dr. J. Born], demonstrated that sleep and an expectation of a test will increase the memory recall of relevant data. Source: [http://www.jneurosci.org/ Journal of Neuroscience, DOI 10.1523/jneurosci.3575-10.2011]}}

=== Recall ===
Memory recall capabilities also varies hugely from individual to individual, and also depends ultimately on how strongly memories have been stored and accessed, emotional states do have a high importance on the moment of memory created as it is believed that strong emotional experiences will help to create long lasting memories. Emotional or physical pain, more so than emotional pleasure or physical pleasure these are often linked to cravings and often dependency.  Recollecting (reactivating) a memory will make it stronger.

Physical pain and pleasure can also build resistance on how the brain processes the inputs. Emotional pleasure driven memories when linked to physical pain or physical discomfort can also bypass the expectation that an individual would avoid the repetition of a painful or uncomfortable experience.   

As we have already discussed memory comes in two major distinct forms, short term and long term, this types of memory are not only distinct in how they are managed by the brain they have also have different qualities. There is of course sub-levels, for instance we may recall an address for some hours or a day, or for instance a movie plot memory will become to decay in a few weeks, after a while only very specific sequences can be easily recalled, on the other hand most highly emotional memories will tend to remain with us for the rest of our lives.

It is also interesting to mention the reports of total life experience recall that some people report after being in a near death situation. Britain's Royal Navy Rear Admiral Sir [[w:Francis Beaufort|Francis Beaufort]] (1774 – 1857), inventor of the [[w:Beaufort scale|Beaufort scale]], reports while writing about his near death experience in an almost fatal drowning accident after a fall off a boat in Portsmouth harbor on June 10, 1791 ([http://books.google.pt/books?id=9x_VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA499 full text]).

{{Quotation| &quot;Though the senses were thus deadened, not so the mind; its activity seemed to be invigorated in a ratio which defies all description—for thought rose after thought with a rapidity of succession that is not only indescribable, but probably inconceivable, by any one who has not himself been in a similar situation. The course of those thoughts I can even now in a great measure retrace—the event which had just taken place, the awkwardness that had produced it—the bustle it must have occasioned (for J had observed two persons jump from the chains)—the effect it would have on a most affectionate father—the manner in which he would disclose it to the rest of the family—and a thousand other circumstances minutely associated with home, were the first series of reflections that occurred. They took then a wider range—our last cruise—a former voyage, and shipwreck—my school—the progress I had made there, and the time I misspent —and even all my boyish pursuits and adventures. Thus travelling backwards, every past incident of my life seemed to glance across my recollection in retrograde succession; not, however, in mere outline, as here stated, but the picture filled up with every minute and collateral feature; in short, the whole period of my existence seemed to be placed before me in a kind of panoramic review, and each act of it seemed to he accompanied by some reflection on its cause, or its consequences ; indeed, many trifling events which had been long forgotten then crowded into my imagination, and with the character of recent familiarity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;May not all this be some indication of the almost infinite power of memory with which we may awaken in another world, and thus be compelled to contemplate our past lives? Or might it not in some degree warrant the inference that death is only a change or modification of our existence, in which there is no real pause or interruption * But, however that may be, one circumstance was highly remarkable; that the innumerable ideas which flashed into my mind were all retrospective—yet I had been religiously brought up—my hopes and fears of the next world had lost nothing of their early strength, and at any other period intense interest and awful anxiety would have been excited by the mere probability that I was floating on the threshold of eternity: yet at that inexplicable moment when I had a full conviction that I had already crossed the threshold, not a single thought wandered into the future—I was wrapped entirely in the past.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;The length of time that was occupied by this deluge of ideas, or rather the shortness of time into which they were condensed, I cannot now state with precision, yet certainly two minutes could not have elapsed from the moment of suffocation to that of my being hauled up.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;}}

It then becomes hard to state concisely what the limits of our memory is, it seems however that the limit is vastly superior to what we in our everyday can access.

{{NOTE|This near death memory recall events have been tentatively explained by an ''in extremis'' subconscious attempt of the mind to find a match in a past experiences to the situation ones is now living.}}

A study by Benton H. Pierce and David A. Gallo also indicate that visual memory is stronger than auditory memory and the degree of recollection is also increased using visualization activation. (See 2011 paper {{PDFlink|[http://memorylab.uchicago.edu/pdf/Pierce_2011.pdf Encoding Modality Can Affect Memory Accuracy via Retrieval Orientation]}})

==== Priming ====
[[w:Priming (psychology)|Priming]] is an implicit memory effect of reactivation of a memory/concept on exposure to a stimulus that has a mental correlation. It can occur following perceptual, semantic, or conceptual stimulus repetition. For example, if a person reads a list of words including the word table, and is later asked to complete a word starting with tab, the probability that he or she will answer table is greater than if not so primed. Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch that they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture, later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time.

The effects of priming can be very salient and long lasting, even more so than simple recognition memory. Unconscious priming effects can affect word choice on a word-stem completion test long after the words have been consciously forgotten.

Priming works best when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities, or between semantically related words such as &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;nurse&quot;.

Priming is extremely important in hypnosis from the choice of words to the creation of reactive stimuli, anchors and triggers.

{{TODO|Possible transclusion of the Wikipedia article.}}

==== Memories as emotional triggers ====
In general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the '''memory enhancement effect''', most often a person is has no conscious awareness of the process. Most of us consciously remember sensory inputs (smell and vision) better than the memories emotional connotations.

{{NOTE|A Psychological Science study in 2009, by Psychologist Sarah Master of the University California, Los Angeles. Showed that women holding their partner's hand or viewing his photo decreased the women's pain significantly more than touching or viewing a stranger-and the photo was just as effective as the physical contact.}}

Special consideration should be given to avoid unwanted [[w:Abreaction|abreactions]] from a subject during hypnosis. Be aware of the subject phobias and bad experiences before hand. Use the [[Hypnosis/Chapters/Hypno#Pre-hypnosis|pre-hypnosis stage]] to find the relevant information and during hypnosis be aware on how the subject reacts to the induced perceptual changes.

=== Repression ===
Memory repression is mostly done subconsciously, as we've seen sleep time seems to be linked to memory storage and prioritization, repression of memory seems to be the other side of the process. Some will even argue that we never forget anything that whatever loss there is, is restricted to the fidelity of the stored memories and the ease of access to them. But this bring up a realization, that degradation is a form of memory alteration.

There is also a issue of fragmentation, that is events that are not consciously remember but are so strong that can dictate subconsciously our reactions. [[w:Amnesia|Amnesia]] is a very vast phenomena but it is interesting to note that it can originate both from a pure physical neurological damage ('''organic amnesia''') and also by very long list of purely psychological reasons, of particular note to our subject is '''post-hypnotic amnesia''', where events during hypnosis are forgotten, or where past memories are unable to be recalled. The failure to remember those events can be induced by suggestions made during the hypnosis or occur without a explicit suggestion. This is classified as a subtype of [[w:Psychogenic amnesia|Psychogenic amnesia]] ('''dissociative amnesia''').

A person can also be taught to forget emotional details, like personal feelings, associated with a memory without erasing the memory of the actual event, helping to deal with depression or as a therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. This is supported by a study conducted by a research team from the University of St. Andrews in 2012.

Notes: The 1977 S.G. Elizabethan Catalogue states that &quot;Examples of the 1sh. and 10sh. have been seen with the obliterating bars over &quot;NIGERIA&quot; strengthened with additional bars in ballpoint pen.&quot; 

It also states that &quot;The 1 1/2D. is known, unused, with an overprint, similar to that used on the 2D., inverted and with &quot;SOVEREIGN BIAFRA&quot; omitted.

A polynomial is a variable that has the general form
:;&lt;math&gt;P(x) = a_n x^n + a^n-1 x^n-1 + a_1 x + a_o&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; literals represent any constant numbers.

==Monomial==
Polynomials with highest degree as 1 are called Monomials.
Monomial has the general form

&lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x &lt;/math&gt;

Consider &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a monomial function of x.
: &lt;math&gt;y = 2 x &lt;/math&gt;
:  x | y
: -2 | -4
: -1 | -1
:  0 | 0
:  1 | 1
:  2 | 2


General equation of a straight line with slope m = a through y intercept (0,b)

* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x + b&lt;/math&gt;

Equation of a straight line with slope m = 1 and passing through (0,0).
: &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;
: x | -2 -1 0 1 2
: y | -2 -1 0 1 2
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Graph of line Y = X.jpg|Graph of line y = x
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Binomial==
Polynomial of one variable has the general form
* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x^2 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y = a x^2 &lt;/math&gt;
: x | -2 -1 0 1 2
: y | 4  2  0 2 4

: Parabola goes through point (0,0)

* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x^2 + c &lt;/math&gt;
: Parabola goes through y - intercept point (0,&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;)

* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x^2 - c &lt;/math&gt;
: Parabola goes through y - intercept point (0,&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;)

* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x^2 + b x &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c &lt;/math&gt;

No matter where you are moving to, insurance can help protect the things that you have worked so hard for over the years. Just like any other insurance policy, moving insurance takes a fee and then provides you cash payment if something is damaged while it is being moved.

==Where to Buy Moving Insurance==

There are a couple of different places that consumers can purchase moving insurance from. First is the moving company itself, which offers an insurance-like product called valuation. When you choose valuation instead of traditional insurance, you will be getting a set per pound amount for each pound of goods that is being shipped. Most companies offer a basic level of valuation coverage for free with the purchase of their services, but this is usually not enough to cover the value of the items being shipped. Consumers can, however, purchase additional coverage if they choose to.

Another place to get moving insurance is a traditional insurance company. Movers are not insurance companies, so their version of moving insurance is not actual insurance. When you choose a traditional policy, however, you will be dealing with actual insurance. These policies can be purchased separately or they can be added on to your homeowners policy. They cover the cost of each item individually rather than a per pound rate.

==Things to Consider==

Purchasing moving insurance is a very important part of every move. It is important that consumers think about the worth of their goods and find out how much of each type of insurance would be needed to replace everything. By doing this, consumers can guarantee that they have enough coverage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Polynominal Equation==
An equation is an expression of one variable such that
:; &lt;math&gt;f(x) = Ax^n + Bx^(n-1) + x^1 + x^0 = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

==Solving Polynominal Equation==
Solving polynominal equations involves finding all the values of variable x that satisfy f(x) = 0.

===First Order Equation===
A first order polynominal equation of one variable x has the general form
: Ax + B = 0

Rewrite the equation above
: &lt;math&gt;x + \frac{B}{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = -\frac{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Second Order Equation==
A second order polynominal equation of one variable x has the general form
# &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 - C = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Solving Equation===
====Method 1====

&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{B}{A}x + \frac{C}{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = -\alpha \pm \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Where
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = - \frac{B}{2A}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = - \frac{C}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;


Depending on the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the equation will have the following root

One Real Root
: &lt;math&gt;-\alpha = - \frac{B}{2A}&lt;/math&gt;

Two Real Roots
: &lt;math&gt;-\alpha \pm \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{B}{2A} \pm \sqrt {\frac{B^2 - 4 AC}{2A}} &lt;/math&gt;

Two Complex Roots
: &lt;math&gt;-\alpha \pm j\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{B}{2A} \pm j\sqrt {\frac{B^2 - 4 AC}{2A}} &lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====

&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + b = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm j \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Method 3====
&lt;math&gt;ax^2 - b = 0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 - \frac{b}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

The general form of First Order Equation
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + B f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Which can be writte as
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = - \frac{B}{A} f(x)  &lt;/math&gt;

has one root of the exponential function form
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = A e^(-\frac{B}{A}) t &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
Equation is an expression of one variable such that
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + B f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} + \frac{B}{A} f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{f(x)} = -\frac{B}{A} dx&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d f(x)}{f(x)} = -\frac{B}{A} \int dx&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Ln f(x) = -\frac{B}{A} t + C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^[-\frac{B}{A} t + C]&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^C e^(-\frac{B}{A}) t &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = A e^(-\frac{B}{A}) t &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Second Order Differential Equation==
Second Ordered Differetial Equation has the general form
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d^2 f(x)}{dx^2} + B \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + C = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Which can be expressed as

In cases when manual alignment of two volumes is needed, [[/register/]] can be used.

==Manual Segmentation (labeling, painting)==

[[/Display/]] is the tool developed for manual labeling of MRI volumes and visualization of 3D objects. Alternatively,  [[MINC/EZMINC/MincifiedTools|mincified version of ITK-SNAP]] can be used for the same purpose.


==The rest of the tools (unsorted heap)==

[[/xdisp/]] - useful for quantitative measurements

[[/brain-view/]] - visualization of statistical results

[[/viewnup/]] - visualization of multiple volumes simultaneously

      <text xml:space="preserve">====NAME====
MNI-register  -  interactive volume display and point tagging program


====SYNOPSIS====
&lt;nowiki&gt;
register  [-version]] [-help]
 [-rgb]] [-cmap]] [-single] [-double]
 [-global variable value]]
 [volume1''filename]  [volume2''filename] [tags.tag]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====DESCRIPTION====
Register  is  an interactive graphics application.  It can
display one or two volumes (typically MR or PET), and  the
merged image of the two.  Some, but not all, versions will
allow switching between single and double buffer mode  and
between  RGB  and  colour  map  mode, so the options -rgb,
-cmap, -single, -double are useful for setting the initial
state  of the program.  There are three viewports for each
volume, showing tranverse, sagittal, coronal slices.   The
user  can  move  throughout  the  volumes,  and create tag
points within the volumes.  If enough tag points  for  two
volumes  are picked, then a transformation is computed for
registering the two volumes.  This transform  is  used  in
displaying  the  merged  image and in allowing the user to
start a process which resamples one of  the  volumes  into
the same space as the other.
A  vector volume will normally be converted to an RGB volume, on input. 
I don't know what that means in  terms  of
register's display.  Alternatively, the vector can be converted to a
scalar whose value is the mean of  the  vector
components,  by  setting  the global variable
Convert''vectors''to_rgb to FALSE.

====USER INTERFACE====
The user interface is a mouse-based interface composed  of
buttons,  sliders, and text entry.  Buttons can be pressed
with the left mouse button.  Text entries can  be  changed
by  pressing  the  left  mouse button on them, then typing
text.  Typing return signals the text entry is done.  Typing  escape
ends text editting without modifying the text.
The delete, cursor left, and  cursor  right  keys  may  be
used.   Ctrl-a and ctrl-e move the cursor to the beginning
and end of text, respectively.  Ctrl-u deletes all text in
the text entry.

====MAIN MENU====
Quit: Quits the program, after confirmation.

Resample and Load: Resamples the second volume to place it
in the same space as the first, according to the transformation
defined by the tag points. 
Resample  Filename: Text entry to set the name of the file
to create for the resampling.

Synced / Not Synced: Toggle switch to control whether  the
cursor  position  in  all volumes is enforced to always be
the same.

Flat / Interpolated: Not implemented yet.  Eventually will
control the interpolation method for display.
Colour  Map / RGB: Toggles between colour map mode (faster
updates) and RGB mode (truer colours).

Double / Single: Toggles between double and single buffer.

Load Tags: Loads a set of tag points into the program.

Tags  Filename:  Text  entry to set name of filename to be
used by load and save tags.  A default extension \&quot;.tag\&quot; is
provided automatically.

Save  Tags: Saves all active tag points to a file.  If one
volume is loaded, then a set of single tags is saved.   If
two  volumes  are  loaded, then a set of pairs of tags are
saved.

Save Transform: Saves the transform  defined  by  the  tag
points, if it exists.

Transform  Filename: Text entry to set name of filename to
be used by save transform.  A default extension \&quot;.xfm\&quot;  is
provided automatically.

Record  Tag:  Overwrites  the  current tag point positions
with the current positions within  the  volumes.   If  the
current  tag point is the end of the tags, then it creates
a new tag point.

Delete Tag: Deletes the current tag point.

Delete All Tags: Pops up a confirmation box  allowing  you
to delete all the tags.

Transform  Type: Pops up a dialog to select 6 parameter, 7
parameter, 12 parameter, or thin-plate  spline  non-linear
fitting.

Tags  In/Visible:  Toggles  the display of tag point positions on the slices.

Cursor In/Visible: Toggles the display of cursor crosshair
on the slices.

Interp: Flat/Smooth: Toggles the display of slices between
flat and smooth shading.  Smooth shading takes much longer
to  update  (a  few  seconds), but produces higher quality
images, especially noticeable when the images  are  zoomed
up.

RMS:  Displays the average RMS error of the tag points, if
a transform exists.

====VOLUME MENUS====
Voxel and World Position Readouts Displays the position of
the  volume  cursor  in  voxel and world coordinates.  The
positions can be changed numerically by  clicking  on  the
number and typing in the desired position.

Load Volume: Loads the specified volume.

Volume Filename: Specifies the volume filename.

Reset View: Resets the scale and translation of the slices
to fit in the viewports.

Filter Pops up a dialog window  that  selects  the  filter
type for each of the 3 views of the volume.  The filtering
applies across slices, but not within slice.   The  filter
types  are:  nearest  neighbour, linear interpolation, box
filter, triangle filter, and gaussian filter.

Under Colour: Sets the colour displayed for  voxels  whose
values are less than the range.

Over  Colour:  Sets  the colour displayed for voxels whose
values are greater than the range.

Colour Bar Slider: Sets the colour range.  The left  mouse
can  be used to drag the upper or lower limit.  The middle
mouse is used to move both at the same time.

Colour Coding Type: Sets the colour coding method  to  one
of gray scale, hot metal, spectral, red, green, or blue.

====MERGED MENU====
Voxel  and  World Position Readouts: Displays the position
of the volume cursor in voxel and world coordinates.   The
positions  can  be  changed numerically by clicking on the
number and typing in the desired position.

Reset View: Resets the scale and translation of the slices
to fit in the viewports.

Merge  Method  Buttons:  Sets  the  merge method to one of
blend, weighted, one on two, or two on one.  Blend  allows
blending  between  the two volumes.  Weighted allows arbitrary
weights for the two volumes.  One on two places volume  one  on  top
of  volume two, with volume two showing
through if volume one is out of range.  Two on one is  the
opposite.

Opacity Sliders Sets the weights of the two volumes.  Only
used if the merge method is blend or weighted.

====TAGS MENU====
Position: Displays and allows setting of tag positions.

Name: Sets the name of a tag.

On / Ignore: Sets the activity of a tag, whether  it  contributes to the transformation or not.

Dst:  Displays  the distance of the tag point in the first
volume from the position of the  transformed

====MOUSE AND KEYBOARD====
In the slice viewports, the following actions are valid:

Left Mouse: Sets the volume cursor position.

Middle Mouse: Moves slice  perpendicular  according  to  y
position of mouse.

Right  Mouse:  Adds  a new tag point at the current volume
cursor positions.

Shift/Ctrl/Alt Left Mouse: Translates the slice display

Shift/Ctrl/Alt  Middle  Mouse:  Zooms  the  slice  display
according to the y position of the mouse.

====VOLUME CACHING====
Register  has  the  ability  to handle volumes larger than
virtual memory by caching parts of the volume  in  memory.
The  current  default for deciding when to cache is volume
is 80 Megabytes.  See  the  documentation  of  the  source
libraries for MNI-register for more information.

Note that volume caching can have a radical effect on performance.
In some cases you may get much better results by disabling caching,
especially when working with volumes on NFS-mounted filesystems.

To disable caching, set VOLUME_CACHE_THRESHOLD environment variable to -1. I.E
&lt;code&gt;export VOLUME_CACHE_THRESHOLD=-1&lt;/code&gt; in bash

====FILES====
/usr/local/lib/register.globals

/usr/local/lib/register_UI.globals

== I'd like to wikiobookify &quot;Optimizing Code for Speed&quot; ==

Hi all, [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] should be wikibookified per the request of a moderator (which prevents making it a 100% completion status.). I don't mind it being split into pages, but I'd like to know how to do it exactly. Is there a script somewhere or a page explaining the process? [[User:Shlomif|Shlomif]] ([[User talk:Shlomif|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shlomif|contribs]])
:It's really simple. Just copy the contents of each of the sections into a subpage. for example, the introduction goes to [[Optimizing Code for Speed/Introduction]]. After you've done that, turn the book into a table of contents. You can see how this is done by looking at a random book. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

== Quizzes and Exams ==

Hey guys, do we have a multiple choice quiz function on the English wikibooks? On the Icelandic wikibooks, we have &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and we can produce a nice self assessment on Wikibooks. See [http://is.wikibooks.org/wiki/Enska/L%C3%A6r%C3%B0u_ensku_1/Spurningakeppni_A here]. If we do, what's the code?

== &quot;Future of Wikimedia&quot; ==

Came across this recently-created essay.  It's an interesting examination and helps foster thoughts on long-term planning.  See [[m:User:Yair rand/Future of Wikimedia]].  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 05:08, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
: That's a refreshing contrast to the usual &quot;we should put all our resources into Wikipedia, and the unimportant side projects are welcome to try to survive&quot;.  (It's also interesting to me as a Wikinewsie that, while I agree ''that'' it has massive potential, I disagree with or doubt other things said about it, and feel Wikinews's current key challenge is missing from the account... but I digress.&amp;nbsp;:-)

: Regarding Wikibooks, I'm interested that the author draws xyr correspondence between Wikibooks and Wikipedia by analogizing our books to Wikipedia's ''pages''.  I disagree with that.  An independent project has the psychologically significant property that its mainspace text wikilinks are internal to the project.
:* Wikinews suffers, psychologically, because its mainspace text wikilinks are often, in some articles almost entirely, to Wikipedia.  (I mean to do something about that... again I digress.)
:* Wikipedia mainspace text mostly wikilinks to Wikipedia pages.
:* Wiktionary mainspace text mostly wikilinks to Wiktionary pages.
:* But Wikibooks mainspace text, once it matures, mostly wikilinks ''within the same book''.  So each book feels like an independent project, analogous not to a single Wikipedia page but to the whole of Wikipedia &amp;mdash; only with such a small scope that it's almost impossible to build and maintain a significant contributing community.  This also explains the difficulty with a single person writing a book by xyrself.
: Moving forward, we may view ourselves as shepherds of a very large flock of tiny projects (though it may be less like herding sheep, and more like [[wikt:herding cats|herding cats]]).  Obvious subgoals include
:* helping users find a book they might be interested in contributing to.  (Goes back to my thoughts on keyword searching.&amp;nbsp;:-)
:* helping a book to establish and maintain a coherent style despite long dry spells between significant contributions:  it should be possible to pick up an &quot;abandoned&quot; book without having to reinvent the wheel (unless, of course, one wants to).  If I chose a random book, even a random book whose subject I'm competent in, and tried to contribute to it, I might have to either ignore the intended organization, and thus potentially degrade it, or spend a pile of up-front time figuring out how the book was meant to be organized and how, if at all, I feel it ought to be reorganized.  Even with that effort, subtle aspects of the previously envisioned organization might never become evident to me.  My point is, we want to make it easier for the past contributors to a book to successfully liaise with later contributors across time.
:* helping books to coordinate with each other, for synergy.  An obvious goal, that falls trippingly off the tongue and is very hard to know how to go about.

::Someone recently made the point that we're like a collection of wikis within one.  That matches up with your comments and recent discussions at [[Wikibooks talk:Incubator]].  I do find the essay's overall theme, &quot;a Wikipedia surrounded by successful projects will have a far better future than without&quot; to be insightful.  The cross-wiki watchlists and bug fixes/feature requests would help to encourage greater participation.  The software is deficient in supporting the idea of wikis within a wiki, from watching a book at once to per-book CSS/JavaScript.  As Wikipedia is quite mature, the opportunity for growth is at the other projects. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:48, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
== Page counts are incorrect ==

It appears that a definition I read somewhere about pages having to be in a content namespace and '''having a link to another page''' for them to be counted as content pages in [[Special:Statistics]] is correct.  I checked the value of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; before and after adding a link to a page with none ([[.NET Development Foundation/Iterators]]), for example, and it caused the value to increment.  It's too bad [[Special:DeadendPages]] is disabled.  The implications of this are that the values shown on the main page, in the local statistics, at stats.wikimedia.org, and especially in [[m:List of Wikimedia projects by size]] all severely under-report our progress.  [[A-level Chemistry/AQA/Module 5/Periodicity]] with all its content wouldn't be counted, for instance.  I've found that [[w:Wikipedia:Dead-end pages]] has instructions that will produce a list of pages that can then have navigation templates applied, rectifying the count. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:57, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::: yes, despite my glib answer I did think that... I struggled a bit to get beyond why any character (i.e., a page length &gt; 1) wouldn't be the most sensible option. Presumably there was some logic in choosing &quot;wikilink or comma&quot; as the options but I can't think of one. Perhaps a &lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be a good choice for us as most / all pages will include a transcluded template? &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:43, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
:::::::: I think the problem with wikilinks could be fixed for Wikibooks if the criteria for it were the use of wikilinks on a page OR a page is linked to from another page. Generally books have a table of contents with wikilinks to their pages, so if the criteria were updated to that than just having a table of contents should be enough to ensure all its pages were counted. Another option I can think of would be to count all pages which are categorized. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:46, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
::::::::: Wondering, could we hotwire {{tl|BookCat}} so that every page (or every content-space page) it's on would have a link, without causing that link to be obnoxiously visible?

:::::::::: If links through template inclusion were enough to have a page counted, I think most pages would already be counted due to the use of navigational aids. I wonder if page statistics even matter. Other than to perhaps determine average book length, I think how many books Wikibooks has is the statistics that is most relevant to us. I think counting pages based on template inclusion is a good idea, but I think multiple ways for a page to be counted would help to ensure more pages are counted without people having to go out of their way to make sure a page is counted. Another option could be the presents of any one of &quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, or &quot;.&quot; since at least one is guaranteed to be present in properly formed sentence. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:30, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
::::::::::: We can wish for many things, but any significant feature requests requiring new code rather than configuration changes seem to just flounder in the bug reporting system for years.  Changing this configuration value will at least increase accuracy in the meantime.  Page statistics do matter with regards to mindshare.  If charts at stats.wikimedia.org make it appear that we are stagnating, the foundation will not see it as a priority to have the developers handle the big feature requests outstanding for Wikibooks (such as watching a whole book at once), people primarily contributing to Wikipedia will not want to invest time in a &quot;second-class&quot; project, and changes to extensions such as Flagged Revisions will continue to not be discussed with us ahead of time. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:08, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

== 1.17 Update ==

Some issues I've seen, and I don't know whether or not they are temporary: [[Template:Navbox]] is not styled; the protection icons via [[Template:pp-meta]] are not in the correct location anymore, the default style of wikitables has changed (good thing, we don't need purple clashing with everything), the [[Template:Mbox|Mbox]] suite is not styled.

: I hope the issues are temporary as well. You could say there are two big changes actually. MediaWiki 1.17 is intended to speed up load time and decrease hits to their servers, if I understand correctly, by combining, compressing, and anticipating what JavaScript and CSS is or is not needed. I believe this second big change is intended to not to have any visibly noticeable affect though, besides people possibly noticing pages load faster. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:01, 11 February 2011 (UTC)

::I think I know what the problem is, though I only know of one solution to fix it.  The linked CSS pages at [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] are not loading.  Only solution would be to combine them again.

Would be a pity if all that effort to make our CSS more manageable and the discussion of specific CSS problems easier went to waste.

{{outdent|::::::::}}

I managed to attend the office hour IRC meeting this time. The good news, right now this bug is considered a blocker that will need to be fixed before 1.17 is released. Other than that, I think as a community, we probably need to discuss what if anything to do about scripts in user space. People sometimes copy scripts from other wikimedia projects, and don't keep up with changes made to fix bugs and updates to mediawiki. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:28, 14 February 2011 (UTC)

:We don't have any gadgets that reference scripts in user space, but my concern would be whether our gadgets are getting dated, with too many that won't work with Vector (and thus appear to be broken to new users using the default theme and not knowing about Monobook) and whether they will work after the update (or even whether they have been unmaintained and could break any day now&amp;mdash;Whiteknight's Visual Book Designer).  Short of using a bot to replace functions that are clear replacements, I feel scripts in user space should be maintained by the user.  If they were created across multiple wikis, [[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] has a bot that will update CSS/JS globally for a user seeking to update. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:50, 14 February 2011 (UTC)

:: People asked would things break at the meeting. 1.17 is intended to maintain backwards compatibility according to the mediawiki developers. I think the mediawiki developers don't expect things to break, but will fix them if they do and are reported to bugzilla. The old methods will still be around in 1.17.
:: When Wikibooks was updated to 1.16 I began to update scripts in MediaWiki space to keep on top of things. While I trust the mediawiki developers to keep things working right now, I have doubts the Wikibooks community will be informed should a decision be made to remove the old methods in a future release. I think the best way to avoid surprises is to update sooner rather than later as we know about it.
:: I think scripts in user space should be updated to avoid surprises too, I just don't know whose responsibility we should consider it to be to do so. People may want to know why things aren't working as they use to at some point. Should people be informed before, or should we be dealing with questions later? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:03, 14 February 2011 (UTC)

Transwiki imports are semi-broken with the update.  See [[bugzilla:27486|bug 27486]].  You'll have to choose &quot;all&quot; as the destination namespace to attribute Wikipedia properly as the source, for now, and you can't import to a different namespace than the one you're pulling from. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:25, 18 February 2011 (UTC)
== Books for examination ==

An IP editor has, over time, created several books that are often poorly translated.  Several pages of them were blatant copyright violations of Wikipedia content and I have deleted those pages but others are probably taken only partly from Wikipedia.  The content appears to be copied/translated from vi.wikibooks.org given that some of the images used here are used there in books that appear to cover the same topics.  This is likely the same editor who created ''Arithmatics'' which was moved to ''Arithmetics'' and [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Arithmetics|deleted]], ''Mathematics Fundamental'' which was moved to ''Mathematics Fundamentals'' and [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Mathematics Fundamentals|deleted]], and ''Physics Handbook'' which was [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Physics Handbook|deleted]].  I deleted the recently-created ''Electronics Course'' entirely as it was complete copy-pastes of ''Electronics Handbook''.  If this person created an account they could track their contribution history instead of forgetting and creating the same thing four months later under a new IP…  [[Arithmetic Course]], [[Calculus Course]], [[Trigonometry Course]], [[Geometry Course]], [[Electronics Handbook]], [[Physics Course]], [[Digital Electronics]], [[Communication Course]] are ones I can think of off the top of my head in case anyone sees any other problems that I've missed. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:58, 18 February 2011 (UTC)
:I believe all these books are being written by a guy called Quach Trung Thanh of Toronto, as several of them have this name as the author on their title page. In 2009 he used the accounts [[User:Quachtahnh]] and [[User:Qtt1964]], but since then he has prefered not to log in for some reason. As far as I can tell, he has never actually responded to any comments or requests. You have to admire his persistence though, even if his way of working can be rather exasperating.

== Statistics ==

It's been asked of me before and I recently got a request through OTRS for whether or not there's a tool for seeing page views at Wikibooks (we don't have [[Wikibooks:Statistics]]).  Previously I didn't know of any but I recently heard that a tool normally used just for Wikipedia can be &quot;hacked&quot; to output results for Wikibooks.
*Visit http://stats.grok.se/en.b/top for the top 1000 pages and ignore the &quot;Wikipedia article traffic statistics&quot; title.
*Add the page you want to know about in particular to the end of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://stats.grok.se/en.b/201102/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for February statistics.  The end is YYYYMM, so you can change the value in the address bar for older months.
The interface and forms of the site cannot be used; doing so reverts it back to Wikipedia.  Would you believe that 18 of the top 30 spots are held by pages in [[LaTeX]]? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:01, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

: Wikibooks use to keep track of pretty good statistics useful for book projects, until the format of the data dumps changed from SQL to XML. Would just require motivated individuals to do so again. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:45, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

: Here's a rough example of the type of statistics Wikibooks use to have:
:# [[File:Increase.svg|12px|link=]] Cookbook (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;+120&lt;/span&gt;)
:# [[File:Increase.svg|12px|link=]] LaTeX (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;+50&lt;/span&gt;)
:# [[File:Decrease.svg|12px|link=]] Rubik Puzzles (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;-20&lt;/span&gt;)

: Where the arrow indicated whether contributions went up or down since last time for the given book, and the number in parenthesis represented the contribution difference since last time. I'd like to see such a system in use again. I think it acts as a good motivator and can encourage people. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:28, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

::: Ya, I was thinking of ways statistics could be made easier for people without the skills to do so. I had thought to file a bug report requesting the statistics at http://stats.wikimedia.org be made available in xml dump form. I found bug [[bugzilla:26352|#26352]] though, which is a request to make statistics available by an API. I think that would be even better. Apparently there are dumps already available at http://dammit.lt/wikistats/ for the page view statistics of all projects. I would like it better if dumps were separated by project though. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:39, 21 February 2011 (UTC)
== Disappearance of Private WikiBook ==

I had created a Wikibook that was 56 pages in length. I attempted to create a Chapter and the book suddenly had no content. When I was in a Wikipedia article, the book creator showed that I had 56 pages, however, when I went to add page, the book was empty of content. Are there length restrictions on Wikibooks, and if so, can advance notification be given by the system administrator so that the book can be saved before elimination? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:98.94.81.35|98.94.81.35]] ([[User talk:98.94.81.35|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/98.94.81.35|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== editing and viewing problem ==

Hi,

I have problem with viewing discussion pages and editing some pages.
It is only in english wikibooks and only on some pages.
Like here : [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set]].

I see:
* inactive Talk tab , not active Discussion tab
* inactive Edit tab
* active edit link which opens &quot;Editing Null&quot; page

What is a reason of this and how I can resolve it ?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Physical Significance of Poles and Zeros ==

With respect to this article on poles and zeros of the transfer function, I find that the notion of poles and zeros in case of a simple transfer function is explained in detail and I specifically liked the part which details the &quot;meaning of a pole&quot;, where the exponential and the sinusoidal nature of the response are decoupled and explained clearly.

However, I feel that it is also relevant to highlight the physical significance of the poles and zeros of a transfer function in this article. Personally, I have understood the physical significance of a pole as I have mentioned below. However, I still haven't understood the physical significance of a zero.

Physical Significance of a Pole:
We can relate the statement &quot;An (open loop)system has a pole at ω(rad/s)&quot;, to an object which has a natural frequency of oscillation of ω(rad/s). Furthermore, from the fundamental concept of resonance in physics, this object with a natural frequency &quot;ω&quot;, will attain resonance when excited by an input of frequency &quot;ω&quot;. And we know that resonance corresponds to maximum energy transfer. From the perspective of an (open loop)system, a pole at &quot;ω&quot;, mathematically means that the denominator of the transfer function will become zero and hence, the transfer function reaches infinity. For practical reasoning, we can consider that, infinity in mathematical terms corresponds to some large energy physically. Accordingly, when the (open loop)system is excited by an input which has a frequency &quot;ω&quot;, then there will be a large amount of energy transfer from input to output, which we also call resonance, and hence, the transfer function takes a value of infinity mathematically.

Kindly let me know with your feedbacks about my above view of the physical significance of a pole. I am equally keen to learn and know about other physical interpretations of pole and specifically a zero.

Thank You.Rajeev singh

﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Advanced Haskell}}

== Introduction ==

Arrows are a generalization of monads: every monad gives rise to an arrow, but not all arrows give rise to monads. They serve much the same purpose as monads -- providing a common structure for libraries -- but are more general. In particular they allow notions of computation that may be partially static (independent of the input) or may take multiple inputs. If your application works fine with monads, you might as well stick with them. But if you're using a structure that's very like a monad, but isn't one, maybe it's an arrow.


== 介绍 ==
箭头（arrow)是单子（monad）的抽象：所有的单子都是箭头，但不是所有的箭头都是单子他们都为一个目的设计 -- 提供一个通用的结构来构建库 --但箭头抽象度更高。  特别的，箭头允许为那写非全静态的（取决于输入）或者是多输入的计算做上记号。 如果能用单子写出不错的程序，你会喜欢上它的。但如果你只是写出了一些像单子的东西，那它可能是箭头

== &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt; and the arrow tail ==

Let's begin by getting to grips with the arrows notation.  We'll work with the simplest possible arrow there is (the function) and build some toy programs strictly in the aims of getting acquainted with the syntax.

Fire up your text editor and create a Haskell file, say toyArrows.hs:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}

import Control.Arrow (returnA)

idA :: a -&gt; a
idA = proc a -&gt; returnA -&lt; a

plusOne :: Int -&gt; Int
plusOne = proc a -&gt; returnA -&lt; (a+1)
&lt;/source&gt;

These are our first two arrows.  The first is the identity function in arrow form, and second, slightly more exciting, is an arrow that adds one to its input.  Load this up in GHCi, using the -XArrows extension and see what happens.

&lt;pre&gt;
% ghci -XArrows toyArrows.hs   
   ___         ___ _
  / _ \ /\  /\/ __(_)
 / /_\// /_/ / /  | |      GHC Interactive, version 6.4.1, for Haskell 98.
/ /_\\/ __  / /___| |      http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
\____/\/ /_/\____/|_|      Type :? for help.

Loading package base-1.0 ... linking ... done.
Compiling Main             ( toyArrows.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt; idA 3
3
*Main&gt; idA &quot;foo&quot;
&quot;foo&quot;
*Main&gt; plusOne 3
4
*Main&gt; plusOne 100
101
&lt;/pre&gt;

Thrilling indeed.  Up to now, we have seen three new constructs in the arrow notation:
* the keyword &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;
* the imported function &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt;

Now that we know how to add one to a value, let's try something twice as difficult: adding TWO:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 plusOne = proc a -&gt; returnA -&lt; (a+1)
 plusTwo = proc a -&gt; plusOne -&lt; (a+1)
&lt;/source&gt;

One simple approach is to feed (a+1) as input into the &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; arrow.  Note the similarity between &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;plusTwo&lt;/code&gt;.  You should notice that there is a basic pattern here which goes a little something like this: proc FOO -&gt; SOME_ARROW -&lt; (SOMETHING_WITH_FOO)

{{Exercises|1=
# &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; is an arrow, so by the pattern above &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt; must be an arrow too.  What do you think &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt; does?
}}

== &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation ==

Our current implementation of &lt;code&gt;plusTwo&lt;/code&gt; is rather disappointing actually... shouldn't it just be &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; twice?  We can do better, but to do so, we need to introduce the do notation:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 plusTwoBis = 
  proc a -&gt; do b &lt;- plusOne -&lt; a
               plusOne -&lt; b
&lt;/source&gt;

Now try this out in GHCi:

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :r
Compiling Main             ( toyArrows.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt; plusTwoBis 5
7
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use this do notation to build up sequences as long as you would like:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
plusFive =
 proc a -&gt; do b &lt;- plusOne -&lt; a
              c &lt;- plusOne -&lt; b
              d &lt;- plusOne -&lt; c
              e &lt;- plusOne -&lt; d
              plusOne -&lt; e
&lt;/source&gt;

== Monads and arrows ==

:''FIXME: I'm no longer sure, but I believe the intention here was to show what the difference is having this proc notation instead to just a regular chain of dos''

==Merge with Lua Programming / Embedding Lua / Lua components written in C&amp;C++==

I support the merge of Lua programming and Lua Programming, with Lua programming's content largely superseding Lua Programming's.  Lua Programming does have a section called 'solutions' which suggests there should be pages about writing Lua components in C and C++ and embedding and embedding Lua in C and C++.

I notice that you have removed the &quot;programming solutions&quot; section. This has left a hidden section &quot;solution&quot;s, which is no longer accessible via the book indexes. I'll put this back for now, until the indexes are fixed.

This solution uses magic numbers (the number of attempts) buried in the code, which isn't good practice. It would be better to define the number of attempts at the top of the program. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:34, 25 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== thank you ==

Thank you for improving the [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller]] Wikibook.
I hope you find that and other Wikibooks useful.
I hope you periodically stop by and help us, a little step at a time, improve these rough drafts until we have amazingly useful, insightful, and easy-to-understand books.

==Chapter 1==

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 I remember two childhoods. I had two. Whether this is a fortunate thing or not I really can't say. Fortune is only apparent in life's result. Certainly, we cannot know our fortunes until they have become history. Looking backward it is difficult to imagine my past as belonging to me at all. Since my life is hardly over it would be hasty to state with any certainty of fortune or misfortune.
   There are fleeting fragments of life, here, where I call home. Life with my mother and father. Long summers with my brothers and sisters under the blue skies of the great northwestern prairies. This makes it very difficult really to relate this story. Difficult to relate much of my life prior to age 5 or so. Not difficult for lack of remembering, but difficult because I can't tell if those memories belong to me or are part of some mental delusion that I have allowed myself to fall victim to.
   My first memory of my life, here, is being dropped off on a corner in a small, rural, Canadian town. I had been thoroughly instructed where to walk, the house number, where I would live, the people I would come in contact with there. As the small van drove away, I followed my instructions. I walked down the street. I walked to a house. I climbed the stairs. I opened the front door. I entered the house.
   From the front door I passed through a small boot room, at the top of the front step. It was summer, the weather was dry and my shoes were not soiled. I saw no reason to remove them. I decided that it was best not to remove them, in case I needed to beat a hasty retreat.
   Beyond the boot room was what appeared to be a kitchen. There was a woman working there, preparing the evening meal. I waited pensively in the doorway assessing how she would respond to my initial presence. She glanced my direction after noticing, perhaps sensing, me standing there. She looked at me briefly. There was a subtle question that crossed her face momentarily and then it was gone again. Something subconscious perhaps.
   I felt some relief when she looked away to her work once again.
   &quot;Go wash your hands for dinner.&quot;, she said. These were the first words I remember my mother speaking.
   I thought to comply quickly and do as she wished. Not being intimately familiar with the layout of the house was the next problem I would need to resolve. I moved past her, through the room to one of two other doors on the opposite wall. Both were closed. I chose the door to the right. It opened to a basement stairway. 
   &quot;Did you hear me?&quot;, the woman said, &quot;Do I need to repeat myself?&quot;. She turned and pointed to the other door. &quot;Hands!&quot;, she said. There was a threatening maternal undertone to her voice.
   I quickly closed the stairway door and moved to open the other. As I passed from the kitchen she returned to her work. &quot;Use soap this time&quot;, she said.
   Beyond the second door was a short hallway. A brief search found me in a simple washroom with basic bathtub, toilet and sink. The fixtures were utilitarian and clean. There was a bar of soap on the sink which I used to wash my hands, and a single towel hanging on a peg. As I dried my hands on the towel I could hear some commotion coming from the kitchen. I replaced the towel to the peg and returned to the kitchen.
   At the door was another woman who seemed very upset. &quot;I saw them&quot;, she was saying, &quot;They snatched him and drove away.&quot;
   My mother was trying to calm her. &quot;No&quot;, she said,&quot;He's here. Look&quot;. Mother pointed at me.
   When the other woman saw me standing there she quieted and a quizzical look transformed her.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Merge Proposal==
I have proposed a merge from '''[[Issue Guide]]''' to [[Debate/Topics]], as the Issue Guide is put forth as a debater's guide to controversial issues. I believe the '''[[Debate]]''' wikibook has a superior structure which may benefit from the content of the [[Issue Guide]]. In turn, I hope this merger will drive more traffic and interest to the debate book, which has the potential to be a very helpful wikibook. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 21:26, 26 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Writing systems==
Please note, many resources include written ASL. ASL is often written with English words in all capital letters, which is known as ''glossing''. This is, however, a method used simply to teach the structure of the language. ASL is a visual language, not a written language. There is no one-to-one correspondence between words in ASL and English, and much of the inflectional modulation of ASL signs is lost.

There are two true writing systems in use for ASL: a phonemic Stokoe notation, which has a separate symbol or diacritic mark for every phonemic hand shape, motion, and position (though it leaves something to be desired in the representation of facial expression), and a more popular iconic system called SignWriting, which represents each sign with a rather abstract illustration of its salient features. SignWriting is commonly used for student newsletters and similar purposes.

The text definitions also have letter or number sign images to aid in visualizing the sign. This will allow you to quickly locate a word, read how to sign the word, and choose to view the animated sign if you wish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Selene (In Greek: Σελήνη) was the goddess of the moon. Her parents were the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and her siblings were Helius, sun god, and Eos, the dawn. She is known to have many love affairs, the most known one is with the shepard Endymion. Others are with Zeus, which gave her three daughters, and with Pan, who gave her a herd of white oxen. 

Selene appears as a young women who travels on a silver chariot drawn by two horses. She is said to wear robes, carry a torch, and wear a half moon on top of her head. 

In Selene's affair with Endymion, she seduces him while he's asleep. This results in the birth of 50 daughters. It's said that her moon rays fall onto sleeping mortals, and her kisses on Endymion.

      <comment>/* The diagonals and circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral */ Expand</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Take any quadrilateral ABCD.  Write AB=a, BC=b, CD=c, DA=a; &amp;sigma; = {{frac|1|2}}(a+b+c+d); area of ABCD = S.

Note that a+b+c-d = 2(&amp;sigma;-d) and similarly for the other sides.

The diagonals of ABCD are AC and BD.  Let the angle between them be &amp;theta;.  Then S = {{frac|1|2}}AC.BD.sin(&amp;theta;).

If ABCD is convex and the diagonals intersect at P, this is easily proved by considering the four triangles ABP, BCP, CDP, DAP since S is the sum of the areas of these four triangles.  IF ABCD is not convex, then one of the vertices, say C, must lie inside the triangle ABD.  We then find S as the area of ABD less the area of BCD.

Let angle A+C = 2&amp;alpha;.  To find S in terms of the sides and alpha;.

We can find BD&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by applying the cosine theorem to either of the triangles BAD, BCD.  This means that

:a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-2ad.cos(A) = b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-2bc.cos(C)

so

:a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2ad.cos(A)-2bc.cos(C) ... (i)

Also

:S = area(BAD) + area(BCD) = {{frac|1|2}}ad.sin(A) + {{frac|1|2}}bc.sin(C)

so

:4S = 2ad.sin(A) + 2bc.sin(C) ... (ii)

Taking (ii)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (i)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

:16S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 8abcd.cos(A+C)

But

:cos(A+C) = cos(2&amp;alpha;) = 2cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;alpha;)-1

so

:16S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4(ad+bc)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - (a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 16abcd.cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;alpha;).

Simplifying,

:S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (&amp;sigma;-a)(&amp;sigma;-b)(&amp;sigma;-c)(&amp;sigma;-d) - abcd.cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;alpha;).

This expression becomes even simpler for a cyclic quadrilateral, because then cos(&amp;alpha;) = 0 so the last term disappears.

== The diagonals and circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral ==
In the expression (i) above, for a cyclic quadrilateral cos(C) = -cos(A), so

:&lt;math&gt;2(ad+bc)\cos(A) = a^2+d^2-b^2-c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

From the cosine theorem,

:&lt;math&gt;BD^2 = a^2+d^2-2ad.\cos(A) = a^2+d^2 - \frac{ad(a^2+d^2-b^2-c^2)}{ad+bc} = \frac{(ab+cd)(ac+bd)}{ad+bc}&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly,

:&lt;math&gt;AC^2 = \frac{(ab+cd)(ad+bc)}{ab+cd}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus AC.BD = ac+bd (as we already knew) and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AC}{BD} = \frac{ad+bc}{ab+cd)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The circumcircle of ABCD is also the circumcircle of triangle ABD, so

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{BD}{2\sin(A)} = \frac{(ad+bc)BD}{2(ad+bc)\sin(A)} = \frac{(ad+bc)BD}{4S} = \frac{1}{4S}\sqrt{(ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tan^2 \left( \frac{B}{2} \right) = \frac{(\sigma-a)(\sigma-b)}{(\sigma-c)(\sigma-d)}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Further results ==
If a quadrilateral is '''circumcyclic''', i.e. such that a circle can be inscribed in it touching all four sides, then a+c=b+d.  This is easily proved by noting that the lengths of the two tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length.

The radius of the inscribed circle is called the '''inradius''' and equals S/&amp;sigma;.

'''Theorem:''' If a quadrilateral ABCD is both cyclic and circumcyclic, then

:&lt;math&gt;\tan^2 \left(\frac{A}{2} \right) = \frac{bc}{ad}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' Since ABCD is cyclic,

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(A) = \frac{a^2+d^2-b^2-c^2}{2(ad+bc)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since a+c=b+d, a-d=b-c, i.e. a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2(ad-bc).  Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(A) = \frac{ad-bc}{ad+bc}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan^2 \left(\frac{A}{2} \right) = \frac{1-\cos(A)}{1+\cos(A)} = \frac{bc}{ad}&lt;/math&gt;.

If a quadrilateral ABCD is both cyclic and circumcyclic, then its area is √(abcd) and inradius is 2√(abcd)/(a+b+c+d).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Anemoi were a group of wind gods, each with his own direction. Aeolus, the God of Storms, was the leader or the Anemoi and the only member who controlled all four directions. Boreas controlled the north wind and brought winter, Notus controlled the south wind and brought autumn. Zephyrus brought the west wind and brought spring and early summer. Eurus controlled the east wind. 

In Roman mythology, the Anemoi were the Venti, Latin for &quot;wind&quot;. They all had different names but had similar occupations with the Greek versions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Titans, often called as the Elder Gods, are the children of Uranus (Ορανος) . Their role/function was to oppose the gods run by Zeus and the other Olympians. They are not simply big gods. That role is for the Gigantes who came out of a god's blood. The Titans were involved in epic wars, many of which have been written about. Some sons of Titans include important gods like Prometheus and Atlas.

The new cover looks nice, but the title is wrong.  This isn't &quot;Start to Finish&quot;.  :)  You might want to fix that and re-upload?  [[User:Sendoshin|Sendoshin]] ([[User talk:Sendoshin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sendoshin|contribs]]) 21:26, 27 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Anemoi were a group of wind gods, each with his own direction. Aeolus, the God of Storms, was the leader or the Anemoi and the only member who controlled all four directions. Boreas controlled the north wind and brought winter, Notus controlled the south wind and brought autumn. Zephyrus brought the west wind and brought spring and early summer. Eurus controlled the east wind.

In Roman mythology, the Anemoi were the Venti, Latin for &quot;wind&quot;. They all had different names but had similar occupations with the Greek versions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hades, the god of the underworld, was the oldest son of the Titans Kronos and Rhea. He had three older sisters, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, as well as two younger brothers, Poseidon and Zeus. After the Olympian gods, led by Zeus, overthrew the Titans, the three brothers drew lots to determine where each would rule. Zeus got the sky, Poseidon got the seas, and Hades received the underworld, the unseen realm to which the dead go upon leaving the world.

Hades ruled the House of the Dead, also called Hades. Besides Heracles, the only other living persons who ventured to the Underworld were all heroes: Odysseus, Aeneas (accompanied by the Sibyl), Orpheus, and Theseus.

He is married to Persephone, daughter of Demeter, who spends half of each year in the underworld and half in the upper world. While she is in the underworld her mother mourns her giving earth winter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dijkstra's algorithm ==

The centrality measures requires finding the shortest path from one node to another. The most widely-used algorithm is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm Dijkstra's algorithm]. A greedy algorithm, the Dijkstra's algorithm starts at the source node and gradually spans a tree to all nodes reachable. Nodes that provide the shortest distance in that round are added to the tree by sequence. 

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is regarded as one of the most efficient algorithms to calculate the shortest path.  

For the directed graph &lt;math&gt;{G}&lt;/math&gt; defined previously, a shortest (travel time) path between origin node &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to every other node in the network can be calculated using this algorithm.  Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; be the distance matrix of &lt;math&gt;{G}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; representing the length (travel time) of the links from node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, if nodes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt; j&lt;/math&gt; are not connected then the corresponding element in &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a very large number.  

Say the set of nodes &lt;math&gt;{N}&lt;/math&gt; is divided into two different subsets &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\Gamma_r}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of nodes to which shortest path from &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is known and the complementary set of &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{\Gamma_r}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let   represent a vector of permanent labels of nodes corresponding to every node in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt;.  The permanent label of a node is the shortest distance of the node from the origin node &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  Say &lt;math&gt;{\Phi_r}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of nodes that are adjacent to nodes in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; along the shortest path.  Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; be a vector of temporary labels of nodes corresponding to nodes in &lt;math&gt;{\Gamma_r}&lt;/math&gt;.  The steps involved in the algorithm are explained below.

#	Initialize &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r} = {r},  = {0}, {\Phi_r} = {0}&lt;/math&gt;, and all elements of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; are assigned a large number.
#	Find all the child nodes that are adjacent to any node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; – parent node - in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; that are not already in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; using the distance matrix &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;.  Then calculate a temporary label to each of the child node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; by summing the permanent label of the parent node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from the vector &lt;math&gt;\Pi_r&lt;/math&gt;  and length of the link &lt;math&gt;i \rarr j \Delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.
#	Select the node with smallest temporary label and add it at the end of the set &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt;, deleting it in &lt;math&gt;{\Gamma_r}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then add the corresponding parent node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; at the end of the set &lt;math&gt;{\Phi_r}&lt;/math&gt; and corresponding temporary label to &lt;math&gt;\Pi_r&lt;/math&gt;  .  With the new &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; repeat the steps from 2 until there are no elements in &lt;math&gt;{\Gamma_r}&lt;/math&gt;.

To get the length of the shortest path from the origin node r to any other node in the network, look for the position of the destination node in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding element in   gives the length of the shortest path.  To get the shortest path itself, look for the position of the destination node s in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; and read the element that occupies that same position in &lt;math&gt;{\Phi_r}&lt;/math&gt; then again look for the position of this new node in &lt;math&gt;{\Omega_r}&lt;/math&gt; and repeat the process until the node &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is reached in &lt;math&gt;{\Phi_r}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. tracing the shortest path backward until the origin is reached.  The links that lie along the shortest path from origin node &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to destination node s calculated this way are assigned to a set &lt;math&gt;{K_{rs}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above algorithm is done for a single origin node r, but the shortest path from every node to every other node is required for trip distribution and traffic assignment.  In that case perform Dijkstra’s algorithm for every node in the graph &lt;math&gt;{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

Further details of the algorithm can be found in &lt;ref&gt; Dijkstra's algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Community detection ==

The goal of community detection is to cluster the network into groups of nodes that have few connections between these nodes. &lt;ref&gt;Newman, M.E. Networks. 2010. Oxford: Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;. A cluster is a collection of nodes that are similar in terms of connections. One basic algorithm to identify clusters is the hierarchical clustering algorithm which creates tree-structure hierarchy of clusters. The leaves are the nodes and the root is a single cluster consisting of all nodes. The hierarchies of leaves show the communities of different levels. The details about the algorithm can be found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis#Hierarchical_clustering Hierarchical clustering ].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Dropbear==

[https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html Dropbear] is a smaller, modular, open source SSH2 client and server available for all regular POSIX platforms.  Dropbear is partially a derivative of OpenSSH.  It is often used in embedded systems because very small binaries can be produced.  Functions that are not needed can be left out of the binary, leaving a lean executable.  Thus a working server can be boiled down to 110KB by trimming away various functions.  

Many distributions and products use Dropbear.  This includes OpenWRT, gumstix, Tomato Firmware, PSPSSH, DSLinux, Meego, OpenMoko, Ångström (for Zaurus),  ttylinux, Sisela, Trinux, SliTaz, Netcomm, US Robotics, some Motorola phones, and many, many more.

==Tectia==

[http://www.tectia.com/en.iw3 Tectia] is from SSH Communications Security Corporation which is based in Finland.  It is a closed-source SSH client and server with FIPS support.

==Solaris Secure Shell (SunSSH)==

[http://wikis.sun.com/display/SunSSH/SunSSH+FAQ Sun SSH] is fork of OpenSSH 2.3, with many subsequent changes.

* Help content should be updated as no maintenance performed after automatic imports from Meta halted
* Pull content from mature Wikipedia help pages with attribution in edit summary and localize to Wikibooks
* Go through Wikibooks namespace for pages that should be in help namespace
* Move FAQs to subpages of [[Help:FAQ]], condense to one link in sidebar nav (and [[Help:Contents]] if more is added?), and create [[Template:Wikibooks FAQ]] to link them and provide search box.
* Potentially use a horizontal [[Template:Navbox|navbox]] instead of the layout currently at [[Template:Wikibooks help]] to permit links to some of the Help pages linked from [[Help:Contents]] and not the template, possibly using [[Template:Navbox with collapsible groups]] if it gets too large
* Potentially redesign [[Help:Contents]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Update Gadgets and User Scripts ==
MediaWiki 1.17 introduced a new [[mw:ResourceLoader/Default modules|JavaScript library backend]] based on [http://docs.jquery.com jQuery]. Many parts of the [[mw:ResourceLoader/JavaScript Deprecations|old library]] are now deprecated and will be removed in the future. To keep from being caught by surprise, people are strongly advised to update Gadgets and user scripts.

Below is an assessment of pages which are likely to be affected in the future if not updated.

[[w:WordPress|WordPress]] has evolved beyond its humble beginnings as a blogging platform and fully into the arena of Content Management Systems. What sets WordPress apart is its elegant administrative interface, rich ecosystem of plugins and themes, and ease of extending.
   
This book will describe how WordPress works and how to successfully extend it.

If this section is to be included for the open-sourced textbook, I would recommend that answers be supplied with rationale behind them, to assist the reader in better understanding the concepts behind different measures of centrality.&lt;br&gt;
houl0078, 2:19pm 2/28/2011

I would also recommend fleshing out the discussion of algorithms with a few more examples, including the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and nearest neighbor algorithm, which may be particularly useful for transportation networks. A good list of important basic algorithms (and links to their Wikipedia sites) may be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#Algorithms here].

There was, for some years, a section of the page called ''Symbols'', just before ''Further reading'', containing evidently notes on what was planned for it:
: ==Symbols==
: [How we label and reference points, lines, and planes.]
Since the section was removed, not unreasonably, I'm noting it here so the thought is visibly preserved.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:44, 16 October 2013 (UTC)</text>

This book is on ''three-dimensional electron microscopy'' (sometime referred to as 3DEM) that includes both cryo-electron microscopy and cyro-electron tomography. The goal of this book is to take all of the material on 3DEM and put it into an organized form. This organized book can then in turn be used for training new scientists in the field, teaching a course on 3DEM, or just expanding ones knowledge on the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome ==

This is book idea that was proposed to me (Prof. Neil Voss; Roosevelt University) by my former advisor Professor Bridget Carragher (Scripps Research). Dr. Carragher was discussing the idea with Professor David DeRosier (Brandeis University) who agreed to contribute a monograph on Fourier transforms that he had been working on. Our idea is to start with the monograph and expand it cover the entire field. We welcome any other people to help contribute to this project.

The book is not named cryo-electron microscopy, because we intend to include concept from negative stain electron microscopy as well. So, we felt that ''Three Dimensional Electron Microscopy'' was an ideal name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What You Need To Know About A Fourier Transform ==
'''By David J DeRosier&lt;br /&gt;

Professor Emeritus, &lt;br /&gt;
Department of Biology &amp; Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, &lt;br /&gt;
Brandeis University''' 

=== Introduction ===

Most students of molecular electron microscopy keep well away from learning about Fourier transforms.  At schools whose aim is to train students in molecular electron microscopy, however, the gathered class must sit through a lecture or two on the Fourier transform.  A mathematical lecture on the topic is usually more satisfying to the faculty than it is to students, who use the occasion to day dream or simply sleep having been up half the previous night at some bar.  I guess it is not obvious why such a mathematical operation would be of interest to those who simply wants to know the molecular architecture of some cellular machine.

My aim is to tell you why you want a Fourier transform of your electron micrographs, what you can learn from a Fourier transform, how to think about a Fourier transform without having to waddle through the mathematics, and how to generate a Fourier transform when you want one.  Since microscopy and image analysis are visual, I am presenting many of the lessons as pictures.  I do not intend to prove the properties of various transforms but rather to show the results.  There are lots of books on the theory.


===Background on Fourier Transforms ===
Fourier Transforms are a tool used to analyze complicated data. They are, in essence, a mathematical function that transforms spatial or time based data into amplitudes and frequencies. This allows for the data to be analyzed at a glance, and more importantly makes it very easy to adjust features of the signal.  Uses of the Fourier transforms include processing and analysis of sound, video, images, and other large, complex sources of data. The technology transition from analog technologies to digital has ushered in an increased use of this technique. Since the original algorithm for the transform is very long and computer resource intensive, a computer friendly version known as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was independently invented by both J.W. Cooley and J.W. Tukey in 1965. 


In transmission electron microscopy image analysis, fourier transforms are heavily utilized to remove the low resolution data from a collected image. Removing the low resolution data, which is the center of the image produced by a fast fourier transforms, is a way of increasing the contrast on images without losing much of the identifying information. It is often necessary to remove some of the high resolution data, which is found at the outside of the fast fourier transform, since the method of collection in a tunneling electron microscope often distorts the data. The need to do this step varies with the quality of the image recorded. For example, having a direct detector instead of film will greatly increase image quality and will allow more of the data transformed to be kept, which leads to a higher resolution 3D reconstruction.


Taking data from an electron microscopy image and transforming also allows for greater ease in 3D reconstruction. Fourier transforms are completely and easily reversible even after images have been processed, so frequently 3D reconstructions are generated with the fourier transforms of 2D images.


Fourier Transforms involve many of different types of math, but the most common element that is seen in fourier transform math is complex numbers. Complex numbers are usually seen in some form or another but a common form of this is  . Now i stands for imaginary number. You might be asking yourself why involve such numbers or complex math altogether. Well its simple really, complex numbers make things go together really well. Rather than laying hundreds of equations and piling on thousands upon thousands of different mathematical proofs for you to see and understand, complex numbers shorten it and make it look a bit more elegant. Complex numbers is just one element that shows up in fourier equations and transforms. 


Figure 1: Fourier Series formula, Purdue University. 


Figure 1 listed above gives an apt description of what the formula for Fourier series looks like. Its expressed in sines and cosines, which are commonly found in frequencies. Fourier series and transforms allow any type of data to be converted into frequencies and amplitudes and it also allows us to delete certain frequencies away from the data. This allows us to clean up most of the data or image in our case. This is extremely helpful in electron microscopy as, many images taken from a EM are littered with aberrations or under focusing on the image. The fourier transform allows us to convert the images we see in to frequencies or amplitudes and allows us to modify or “delete” parts of the frequency away in order to clear up the image and correct any aberrations seen or found in the data. Then running an inverse of the fourier transform, turns the frequency back into an image with the corrections made.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Separating the elements of a structure ==

The comma [[/symbol/]] is used to separate the elements of a [[/structure/]]:

 student {
   name = &quot;Bob&quot;
   age = 19,
   gender = &quot;M&quot;,  -- A comma after the last element is optional
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Referencing table elements ==

The [[/dot/]] symbol can be used to separate [[/element/]]s and [[/subelement/]]s from the [[/table/]] name when referencing table [[/element/]]s:

 print (student.age)    -- we could have used alternative syntax: print (student[&quot;age&quot;])

We welcome and appreciate [[Special:Contributions/Xuefei|your contributions]], but some of your recent edits had to be undone. Please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|What is Wikibooks?]] to learn more about what contributions are beneficial to Wikibooks. Wikibooks is not a collection of links; nor should it be used as a platform for advertising or promotion, and doing so is contrary to the goals of this project. Because Wikibooks uses nofollow tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel a link or content should be added to a page, please discuss it on the page's talk page before reinserting it. Please take a look at the [[Wikibooks:Welcome|welcome]] page to learn more about contributing to this project. Thank you. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:29, 1 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">PCR is used to amplify a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target). Most PCR methods typically amplify DNA fragments of up to ~10 kilo base pairs (kb), although some techniques allow for amplification of fragments up to 40 kb in size.
A basic PCR set up requires several components and reagents. These components include:
DNA template that contains the DNA region (target) to be amplified.
Two primers that are complementary to the 3' (three prime) ends of each of the sense and anti-sense strand of the DNA target.
Taq polymerase or another DNA polymerase with a temperature optimum at around 70 °C.
Deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks from which the DNA polymerases synthesizes a new DNA strand.
Buffer solution, providing a suitable chemical environment for optimum activity and stability of the DNA polymerase.
Divalent cations, magnesium or manganese ions; generally Mg2+ is used, but Mn2+ can be utilized for PCR-mediated DNA mutagenesis, as higher Mn2+ concentration increases the error rate during DNA synthesis
Monovalent cation potassium ions.
The PCR is commonly carried out in a reaction volume of 10–200 μl in small reaction tubes (0.2–0.5 ml volumes) in a thermal cycler. The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the Peltier effect which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube. Older thermocyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.

==Protocol==
PCR for DNA amplification was done as per the method of describe here. The templates were 10 ng of plasmid DNA for routine PCR, 0.5 to 1 μg of genomic DNA for genomic PCR, 1 μl of RT reaction for RT-PCR or a part of the bacterial colony for bacterial colony PCR in a 25 to 50 l reaction. PCR was done in a reaction mix containing 1X PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% w/v gelatin), 250 M each of the dNTPs, 250 ng each of primers and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. When using Pfu DNA polymerase 500 ng of each primer and a hot start for Pfu reaction was carried out. The samples were then overlaid with mineral oil to prevent evaporation during cycling, 35 step cycles were carried out after initial denaturation at 94C for 15 min. Each step cycle consisted of denaturation, 94C for 30 sec, annealing (4C below Tm of primer) for 30 sec or 1 min and extension, 72C for 1 min. A final extension was given at 72C for 7 min for completion of truncated products. For preparing radiolabelled probe by PCR, high specific activity was ensured by adding only 2.5 M each of the dNTPs and primer concentration was reduced to100 ng each. 25Ci (2.5 l) of -32P dATP was generally used for incorporation. A 50 l reaction volume was used and all other conditions of step-cycles were identical to cold PCR.  

Inverse PCR was carried similar to conventional PCR, except that the divergent primers would be used instead of the conventional convergent primers used for routine amplification. Also the DNA polymerase like pfu or pfu Turbo, which give blunt end amplification products should be used. Inverse PCR is used for generating insertion, deletion or point mutations on any desired DNA fragment. Multiplex PCR was carried out by mixing multiple primer sets for different genes in the same reaction mix and PCR was carried out at as a single reaction.

      <comment>/* Preparation of competent E. coli DH5-α cells using rubidium chloride */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Depending on the efficiency of transformation required for various cloning procedures, competent cells were made by two different methods.
	
==Preparation of competent E. coli JM109 cells using rubidium chloride==	
A single colony of E. coli DH5-α, maintained on a fresh LB agar plate was inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium and incubated at 37C with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 hrs. One ml of this overnight culture was inoculated into 35 ml of LB medium and incubated at 37C at 200 rpm till the OD600 reached 0.55. The culture was then chilled on ice for 15 min and the cells were pelleted at 1,500g for 15 min at 4C in an HB 4 rotor in a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant was completely drained and the pellet was gently resuspended in 10 ml of ice cold  buffer R1 (100 mM RbCl, 50 mM MnCl2.4H20., 30 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM CaCl2.2H20, 15% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cells were then distributed into prechilled microfuge tubes in 100 µl aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  70C. The competent cells prepared by this method generally yielded a transformation efficiency of 5 x 106 to 1 x 107 colonies/µg of pUC18 DNA and were stable upto three months. They were used for most of the routine cloning experiments involving ligations of compatible, cohesive termini.

''' buffer R1''' 

100 mM RbCl, 

50 mM MnCl2.4H20., 

30 mM potassium acetate, 

10 mM CaCl2.2H20, 

15% glycerol

== Preparation of ultracompetent cells==

Ultracompetent cells were prepared according to the method described here. A single colony of E. coli DH5 α maintained on a fresh LB agar plate was inoculated into 5 ml of LB and incubated at 37C at 200 rpm for 16 hrs. One ml of this overnight culture was inoculated into 100 ml of LB medium and incubated at 18C at 200 rpm, till the OD600 reached 0.6. The culture was chilled on ice and centrifuged at 1,500g for 15 min at 4C to pellet the cells. The cells were then resuspended in 32 ml of ice cold buffer I (10 mM PIPES pH 6.7, 15 mM CaCl2, 250 mM KCl, 55 mM MnCl2) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The centrifugation was repeated and the cells were resuspended in 8 ml of ice cold buffer I containing 7% DMSO, distributed into 100 µl aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  70C. Ultracompetent cells prepared by this method yielded a transformation efficiency of 1 x 108 colonies/µg of pUC18 DNA and were stable for three months at  70C. Ultracompetent cells were used for cloning experiments involving ligation of DNA fragments with blunt ended termini.

==Transformation of competent and ultracompetent E. coli cells by heat shock==

Competent cells were removed from the  70C freezer and thawed on ice. Ligated DNA sample (5 µl) was added to the competent cells and mixed gently. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, and then subjected to heat shock at 42C for 90 sec. After the heat shock, 400 µl of LB was added to the cells and the tube was incubated at 37C for 1 hr. The cells were then plated on 90 mm LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin. In cases where the plasmid vector displayed the property of  complementation, the cells were plated on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic, and coated with 40 µl of 20 mg/ml X Gal and 4 µl of 200 mg/ml IPTG. The plates were incubated at 37C for 14 16 hr to enable the transformants to grow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yılan insanın sadece canını alır. Kötü arkadaş cehenneme sürer de ebedi hayatını mahveder.

Yerde bir zayıf aman dilerse, gökyüzü askerleri birbirlerine karışırlar.

Yüz kişinin içinde aşık, gökte yıldızlar arasında parıldayan ay gibi belli olur.

Yarasından taze kan sizan gönül ehline,dostların yüzünü görmek merhem gibidir.

Yaşamak direnmektir, sevmek güvenmektir. Unutma; 'İnsan çoğu zaman dünyanın hakimi, Bazen de küçük bir kalbin esiridir.

Gel, gel, ne olursan ol yine gel,
İster kafir, ister mecusi, ister puta tapan ol yine gel,
Bizim dergahımız, umitsizlik dergahı değildir,
Yüz kere tövbeni bozmuş olsan da yine gel.


Cömertlik ve yardım etmede akarsu gibi ol.
Şefkat ve merhamette güneş gibi ol.
Başkalarının kusurunu örtmede gece gibi ol.
Hiddet ve asabiyette ölü gibi ol.
Tevazu ve alçak gönüllülükte toprak gibi ol.
Hoşgörülülükte deniz gibi ol.
Ya olduğun gibi görün, ya göründüğün gibi ol.


Allah merhalesinde akıl beygirine yol yoktur.

Allah üstünlük bakımından göz yaşını şehitlerin kanı ile eş tuttu.

Allah’a şükür, rızkı artırır.

Allah'ım sen kimi dertle hasta etmek dilersen ona ağlayış kapısını kapatırsın. Kimi de beladan kurtarmak dilersen gönlüne sızlanma ve ağlayış verirsin.

Bir kimseyi tanımak istiyorsan, düşüp kalktığı arkadaşlarına bak.

Bir mum diğer bir mumu tutuşturmakla, ışığından bir şey kaybetmez.</text>

== Quizzes and Exams ==

It is a suprise that this isn't already integrated on the Wikibooks English site, but we really need to apply for the Quiz and Exams multiple choice addon to fully characterize and emphasize our wikibooks. We have many language books, mathematic books, and other educative books that could use a nice addition of a practice quiz at the end or middle to check the user's progress. Those studying for exams (let's face it, students today use Wikimedia projects as a primary source) will love to test their knowledge on the topics they are studying to make sure they have obtained the knowledge required of them.

Ther is any way to use cookbook templates for other type of receipes, not necessary food related?

I'm very interested in this topic and i know couple of others that are too. Any ideas will be much appreciated. {{unsigned|Atelierelealbe}}
:It would be relatively simple to create &quot;clones&quot;, appropriately modified, of the Cookbook templates (e.g., &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) - assuming that's what you mean. Or, do you mean by &quot;template&quot;, following the structure of a typical Cookbook page?

===Button to add/remove all pages of a book to one's watchlist===
This could be done fairly easily with some Javascript and the Mediawiki API. (I'm not sure where the button should go (any ideas?), but it can be done.) --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yair rand|contribs]]) 23:54, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

: You can use the feed from [[Special:RelatedChanges/Category:Esperanto]] for example to watch an entire book without the need for JavaScript. That method will also begin showing changes for any new pages added to a book as long as the category is maintained. With the JavaScript approach, only pages that exist at the time the button was clicked would be added to one's watchlist. I think a better option would be to create an MediaWiki extension to allow books to be watched, and such an extension could even possibly alert people when pages in a book are added, deleted, or renamed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:17, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
::Yes, that would be a much better solution, if it were possible.

:::: I was thinking a while back (before I got sidetracked and went on de facto wikibreak from Wikipedia) of floating the idea of an extension of this nature at [[w:Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab)]], to see if I could drum up any interest, or other interesting feedback.  My hope was that users on many projects, including Wikipedia, might find it useful to be able to auto-watch all new subpages of, say, a requests page (deletions, adminships, what have you), an elections page, or the like.  (Anything whatever to do with Arbcom?  All specializations of the MOS?)  Cross-project support from Wikipedia might help move things along.

:::: This would require a proposal flexible enough to gain wide appeal, and potentially efficient enough that the devs wouldn't balk at it.  A variant I've been mulling over:  a &quot;subpages&quot; bit on each item on one's watchlist, and an extra timestamp associated with each page.  When you watch a page with subpages bit on, all its existing subpages also get watched.  When a new subpage is created, it updates the subpage-creation timestamp of its ''longest-named existing ancestor'' (e.g., if pages &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo/bar&lt;/code&gt; exist, and you create &lt;code&gt;foo/bar/quux&lt;/code&gt;, only the subpage-creation timestamp of &lt;code&gt;foo/bar&lt;/code&gt; would be updated).  And when you check your watchlist, if you're subpages-watching a page, and its subpage-creation timestamp is more recent than the last time you checked, then its subpages are checked to see if they were created since then and, if they were, they get watched.  (That's a depth-first search of its subpages, but it doesn't search for further descendants of any subpage that already existed the last time you checked your watchlist.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:38, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

:::::: Although I don't agree with &quot;very little usefulness&quot; on an absolute scale &amp;mdash;my recent thoughts of pitching to Wikipedia were stirred up by, iirc, a wish for functionality expressed by a Wikipedian (I should track that down while I still can)&amp;mdash; my plan to get the functionality without unacceptably slowing things down did, I agree, result in data structures out of proportion to the functionality provided.  I.e., too complicated.

:::::: Tacking a different tack, and keeping in mind that recent changes of a category requires actively checking, omits pages improperly categorized, and omits talk pages,
{{outdent|:::::}}
given a javascript means to add all existing pages of a book to a user's watchlist, is there a way to arrange to automatically repeat that every once in a while, so that new pages eventually get picked up as well (even though not instantly)?  We might want to adjust the interval between repetitions depending on the user's activity level; at the extreme, inactive users don't need the updates while they remain inactive.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:32, 8 February 2011 (UTC)

===Enlarge the size of the title on book front pages===

===Standard navigation bar===
If an #ifexist function in the tagline checked whether the current page's superpage had a subpage titled &quot;X/Navigation&quot; (or something like that), and transcluded it if it did, and the /Navigation page had a standard template which had a list of the various pages in the section/book, it would be pretty simple to have a bunch of parserfunctions in it provide back and forward buttons leading to the following/preceding pages in the book... --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yair rand|contribs]]) 23:54, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

: I previously tried to use wiki markup in the tagline, but it displayed the text as if wrapped with nowiki. Would require a software change to be doable. A MediaWiki extension could probably do this too. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:24, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

::Portuguese Wikibooks does something like this, only instead of /Navigation they use subpages of a &quot;list of chapters&quot;.  See [[:pt:Special:PrefixIndex/Template:Lista_de_capítulos/]].  Then they use [[:pt:Template:Capítulo_anterior]] and [[:pt:Template:Capítulo_posterior]] called from [[:pt:MediaWiki:Retrievedfrom]] to create automatic forward and backward navigation based on the current page and where it is placed in that list of chapters.  The MediaWiki parser functions might not fly on a larger wiki, since that interface is called on every page load, but I thought I'd mention their system.  Possibly something could get put into {{tl|BookCat}}.  It seems like Pi zero is working on a similar system with [[Template:Navlist]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:54, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

===Redesign title format===
(I proposed this a while ago and it was archived without really getting anywhere, but I think that something really does need to be done about this...) The title format on Wikibooks of BOOKTITLE/SECTION/PAGE format really looks ridiculous. Certain books have tried simply fiddling with the title to either just show the book title on every page, or just the page title, but neither of these really work well, and the format should really be standardized. I really don't have any idea of what kind of thing should be there at the top of the page indicating what the user is reading, but I'm pretty sure that the current format is not the best solution. Anyone want to throw around some ideas? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yair rand|contribs]]) 23:54, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

:A few notes: the archived discussion is at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals/2010/August#Book page top header]].  The template being used for the title tweaking mentioned above is {{tl|displaytitle}} (tab renaming doesn't work on Vector).  Personally, I'm not a fan of the multi-line options.  I know the titles take some getting used to if you're used to Wiktionary titles.  Probably even before looking at technical implementations, we'd have to decide whether this would be something all books would be fine with having standardized since there are different implementations currently, as noted above. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:55, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

:I also agree that the display title format on Wikibooks (of BOOKTITLE/SECTION/PAGE) should have be given some extra consideration, users should be able to turn off or customize it on &lt;s&gt;the&lt;/s&gt; their preferences.
:The current default state can be seen as preventing the use of deep page trees (this can be bad or good) and the font size by default could be smaller.
:Personally my views is that beyond the title page the need to have the tree path in evidence is mostly null (I appreciate having easy access to it when editing), beyond this I wouldn't have the foggiest idea on how it could be improved.
:As for the establishing what should be there, I also doubt that a consensus could easily be reached, as Adrignola hints above, and that if reached it should be an imposition of a style. I would support some work on [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] to provide some guidelines on how to make the tweak and establish what should be acceptable. That would be useful and a step toward determining what could be altered.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:34, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

::The complication here that, as I remarked (ad tedium) at the [[WB:Reading room/General#&quot;Future of Wikimedia&quot;|general reading room thread]] about Yair rand's essay at meta (circles within circles), Wikibooks really isn't a project made up of larger units than Wikipedia's &amp;mdash; it's a collection of very small separate projects, each with such small scope that very few of them can sustain a continuous community.  So title format isn't something to customize primarily by user, it's to customize primarily by ''book'', with different books wanting different formats.

::An obvious (probably too obvious) thought is that there might be some sort of per-book customization we could rig using {{tl|BookCat}} &amp;mdash; though I suppose it'd have to be JS, since the [[w:WP:DISPLAYTITLE|&lt;code&gt;DISPLAYTITLE:&lt;/code&gt;]] magic word doesn't seem to be flexible enough for what we want.  (I'd be tempted to use {{tl|Navlist}} instead, except that still needs significant work before I consider it ready for prime time.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:48, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

:::Both views can be defended (I've unsuccessfully attempted to read your past discussion on the subject so I'm expanding only on the above lines), personally in my edits I've attempted to create links to other works on Wikibooks (if relevant to the section I'm editing, going so far as to directly pointing to other Wikibooks that deal more in depth with an issue that goes outside of the scope). I'm also a defender (and understand that this view is not shared by all) that wikilinks to Wikipedia are valuable to works, readers and even editors, this is something that I make a point in defending when dewikification is mentioned in a discussion. On the other hand I fully agree that books, to some degree, should be allowed individuality and that too much normalization can restrict creativity, even create a barrier to participation. Having said that I recognize that having something in the lines of [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] as to establish best practices in this matters is a good thing.
:::Over time I've created some aversion to navigation templates, as an editor (they are costly to maintain) and as a user since they can change dramatically from work to work and often are outdated, in reality they bring no added benefit, if they define navigability not structure. We have now automated paths to deal with navigational problems that make most of this types of templates unnecessary distractions...

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Digital forensics|title=Image Investigations}}

One of the most common aspects of any digital forensic investigation is that of image forensics. It is an unavoidable fact that one of the most common crimes looked at within the field is that of child pornography, but beyond that images can have a number of evidential uses in other settings.

For example, we previously discussed how [[../Chat,_email_and_internet_artefacts#Cached_web_page|some browsers store thumbnails]] of visited sites, useful to proving what a user saw on their screen. With the Google Chrome browser this can sometimes amount to many hundreds of images to work through, this is the inherent disadvantage introduced by image analysis; there tends to be a lot of them. A basic installation of Windows, for example, could contain thousands of images and just one computer game tens of thousands. Finding ways to process and filter relevant images in bulk is one of the foremost issues in digital forensics.

The exam questions are very hard to predict and this site is by no means going to give you everything you need for the questions you'll sit.  The most important thing you should do is learn how to program, and learn how to program well!

==Things to Learn==
Reading the specification it appears that you will have to learn the following:
*File Read
*File Write
*[[/String manipulation/]]
*[[/Random functions/]]

==The Exam==
The exam is split into 4 sections that must be completed on a computer.

===Section A===
&lt;30 minutes&gt;
Theory Questions based on the material you have covered for unit 1.  For an overview of what this might include see the [http://store.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/pdf/AQA-2510-W-SP.PDF specification] and this wikibook

===Section B===
&lt;20 minutes&gt;
Programming solutions to short problems, not based on the preliminary material or skeleton code
*[[/Section B/]]

===Section C===
&lt;20 minutes&gt;
Theory questions about the preliminary material and skeleton code
*[[/Section C/]]

===Section D===
&lt;50 minutes&gt;
Program solutions based around the preliminary code.  The guidance below doesn't pretend to offer the actual questions that will be set in the exam, but by doing them you should hopefully get a better grasp of the code and be able to answer any questions thrown at you during the exam.
*[[/Section D/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{stub}}

=== The need for a layered approach ===

Computer networks have very high expectations of them: we expect to be able to communicate with anywhere in the world with minimal delay, and with high reliability. But the hardware that provides this communication sometimes fails, or needs to be upgraded. Nor is the internet a static system: new networks are connected every day, and some old networks stop working temporarily or permanently. The systems that are used for computer networking need to detect and work around errors, and do so automatically without waiting for human intervention. Errors can occur on any level, from tiny amounts of electrical interference or cosmic rays that might alter a single bit of information on a wire, to an entire trans-Atlantic network trunk cable being cut by a ship's anchor.

Writing a single protocol that can deal with all these eventualities is achievable in theory, but in practice the need to deal with all the possible sources of error would quickly make it unmanageably complex. In addition, there's a political problem with deploying one single monolithic protocol: everyone would have to use the same protocol, and everyone would have to adopt it at the same time.

The solution that developed is a common one in software engineering: the use of abstraction. Networking is implemented in terms of a series of ''layers'', each of which only solves a small part of the whole problem of networked communications. However, each layer can rely on the services provided by the layers below it, so that the entire stack working together can solve a problem that no single layer solves. In addition, the layered model means that different parts of the network can solve the lower-layer problem in different ways, provided that they all implement the same interface that the higher-level layers rely on.

[[File:OSI-model-Communication.svg|600px|Communication in the OSI-Model (example with layers 3 to 5)]]

=== The OSI model ===

An early attempt to standardize the layers of networking was made in 1978 by the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) project by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The product of this group described 7 network layers and specified a suite of protocols to operate at each of these layers. Though the protocols specified didn't catch on and were superseded by TCP/IP, the concepts of the 7 layers stuck, and are still used to this day to describe networking protocols. There is no strict need for protocols to comply with the OSI 7-layer model, and indeed many protocols blur the boundaries or collapse the functions of several layers into one protocol, but the layer numbers are still useful for informal communication.

==== Layers in the OSI model ====

===== Layer 1: the physical layer =====
The lowest layer of the stack deals with the physical details of sending signals from one place to another. Typically this information is carried encoded in electrical signals or laser light, but in principle any means of communication could be used. For example, if you had a way of encoding binary data into sound transmitted from a speaker to a microphone (with a second speaker and microphone to send data back the other way) then you could use the rest of the standard protocols on top of this physical layer without having to change them.

The physical layer needn't provide completely reliable transmission: the upper layers are responsible for detecting errors and resending data if necessary. The physical layer merely provides some way of propagating data from one node to another.

Among other things, the specification of a physical layer protocol will need to specify the voltage of an electric signal or frequency and power of a laser, size and shape of connectors, modulation of the signal, and the way that multiple nodes share the same link.

===== Layer 2: The Data Link Layer =====

The data link layer is responsible for providing the means to transfer data from one node to the other, if possible detecting or correcting errors in the physical layer. Layer 2 introduces the concept of unique addresses that identify the nodes that are communicating. Unlike layer 3, data link layer addresses use a flat structure, i.e. the structure of the address doesn't yield any information about the relative location of nodes or the route that traffic should take between them.

The most familiar layer 2 protocol is Ethernet, although the Ethernet standard also specifies details of the physical layer.

===== Layer 3: The Network Layer =====
The network layer builds on the lower layers to support routing data across interconnected networks (rather than within a single network). Addressing at the network layer takes advantage of a hierarchical structure so that it's possible to summarise the route to thousands or millions of hosts as a single piece of information. Typically, nodes that are on the same network as each other will share a common prefix on their layer 3 address. Layer 3 communication doesn't contain any concept of a continuing connection: each packet of data sent between a pair of communicating hosts is treated separately, with no knowledge of the packets that went before it. Layer 3 protocols may be able to correct errors in a packet that have been introduced at the physical or data link layer, but do not guarantee that no packet will be lost.

===== Layer 4: The Transport Layer =====
The transport layer allows communicating hosts to establish an ongoing connection between them. Layer 4 protocols may detect missing packets and compensate by retransmitting them, but not all protocols do so: most obviously, TCP does provide reliable transmission but UDP doesn't. Providing reliable transmission incurs an overhead, and some data is obsolete once it has been even slightly delayed (e.g. data for a live phone call or video conference) so there are cases where unreliable transmission is desirable.

===== Layer 5: The Session Layer =====
The OSI model allowed for a fifth layer that provides the mechanism for creating, maintaining and destroying a semi-permanent session between end-user applications. For example, it might make it possible to checkpoint and restore communication sessions, or bring several streams from different sources into sync. In practice, although there are protocols that provide features of this type, layer 5 is rarely referred to as a general concept.

===== Layer 6: The Presentation Layer =====
Layer 6 is the layer at which data structures that have meaning to the application are mapped into a stream of bytes, the details of which need not concern the lower layers. In theory, this relieves the application layer of having to worry about the differences between one computer platform and another, e.g. a computer that uses ASCII to encode its text files communicating with one that uses EBCDIC. In practice, protocols rarely bother to differentiate this layer from the highest layer (the application layer), treating the two combined as one layer.

===== Layer 7: The Application Layer =====
The application layer covers the protocols that describe application-specific details of communication. FTP, HTTP and SMTP are all application-layer protocols.

=== Switching at different layers ===
The distinction between the aspects of communication that are constrained by each protocol layer may at first seem unimportant or arbitrary. This is true in the case of the most trivial network, consisting of just two computers with a single cable connecting them. However, as the number of nodes on the network increases, it gets more and more useful to clearly distinguish the responsibilities of each layer.

Two computers can share a single physical cable between them, but if we want to add a third computer to this micro-network, how do we connect it? Do we attempt to share the same physical cable by cutting it and splicing in a branch to the cable? This might work in theory, but would be inflexible in practice: apart from the time taken to cut and splice the cable, it would be very hard to add a node to the network without disrupting the network for the existing network users. A more maintainable solution is to plug each computer into a common ''hub''. The hub will have network sockets on it that our network cables can plug into, and the circuitry within the hub will ensure that as soon as a cable is plugged in it will be able to send and receive signals with any other cables already connected.

[[File:Hub network diagram.svg|Hosts connected via a hub]]

The hub is a purely physical layer device. It doesn't know the meaning of any of the signals it transmits, nor does it make any decisions about which signals should go where or whether data is corrupt. Every signal on every cable is copied to all the other cables.

An alternative to using a physical-layer hub is to use a layer 2 switch to connect the hosts. Unlike a hub, a switch attempts to process the data it receives so as to understand something about the packets being transferred. A switch will only parse the layer 2 content of a packet, treating all the higher layer data as a blob of data that can be transferred without understanding it. The advantage of parsing the layer 2 wrapper is that this contains the source and destination addresses of the packet. If the switch knows which direction to send the packet (based on the destination address and its knowledge of the network) it can send the packet to only one link on the network, which saves bandwidth. If the switch doesn't know where to send the packet, it sends it to all interfaces other than the one on which it received the packet: this is called ''flooding''.

Using switches in place of hubs saves bandwidth (by only sending packets on links that need to receive them), the only disadvantage being that switches are more complex devices and may cost more or require additional configuration. In practice, simple switches don't require any configuration and have long since become as cheap as hubs (or even cheaper, now that there is little demand for physical layer hubs).

This discussion has glossed over the detail of ''how'' exactly the switch knows where to send a particular packet. When a switch is first connected to the network, it doesn't know anything about the network. Without any knowledge, it has to flood every packet it receives onto every port, behaving in effectively the same way as a hub would. However, the switch can learn from each packet it sees, and this means it can make better decisions. For example, if a switch receives a packet with source address A and destination B on interface 2, it can conclude that source address A is reachable via interface 2. Next time it receives a packet with destination address A (whether or not it comes from address B) it can forward it straight to interface 2, saving bandwidth on the other links.

Inside every switch there is therefore a table mapping layer 2 addresses to port numbers. The size of this table is limited by the available memory, and the speed of looking up addresses in the table (packets must be looked up very quickly in order to be forwarded on without too much delay). The specialist hardware that enables this fast lookup is very expensive, so in practice if you want your switch to have more layer 2 address capacity you have to be prepared to pay extra for it. Home network switches might be able to store a few thousand addresses, while high-end data center switches can cope with tends or hundreds of thousands.

No matter how much you spend on your switch, it's never going to be able to cope with an entry in its lookup table for every one of the billions of hosts on the internet. The only sensible way to deal with this is to break down the network into sections, and store information about it a section at a time. This is the way that routing (which takes place at layer 3) differs from switching (taking place at layer 2).

{{TODO|
Still to be expanded:
* The characteristics of layer 2 switching and layer 3 routing
* Terminology: switch vs. bridge, switch vs. hub, routers, internetworks, catenets
* The historical development of switches
* The current state of router technology: microsegmentation; switches have more and more layer 3 capabilities; the difference between switch and router is now more a matter of performance / scalability characteristics than black and white technical distinction.}}

&lt;u&gt;'''Runtime Document Manipulation'''&lt;/u&gt;

JavaScript can manipulate an HTML document that has been loaded into the browser using standard DOM (Document Object Model). Let's see an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      function displayMessage() 
      {
          var divObj = document.getElementById(&quot;messageText&quot;);
          if(divObj) {
             divObj.innerHTML=&quot;&lt;b&gt;This is new Message from Javascript&lt;/b&gt;&quot;;
          }
      }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
         &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;display Message&quot; onclick=&quot;displayMessage();&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;div id=&quot;messageText&quot; style=&quot;width:400px; height:200px; color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

The html document when loaded into a browser, will have one &quot;Display Message&quot; button. By clicking the button we could see a message below the button.
By referring to the source code above, a javascript function displayMessage() was called when ever we click the &quot;Display Message&quot; button.

'''document''' object is a DOM object that refers to the loaded HTML.  By using its '''getElementById()'''  method, and by passing the id/name of the HTML element, we can tap to the element's DOM representation (in this case a div tag). We add a new HTML element to the current HTML document by using the '''''innerHTML''''' property.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pedro Calderon de la Barca (1600-1681) continues his excellent work into the second half of the century with &quot;Guadarte del agua mansa&quot; (Still waters run deep, or more literally Beware of sleeping waters, 1657), about the violent conflict between two rivals vying for the hands of two sisters of calm and turbulent personalities, respectively. A second play of renown is &quot;El alcalde de Zalamea&quot; (The mayor of Zalamea, 1651) about the conflicts between the interests of the army and the townspeople.

Felix receives the visit of Juan and Pedro. They contemplate on the opposite side of his house Clara and Eugenia, daughters of his neighbor, Alonzo. Juan and Pedro reveal to Felix that they each love one of the two without saying more. Alzonzo invites Torribio, his nephew, to marry one of the two, but neither like him. To Felix his house has become &quot;the hospice of convalescence of the sick in love&quot;. In the street the three men meet the two sisters. When Felix asks for whom they sigh for, both Juan and Pedro answer the one holding a handkerchief and then leave him. Before he turns around, Eugenia hands the handkerchief over to Clara, and so Felix thinks it is her. Unknowing of the other two's intentions, Torribio offers his hand in marriage to Eugenia. When Alonzo announces Torribio's choice, the loud and lively Clara sarcastically offers to her quiet sister &quot;sincere congratulations for her felicity&quot;. Eugenia submits to her father's will, yet requests Torribio to renounce the thought, refusing him for not having &quot;I-do-not-know-what&quot;. When the rejected lover meets Alzonzo, he says he will never again appear before his love until finding I-do-not-know-what. Felix then enters to warn Clara that Juan and Pedro will hazard not only their lives for her sake but also her reputation. Not having had the chance of even knowing Felix, Juan, or Pedro, Clara is astonished at these news. Afraid of being compromised, Eugenia enters to intercept a letter Felix wrote to explain his views of these matters. Also afraid of being compromised, Clara calls out loudly so that the entire household enters to find out what is going on, and an abashed Felix disappears. As Alzonzo, Torribio, and others search for him, Clara obtains the letter meant for her sister. Later, Eugenia sees Pedro in the street from her window and, to set matters aright, says to him she will no longer allow his liberties. She then expresses to Clara her view that &quot;noise, agitation, and amusement&quot; were what she looked for in a convent where she was raised. &quot;The peril is in tranquil waves,&quot; she adds, &quot;so the wisest has always known that still waters run deep.&quot; Another letter is brought to the two sisters, which Torribio out of jealousy wishes to see, but this is prevented by the sisters' duena, Maria. When he threatens to hit her, she hits him and cries out that she is being killed, so that the household is once again in an uproar. The letter is merely on the part of their uncle inviting them to see the queen's festivities from his balcony. Later, Felix receives a letter from Clara, inviting him to meet a second time. Juan has been told that Eugenia does not wish to see him. Suspecting Felix as the cause, he asks to see his letter to Eugenia. Thinking that Clara is Eugenia, Felix is in a great difficulty with respect to his friend, but refuses to let him see it. A duel must ensue. Pedro enters, also woe-begone, for the same reason as Juan. He tries to prevent the impending duel, but when Juan tells him that Felix may be Eugenia's lover, Pedro is angry with both. All three cry out at once: &quot;Both of you have outraged my honor&quot; and decide to fight it out with swords, but this is interrupted by Alonzo and Torribio. When next Torribio sees Maria, he hits her and cries out that he is the one being killed. To plague her sister out of spite of her success in men, Clara insinuates to Torribio that Eugenia favors another man, inviting him to listen in secret to her conservations from the balcony. Clara calls her sister, informing her that the two rivals were seen fighting each other and that her father has &quot;violent suspicions&quot; concerning her attitude. Felix arrives to see Clara as arranged. They hear a noise, and, to avoid Alonzo's interference, Clara goes to her room while Felix runs to the balcony, where he sees Torrobio. Pedro enters, only to witness the surprising sight of Alonzo fighting Juan, whom he considers an intruder in his house. Having also seen Felix on the balcony, Pedro has now two men to fight with. Felix stops the fight and says that Eugenia received him in this room to prevent any further quarrel between the rivals. Eugenia denies this, at which point Alonzo discovers Clara as being responsible for hiding Felix. Clara confesses that she wanted &quot;to hinder Eugenia's loves but could not resist her own&quot;. Felix is elated, for now he can &quot;reveal his fires&quot; to Clara, while Juan and Pedro have no more cause for jealousy, for Torribio being found wanting in intellect, Alonzo decides to marry Eugenia to Juan, with all the more reason because he was her mother's choice before she died.

[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola (ca. 1532-1625)]]

Soldiers enter the village of Zalamea on their way towards Lisbon to see King Philip II of Spain crowned king of Portugal. The captain of the company, Alvaro, converses with a sergeant regarding the townswomen one may notice there. &quot;When a woman does not dress with grace and elegance, in my view she ceases to be a woman,&quot; affirms the captain. An affected gentleman, Mendo, courts Isabel, daughter of  the well-to-do Pedro, but with no intention of marrying her. She does not wish to see him. Seeing the thin gentleman plant himself before their house, her brother, Juan, exclaims: &quot;Always that phantom at my door with his plumes and gloves!&quot; Pedro agrees to welcome the captain as his guest and later enjoins Isabel to remain invisible to the soldiers in a room at the top floor of the house. By the very fact she cannot be seen, Alvaro is attracted to her. He proposes to a soldier, Rebolledo, to pretend to fly from his rage into her room. The ploy works. Her beauty allays his pretended anger. Despite her low status, he shows signs of being smitten by her charms, but their talk is interrupted by Pedro and Juan. Suspecting Alvar's intentions, Juan feels insulted, but his father, thinking no evil, defends the captain. Despite this, the son and the captain draw their swords. The head of the company of soldiers, Lope, suddenly appears, and, hearing the reason of the commotion, orders Rebolledo to be whipped with rods. An affronted Rebolledo reveals all. Lope orders the captain to leave Pedro's house, as he is now to stay there. Hearing of the captain's intentions, Mendo becomes jealous and asks his servant, Nuno, how does Isabel treat the captain. &quot;As she does you,&quot; answers Nuno. &quot;Isabel is a divinity that the gross vapors of the earth do not attain.&quot; For this sarcasm, Mendo strikes his face. Nuno responds that was well done, for he only broke two of his teeth, &quot;useless appendages in your service,&quot; he adds. Later, Isabel is serenaded by Rebolledo and others in the presence of Pedro, Juan, and Lope, all four irritated by such attentions. Lope and Pedro attack the musicians with swords to disperse them along with Mendo. They also attack each other until prevented by Juan. Since the people are ill disposed towards the soldiers, Lope orders the captain to leave town along with the entire troop. Recruited as a soldier, Juan is also to go. But Alvaro has other plans. He kidnaps Isabel while Rebolledo pushes Pedro towards his house. Although Isabel's cousin, Ines, gives Pedro his sword to defend himself, all action is to no avail. The sergeant ties Pedro to a tree while Alvaro rapes his daughter. In the aftermath, Isabel wanders wearingly inside the forest and sees her father tied to the tree. She explains that Juan found the captain and wounded him, but could do no more, being saved by accomplices. She encourages her father to kill her, but he refuses. As he is being untied, Pedro learns he has just been elected mayor of Zalamea. &quot;Your father is the mayor; he will render you justice,&quot; declares Pedro. On locating the captain's whereabouts, he commands the officers of the law to have an eye on the soldiers while he converses with him. In view of his superior status, Pedro proposes to yield to Alvaro all his goods provided he restore his honor by marrying Isabel, but he refuses. The mayor orders his arrest, despite his claims that civil authorities have no jurisdiction over him. The mayor also orders the arrest of his accomplices. Thinking Isabel guilty of trying to escape with the captain, Juan takes out his dagger to kill her, but Pedro arrives in time to order his arrest for wounding the captain. He requests his daughter to accuse the rapist, but she is astonished he wants to make public what should be kept in silence. An outraged Lope learns of Alvaro's arrest and insists that the mayor hand over the prisoner to his authority, but the trial has already been conducted and the culprit executed. Incensed, Lope commands his troops to burn down the entire town until prevented by the king, who names Pedro mayor for his entire life. Juan is to be punished for stabbing the captain unlawfully and then rejoin the troops towards Portugal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are various versions of firmware for the 5800; many of the issues that arise are due to the particular firmware used, not the hardware. Early versions of firmware, in particular, can have problems. One strategy is to download and use the most recent firmware. In particular this adds some features of Freeview+ to the 5800. But the most reliable firmware is arguably a version which has been updated and debugged by many expert enthusiasts. As of early 2011 the best firmware is probably 5.13.65T (the &quot;T&quot; is important) downloadable without charge from the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/downloads/firmware.php toppy.org.uk website]. It does not have the latest features (e.g., series recording), but does not have the latest bugs either!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people know from their own experience that it's not easy to install an Apache web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP is an easy to install Apache distribution containing MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP is really very easy to install and to use - just download, extract and start.

At the moment there are four XAMPP distributions:

*[[/XAMPP for Linux/]]
*[[/XAMPP for Windows/]]
*[[/XAMPP for Mac OS X/]] 
*[[/XAMPP for Solaris/]] 


To install XAMPP you only need to download and extract XAMPP, that's all. There are no changes to the Windows registry (not true if you use the Windows installer version of XAMPP) and it's not necessary to edit any configuration files. It couldn't be easier!

To check that XAMPP is working some sample programs are included, there is a small CD collection program (written in PHP using MySQL) and a small guest book software (written in Perl) and several other demonstration utilities.

If you decide that XAMPP isn't needed any more just delete the XAMPP directory and it's completely removed from your system.

However if you use the Windows installer version of XAMPP it's recommended to use the uninstall feature. As every installer the installer will make registry entries to remember the install.

Reporting is a key final phase to any investigation. A skilled investigator aims to balance the technical facts against their own analysis, whilst presenting it in layman terms. Writing a good report is often a skill hard won by forensic analysts because communicating complicated ideas in simple language is not always easy.

==Report content==

How your report findings depends a lot of who will be reading it. For the most part it is easiest to assume the person reading any report has no technical knowledge at all, and pitch it to them.

A common forensic report might include:
* Summary of findings
* Description of the analysis undertaken
* Explanation of terms such as &quot;unallocated space&quot; and &quot;peer 2 peer&quot; (an extended glossary)

==Producing evidence==

Alongside any report it is often required to produce the original evidence. Within a legal setting there is a pre-requisite called the &quot;Best Evidence&quot; rule, which asks for the original copies of evidence. Obviously, with digital evidence this raises the question of &quot;what is the original copy&quot;. Viewing the original disk risks modifying the evidence (as discussed in previous chapters) and often deleted evidence cannot be presented in original form. 

For practical purposes courts generally accept a CD/DVD (i.e. write-once media) containing copies of the evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Helly's theorem''' is as follows:

Let R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; be an n-dimensional real vector space and let N &gt; n.  Suppose you have N convex sets in R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; such that, given any n+1 of them, they have at least one point in common.  Then all N sets have at least one point in common.

'''Proof:''' Obviously, the theorem is true for N = n+1.  Proceed by induction and assume it is true for N-1.  Let the sets be X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to X&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;.  For each ''i'', exclude set X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.  By the inductive hypothesis, there is at least one point x(i) belonging to all the sets except possibly X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since N &gt; n+1, the (n+1) equations

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i x_k(i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle(k=1,2, ... n)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

in the N unknowns &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; must have non-trivial solutions.  For one such solution, denote by &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt; to &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt; those &amp;lambda; that are positive, and &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;h1&lt;/sub&gt; to &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;h(N-k)&lt;/sub&gt; those that are negative.

&lt;br&gt;structure of early to advanced previtellogenic stages
&lt;table align=top width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td  align=top&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt; early previtellogenic stage (ovary staging 0-1)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This image represents an early previtellogenic stage in ovary development, with predominant occurrence of early oocyte stages i.e. oogonium, primary oocytes stage 1, and occasional stage 2.

In this image, the following elements are present:
* clusters of meiotic oogonian [&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;, see below for detail; cell diameters ~10 µm.
* stage 1 primary oocytes [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]: these are small previtellogenic oocytes (cell diameters: 10-20 µm). Accompanying follicle cells &lt;'''thin arrows'''] are present.
* stage 2 primary oocytes [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]: these previtellogenic oocytes have cell diameters ranging of 20-90 µm. Accompanying follicle cells ['''thick arrows'''] are arranged in a single layer.
In the intra-ovary stroma ['''i'''], occasional apoptotic bodies ['''a'''] are present. The stroma tissue of the mesentery ['''s'''] between the ovary and the liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;] contains eosinophilic peritoneal cells [&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;].

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td  align=top&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt; early previtellogenic stage (ovary staging 0-1) - primitive pole&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ovaries with progressed maturation may still contain only primitive developmental stages, especially in the rostral and caudal poles; this suggests that the growth of these organs emerges from these regions.

In this image, the following elements are present:
* clusters of oogonia [&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;] (cell diameters: ~10 µm) 
* stage 1 primary oocytes [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;], these are the earliest previtellogenic maturation stages of oocytes (cell diameters: 10-20 µm).
* stroma [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]
* adjacent pancreas tissue [&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;]
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt; early previtellogenic stage (ovary staging 1-2)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The images below represent various parts of the same ovarium.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following elements are present:
&lt;br&gt;
* oogonia [&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;]: develop in clusters from germ cells; cell diameters ~10 µm
* primary oocytes: previtelogenic maturation stages of oocytes; maturation from oogonium is asynchronous. At this age, only stage 1 and stage 2 primary oocytes can be distinguished:
* stage 1 oocytes [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]: small, cell diameters range from 10-20 µm; round-oval nucleus with 1-4 nucleoli per section; small rim of cytoplasm; accompanying follicle cells present [&lt;b&gt;thin arrows&lt;/b&gt;].
* stage 2 oocytes [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]: increase of cytoplasm volume with corresponding increase in cell diameters to a range of 20-90 µm; the cytoplasm is compact and reacts basophilic. Accompanying follicle cells are arranged in a single layer [&lt;b&gt;thin arrows&lt;/b&gt;].
* apoptotic bodies [&lt;b&gt;arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;]

 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;



&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td &gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt; intermediate previtellogenic stage (ovary staging 2)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This image represents an intermediate previtellogenic maturation stage of the ovary. This specimen contains early stages of development up to stage 3 primary oocytes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this image, the following elements can be identified:
&lt;br&gt;
* clusters of oogonia [&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;];
* stage 1 oocytes (10-20 µm) [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;] with accompanying follicle cells [&lt;b&gt;red arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;];
* stage 2 oocytes (cell diameters: 20-90 µm) [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]; cytoplasm is compact and reacts basophilic. Accompanying follicle cells [&lt;b&gt;green arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;] are arranged in a single layer;
* stage 3 oocytes (cell diameters: 80-160 µm); cytoplasm reacts basophilic but shows spotted clearing. Accompanying follicle cells are arranged in a single layer [&lt;b&gt;blue arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;].
Various stages of oocyte maturation can be observed simultaneously, since maturation of oogonia is asynchronous.&lt;br&gt;
Other structures are:
* stroma [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]

Generally, further maturing ovaries still have clusters of early oocytes, particularly in the poles of the organ.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Such a region is represented in this image, showing the following elements:
* clusters of oogonia [&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;]
* stage 1 primary oocytes (10-20 µm) [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]; accompanying follicle cells [&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;red arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;] are present.
* stage 2 primary oocytes (cell diameters: 20-90 µm) [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]; cytoplasm is compact and reacts basophilic. Accompanying follicle cells [&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;green arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;] are arranged in a single layer.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



At advanced previtellogenic maturation stages of the ovary, the section is dominated by stage 2 and stage 3 primary oocytes, with obvious clearing of the cytoplasm. The follicle cells of the stage 3 show more prominent than those of previous stages.

In this image, the following elements are present:
* clusters of oogonia [&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;]
* stage 1 oocytes (cell diameters: 10-20 µm) [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;];
* stage 2 oocytes (cell diameters: 20-90 µm) [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;];
* stage 3 oocytes (cell diameters: 80-160 µm) [&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;]; these cells have basophilic cytoplasm basophilic with spotted clearing. Accompanying follicle cells [&lt;b&gt;arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;] are arranged in a single layer.
Various stages of oocyte maturation are present simultaneously, since maturation from oogonium is asynchronous.

==History==
[[File:Brewster Kahle 20021120.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Brewster Khale, founder of Alexa Internet and The Internet Archive&lt;ref&gt;Brewster Khale http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[http://web.archive.org The Internet Archive]&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Archive Site http://web.arhive.org&lt;/ref&gt; was created by Brewster Khale in 1996.  It was originally created as a nonprofit organization to store digital webpages and their graphics.  The archive was essentially a digital library of current and past webpages.  In 2001, the archive became part of the public domain.  Today it is considered to be the world's largest database.&lt;ref&gt;Panos, P. (2003, Spring). The Internet Archive: An End to the Digital Dark Age. Journal of Social Work Education, 39(2), 343-347.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Khale also founded Alexa Internet, which created the Alexa crawler used to retrieve data for The Internet Archive.  The crawler scans the internet every few months taking snapshots of webpages and storing them in The Internet Archive.  Public users may then access copies of the webpages by going to the archive webpage, then entering the webpage's url into the Way Back Machine search engine.&lt;ref&gt;Panos, P. (2003, Spring). The Internet Archive: An End to the Digital Dark Age. Journal of Social Work Education, 39(2), 343-347.&lt;/ref&gt;   Today The Internet Archive has expanded in various directions to make available a wide variety of digital resources.  The creation of the Open Library and NASA Images through The Internet Archive are just two of Internet Archive's projects that provide the public with free, easily accessible digitized information.  

==The Wayback Machine==
[http://web.archive.org/collections/web.html The Wayback Machine]&lt;ref&gt;The Wayback Machine Site http://web.archive.org/collections/web.html&lt;/ref&gt; is an archive of web pages.  It was created in 1996 by Brewster Khale, founder of Alexa Internet and The Internet Archive.  The Wayback Machine allows users to search for nearly any webpage and view the pages from past dates.  Any webpage that Alexa Internet is aware of will appear here.  The webpages are archived at various dates and intervals.  While there are some pages that cannot be viewed due to various technological reasons, there are millions of sites available for the user to peruse.  According to [http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php#7 The Wayback Machine Frequently Asked Questions Page]&lt;ref&gt;The Wayback Macine FAQ Page http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php#7&lt;/ref&gt;, The Wayback Machine currently consists of nearly 2 petabytes (or 2,097,152 gigabytes&lt;ref&gt;What is a Petabyte? http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-petabyte.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to put it into perspective) and continues to grow.

Why might one find The Wayback Machine useful?  The Wayback Machine could be used to view and analyze past versions of one's personal website, to find information on a potential employee, to find instruction manuals on now obsolete technology, even possibly for legal matters.  One could also just explore the past.

==NASA and The Internet Archive Partnership==
In 2007 The internet Archive signed a partnership agreement with NASA to create an interactive web site consisting of NASA images.  The entire project is to be completed over a 5 year time span.  NASA developed the website so their images, audio, and video film clips could be available to the public and located in one web site.  Prior to the development of this site, NASA images were stored in 21 different locations.  Another purpose of the web site is that the digitizing of photos will ensure availability of NASA images for many years to come, as several photos from the early 1900's are beginning to deteriorate.  The first phase of the site, [http://www.nasaimages.org NASA Images]&lt;ref&gt;NASA Images Site http://www.nasaimages.org.&lt;/ref&gt;, was launched in July 2008.  At that time, the site consisted of over 140,000 images, video, and audio clips extending from early Apollo missions to images of the solar system from the Hubble Telescope. Future goals of the partnership is to embed interactive Web 2.0 tools within the site.  There is currently a blog on the site and developers are working on embedding both wikis and blogs to allow user shared content.  The partnership plans to digitize still photos, film, film negatives, and audio that had been previously stored on analog devices.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Launches Online Historical Image Gallery http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9110976/NASA_launches_online_historical_image_gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, science teachers and students alike can utilize the NASA Images website because it provides free access to the public through the partnership with The Internet Archive.  No login or payment is required to access the site.  Teachers can use the images or videos to enhance instruction in the classroom.  Students may use images to further their studies, as a tool to share their input or ask questions through the blogs and wikis, or as a resource in development and/or understanding of assignments.  

==Open Library==
[http://openlibrary.org/ Open Library]&lt;ref&gt;The Open Library http://openlibrary.org/&lt;/ref&gt; was also created by The Internet Archive and makes nearly 2 million books available online for free.  Their goal is to &quot;provide a page on the web for every book ever published.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Open Library FAQ Page  http://openlibrary.org/help/faq#what&lt;/ref&gt;  To make as many books available to its users, The Open Library has partnered with [http://overdrive.com/ Overdrive]&lt;ref&gt;Overdrive http://overdrive.com/#4&lt;/ref&gt;, adding an additional 70,000 electronic titles to those who belong to one of the 11,000 libraries who subscribe to Overdrive&lt;ref&gt;Open Library FAQs on Borrowing http://openlibrary.org/help/faq/borrow&lt;/ref&gt;. Should you not be able to access your book for free at The Open Library, as some are not yet available in digital format, The Open Library will provide links to allow you to borrow the physical copy or to buy the book online.  The Open Library is a work-in-progress and continues to try to obtain as many digital versions of books as possible.

A recent addition to the services Open Library provides is the lending of e-books.  It is possible for an account holder to borrow up to five titles for two weeks.  These books can be viewed on any browser, as a PDF or using ePub.  In order to use the lending library, one must register their library and send one book, published between 1923 and 2000, non-rights cleared.  When the book is received, the lending option is made available.  On the Lending Library page, the user will find title covers of many of the books available for checkout.  A book icon with or without a red line through it indicates the availability status of the book.  As of 2012, there are 10,248 works available in the Lending Library.  Also on the Lending Library page, a viewer will find a chart that gives the number of editions in the library for each year.  The majority of these titles have 20th Century publication dates.

[[File:OERLogo.png]]
== Defined ==
Open Educational Resource (OER) is content developed and offered freely for the purpose of teaching and learning.  The digitized material allows for open development and reuse.  Because of copyright laws, OERs either remain in the public domain or permit reuse through an intellectual property license or other copyright accommodation.  OER's include education course content and materials, digitized textbooks, streaming videos, software, and other materials used to support and convey knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;﻿Atkins, Daniel E.; John Seely Brown, Allen L. Hammond (2007-02). &quot;A Review of the Open Educational Resources (OER) Movement: Achievements, Challenges, and New Opportunities&quot;. Menlo Park, CA: The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. p. 4. http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf. Retrieved 2011/03/04&lt;/ref&gt;

== OER Initiatives ==
Although a relatively new concept in education, OER initiatives are taking place regularly by various institutions.  MIT Open Course Ware (OCW) Initiative offers freely available materials for online non-commercial use.  The Hewlett Foundation funds many OER projects, including UK Open University, Open Universiteit Nederland, and MORIL (Multilingual Open Resources for Independent Learning).  The main purpose behind these initiatives varies by institution but include a mind set of developing life long learners and making knowledge available to all.&lt;ref&gt;www.eadtu.nl/.../day2_UNESCO-EADTU%20OER%20Seminar.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pros v. Cons ==
Open Educational Resources is a fairly new initiative in education, however it has proven to be wildly popular and useful to both educators and consumers.  This forum allows users to easily share educational materials online and freely manipulate resources for use.  Benefits include:  
* Increased interaction with a wider community:  users are provided an easily accessible forum for collaborating with others from all over the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakeholder Benefits&quot;&gt;[https://openeducationalresources.pbworks.com/w/page/24838012/Stakeholders-and-benefits
 1].&lt;/ref&gt;
* More variation in materials for users to select from:  with many providers of content contributing out of personal and professional want, there is a breadth and depth to the content that will provide an ease of use from others in the community &lt;ref name=&quot;Stakeholder Benefits&quot;&gt;[https://openeducationalresources.pbworks.com/w/page/24838012/Stakeholders-and-benefits
 1].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improved quality of materials:  with so many contributors providing information, feedback, approval, and revisions, the material is often improved upon and provides the best material to users &lt;ref name=&quot;Benefits Challenges&quot;&gt;[https://www.col.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/OER_BenefitsChallenges_presentation.pdf
 2].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decline in cost of materials:  sharing resources in this forum cuts the cost to both users and producers as the are easily able to create material and with a few clicks, share this information globally &lt;ref name=&quot;Benefits Challenges&quot;&gt;[https://www.col.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/OER_BenefitsChallenges_presentation.pdf
 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

OER faces some challenges as it breaks into cyber communities to be a leading resource for educators to collaborate and share materials.  The two main challenges are in quality assurance and financial sustainability.  Most consumers remain skeptical of &quot;free&quot; materials.  This skepticism tends to be eased when the OER has established some sort of peer-evaluation system to rate and approve sources.  With these resources being free to users the long-term financial sustainability of OER sites is questionable.  As useage increases in this area, there seems to be a shift from a primarily donation-based financial plan to more institutional support.  These include, but would not be limited to, higher-education institutions.  This has already been seen as MIT provided nearly $8 million to OER &lt;ref name=&quot;Benefits Challenges&quot;&gt;[https://www.col.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/OER_BenefitsChallenges_presentation.pdf
 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for OER ==
OER is a highly supported online collaborative educational initiative.  This support comes largely from higher-education institutions.  Colleges and Universities around the globe are taking advantage of OER to facilitate the educational process and as a marketing tool for current and potential learners.  These instutions are spending the most resources to create and monitor these sites in order to diseminate educational information to the online community.  Many issues like financial sustainability and quality assurance are being debated and worked through by contributors of OERs in order to determine how these sites can and will be used most efficiently &lt;ref name=&quot;JISC&quot;&gt;[http://events.jiscinvolve.org/wp/open-educational-resources-international-symposium-oer-and-institutional-change/ 3].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many self-sustaining OER servicers that support the OER initiative both in concept and in structure.  The OER Foundation is one such service provider that is committed to nurturing the OER environment&lt;ref name=&quot;OER Foundation&quot;&gt;[http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Join 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== Introduction ==
Software engineers speak a funny language called ''Unified Modeling Language'', or UML for short.  Like a musician has to learn musical notation before being able to play piano, we need to learn UML before we are able to engineer software.  UML is useful in many parts of the software engineering process, for instance: planning, architecture, documentation, or reverse engineering. Therefore, it is worth our efforts to know it.

Designing software is a little like writing a screenplay for a Hollywood movie.  The characteristics, actions, and interactions of the characters are carefully planned, as is the relevant components of their environment. As an introductory example, consider our friend Bill, a customer, who is at a restaurant for dinner. His waiter is Linus, who takes the orders and brings the food. In the kitchen is Larry, the cook. Steve is the cashier. In this way, we've provided useful and easily accessed information about the operation of a restaurant in the screenplay.

=== Use Case Diagram ===
[[Image:Restaurant_UseCase_Diagram.png|thumb|240px|Restaurant Use Case Diagram.]]
The first thing a software engineer does is to draw a Use Case diagram. All the ''actors'' are represented by little stick figures, all the ''actions'' are represented by ovals and are called ''use cases''. The actors and use cases are connected by lines. Very often there is also one or more system boundaries. Actors, which usually are not part of the system, are drawn outside the system area.

Use Case diagrams are very simple, so even managers can understand them.  But they are very helpful in understanding the system to be designed.  They should list all parties involved in the system and all major actions that the system should be able to perform.  The important thing about them is that you don't forget anything, it is less important that they are super-detailed, for this we have other diagram types.
 
=== Activity Diagram ===
[[Image:Restaurant_Activity_Diagram.png|thumb|240px|Restaurant Activity Diagram.]]
Next, we will draw an Activity diagram.  The Activity diagram gives more detail to a given use case and it often depicts the flow of information, hence it is also called Flowchart.  Where the Use Case diagrams has no timely order, the Activity diagram has a beginning and an end, and it also depicts decisions and repetitions. 

If the Use Case diagram names the actors and gives us the headings for each scene (use case) of our play, the Activity diagram tells the detailed story behind each scene.  Some managers maybe able to understand Activity diagrams, but don't count on it.

=== Sequence Diagram ===
[[Image:Restaurant_Sequence_Diagram.png|thumb|240px|Restaurant Sequence Diagram.]]
Once we are done drawing our Activity diagrams, the next step of refinement is the Sequence diagram.  In this diagram we list the actors or objects horizontally and then we depict the messages going back and forth between the objects by horizontal lines. Time is always progressing downwards in this diagram.  

The Sequence diagram is a very important step in what is called the process of object-oriented analysis and design.  This diagram is so important, because on the one hand it identifies our objects/classes and on the other hand it also gives us the methods for each of those classes, because each message turns into a method.  Sequence diagrams can become very large, since they basically describe the whole program.  Make sure, you cover every path in your Activity diagrams, but try to avoid unnecessary repetition.  Managers will most likely not understand Sequence diagrams.

=== Collaboration Diagram ===
[[Image:Restaurant_Collaboration_Diagram.png|thumb|240px|Restaurant Collaboration Diagram.]]
The Collaboration diagram is an intermediate step to get us from the Sequence diagram to the Class diagram.  It is similar to the Sequence diagram, but it has a different layout. Instead of worrying about the timeline, we worry about the interactions between the objects. Each object is represented by a box, and interactions between the objects are shown by arrows. 

This diagram shows the responsibility of objects. If an object has too much responsibility, meaning there are too many lines going in and out of a box, probably something is wrong in your design.  Usually you would want to split the box into two or more smaller boxes.  At this stage in your design, this can still be done easily.  Try to do that once you started coding, or even later, it will become a nightmare.  

=== Class Diagram ===
[[Image:Restaurant_Class_Diagram.png|thumb|240px|Restaurant Class Diagram.]]
For us as software engineers, at least the object-oriented kind, the Class diagram is the most important one.  A Class diagram consists of ''classes'' and lines between them.  The classes themselves are drawn as boxes, having two compartments, one for ''methods'' and one for ''attributes''.

You start with the Collaboration diagram, and the first thing you do is take all the boxes and  call them classes now.  Next, instead of having many lines going between the objects, you replace them by one line.  But for every line you remove, you must add a method entry to the class's method compartment.  So at this stage the Class diagram looks quite similar to the Collaboration diagram.

The things that make a Class diagram different are the attributes and the fact that there is not only one type of line, but several different kinds.  As for the attributes, you must look at each class carefully and decide which variables are needed for this class to function.  If the class is merely a data container this is easy, if the class does some more complicated things, this may not be so easy.

As for the lines, we call them relationships between the objects, and basically there are three major kinds:
* the association (''has a''): a static relationship, usually one class is attribute of another class, or one class uses another class
* the aggregation (''consists of''): for instance an order consists of order details
* and the inheritance (''is a''): describes a hierarchy between classes

Now with the Class diagram finished, you can lean back: if you have a good UML Modelling tool you simply click on the 'Generate Code' button and it will create stubs for all the classes with methods and attributes in your favorite programming language.  By the way, don't expect your manager to understand class diagrams.

      <comment>/* Betweenness centrality */ Rephrased again (according to the formula, equally many paths are examined no matter if the graph is directed or not)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==

There are a variety of networks in transportation geography, such as the airline networks, road networks, and canal networks. One important question is how to measure these networks. If we focus on properties of the nodes, the questions can be: how important are certain nodes? And how to quantify their importance? 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality Centrality] measures are often used to measure a node's importance. There are three major categories: degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality.

=== Degree centrality ===

Degree centrality measures the importance of a node by the number of edges ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory) degree]) the node has. The idea is that a node with more edges is more important. Mathematically, for node ''j'', its degree centrality is calculated as the number of its degrees divided by ''n-1'', where ''n'' is the total number of edges in the graph. 

=== Closeness centrality ===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_(graph_theory)#Closeness_centrality Closeness centrality] measures the importance of a node by its geodesic distance to other nodes. The idea is that the closer a node is to other nodes, the important the node is. Mathematically it is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of geodesic distances to all other nodes &lt;ref&gt;Centrality measures http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Betweenness centrality ===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness#Betweenness_centrality Betweenness centrality] measures the importance of a node by its proportion of paths between other nodes. The idea is that a node that plays the roles of connecting more other nodes is more important. Mathematically,  the betweenness centrality of node ''j'' is calculated as the proportion of shortest paths from one node ''s'' to another node node ''t'' that passes through ''j''.

== Technical Discussion ==
''Adapted from Wikipedia article on  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality Centrality]''

Within [[w:graph theory]] and [[w:network analysis]], there are various measures of the '''centrality''' of a [[w:vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] within a [[w:graph (mathematics)|graph]] that determine the relative importance of a vertex within the graph (for example, how important a person is within a [[w:social network]], or, in the theory of [[w:space syntax]], how important a room is within a building or how well-used a road is within an [[w:urban network]]).

There are four measures of centrality that are widely used in network analysis: degree centrality, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality. For a review as well as generalizations to weighted networks, see Opsahl et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Opsahl | first1 = Tore | last2 = Agneessens | first2 = Filip | last3 = Skvoretz | first3 = John | title = Node centrality in weighted networks: Generalizing degree and shortest paths | doi = 10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.006 | year = 2010 | pages = 245 | volume = 32 | journal = Social Networks | url=http://toreopsahl.com/2010/04/21/article-node-centrality-in-weighted-networks-generalizing-degree-and-shortest-paths/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Degree centrality===
{{Main|Degree (graph theory)}} 
The first, and simplest, is '''degree centrality'''. Degree centrality is defined as the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has). Degree is often interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). If the network is directed (meaning that ties have direction), then we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely [[w:indegree]] and [[w:outdegree]]. Indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node, and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others. For positive relations such as friendship or advice, we normally interpret indegree as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.

For a graph &lt;math&gt;G:=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' vertices, the degree centrality &lt;math&gt;C_D(v)&lt;/math&gt; for vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;C_D(v)= \frac{\text{deg}(v)}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating degree centrality for all nodes &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in a graph takes [[w:big theta|&lt;math&gt;\Theta(V^2)&lt;/math&gt;]] in a [[w:dense matrix|dense]] [[w:adjacency matrix]] representation of the graph, and for edges &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in a graph takes &lt;math&gt;\Theta(E)&lt;/math&gt; in a [[w:sparse matrix]] representation.

The definition of centrality can be extended to graphs. Let &lt;math&gt;v*&lt;/math&gt; be the node with highest degree centrality in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X:=(Y,Z)&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; node connected graph that maximizes the following quantity (with &lt;math&gt;y*&lt;/math&gt; being the node with highest degree centrality in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;H= \displaystyle{\sum^{|Y|}_{j=1}{C_D(y*)-C_D(y_j)}}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the degree centrality of the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;C_D(G)= \frac{\displaystyle{\sum^{|V|}_{i=1}{[C_D(v*)-C_D(v_i)]}}}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is maximized when the graph &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains one node that is connected to all other nodes and all other nodes are connected only to this one central node (a [[w:star graph]]). In this case
:&lt;math&gt;H=(n-1)(1-\frac{1}{n-1})=n-2&lt;/math&gt;
so the degree centrality of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt;C_D(G)= \frac{\displaystyle{\sum^{|V|}_{i=1}{[C_D(v*)-C_D(v_i)]}}}{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Betweenness centrality===
[[Image:Graph betweenness.svg|240px|right|thumb|Hue (from red=0 to blue=max) shows the node betweenness.]]

'''Betweenness''' is a centrality measure of a [[w:vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] within a [[w:graph (mathematics)|graph]] (there is also [[w:edge (graph theory)|edge]] betweenness, which is not discussed here). Vertices that occur on many [[w:shortest path problem|shortest paths]] between other vertices have higher betweenness than those that do not.

For a graph &lt;math&gt;G:=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' vertices, the betweenness &lt;math&gt;C_B(v)&lt;/math&gt; for vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is computed as follows:

1. For each pair of vertices (s,t), compute all [[w:Shortest path problem|shortest paths]] between them.

2. For each pair of vertices (s,t), determine the fraction of shortest paths that pass through the vertex in question (here, vertex v).

3. Sum this fraction over all pairs of vertices (s,t).

Or, more succinctly:&lt;ref name=&quot;narayanan&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis  | author = Shivaram Narayanan  | title = The Betweenness Centrality Of Biological Networks  | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.958&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf  | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_B(v)= \sum_{s \neq v \neq t \in V}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{st}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of shortest paths from ''s'' to ''t'', and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{st}(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of shortest paths from ''s'' to ''t'' that pass through a vertex ''v''.  This may be normalized by dividing through the number of paths that are examined, which is &lt;math&gt;(n-1)(n-2).&lt;/math&gt; For undirected graphs, only one of the directions between each pair of vertices has to be examined, so only &lt;math&gt;(n-1)(n-2)/2&lt;/math&gt; paths in total, which is also the number of pairs of vertices not including ''v''.  For example, in an undirected [[w:Star (graph theory)|star graph]], the center vertex (which is contained in every possible shortest path) would have a betweenness of &lt;math&gt;(n-1)(n-2)/2&lt;/math&gt; (1, if normalised) while the leaves (which are contained in no shortest paths) would have a betweenness of 0.

Calculating the betweenness and closeness centralities of all the vertices in a graph involves calculating the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices on a graph.  This takes [[w:big theta|&lt;math&gt;\Theta(V^3)&lt;/math&gt;]] time with the [[w:Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], modified to not only find one but count all shortest paths between two nodes.  On a sparse graph, [[w:Johnson's algorithm]] may be more efficient, taking [[w:Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(V^2 \log V + V E)&lt;/math&gt;]] time. On unweighted graphs, calculating betweenness centrality takes [[w:Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(V E)&lt;/math&gt;]] time using Brandes' algorithm&lt;ref name=&quot;brandes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Ulrik Brandes  | title = A faster algorithm for betweenness centrality  | url = http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~rb4/resources/Brandes.pdf  | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In calculating betweenness and closeness centralities of all vertices in a graph, it is assumed that graphs are undirected and connected with the allowance of loops and multiple edges. When specifically dealing with network graphs, oftentimes graphs are without loops or multiple edges to maintain simple relationships (where edges represent connections between two people or vertices). In this case, using Brandes' algorithm will divide final centrality scores by 2 to account for each shortest path being counted twice&lt;ref name=&quot;brandes&quot; /&gt;.

===Closeness centrality===
In [[w:topology]] and related areas in mathematics, '''closeness''' is one of the basic concepts in a topological space. Intuitively we say two sets are close if they are arbitrarily near to each other. The concept can be defined naturally in a [[w:metric space]] where a notion of distance between elements of the space is defined, but it can be generalized to topological spaces where we have no concrete way to measure distances.

In [[w:graph theory]] '''closeness''' is a centrality measure of a [[w:vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] within a [[w:graph (mathematics)|graph]].  Vertices that are 'shallow' to other vertices (that is, those that tend to have short geodesic distances to other vertices with in the graph) have higher closeness.  Closeness is preferred in [[w:network analysis]] to mean shortest-path length, as it gives higher values to more central vertices, and so is usually positively associated with other measures such as [[w:degree (graph theory)|degree]].

In the network theory, '''closeness''' is a sophisticated measure of centrality. It is defined as the mean geodesic distance (i.e., the [[w:Shortest path problem|shortest path]]) between a vertex ''v'' and all other vertices reachable from it:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{t \in V\setminus v}d_G(v,t)}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n\ge 2&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the network's 'connectivity component' ''V'' reachable from ''v''. 
Closeness can be regarded as a measure of how long it will take information to spread from a given vertex to other reachable vertices in the network&lt;ref&gt;Newman, MEJ, 2003, Arxiv preprint [http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0309045 cond-mat/0309045].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some define closeness to be the reciprocal of this quantity, but either way the information communicated is the same (this time estimating the speed instead of the timespan). The closeness &lt;math&gt;C_C(v)&lt;/math&gt; for a vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal of the sum of [[w:Distance (graph theory)|geodesic distance]]s to all other vertices of ''V''&lt;ref&gt;Sabidussi, G. (1966) The centrality index of a graph. ''Psychometrika'' '''31''', 581--603.&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;C_C(v)=\frac{1}{\sum_{t \in V\setminus v}d_G(v,t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Different methods and algorithms can be introduced to measure closeness, like the ''random-walk centrality'' introduced by Noh and Rieger (2003) that is a measure of the speed with which randomly walking messages reach a vertex from elsewhere in the network—a sort of random-walk version of closeness centrality&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Noh and H. Rieger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 118701 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''information centrality'' of Stephenson and Zelen (1989) is another closeness measure, which bears some similarity to that of Noh and Rieger. In essence it measures the harmonic mean length of paths ending at a vertex '''&lt;big&gt;i&lt;/big&gt;''', which is smaller if '''&lt;big&gt;i&lt;/big&gt;''' has many short paths connecting it to other vertices&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, K. A. and Zelen, M., 1989. Rethinking centrality: Methods and examples.
Social Networks 11, 1–37.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dangalchev (2006), in order to measure the network vulnerability, modifies the definition for closeness so it can be used for disconnected graphs and the total closeness is easier to
calculate&lt;ref name=Dan&gt;Dangalchev Ch., Residual Closeness in Networks, Phisica A '''365''', 556 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;C_C(v)=\sum_{t \in V\setminus v}2^{-d_G(v,t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

An extension to networks with disconnected components has been proposed by Opsahl (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;opsahl2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Tore Opsahl  | title = Closeness centrality in networks with disconnected components | url = http://toreopsahl.com/2010/03/20/closeness-centrality-in-networks-with-disconnected-components/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Eigenvector centrality===
'''Eigenvector centrality''' is a measure of the importance of a [[w:node (networking)|node]] in a [[w:network (mathematics)|network]]. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes.  [[w:Google]]'s [[w:PageRank]] is a variant of the Eigenvector centrality measure.

==== Using the adjacency matrix to find eigenvector centrality ====
Let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the score of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; node. Let &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[w:adjacency matrix]] of the network. Hence &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j} = 1&lt;/math&gt; if the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; node is adjacent to the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; node, and &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j} = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. More generally, the entries in ''A'' can be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a [[w:stochastic matrix]].

For the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; node, let the centrality score be proportional to the sum of the scores of all nodes which are connected to it. Hence 

:&lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{j \in M(i)}x_j = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{j = 1}^N A_{i,j}x_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of nodes that are connected to the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; node, ''N'' is the total number of nodes and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.  In vector notation this can be rewritten as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\mathbf{Ax}&lt;/math&gt;, or as the [[w:eigenvector]] equation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ax} = {\lambda}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, there will be many different [[w:eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for which an eigenvector solution exists. However, the additional requirement that all the entries in the eigenvector be positive implies (by the [[w:Perron–Frobenius theorem]]) that only the greatest eigenvalue results in the desired centrality measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = M. E. J. Newman  | title = The mathematics of networks  | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/palgrave.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; component of the related eigenvector then gives the centrality score of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; node in the network.  [[w:Power iteration]] is one of many [[w:eigenvalue algorithm]]s that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;The limit as x approaches gives you the horizontal asymptote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}x = L&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use L'Hopital rule to help you with these limits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2x}{2x^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an indeterminate form so you can use L'Hopital's rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this you need to take &lt;math&gt;\frac{f \prime (x)}{g \prime (x)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this you get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2}{4x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no longer in indeterminate form so, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;L=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biography and Background==
Frances Oldham Kelsey was born in 1914 in Cobble Hill, British Columbia. [[Image:Kelsey02.png|right|thumb|300px|Frances Oldham Kelsey.]]
In 1934 and 1935, she earned a bachelor’s degree in science and a master degree in science from McGill University in Montreal &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_182.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Eventually, she accepted a scholarship, where she earned her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and went on to teach there from 1938 to 1950 &lt;ref&gt;Baker, L. (2003). Women in medicine: An encyclopaedia. Reference Reviews, 17(6), 55. &lt;/ref&gt;.In 1960 she moved to Washington, D.C., and began her long and distinguished career at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where she later became chief of the Division of New Drugs, director of the Division of Scientific Investigations &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_182.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Dr. Frances Kelsey took her stand against thalidomide during her first month at the FDA, on her first assignment. The application was for thalidomide, a drug then popular in Europe to aid sleep and alleviate nausea during pregnancy. Kelsey and her FDA colleagues found the safety and toxicity data submitted by the company to be lacking supportive evidence, and she insisted that the company provide better data. Those concerns proved to be well-founded: about a year later a European outbreak of phocomelia, a severe birth defect in which infants are born without limbs or with severely deformed limbs, was associated to the use of thalidomide during pregnancy. Kelsey’s refusal to approve the application is credited with saving thousands of US children from such a fate. It also helped prompt massive changes in the regulation of drugs in the United States and abroad, changes she helped to shape during her 45-year career at the FDA &lt;ref&gt;Kuehn, B. B. M. (2010).

Accutane (clinically known as isotretinoin) was invented in the late 1950s to treat acne, though in its earliest trials it proved to have teratogenic effects in animals, causing birth defects when mothers are exposed to the drug.&lt;ref&gt;http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/516/petrocelli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Accutane is a human teratogen that can cause multiple major malformations; the embryopathy associated with exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy includes craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system malformations '&lt;ref&gt;Lammer EJ, Chen DT, Hoar RM, Agnish ND, Benke PJ, Braun JT, Curry CJ, Fernhoff PM, Grix AW, Lott IT, Richard JM, Sun SC. 1985. Retinoic acid embryopathy. N Engl J Med 313:837–841.&lt;/ref&gt;'. The drug was released in 1982 by Roche Pharmaceuticals under FDA pregnancy category X which states that “the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits” but says nothing about women who may become pregnant. The drug was approved for the treatment of severe recalcitrant cystic acne, but within the first year became the drug of choice for treating all types of acne, prescribed by nearly 90% of dermatologists nationwide until the first reports of malformed babies came in. Babies of accutane users were born with heart and central nervous system problems, malformed or absent ears, wide-set eyes and sometimes a cleft palate. Each successive year, as more reports came in, Roche Pharmaceuticals issued further warnings and increased labels, but the rate of birth defects continued to grow.&lt;ref&gt;http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/516/petrocelli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


===FDA===
In Februrary of 1988 the Office of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the FDA recommended that the drug be withdrawn from the market, but at Roche’s request, the FDA merely appointed a committee to review the drug. A follow up report was issued later that year stating that a woman exposed to Accutane in her first trimester had a 40% chance of miscarrying and a 25% chance of delivering a malformed baby.
At the end of 1988, the manufacturer began a Pregnancy Prevention Program (PPP) that includes educational materials for both prescribers and patients and offers women reimbursement for contraceptive counseling by a physician. The PPP protocol states that women of reproductive potential must either abstain from sexual intercourse or use two methods of effective contraception simultaneously, have a negative pregnancy test before starting Accutane, and wait until the second or third day of their next menstrual period before beginning to take Accutane. The PPP also asks women of childbearing age being treated with Accutane to voluntarily enroll in the Boston University Accutane Survey (BUAS) &lt;ref&gt;Mitchell AA, Van Bennekom CM, Louik C. 1995. A pregnancy-prevention program in women of childbearing age receiving isotretinoin. N Engl J Med 333:101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;.Although Accutane is contraindicated in pregnancy, and its package explicitly warns users to avoid pregnancy while taking the product, exposed pregnancies continue to occur. Approximately 85 cases of congenital anomalies after exposure to Accutane have been reported to the FDA since 1989. Sixty of these reports have at least one of the features of retinoid embryopathy &lt;ref&gt;(A. Vega, FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, personal communication, August 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Accutane is known to be a very harsh drug with a long list of side effects including pink eye, chronically dry and sensitive skin, chapped lips, nosebleeds and joint pain, and possibly chest pain, depression, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, rashes and skin infections and decreased night vision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accutanesideeffects.net/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the medical side effects, women who wanted to take accutane now also had to take birth control, monthly pregnancy tests and drive back and forth to renew prescriptions. Alternatively, a waiver was available that said you were not sexually active and would not become pregnant.

===Sloan Survey===
In conjunction with the PPP, the FDA conducted what was called the Sloan Survey, a voluntary program that surveyed women treated with accutane since 1989, totalling about 35% of the total female users.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/00/slides/3639s1c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study sought to determine how effective the PPP was and what the continued risk was among women of childbearing age. 

Between 1992 and 1999 the number of women taking accutane went up 200%, and 80% of its users were between 15 and 30 years old, the age group considered by the FDA to be the prime child bearing population. Results of the Sloan Survey discovered major issues of non-compliance although 40% of female users in the high risk age group were sexually active. Between 1982 and 2000 there were 1,995 exposed pregnancies of which only only 383 were carried to full term and 42% of those babies with available medical records were born with major malformations. 1,446 of these pregnancies were terminated either electively or spontaneously and the outcome of the remaining 166 is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Breaking out: a woman's guide to coping with acne at any age By Lydia Preston, Dr. Tina Alster&lt;/ref&gt; 

The FDA concluded that pregnancies are still occurring, there is substantial non-compliance with regulations, and that the survey only captured about 40% of all users and does not likely represent the actual number of problems.

==Ethics==
To get out of the strict qualifications, including added costs, additional drugs and inconvenient logistics, women can sign a waiver that says they are not sexually active and will not become pregnant. It seems that this an indication that the FDA is more concerned with liability than actually preventing birth defects. 

The pregnancy classification X under which Accutane was first released and continues to be distributed stipulates that it cannot be prescribed to pregnant women because the risks outweigh the benefits. This stipulation should probably be expanded to include women who might get pregnant because they are at just as much a risk of passing on defects to their potential unborn children.

Accutane is a very expensive drug that is very attractive to a large portion of the population who can afford it. This could be a factor in its continued distribution. Those who have money are willing to pay for it to treat their acne and seem to be willing to take the risks of either signing the waiver or giving birth to a child with birth defects.

==Introduction==
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, conducted from 1932 to 1972, was a study conducted by the United States Public Health Service with the cooperation of the Tuskegee Institute to record the natural history of syphilis if it were left untreated. It gained notoriety for its unethical use of human subjects and became a long-lasting source of distrust towards the U.S. government. This article explores the related ethical issues and tells the story of Peter Buxtun, the man who brought this study to light.

===Background===
The study, officially named the &quot;Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male&quot;, initially involved 600 black men, all of whom were residents of Macon County, Alabama. Two-thirds of these men had syphilis and one-third did not. &lt;ref&gt; Center for Disease Control (2011). U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm &lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the study was to examine the progression of syphilis among black males if it was left untreated. Before the study began, the germ that causes syphilis and its symptoms were all well understood, so the purpose of the study was dubious at best.
[[File:Tuskegee-syphilis-study doctor-injecting-subject.jpg|right|200px|Doctor injecting a patient with placebo as part of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study|thumb]]
In return for participation, the subjects were promised free physical examinations, hot meals on examination days, free treatment for minor ailments, and burial stipends to their survivors if they died. Because most of the men were poor, the incentives were very enticing. None of the subjects, however, were told of the purpose of the study, and those infected with syphilis were never informed. Charles Pollard, one of the subjects who had syphilis, recalled: &quot;I went on over and they told me I had bad blood. And that's what they've been telling me ever since... they never mentioned syphilis to me, not even once.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; New York Times, July 27, 1972, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, many of the subjects believed that they were being treated for the &quot;bad blood.&quot; &quot;They been doctoring me off and on ever since then, and they gave me a blood tonic,&quot; said Pollard. However, no treatments for syphilis were administered throughout the length of the study. In fact, PHS officials made sure other doctors did not give the infected subjects treatments by telling the subjects they would lose their benefits if they sought treatment outside of the study. &lt;ref&gt; New York Times, July 27, 1972, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, fourteen years after the study began, penicillin was discovered to be an effective cure for syphilis. The standard treatment for syphilis before 1946 consisted of injections of arsenic and mercury, poisons that sometimes did more harm than good. &lt;ref&gt; Atlanta Journal. July 27, 1972, p2. &lt;/ref&gt; Because of its safety and effectiveness, penicillin quickly became the standard treatment for syphilis. PHS officials, however, continued to deny the infected subjects treatment and prevented them from seeking treatment outside of the study. Reports indicate that by 1969, between 28 and 100 men died as a direct result of syphilis and many others developed serious heart complications that contributed to their deaths. &lt;ref&gt; James H. Jones (1981). ''Bad Blood, The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment'', p2. The Free Press, New York, NY. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, stories on the Tuskegee study broke out on several major newspapers. The ensuing public outcry immediately forced PHS to terminate the study, which had gone on for forty years. The man that brought this story to light was Peter Buxtun.

==Buxtun's Story==
Peter Buxtun is a former employee of the PHS. He discovered the Tuskegee study through several of his co-workers, and was especially taken aback when learned the participants were not being treated. He wrote a letter to Dr. Williams J. Brown, the former director of the Division of Venereal Diseases, &quot;expressing grave moral concerns about the experiment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; James H. Jones (1981). ''Bad Blood, The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment'', p191. The Free Press, New York, NY. &lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Dr. Brown flew Buxtun to Atlanta to attend a scientific meeting where he met two men, one being Dr. John Cutler.
[[File:Buxton_media.jpg|right|250px|Peter Buxtun|thumb]]
Dr. Cutler, a health officer with intimate knowledge of the study, proceeded to &quot;straighten out&quot; Buxtun. &quot;He was infuriated,&quot; stated Buxtun. &quot;He had obviously read my material, thought of me as some form of a lunatic who needed immediate chastisement and he proceeded to administer it.&quot; Dr. Cutler then launched an impassioned defense of the experiment, stressing how it would benefit physicians who were treating syphilitic blacks. &quot;Buxtun was neither intimidated nor impressed.&quot; He believed blacks were being used as &quot;human substitutes for guinea pigs,&quot; and informed the officials of the ramifications of the public discovering this study. Peter resigned from the PHS in 1967, and he wrote another letter to Dr. Brown the following year stating, &quot;The group is 100 percent Negro... This in itself is political dynamite and subject to wild journalistic misinterpretation.”&lt;ref&gt; James H. Jones (1981). ''Bad Blood, The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment'', p192-3. The Free Press, New York, NY. &lt;/ref&gt; When Buxtun realized nothing was going to come of his letter, he contacted a reporter and told her about the study. The reporter contacted her editor, who then assigned another woman to the story. On July 25, 1972, the Washington Star published her article. The American people, as Buxtun foretold, were outraged when they read about the project. Public health officials had no luck attempting to justify the program. The Tuskegee Study ended later that year and every survivor received $10,000.”&lt;ref&gt; James H. Jones (1981). ''Bad Blood, The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment'', p204. The Free Press, New York, NY. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the Study==
The Public Health Service rushed to defend itself as stories of the study broke out across major newspapers. It contended that because the best treatment in 1932 was dangerous and hardly effective, little harm was done in leaving the subjects untreated.&lt;ref&gt; Millar quoted in Montgomery Advertiser, July 26, 1972, p1&lt;/ref&gt; Most journalists accepted this argument, but some argued that such claims cannot be made retroactively: &quot;The government from the moment the experiment began withheld the best available treatment for a particularly cruel disease. The immorality of the experiment was inherent in its premise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; St. Louis Dispatch, July 30, 1972, p2D. &lt;/ref&gt; Whether this was ethical might have been controversial, but almost no one approved PHS's decision to deny the subjects penicillin when it became the standard treatment. Many pointed a finger at Dr. John R. Heller, the director that oversaw the study between 1943 and 1948, but Dr. Heller denied all responsibility and shockingly declared that &quot;There was nothing in the experiment that was unethical or unscientific.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; New York Times, July 26, 1972, p1 &lt;/ref&gt; A congressional hearing was conducted and several class action lawsuits were brought against the PHS, all of which were settled out of court.

===Legacy of the Controversy===
As a result of Peter Buxton’s testimony, medical organizations became pressured to explicitly state their commitment to protecting the rights of human test subjects.  The National Research Act, signed in to law in 1974, created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.&lt;ref&gt; Office of Integrity. ''Human Research Subjects''. University of Nevada, Las Vegas: http://research.unlv.edu/ORI-HSR/history-ethics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission, which releases reports and studies related to bioethics and human medical rights, issued its most well-known document, the Belmont Report, in 1979.  The report spells out what should be required ethical principles in medical research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.  The report also dictates common applications that are known today in human research, such as informed consent, assessment of risks and benefits, and selection procedures for test subjects.&lt;ref&gt; Office of Human Subjects Research. ''The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the protection of human subjects of research''. National Institutes of Health: http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is likely that the principles and procedures developed in the Belmont Report were produced as a direct response to the ethical shortcomings discovered by the revelation of the Tuskegee Study.

===Presidential Apology===
Although legislation created these medical organizations to improve the ethical oversight of human medical research, the United States government did not formally respond to the Tuskegee Study until 1997, 65 years after the beginning of the Tuskegee Study and 27 years after Buxton’s whistleblowing.  On May 16, President Bill Clinton officially apologized for the actions of the US Public Health Service, stating that “what was done cannot be undone, but we can end the silence…what the United States government did was wrong and I am sorry”.&lt;ref&gt; The White House, Office of the Press Secretary. (1997, May 16). ''Remarks by the President in Apology for Study Done in Tuskegee''. FirstGov: http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Herman Shaw, at that time 94 years old and one of the five surviving members of the study, responded by thanking him “for doing [his] best to right this wrong tragedy and to resolve that Americans should never again allow such an event to occur”.&lt;ref&gt; Thomas, S. B. (2000, January). ''The Legacy of Tuskegee: AIDS and African-Americans''. The Body: http://www.thebody.com/content/art30946.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical Implications==
[[File:Phs.svg|left|120px|thumb]]
The four core values of the United States Public Health Service are: leadership, service, integrity and excellence. The desciption under &quot;service&quot; on the PHS website is, &quot;Demonstrates a commitment to public health through compassionate actions and stewardship of time, resources, and talents.&quot; The description under integrity is, &quot;Exemplifies uncompromising ethical conduct and maintains the highest standards of responsibility and accountability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corp: http://www.usphs.gov/aboutus/corevalues.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
It is hard to imagine an organization with values such as &quot;compassion&quot; and &quot;uncompromising ethical conduct&quot; allowing this type of a study to take place. Dr. Brown showed to Dr. David Sencer, the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the second letter that Buxtun wrote. &quot;Neither official thought they were doing anything wrong, but they decided to convene a 'blue-ribbon panel' to evaluate the study... Everyone at the CDC supported the program and thought it should continue until the last participant was autopsied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; James H. Jones (1981). ''Bad Blood, The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment'', p195. The Free Press, New York, NY. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
While this statement would seem to have closed the door on the United States’ involvement in human rights violations in medical research, the government once again found itself having to account for another case of unethical medical research.  In October of 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton formally apologized for infecting hundreds of Guatemalans, including institutionalized mental patients, with sexually transmitted diseases without their knowledge or permission from 1946 to 1948. &lt;ref&gt; CNN Wire Staff (2010, October 1). ''US apologizes for infecting Guatemalans with STDs in the 1940s''. CNN World: http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-01/world/us.guatemala.apology_1_apologies-research-study-guatemala-city?_s=PM:WORLD&lt;/ref&gt;

This latest apology by the United States government proves that the events of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study are not an isolated case.  On at least one other occasion, government agencies intentionally took advantage of individuals with reduced autonomy, in the pursuit of scientific advancement.  In the case of Tuskegee Syphilis Study, members of the United States Public Health Service targeted poor, uneducated sharecroppers.  Subjects of the study were misled about the purpose of the study, and were prevented from receiving medical assistance.  Even after a simple, readily-available cure for the disease was discovered, Penicillin was intentionally withheld from study participants.
  
Just as with the events of Arthur Andersen's questionable accounting practices, organizational corruption by upper management resulted in the continuation of unethical practices.  However, the Tuskegee case diverges markedly from Arthur Andersen in the fact that many of the leaders of the study truly believed that they were acting correctly, despite the harm that they were causing.  While it is hard to think that any of the accounting firm’s managers believed that they were benefiting anyone besides themselves in their practices, Dr. John Heller, for example, stated after the Buxton testimony that “for the most part doctors and civil servants simply did their jobs, [many] worked for the glory of science”. &lt;ref&gt; Cockburn, Anthony. (1998). ''Whiteout: The CIA, drugs, and the Press''. New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering this quote, it seems that some believe the potential benefits of medical advancements may at times allow for the knowing manipulation of test subjects.

      <comment>/* David Franklin - Questionable Motivations as a Whistleblower */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intro ==
[[File:Fox-40-whistle.jpg|thumb|float=right|Whistleblowing]]
Parke-Davis developed the drug Neurontin, or generically gabapentin. The Federal Food and Drug Administration approved this drug in 1993 to treat epilepsy patients and in 2002 to treat neuralgia patients. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/020235s041,020882s028,021129s027lbl.pdf Neurontin FDA Insert], Neurontin Drug Insert&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these two uses did not have a large market. Therefore, Parke-Davis began an illegal marketing campaign, advertising the drug for treatment of bipolar disorder, migraines, and headaches in the 1990s.

Per FDA regulations, it is legal for doctors to prescribe a drug for an unapproved use, but it is not legal for drug companies to market the drug for these unapproved uses.&lt;ref name = &quot;radley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author =  David C. Radley;  Stan N. Finkelstein;  Randall S. Stafford  | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | year = 2006 |  volume = 166 | issue = 9 | pages = 1021–1026 | title = Off-label Prescribing Among Office-Based Physicians  | url = http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/166/9/1021 | doi =  10.1001/archinte.166.9.1021 | pmid =  16682577}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Pfizer, the parent company of Parke-Davis, was found guilty for promoting and marketing Neurontin for unapproved uses.

This chapter first introduces Neurontin and Parke-Davis and then examines the whistleblower of this illegal marketing campaign, Dr. David Franklin. This analysis allows the reader to understand both the context and motivation surrounding the whistleblower in both a positive and negative light.

== Parke-Davis ==
Parke-Davis, America's first pharmaceutical producer, was founded in 1866. At one time it was the largest drug maker in the US. Parke-Davis introduced the first methodical clinical trials and was a leader in the industry.  In 1970, Parke-Davis was acquired by Warner-Lambert, which later merged with Pfizer in 2000 to form the world's highest valued pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_warner_lambert.jsp Pfizer Website], Warner-Lambert: A History&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:ParkeDavis1891.jpg‎|left|thumb|Original Parke-Davis plant in Detroit, 1891.]]

The phrase on the Parke-Davis logo, &quot;Medicamenta Vera,&quot; translates to 'True Medicine.'  Conflictingly, the tactics executives from Parke-Davis pursued in the late 1990s were far from truthful.  Most notably, Parke-Davis began a huge marketing campaign to persuade doctors to prescribe Neurontin for unapproved uses- despite the fact that it is illegal for pharmaceutical companies to encourage, or even suggest, this practice. In the year 2000, a staggering 78% of Neurontin prescriptions were for off-label uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;

Other illegal activities included paying doctors to:
* Pose as authors for journal articles on unapproved Neurontin uses
* Attend resort dinners and weekend retreats where they were encouraged to prescribe the drug
* Speak about its benefits
* Include their Neurontin patients in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/14/business/whistle-blower-says-marketers-broke-the-rules-to-push-a-drug.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm New York Times],&quot;Whistle-Blower Says Marketers Broke the Rules To Push a Drug&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;annals&quot;&gt; [http://www.annals.org/content/145/4/284.full Annals of Internal Medicine], &quot;Narrative Review: The Promotion of Gabapentin: An Analysis of Internal Industry Documents&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, Pfizer pleaded guilty to violating FDA regulations, resulting in a $430 million settlement. It is interesting to note that, when this was settled, Pfizer tried to make the distinction between itself and Parke Davis - noting how the acquisition occurred well after the illegal activity began and how the activities under investigation did not involve any Pfizer employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;sf&quot;&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/05/14/BUGKK6L0LB1.DTL#ixzz1KgLqIdav San Francisco Chronicle], &quot;Huge penalty in drug fraud&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1125531/?tool=pmcentrez British Medical Journal], &quot;Whistleblower charges drug company with deceptive practices&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly enough, since then, Pfizer has been involved in another $2.3 billion settlement for the illegal marketing of drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/02/AR2009090201449_pf.html Washington Post], &quot;In Settlement, A Warning To Drugmakers&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== David Franklin - A 'Good Guy' Perspective ==
The key, and only, whistleblower for this case is David Franklin. Franklin grew up aspiring to be a scientist and to cure disease.  He graduated from the University of Rhode Island as a doctoral microbiologist.  He went on to become research fellow at Harvard, and then to work at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.  From there he was accepted as a medical liason at Parke-Davis in April of 1996. &lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3079883/ns/dateline_nbc/ Dateline NBC], &quot;Drug giant accused of false claims&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  As a medical liaison, Franklin's job was to be the intermediary expert on prescription drugs between doctors and the pharmaceutical company.  Liaisons are supposed to be objective, third-party advisers to doctors, without carrying a 'company man' label.  Typically, medical liaisons are strictly forbidden by their employers to discuss off-label uses with their clients.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/12/business/doctor-explains-why-he-blew-the-whistle.html?src=pm New York Times], &quot;Doctor Explains Why He Blew the Whistle&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin's words on marketing tactics&lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt; }}
At the time Franklin joined Parke-Davis, company executives were frustrated with the limited sales potential of Neurontin due to the few FDA-approved uses.  So top staff initiated an illegal marketing plan to sell the drug for a plethora of off-label uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;  This was not just in isolated cases, rather, this was an extensive training campaign for company liasons.  They worked closely with doctors to win their trust, and then promoted Neurontin prescriptions for unapproved uses.  As Franklin puts it in a Dateline NBC interview, &quot;I was trained to deceive, to lie to doctors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt;  Essentially, the Parke-Davis medical liaison converted from an objective adviser to a salesman with ulterior motives.  

After only a few weeks at Parke-Davis, Franklin began to doubt these practices.  He was told by executives that 'if he talked publicly about the company's marketing he would be made a scapegoat and be described as a rogue employee in a company that played by the rules.'&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;   Franklin also recorded a voicemail left by his boss, shown below. 

{{Rquote|left|
'''I want you out there every day selling Neurontin... holding their hand, whispering in their ear — Neurontin for pain, Neurontin for monotherapy, Neurontin for bipolar, Neurontin for everything…'''|
Voicemail from Franklin's boss&lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt; }}

This pressure placed on employees by the Parke-Davis hierarchy was presumably suffocating.  Intimidation became a key tactic for executives.  Similar to 'teachers' in the Milgram Experiment, liaisons felt they had no choice but to follow orders to sell Neurontin to doctors for all possible uses.  Liasons for Neurontin were told that if they were not comfortable with their tactics, then they should leave.  So on 29 July, only four months later, Franklin dropped his company car and office keys at a co-worker's house and never returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt;  

From there, he decided to file an eight year long lawsuit with Greene and Hoffman attorneys at law.  During these years Franklin had no job, no income to support his family, and no company friends to turn to.  As one journalist puts it, “the microbiologist ended up blackballed in the pharmaceutical industry and had to endure an emotionally and financially draining odyssey as a whistle-blower.”&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot; /&gt;  He had to endure this stress, all because he was the only one who felt morally obligated to do the right thing, to turn in his own employer.  When the case was finally settled in May of 2004, Pfizer paid the second largest criminal fine in a healthcare fraud case of $430 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;sf&quot; /&gt;

== David Franklin - Questionable Motivations as a Whistleblower ==

It is easy to paint the picture of a whistleblower - someone who has come forward, spoken up, and put themselves in a precarious situation to protect others and do what is morally just. However, not all whistleblowers are motivated by purely ethical reasons. In the case of David Franklin, we must consider if the same is true. First, we will acknowledge whether or not David Franklin was trying to protect himself by coming forward. Second, we will discuss whether this whistleblower was swayed by the power of a financial incentive.

'''Protecting himself'''

{{Rquote|right|
'''Either I needed to own up to this now and put it behind me, or at some point in the future, this could come back, and I’d find myself on the wrong side of this investigation. I did believe, when I left, that they were so aggressively ramping this up, that at some point, someone would expose what was going on there. And therefore, I would find myself in the equally, or even more difficult, position of trying to explain why I ignored an obvious illegal and immoral activity within the company.'''|
Franklin's words on going public&lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt; }}

In an interview with Dateline, Franklin states that if he had not come forward, he would be &quot;on the wrong side of this investigation” &lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt;. This suggests that Franklin was, at least in part, trying to protect himself. Assuming this is true, we must ask if he should have voiced his concerns sooner, especially when &quot;He admits he should have known from the start that he was heading down the wrong path&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, the New York Times reports that “Dr. David P. Franklin decided within weeks of accepting a job with the drug maker Warner-Lambert that he had become a crucial component in an apparent corporate plan to illegally market an epilepsy drug called Neurontin.” &lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;After this realization, he waited four months before resigning and filing a law suit. &lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt;. How long do you wait before you turn someone in? is it better to report it and withdraw yourself or play along to gather evidence to build a strong case? After all, lives were at risk. Are you building a stronger case to simply make yourself look like more of a hero in the public eye/protect yourself and get a larger reward or to actually prove malicious actions?

'''Rewards'''

Ultimately, Franklin filed his case under the terms of the US False Claims Act. As a result of the settlement, Franklin came away with 26.6 million dollars. It is clear that with this settlement, Franklin is set for life. As a USA Today report puts it, “Thursday's settlement gives him even more personal satisfaction — not to mention enough money that he could walk away and retire.” &lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2004-05-13-pfizer-whistleblower_x.htm USA Today], &quot;$26.6M won't change me, whistle-blower says&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. Even MSNBC acknowledges the irony: &quot;So the four-month job in sales that caused so much agony for this scientist, ironically, might in the end have set him up for life&quot;  &lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt;

Franklin's interview suggests he was not in it for the money - &quot;he was not motivated by the fact that he stands to be in line for a percentage of the damages if the company loses or if it settles out of court&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;dateline&quot; /&gt;. Nevertheless, taking a skeptical approach to this scenario results in an interesting ethical analysis. Thus, we must ask: what if the idea of this money tipped the ethical scale for Franklin? did knowing of the potential reward encourage Franklin to come forward?

He states that his next stop after leaving Parke Davis was a law firm, but it is possible that during this four month period Franklin had done his research and learned about the potential rewards before coming forward. A quick search reveals that there are a number of resources - law firms and websites alike - which educate viewers about becoming a pharmaceutical whistle blower.

Franklin would have gathered that building a strong case and filing under the False Claims Act would be the best way to proceed to ensure a large reward. This act allows private citizens to sue on behalf of the government and get a portion of awards in cases where firms defraud the government. Persons filing under the Act stand to receive anywhere from 15 to 25 percent of any recovered damages.  The law was on his side. In fact, the reward itself is known as a writ of [[w:qui tam |qui tam]], originating from the latin phrase “qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur.” Translated, the phrase means &quot;who brings the action for the king as well as for himself.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;leg-dict&quot;&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Qui+Tam+Actions Legal Dictionary], Qui Tam Actions&lt;/ref&gt; As the translation shows, Franklin could have been motivated not only for the good of the people ('the king') but also for selfish reasons ('for himself'). Can a financial incentive encourage people to come forward who might otherwise remain silent? How much of an incentive is appropriate?

== Related Cases ==
=== Douglas Durand and TAP Pharmaceutical ===
The case of David Franklin and Pfizer is not unique.  There have been several other cases in which whistleblowers received a great deal of money from the US False Claims Act. The settlement of Douglas Durand and TAP Pharmaceuticals is one such instance.  Durand worked for TAP Pharmaceuticals for over 15 months, serving as a vice president of the company.   As Vice President of Sales, Durand found that the company was defrauding the government's Medicare program and also encouraging Urologists to &quot;cheat&quot; or &quot;game&quot; the Medicare system by falsely billing for product purchased at discount or even on free samples.  Durand tried to change the system at TAP but his efforts were resisted by senior management.  Before resigning, he collected information, secured an attorney, and cooperated with the government under the US False Claims Act.  For his whistleblowing, Durand received 78 million dollars. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durand&quot;&gt;[http://faculty.msb.edu/homak/homahelpsite/webhelp/Pharma_Whistleblower_Lupron_BW_6-24-02.htm Durand Case] , &quot;Doug Durand's risky documentation of fraud at drugmaker TAP is prompting wider probes&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vioxx ===
While it has been debated whether the whistleblowers blew the whistle for their own gain or because the right thing to do, does it really matter?  For example, Merck, a large pharmaceutical company, covered up negative information about an arthritis pain killer, [[Professionalism/Vioxx: Merck and the FDA|Vioxx]], that potentially increased patients' risk of a heart attack.  As a result, thousands of people may have been put at risk of heart disease.  One challenge in this case was the fact that most patients with arthritis are older and by virtue of their age, have an increased risk of heart disease.    This brings up the question of whether it is okay to do the right thing for the wrong reasons.

== Concluding Thoughts == 
While some people blow the whistle to prevent deaths and fraud, not everybody has such high moral value incentives.  Some people are driven wholly or partly by monetary gain or feel the need to protect themselves.  While it cannot be known what David Franklin's incentives were, it might be asked: Does knowing someone has alternate motives for doing the right thing change your perspective on them? Does it even matter?

However, because of the increased incentives, there have certainly been an increased number of people wrongly reported fraud cases under the United States False Claims Act.  &lt;ref name=&quot;Judicial Burden&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3655311 Burden of US False Claims Act], &quot;Whistle Blowing: An Economical Analysis of the False Claims Act&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  This slows down the legal system.  With the judicial branch having to navigate which cases are legitimate and which ones are angry ex-employees, companies continue their illegal practices.  Therefore it should be better understood the impact that the United States False Claims Act has on reporting efforts and whether this impact is negative or positive.

[[File:The A2.JPG|thumb|Peter Rost, M.D. Former Vice President Marketing, Pfizer (2004).]]

[[w:Peter_Rost (doctor%)| Peter Rost]] was a former vice president of [[w:Pfizer|Pfizer]] and author of ''The Whistleblower'', describing firsthand witnesses of Pfizer's unethical practices.

==Rost: from Pharmacia to Pfizer==
Peter Rost is a medical doctor, author of an emergency medicine textbook and former executive within the pharmaceutical industry. He began his career as an executive at pharmaceutical giant Wyeth and then moved to Stockholm-based Pharmacia. In December, 2002, shortly after the announcement that Pharmacia had been bought by Pfizer, Pfizer began hiring Pharmacia employees. Employees were informed that their salaries would be lower at Pfizer and bonuses less frequent. Pfizer retracted a job offer to one of Rost's coworkers, who was &quot;smart and had a perfect career record&quot;, after she asked for an explanation about her financial compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soft&quot;&gt; Rost, P. (2006) &lt;u&gt;The Whistleblower: Confessions of a Healthcare Hitman&lt;/u&gt; Soft Skull Press, NY &lt;/ref&gt; This was the first instance Rost saw at Pfizer that indicated unethical business practice. Also, many Pharmacia employees were informed by Pfizer that &quot;the company does not provide written or oral references for current or former employees,&quot; making it &quot;all but impossible&quot; for anyone to find a new job.

It seems Pfizer had a hierarchical structure instated before they acquired Pharmacia. This structure is not conducive to reporting unethical practices because it would be detrimental to ones career. Roth had a history at Wyeth where he brought up illegal tax-reducing practices reported to auditors Arthur Anderson. When the New York Times broke the story about Roth's involvement in whistleblowing during his time at Wyeth, his reception to executives in Pfizer changed for the worse.

On December 1, 2005, Pfizer terminated Peter Rost's employment. In an open letter to the Justice Department, Rost claimed, as a witness to a federal criminal investigation, his termination violated the False Claims Act whistleblower protection.&lt;ref&gt;Rost, P. (2005). ''[http://www.counterpunch.org/rost12052005.html Pfizer May Have Violated Federal Law When They Fired Me]''. An Open Letter to the Justice Department.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pfizer: Unethical Practices==
[[File:Pfizer Survey.png|350px|thumb|2001 Pfizer Employee Survey]]

After being demoted by Pfizer in 2003, Rost decided to launch a personal attack on the company. He compiled data, specifically highlighting areas with which employees did not agree. The graphic to the right displays these percentages.

In addition to profits being more important to Pfizer execs than ethical behavior, Rost documented many unethical practices he witnessed during his time there.

*&quot;At Pfizer, I was expected to increase profits at all costs, even when sales meant endangering lives,&quot; tells John Kopchinski, former Pfizer sales representative.&lt;ref&gt;Chitale, Radha. (2009). [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainManagement/pfizers-23-billion-settlement-change-practices/story?id=8476391 Pfizer Pays $2.3B, But Will it Change the Pharmaceutical Industry?]. ''ABC News.''&lt;/ref&gt;

''ABC News.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaziev, Marat. (2009). [http://www.lawyershop.com/2009/09/03/pfizer-fined-a-record-sum-2-point-3b-for-unethical-marketing Pfizer Fined a Record Sum $2.3B for Unethical Marketing]. ''LawyerShop''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Patients have sued Pfizer over Chantix, Lipitor, Celebrex, Bextra, Neurontin, Lyrica, Viagra, Zoloft, and other drugs. &lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Martha. (2010). [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/health/is-pfizer-the-bp-of-drug-companies-part-2-40184.html Is Pfizer the BP of Drug Companies?]. ''The Epoch Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also other instances Rost detailed in his book where Pfizer's behavior was unethical
*Sexual liaisons with potential conflict of interest. (p. 67) A similar situation happened at Boeing in 2003 when executives pursued an affair and Boeing's CEO, Harry C. Stonecipher was forced to resign. Rost felt a similar result could happen at Pfizer if his memos detailing the extramarital liaisons went unnoticed by executives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soft&quot; /&gt;

*While at Pfizer, Rost received a call from a former coworker at Wyeth whose career fell after Rost exposed illegal practices at Wyeth. Rost felt he was indirectly involved in the death of a Wyeth employee following his expose of Wyeth's illegal tax activities.

*Rost's phone was being monitored in 2003. Pfizer's phone operator gave a former colleague of Rost a hard time while trying to contact him. The operator was screening all of Rost's calls. Even personal calls from friends and family uninvolved in the pharmaceutical industry were being monitored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soft&quot; /&gt;

These measures that were taken against Rost and that he witnessed could be directly attributed to his known whistleblowing practices after the New York Times chronicled his exposure of illegal tax practices at Wyeth. Pfizer became extra vigilant after Rost began to see false advertisement and marketing of Genotropin.

==Genotropin==


Genotropin was the highly marketable growth hormone drug manufactured at Pharmacia when Pfizer acquired Pharmacia. Genotropin was one of the main reasons Pfizer became interested in acquiring Pharmacia. Little did Rost and other Pharmacia employees know illegal marketing practices and misuse of the drug at Pfizer would cause careers and corporate ties to dissolve.

===What is it?===
Genotropin is a growth hormone treatment. According to its official marketing site: &quot;It is an exact copy of the natural growth hormone that our bodies make. The main difference is that Genotropin is man-made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pfizer. (2010). ''[http://www.genotropin.com/what/default.aspx What is Genotropin?]''&lt;/ref&gt; Genotropin is approved by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDA FDA] to treat growth failure in:&lt;ref&gt;Pfizer. (2010). ''[http://www.genotropin.com/what/default.aspx What is Genotropin?]''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Children with idiopathic short stature (ISS)
* Children born small for gestational age (SGA)
* Girls with Turner syndrome (TS)
* Children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD)
* Children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
* Adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD)

===Background===

===2002===
Pfizer merged with Pharmacia, acquiring Genotropin. According to Rost, Pfizer began marketing the drug for off-label uses, which he tried to stop.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. ''[http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/spotlight/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002199768 Bad Medicine]''. BrandWeek. March 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
Rost's book &lt;u&gt;The Whistleblower: Confessions of a Healthcare Hitman&lt;/u&gt; documents Pharmacia's suspicious marketing of the Genotropin. Darren McAllister, Rost's boss at Pharmacia, wrote a memo to foreign affiliates and the US sales department of Pharmacia highlighting untrue media statements regarding the use of Genotropin as an age-combatant in adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soft&quot; /&gt; Rost claims the use of drugs other than their explicit FDA approved uses can cause hundreds of millions of fines for the company. This was a red light for Rost because a memo should not be needed if the policy is clearly known.

===2007===
In April, 2007, Pfizer settled to pay $35 million fine for bribes and off-label marketing charges over Genotropin.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, E. (2007). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2007/04/pfizer_35m_fine_for_bribe_offl/ Pfizer Must Pay $35M Fine for Bribe, Off-Label Charges Over Genetropin]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Pfizer voluntarily fully self-disclosed the off-label promotion of Genotropin by a Pharmacia subsidiary before Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer,&quot; said Allen Waxman, Pfizer's general counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, E. (2007). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2007/04/pfizer_35m_fine_for_bribe_offl/ Pfizer Must Pay $35M Fine for Bribe, Off-Label Charges Over Genetropin]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Pfizer's marketing and promotion practices are not involved in the settlement. The company has internal controls to guard against these types of practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, E. (2007). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2007/04/pfizer_35m_fine_for_bribe_offl/ Pfizer Must Pay $35M Fine for Bribe, Off-Label Charges Over Genetropin]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
In February, Rost &quot;cleared a hurdle in his ongoing whistleblower lawsuit against Pfizer.&quot; He cited &quot;200 instances in Indiana in which Genotropin was marketed by Pharmacia for unapproved uses, such as combating aging in adults and short stature in children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, E. (2008). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2008/10/peter-rost-wins-a-big-round-against-pfizer/ Peter Rost Wins A Big Round Against Pfizer]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
In September, 2010, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit Peter Rost had filed against Pfizer, in which he alleged that Pfizer was marketing Genotropin for off-label use.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, E. (2010). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/11/peter-rost-may-get-another-whack-at-pfizer/ Peter Rost may Get Another Whack at Pfizer]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, E. (2010). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/11/peter-rost-may-get-another-whack-at-pfizer/ Peter Rost may Get Another Whack at Pfizer]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Rost is a former Pfizer executive &quot;who allegated that Genotropin, a human growth hormone, was marketed for unapproved uses, such as combating aging in adults and treating short stature in children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[Silverman, E. (2010). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/09/peter-rost-loses-whistleblower-suit-against-pfizer/ Peter Rost Loses Whistleblower Suit Against Pfizer]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt; The drug was initially marketed by Pharmacia, where he worked before the company was acquired by Pfizer.&lt;ref&gt;[Silverman, E. (2010). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/09/peter-rost-loses-whistleblower-suit-against-pfizer/ Peter Rost Loses Whistleblower Suit Against Pfizer]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rost argued, &quot;Pfizer engaged in off-label promotion and provided doctors with kickbacks, which caused pharmacies to submit false claims to state medicaid agenicies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[Silverman, E. (2010). ''[http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/09/peter-rost-loses-whistleblower-suit-against-pfizer/ Peter Rost Loses Whistleblower Suit Against Pfizer]''. Pharmalot.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bextra==
[[File:Bextra.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 4: Bextra, Pfizer pain drug.]]
Bextra is a painkiller used to treat arthritis and menstrual pain. Its side effects include cardiovascular problems, gastrointestinal bleeding, heart attack, stroke, stomach ulcers, deadly skin diseases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, anaphylactic shock, and liver damage.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Laxdal. (2011). '''Bextra and Vioxx: Victims Hope For Justice.''' Retrieved from http://pfizerdugvictims.blogspot.com/2011/01/bextra-and-vioxx-victims-hope-for.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pfizer was sued for illegitimate marketing of the drug for off-label use.
===2009===
In April, Mary Halloway, former Pfizer sales executive, pled guilty to ordering her 100 subordinates to promote Bextra for unofficial uses. She demonstrated an &quot;unusually brazen effort to promote the drug, based extensively on lies,&quot;  including:&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Jim. (2009). [http://www.bnet.com/blog/drug-business/document-shows-rogue-bextra-operation-inside-pfizer/1103 Document Shows Rogue Bextra Operation Inside Pfizer]. ''BNET''.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Asking that her sales reps not be told that the FDA had not approved Bextra for certain types of post-surgery pain
#Promoting Bextra for unapproved uses
#Inventing false safety claims
#Inventing false clinical claims such as that Bextra was safer than Vioxx
#Inventing a fictional protocol for Bextra use in OB/GYN surgery pain 
During the court hearings, Pfizer attempted to hide its affiliation with Halloway, covering up its unethical practices. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2009/03/30/daily25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, Pfizer settled to pay $2.3 billion, the largest fine in U.S. history, for &quot;promoting the arthritis and menstrual pain drug Bextra for uses and in doses not approved by the FDA, putting patients at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chitale, Radha. (2009). [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainManagement/pfizers-23-billion-settlement-change-practices/story?id=8476391 Pfizer Pays $2.3B, But Will it Change the Pharmaceutical Industry?]. ''ABC News.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaziev, Marat. (2009).

''LawyerShop''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the magnitude of the fine, drug industry experts believe the verdict &quot;will do little to curb the highly profitable, unethical marketing practices by some companies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chitale, Radha. (2009). [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainManagement/pfizers-23-billion-settlement-change-practices/story?id=8476391 Pfizer Pays $2.3B, But Will it Change the Pharmaceutical Industry?]. ''ABC News.''&lt;/ref&gt; Pfizer reported annual profits of $50.0 billion, dwarfing the $2.3 billion settlement 22:1.

===2010===
In a Department of Justice sentencing for the Bextra case: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Illegal conduct was pervasive throughout the company and stemmed from messages created at high levels within the national marketing team. Employees, including district managers, explained that they did not question their supervisors about the illegal conduct that they were being instructed to carry out because to do so would be considered a '''‘CLM’ or a ‘Career Limiting Move.''''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Martha. (2010). [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/health/is-pfizer-the-bp-of-drug-companies-part-2-40184.html Is Pfizer the BP of Drug Companies?]. ''The Epoch Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Whistleblowing==
===Consequences===
[[File:Surveyed Consequences of Whistleblowing.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 5: Conseqeuences of 233 whistleblowers.]]
In a study of 233 whistleblowers, most were a &quot;family man in his 40s with a strong conscience and high moral values.&quot; The results, shown in Figure 5, include devastating consequences, such as divorce, suicide, and bankruptcy:&lt;ref&gt;Soft Skull Press. (2011). ''[http://softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-933368-39-X The Whistleblower Confessions of A Healthcare Hitman]''. Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This presents a 9-11% gap of people who faced lawsuits, needed physical care, or became alcoholics yet held no regrets.

===False Claims Act===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Claims_Act The False Claims Act] or &quot;Lincoln Law&quot; is a prime example of the Federal Government rewarding whistleblowers through legal measures. In 2009, amendments to the FCA were made to further protect whistleblowers as well as increasing the scope of the law. Programs like the FCA are essential in encouraging people to report malfeasance within organizations to not only prevent accidents, but to also preserve the principles upon which most organizations are founded.
==Lessons Learned==
===Professional reputation===
[[File:Pfizer Stock.png|thumb|right|Figure 6: Pfizer's stock over 10 years declining from 45 to 20.]]
As seen in Figure 6, Pfizer's stock has steadily declined over the past ten years from $45 to $20 per share. This decline in value is arguably a result of Pfizer's unethical practices, which have eroded its reputation and shareholder confidence. As an owner of a company, it is in your best interest to prevent such unethical practices to preserve value. In this way, rational self interest and ethics are not mutually exclusive but codependent.

===Consequences of Whistleblowing===
One must consider the consequences before whistleblowing. Under no circumstance should it be an impulse decision.  There must be a plan of action after the unwanted information is released.  One should consider the possibility of termination from employment, demotion, salary cut and/or other punitive measures. In the survey of 233 whistle blowers, life-changing events such as divorce and suicide were common. Interestingly, most individuals said they would blow the whistle again if given the opportunity. Clearly they are driven by a higher, perhaps moral purpose to unveil the truth and prevent harm unto others.

== History of Polio ==
==== Polio in the United States ====
Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a childhood disease caused by a highly infectious virus that attacks the nervous system. Approximately 1% of infected persons will suffer paralysis and 10% of paralytic cases end with fatal paralysis of the respiratory muscles&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/polio/dis-faqs.htm CDC 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/index.html WHO 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1921, Franklin D. Roosevelt contracted the disease. He used his political influence to start and raise money for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. This organization would go on to fund research by Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin &lt;ref name=&quot;FDR2000&quot;&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/polio/howpolio/fdr.htm FDR 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin developed polio vaccines in 1952 and 1957, respectively&lt;ref name=&quot;OKONEK&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/polio.php Okonek]&lt;/ref&gt;. These vaccines, coupled with public health policies, were able to eradicate the disease from the United States by 1979 &lt;ref name=&quot;INFECTIONS&quot;&gt;[http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/bacterial_viral/polio.html Infections]&lt;/ref&gt;. Polio is one of few diseases that can be eradicated because infection or the vaccine confers lifelong immunity and there is no environmental or animal host for the virus. Once everyone has the vaccine, the disease cannot exist.

==== Global Eradication Initiative ====
The Western development of a vaccine and the eradication of Polio from the United States prompted the World Health Assembly to pursue a global eradication. In the 41st assembly in 1988, members of the World Health Organization (WHO) voted to pass the Global Eradication Initiative. It stated, “Recognizing that the global eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000… represents both a fitting challenge to be undertaken… and an appropriate gift… from the twentieth to the twenty-first century.”&lt;br /&gt;
The WHO treated this act as both a “challenge” and as a “gift.” &lt;ref name=&quot;WHO1988&quot;&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/ihr/polioresolution4128en.pdf World Health Assembly 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;. This decision was made and funded largely by the Western world. The United States contributed over $1 billion. The United Kingdom donated over $500 million. Japan, Canada, Germany all gave over $250 million. Other top donors were Norway, Denmark, France, Russia, Italy, Sweden, Australia, Spain, and Ireland.
==== Initial Success ====
With millions in funding, oral polio vaccines were distributed throughout the world. By 1991 polio was eradicated from the Americas &lt;ref name=&quot;WHO1991&quot;&gt;[http://www.who.int/features/2004/polio/en/index.html World Health Assembly 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1996 the number of polio-free countries totaled 150. Also in 1996, Rotary International worked with Nelson Mandela to start the Kick Polio Out of Africa campaign &lt;ref name=&quot;ROTARY&quot;&gt;[http://www.rotary.org/en/serviceandfellowship/polio/timeline/Pages/ridefault.aspx Rotary]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Western Pacific was declared polio-free in 1997 and a year later Europe followed suit. By 2003 only six countries were polio-endemic: Egypt, Afghanistan, India, Niger, Pakistan, and Nigeria.
In 1988 when the first polio eradication initiative was started by the World Health Assembly, there were 350,000 cases worldwide. In 2003 the number of cases had dropped to 700. Enormous strides were made to eradicate the disease and 2003 represented the closest we had come to total polio eradication. However, at the end of 2003 a polio boycott erupted across Nigeria; they had the highest number of cases anywhere in the world &lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2004&quot;&gt;[http://www.who.int/features/2004/en/nigeria.htm WHO 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;. Many factors led to this backlash including past injuries brought on by the Western world , religious infighting within Nigeria, and sects vying for political power.

== Polio Boycott ==
==== Historical Reasons====
In Nigeria, there are many deep seeded roots for the reasons for the Polio Boycott. In the 1980's, President Babangida adopted a population policy which limited the maximum of four children for each woman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paa2011.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=112469|title=Population Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people connected this population control campaign with immunization. They believed that the vaccination was one way the government was reducing the population or at least checking the number of children a woman can bear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polio in Nigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jegede|first=Ayodele|date=March 2007|title=What Led to the Nigerian Boycott of the Polio Vaccination Campaign|journal=Plos Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=417–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, there was a general distrust of aggressive, mass immunization programs especially in a country where access to basic health care is not easily available. John Murphy of the Baltimore Sun wrote “The aggressive door-to-door mass immunizations that have slashed polio infections around the world also raise suspicions. From a Nigerian's perspective, to be offered free medicine is about as unusual as a stranger's going door to door in America and handing over $100 bills. It does not make any sense in a country where people struggle to obtain the most basic medicines and treatment at local clinics.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuftscopejournal.org/issues/S10/articles/show/polio_in_nigeria|title=Polio Inoculation Gaps in Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trovan Trial ====
One experience in particular left northern Nigerians suspicious and mistrustful of western healthcare and “free medicine”.  During the summer of 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, there was a devastating meningococcal meningitis epidemic.  The American drug giant Pfizer Inc. had just developed a new antibiotic, trovafloxacin (Trovan), they hoped could treat bacterial meningitis.  Animal studies with Trovan were promising so Pfizer wanted to move forward with human trials.  Pfizer saw the meningitis outbreak in Kano as a perfect opportunity to test the efficacy of Trovan in humans.

At the height of the outbreak, Pfizer conducted an open label drug trial of Trovan against the “gold standard” meningitis medicine ceftriaxone.  Two hundred children were enrolled in the trial; half were given Trovan and the other half given ceftriaxone.  Out of the two hundred, five children died given Trovan and six died given ceftriaxone&lt;ref name=&quot;Polio in Nigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jegede|first=Ayodele|date=March 2007|title=What Led to the Nigerian Boycott of the Polio Vaccination Campaign|journal=Plos Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=417–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In total, 15,000 Nigerians lost their lives during the meningitis outbreak&lt;ref name=&quot;Pfizer Accused&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Jacqui|date=27 January 2001|title=Pfizer Accused of Testing New Drug Without Approval|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=22|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== ''Ethical Concerns'' =====


On the surface the Trovan trial seemed like a success, Trovan was just as effective as the gold standard ceftriaxone.  Controversial ethics on the part of Pfizer, however, drastically tainted the results and caused a severe anti-Western sentiment to spread throughout the region.
According to the British Medical Journal, “at least one child was not taken off the experimental drug [Trovan] and given the standard drug [ceftriaxone] when it was clear that her condition was not improving.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Pfizer Accused&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Jacqui|date=27 January 2001|title=Pfizer Accused of Testing New Drug Without Approval|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=22|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This raises obvious ethical concerns as it is viewed as putting the results of a drug trial ahead of the health and well-being of a human child.  The child should have immediately been given ceftriaxone as her condition deteriorated to try and prevent further damage.

Secondly, Pfizer never warned the Nigerians about the health risks associated with Trovan.  Previous animal trials had shown that drugs like Trovan were linked to joint and cartilage damage&lt;ref name=&quot;Pfizer Accused&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Jacqui|date=27 January 2001|title=Pfizer Accused of Testing New Drug Without Approval|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=22|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  By not providing the parents with all the facts, Pfizer could not legally receive proper consent from the Nigerians.  In subsequent Trovan trials in the United States, patients were properly informed of Trovan’s risks.  So it begs to question why the information was withheld from the Nigerians?

Lastly, according to reports, Pfizer never had the correct ethical approval from the Nigerian government to even run the drug trial in Kano.  Pfizer is accused of falsifying and backdating the letter of ethical approval from the Nigerian government to fit the correct timeline of the trial&lt;ref name=&quot;Polio in Nigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jegede|first=Ayodele|date=March 2007|title=What Led to the Nigerian Boycott of the Polio Vaccination Campaign|journal=Plos Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=417–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The doctor who oversaw the trial has said it was possible that the letter could have been drafted up to a year after the trial was conducted.

===== ''Backlash'' =====
These ethical concerns outraged the northern Nigerian population.  A member of the press wrote, “The government has the duty to tell us whether out children were used as guinea pigs and, if so, who committed such criminality” &lt;ref name=&quot;Pfizer Accused&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Jacqui|date=27 January 2001|title=Pfizer Accused of Testing New Drug Without Approval|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=22|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such obvious feelings of betrayal and indignation resonated throughout the Kano community.  So when the polio vaccine began to be circulated in Nigeria in 2003, people remembered the Trovan trial and were hesitant to again trust a foreign medicine.

==== Political Reasons====
In Nigeria, the states have administrative control over health affairs at the primary level. The Kano state government was able to issue a directive to halt the immunization exercise planned by the federal government. In northern Nigeria in 2003, the political and religious leaders of Kano, Zamfara, and Kaduna states brought the immunization campaign to a halt by calling on parents not to allow their children to be immunized. These leaders argued that the vaccine could be contaminated with anti-fertility agents (estradiol hormone), HIV, and cancerous agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polio in Nigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jegede|first=Ayodele|date=March 2007|title=What Led to the Nigerian Boycott of the Polio Vaccination Campaign|journal=Plos Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=417–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2836.htm|title=Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|Polio vaccines were corrupted and tainted by evildoers from America and their Western allies …We believe that modern-day Hitlers have deliberately adulterated the oral polio vaccines with anti-fertility drugs and…viruses which are known to cause HIV and AIDS|Datti Ahmed |}}

Also, there has been tension between the northern-led military regime and the southern led democracy. The north was colonized by the Islamic Jihadists and the south was colonized by the British. Since the beginning of the new democratic system of government in 1999, power shifted to the south. These changes have resulted in political tensions between the south and north. These tensions might explain why the religious leaders in northern states who boycotted the polio immunization campaign believed that the southern-led federal government was acting in the interests of Western powers. &lt;ref name=&quot;Polio in Nigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jegede|first=Ayodele|date=March 2007|title=What Led to the Nigerian Boycott of the Polio Vaccination Campaign|journal=Plos Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=417–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern states have mistrust of the western world. Sule Ya'u Sule, speaking for the governor of Kano, says &quot;Since September 11, the Muslim world is beginning to be suspicious of any move from the Western world…Our people have become really concerned about polio vaccine.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Polio in Nigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jegede|first=Ayodele|date=March 2007|title=What Led to the Nigerian Boycott of the Polio Vaccination Campaign|journal=Plos Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=417–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/religion-and-politics-threaten-polio-campaign-1.205831?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot|title=Religion and politics threaten polio campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Situation ==
Nigeria still had the highest number of polio cases, over 700, in 2008. However, increased communication and cooperation with both religious and political leaders in the region have led to increased confidence in the vaccines. Moreover, fewer rumors are being circulated and more vaccines are being administered. This certainly has been a driving factor in the decreased case counts. The number of cases dropped to 388 in 2009 and most recent CDC reports indicate only three cases in the first half of 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC 2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5926.pdf CDC MMWR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is evident that the Western &quot;challenge&quot; and &quot;gift&quot; was improperly implemented in the beginning. Little communication with leaders and no public education tools doomed the project from the beginning. Initial success was apparent, however prior history with engaging outsiders left a wariness with the people of Nigeria. The Trovan trial, in addition to political leveraging, caused mistrust in the vaccines and Western gifts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This case exemplifies the importance of education and communication. It is considered unethical to force a solution on a group of people if they are unwilling to accept it; the best implementation therefore is to educate a group about the benefits of the solution before it is given to them. Technology and innovations are only as useful as their application in the society they are used.

==Background==
===Union Carbide and UCIL===
[[w: Union Carbide|Union Carbide Corporation]] is a chemical and [[w: polymers | polymers]] company known for its products such as paints, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, and pharmaceuticals. &lt;ref name=&quot;Union Carbide Corporation&quot;&gt;[http://www.unioncarbide.com/about-us Union Carbide Corporation], About Us.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Union Carbide became one of the first [[w: United States | United States]] corporations to invest in India with the establishment of [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | Union Carbide India Limited]] (UCIL). &lt;ref name=&quot;Bhopal Information Center&quot;&gt;[http://www.bhopal.com/chronology Bhopal Information Center - Chronology], Chronology of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]] factory in [[w: Bhopal |Bhopal]] was built in 1969 to process and distribute the pesticide Sevin ([[w: Union Carbide|Union Carbide]]'s brand name for [[w:carbaryl|carbaryl]]). The pesticide was necessary to help increase agricultural productivity at a time when [[w: India| India]]'s population was growing at an incredible rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;a perspective&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Silva&quot;&gt;D'Silva, Themistocles (2006). &lt;i&gt;The Black Box of Bhopal: A Closer Look at the World's Deadliest Industrial Disaster.&lt;/i&gt; Victoria, B.C.: Trafford.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Preparation of carbaryl as in Bhopal.png|thumb| Process 1 for producing Carbaryl]]

[[File:Alternative synthesis of carbaryl.png|thumb| Process 2: Alternative synthesis of carbaryl]]

There are two primary ways to produce[[w: carbaryl | carbaryl]]:

* Process 1 requires the use of [[w: methyl isocyanate | methyl isocyanate]] (MIC) (3) as an intermediate.

* Process 2 changes the reaction sequence of process 1 and avoids using [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]].

Process 1, the cheaper of the two methods, was adopted by [[w: Union Carbide | Union Carbide]] in the mid-1960's. Initially, [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] was imported to the [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]] plant. By 1979, due to competitive and political pressures, the plant began to manufacture [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] to increase production.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Silva&quot;/&gt;

===Methyl Isocyanate===
[[w: methyl isocyanate | Methyl isocyanate]] or [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]], is a highly reactive liquid. &lt;ref name=&quot;MIC&quot;&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/39191.aspx Methyl Isocyanate]&lt;/ref&gt; It reacts with water to produce non-toxic [[w: urea | ureas]] and large amounts of [[w: carbon dioxide | carbon dioxide]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;MIC&quot;/&gt; Exposure to [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] may affect the [[w: eye | eyes]], [[w: lung | lungs]], and [[w: skin | skin]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;MIC&quot;/&gt; Exposure to high concentrations of [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] gas can result in fatal damage to the [[w: lung | lungs]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;MIC2&quot;&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts182.pdf Methyl Isocyanate Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aziza Sultan's, a survivor, account of the effects of  [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]]:

:&lt;i&gt;“At about 12.30 am I woke to the sound of my baby coughing badly. In the half light I saw that the room was filled with a white cloud. I heard a lot of people shouting. They were shouting ‘run, run’. Then I started coughing with each breath seeming as if I was breathing in fire. My eyes were burning.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Bhopal.net&quot;&gt;[http://bhopal.net/the-1984-gas-leak/ The 1984 Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another survivor, Champa Devi Shukla said:

:&lt;i&gt; “It felt like somebody had filled our bodies up with red chillies, our eyes tears coming out, noses were watering, we had froth in our mouths. The coughing was so bad that people were writhing in pain.” &lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Bhopal.net&quot;/&gt;

===Plant's Location===

[[w: Union Carbide India Limitied|UCIL]]'s pesticide plant was located in the center of [[w: bhopal | Bhopal]] close to a railway station. When they built a [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] unit, they were offered a site outside the town. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt; However, they insisted on using the existing site due to its proximity to the railway station. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt; By 1984, [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]]'s population has grown to 800,000 and there were now residential areas around the plant. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;&gt; Eckerman, I.

Retrieved from ScienceDirect. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Events that led to the disaster==

Although the exact events leading up to the disaster are still disputed, the findings of an Indian government investigation provide the most compelling theory for what happened. A routine maintenance procedure was denoted as the ultimate cause of the accident. Around 8:00 pm on 2 December, 1984, while a worker washed some of the the plant's piping, several drainage nozzles for the water were blocked by debris. The backlog of water forced it back into the plant's main piping system, leaving it free to flow throughout the plant. At about 11:00 pm, the water entered one of the de-pressurized  storage tanks for [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;&gt;Eckerman, Ingrid (2001).

The failed maintenance procedure does not fully explain the magnitude of the disaster and several hidden causes of the leak can be traced to [[w: Union Carbide India Limited|UCIL]] management practices that had been accumulating years before the event.

=== Plant's Management and Working Conditions ===

In the early 1980's, the [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]] plant was running at a loss due to reduced pesticide demands. [[w: Union Carbide Corporation | Union Carbide]] decided to have it shut down and sold. To remain profitable, the plant's management began to make risky decisions that put the facility and its workers in danger. They ignored several important safety and maintenance protocols. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovel&quot;/&gt; 

=====Risky Management=====
* Initially, in order to be an [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] plant operator, one either had to be a graduate in science, [[w: chemical engineering | chemical engineering]], or [[w: mechanical engineering | mechanical engineering]]. This rule was later ignored and the training period was shortened from 6 months to 8 weeks. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;/&gt;

* Company manuals were only available in [[w: English language |English]] even though many Indian employees did not speak the language. Moreover, these manuals were kept with the manager and the workers were not permitted to take them outside the premises. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;/&gt;

* Staffing policies became highly political:

:* Promotions were granted to individuals who demonstrated loyalty to the bosses even if they had little experience. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;/&gt; 

:* Demand for extra safety precautions by the employees led to warnings of termination or salary reductions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;/&gt;

* Due to these policies and deteriorating work conditions, most of the original [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] operators resigned to seek employment elsewhere. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;/&gt; 

* In 1982, a [[w: Union Carbide | Union Carbide]] audit report from India indicated that workers' performance was below American standards. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt;

* In 1983 and 1984, the number of personnel was reduced to cut costs. Plant workers and operators were given more responsibility than they were trained to or had the competence to handle. Moreover, vacant positions in the [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] plant were filled by unskilled workers from shut down parts of the plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman 2005&quot;/&gt;

===== Negligent Safety Practices =====
From its establishment, the [[w: Bhopal|Bhopal]] plant had problems with its design and operating safety that included numerous negligent practices. As management and economic pressures increased, many critical safety systems were bypassed or shut down. Had some of these systems been in place, the severity of the disaster could have been reduced. &lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;

* During cleaning procedures, a thin piece of steel, called a slip blind, should be inserted in between the connecting pipes, but this safety feature was often ignored because it took two hours to install. A former engineers of [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]] plant, Kamal Pareek, said, “...if one of these small pieces of steel had been inserted into the process pipeline, this disaster probably would not have happened.” &lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;

* The main control room that monitored the plant’s activities had faulty equipment due to lack of maintenance. Since the gauges often gave false readings, workers did not take the readings very seriously. &lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;

* The [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] tank alarms had been malfunctioning for four years. &lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;

Backup procedures were originally put into place to control an accidental reaction between [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] and [[w: water | water]]:

* A large [[w: refrigeration | refrigeration]] system, specifically intended to slow an exothermic [[w:methyl isocyanate | MIC]] reaction, was permanently disabled to cut costs. &lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;
* The vent [[w: scrubber | gas scrubber]], used to neutralize toxic gas before escaping into the environment, was switched off that night for maintenance. Even if it had been on, it was too small to neutralize 41 tons of [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;
* The flare tower, designed to burn off toxic gas, had a connecting pipe removed for maintenance 5 months prior to the accident. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bhopal.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.bhopal.org/what-happened/ The Bhopal Medical Appeal], What Happened?.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Disaster Warnings and Past Incidents ===
A series of serious accidents had occurred before the [[w: bhopal | Bhopal]] gas disaster. According to [[w: Russell Mokhiber | Russell Mokhiber]] of [[w: Multinational Monitor | Multinational Monitor]], these accidents &lt;i&gt;&quot;...should have tipped off corporate executives at world headquarters in the United States that something was wrong in India.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Multinational Monitor&quot;&gt;[http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1987/04/bhopal.html Multinational Monitor], Union Carbide and the Devastation of Bhopal.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On December 26, 1981, a [[w: Phosgene | phosgene]] gas leak killed plant operator Mohammed Ashraf. &lt;ref name=&quot;Multinational Monitor&quot; /&gt;

* Another [[w: Phosgene | phosgene]] gas leak in January 1982 seriously injured 28 people. &lt;ref name=&quot;Multinational Monitor&quot; /&gt;

* On April 22, 1982, three electrical operators were severely burned while working on a control system panel. &lt;ref name=&quot;Multinational Monitor&quot; /&gt;

* On October 5, 1982, [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] leaked from a broken valve seriously injuring four workers. People in the surrounding areas also experienced burning eyes and troubled breathing trouble due to the [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] exposure. Two similar incidents were again reported in 1983. &lt;ref name=&quot;Multinational Monitor&quot; /&gt;

* In September 1984, an  internal report on the [[w: Virginia | Virginia]] plant in [[w: USA | USA]] warned that &lt;i&gt;&quot;a runaway reaction could occur in the [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]] unit storage tanks, and that the planned response would not be timely or effective enough to prevent catastrophic failure of the tanks&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. Despite the identical design of the [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]] plant, this reported was never forwarded to them. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt;

Following these accidents, the issue of possible danger to [[w: Bhopal|Bhopal]] from this plant was raised in the State Legislative Assembly. An accident investigation committee concluded that &lt;i&gt;&quot;... there was no danger to Bhopal nor will there ever be!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;a perspective&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and Consequences==
[[File:Bhopal-Union Carbide 2.jpg|thumb|Abandoned Bhopal Plant]]

The aftermath has made the [[w: bhopal | Bhopal]] gas disaster the &quot;[[w: Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki | Hiroshima]] of the chemical industry.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Globe&quot;&gt;[http://www.ripplestrategies.com/images/cohen-op-ed.pdf Boston Globe], Bhopal's Poisonous Legacy, December 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 520,000 people were exposed to [[w: methyl isocyanate | MIC]], with 8,000 dying in the first few weeks and 100,000 permanently injured or disabled. &lt;ref name=&quot;TTL&quot;&gt;[http://www.ttl.fi/en/publications/electronic_journals/asian_pacific_newsletter/archives/Documents/asian_pacific_newsletter2_2006.pdf], The Bhopal Disaster, 1984 - Eckerman.&lt;/ref&gt; It has caused [[w: blindness | blindness]], [[w: cataract | cataracts]], [[w: chemical burn | chemical burns]], breathing problems, severe [[w: abdominal pain | abdominal pain]], increased [[w: infant mortality | infant mortality]], reproductive problems, and [[w: mutation | genetic mutations]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Effects&quot;&gt;[http://redproteger.com.ar/safetyblog/?p=400 Safety Blog], Bhopal-20 Years on.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these effects continue to this day. &lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;
[[File:BHOPAL (231583728).jpg|thumb| People of Bhopal outraged by the disaster]] 

[[w: India | India]]n Supreme Court ordered [[w: Union Carbide | Union Carbide Corporation]] to pay a $470 million settlement to the [[w: India | India]]n government, despite deferring responsibility of the disaster to [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]] and insisting it was an act of sabotage by a disgruntled worker. &lt;ref name=&quot;CSE&quot;&gt; Centre for Science and Environment: [http://www.cseindia.org/webexclusives/factsheet_1.htm Key legal cases on the Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its aftermath]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Common Dreams&quot;/&gt; On June 7, 2010, 8 former plant workers were convicted to 2 years in prison for &quot;death by negligence&quot; in the gas leak. &lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt; [[w: Amnesty International | Amnesty International]] described the convictions as &quot;too little, too late&quot; and the people of [[w: Bhopal| Bhopal]] felt a sense of betrayal and outrage. This was not the justice they had been waiting for since &lt;i&gt;&quot;...the principal accused-[[w: warren anderson (chairman) | Warren Anderson]], [[w: Union Carbide | Union Carbide Corporation]] USA&quot;&lt;/i&gt; was not there. &lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News2&quot;&gt;BBC News: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10260109 Bhopal gas leak convictions not enough, say campaigners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]] plant has been abandoned since the [[w: Bhopal disaster| disaster]]. The [[w: India | India]]n state government of [[w: Madhya Pradesh | Madhya Pradesh]] took over the plant in 1998. &lt;ref name=&quot;25 years later&quot;&gt; PRI's: The World -  [http://www.theworld.org/2009/12/bhopal-disaster-25-years-later/ Bhopal disaster: 25 years later]&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name=&quot;Union Carbide Corporation&quot;/&gt; All the harmful chemicals still remain inside the plant. The surrounding areas have been labeled as &quot;global toxic hot-spots&quot; and declared unfit for any kind of use. &lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist&quot;&gt; New Internationalist Magazine: [http://www.newint.org/sections/agenda/2010/12/02/bhopal-disaster/ Anniversary of Bhopal Gas disaster]&lt;/ref&gt; The groundwater has been found to be contaminated with high concentrations of [[w: mercury (element) | mercury]], that are much higher than the [[w: World Health Organization | World Health Organization]]'s recommended limits, along with large amounts of other poisonous chemicals and metals. &lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist&quot;/&gt; Therefore, people in surrounding areas are still facing health issues 26 years later due to water contamination. &lt;ref name=&quot;25 years later&quot;/&gt; According to Paul Watson with [[w: common dreams NewsCenter | Common Dreams]], &lt;i&gt;&quot;Today the plant is a rusting hulk of ruptured tanks and empty buildings with broken windows...&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Common Dreams&quot;&gt; Common Dreams: [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0830-01.htm Cloud of Despair in Bhopal]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999 [[w: Union Carbide| Union Carbide]] has been a subsidiary of [http://www.dow.com/ The Dow Chemical Company], which claims it is not liable for the abandoned plant waste. &lt;ref name=&quot;CSE&quot;/&gt;

=== Quotes from Survivors ===

* &lt;i&gt;&quot;If they had [sounded the sirens] before or just after the gas leaked out, we would have known what to do,&quot; said one survivor. &quot;We'd at least have had a chance to run. I lost my wife and two sons only because they didn't warn us. These people are criminals, butchers, worse than murderers.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Multinational Monitor&quot;/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

* &lt;i&gt;&quot;I hear sounds in my mind. I only feel like staying in a lonely room. I can't stand going into a crowd.&quot; -Sunil Verma &lt;ref name=&quot;Common Dreams&quot;/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

* &lt;i&gt;&quot;I'm running out of breath. I'm just waiting for God to come and take me away. Instead of living like this, it's better to die.&quot; -Ram Kuwar Bai &lt;ref name=&quot;Common Dreams&quot;/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

==Conclusion==
[[File:Union Carbide 25 ans de souffrances.jpg|thumb| 25 years of suffering]]

December 3, 2009 marked the 25th anniversary of the [[w: bhopal gas tragedy | Bhopal Gas Tragedy]]. Today, over 26 years later, the survivors are still awaiting justice. Many victims continue to fight for compensation in [[w: United States| U.S.]] and [[w: India| India]]n courts, with only 9% of those affected receiving any monetary reparations. &lt;ref name=&quot;NDTV&quot;&gt; NDTV: [http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/bhopal-gas-tragedy-victims-still-await-justice-70213 Bhopal Gas Tragedy: Victims still await justice]&lt;/ref&gt; They complain that the average compensation of $580 cannot even cover the loans many took out to pay medical bills, funeral costs, and other expenses. &lt;ref name=&quot;Common Dreams&quot;/&gt; The victims of the world's worst industrial disaster are still suffering today.

There is dispute over who was responsible for the disaster - [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]] or [[w: Union Carbide Corporation | Union Carbide Corporation]]. It seems that [[w: Union Carbide | Union Carbide]], being the parent company and 51% shareholder in [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]], had the ethical responsibility to keep the [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]]'s plant safe and up to the American standards or shut it down altogether. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt; [[w: Union Carbide | Union Carbide]] deferred the blame to [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]] saying it was not responsible for maintenance of the safety systems of [[w: Union Carbide India Limited | UCIL]]'s [[w: Bhopal | Bhopal]]'s plant. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt; However, it is interesting to note that [[w: Union Carbide Corporation | Union Carbide]] &lt;i&gt;&quot;...chose all production processes, supplied all plant designs and designated procedures. UCC [Union Carbide Corporation] also conducted safety audits.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Eckerman1&quot;/&gt; In either case, many accidents and reports indicated the plant's deteriorating condition and negligent safety practices but no corrective action was taken by either company.

As mentioned in this chapter, multiple events and incidents led to the ultimate catastrophe. It has been said that had each circumstance occured independently, the accident never would have occurred, sparing thousands of innocent lives and those who continuing suffering. &lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dr. Myron A. Mehlman, formerly [[w:Mobil|Mobil's]] Director of Toxicology and Manager of its Environmental Health and Science Laboratory, is a renowned toxicologist with substantial work experience in toxicology for both governmental and commercial employers. He completed his Ph.D. at the [[w:Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[w:University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin]]. He has held faculty positions in biochemistry at [[w:Rutgers University|Rutgers University]] and the [[w:University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]]. Before joining Mobil he served as Chief of Biochemical Toxicology for the Bureau of Foods, United States [[w:Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food and Drug Administration]], and has held other responsible toxicological positions in the [[w:United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services|United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] and in the Office of the Director of the [[w:National_Institutes_of_Health| National Institutes of Health]]. Since 1960, Dr. Mehlman has published over 160 articles in the field of toxicology and biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegiumramazzini.org/fellows1.asp?id=13
|title=Collegium Ramazzini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1989 [[w:Mobil|Mobil Oil Corporation]] appointed Dr. Mehlman to the [[w:United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to represent Mobil in toxicology matters internationally. Dr. Mehlman's represented Mobil's interests before regulatory agencies, trade and scientific associations, and academic institutions. In September 1989, Dr. Mehlman was scheduled to give a talk to corporate managers of Mobil's Japanese subsidiary, concerning the health effects of gasoline inhalation and exposure. During the presentation, a member of the audience informed Dr. Mehlman that the gasoline sold by Mobil’s Japanese subsidiary contained levels of benzene in excess of the regulated limit. Dr. Mehlman warned the managers of the subsidiary that these concentrations of [[w:Benzene|benzene]] were too high to sell and needed to be reduced immediately. When the Japanese managers objected to his demand, Dr. Mehlman responded with an ultimatum:

:''“We in [the] United States and at Mobil[,] consider benzene as a very poisonous chemical-dangerous and toxic.   And [these] concentrations are too high.  [T]hey have to be reduced.”… “You reduce it or do not sell it.”''

The day he returned to the states, Dr. Mehlman informed his superior that the [[w:Benzene|benzene]] levels were too high to sell. Immediately, he was placed on probation and investigated for the misuse of company resources. He could not access his lab and all employees were not allowed to answer his phone calls. Mobil later fired him on the grounds he had misused company personnel and supplies to promote his wife’s scientific publishing business (Princeton Scientific)&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-supreme-court/1193036.html|title=Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Dangers of Benzene==
[[File:Benzene balls.png|left|thumb|3D Representation of Benzene]]
[[w:Benzene|Benzene]] is a natural constituent of crude oil and a common additive in gasoline . It is a known carcinogen, and exposure to benzene poses severe health risks. The [[w:American_Petroleum_Institute|American Petroleum Institute]] states that, &quot;it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://hobsonlaw.com/benzene_pages/pdffile.pdf American Petroleum Institute],  Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;[[w:United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services|The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] classifies benzene specifically as a potent human carcinogen. The major effects of chronic exposure to benzene are seen in the blood and are known to result in different types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/benzene/basics/facts.asp Health Effects of Benzene], Centers for Disease Control&lt;/ref&gt; It was first noted to induce cancer in human in the 1920's. In 1979, the chemical industry recognized the cancer inducing properties of benzene despite historic references to this relation in prior medical literature. The chemical industry tried to discredit earlier animal studies claiming that the results obtained were not relevant to humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal =Int J Occup Environ Health| year =2007|volume =13| issue =2| pages =213–21| title =Benzene-induced cancers: abridged history and occupational health impact| author =Huff J| pmid

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myron Mehlman v. Mobil Corporation==
Since 2002, all states have provided some protection for whistle blowing, in addition to many federal laws and acts. At the time of this case, only two-thirds of the states had any whistle blowing protection. [[w:Whistleblower#Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA)|The Conscientious Employee Protection Act]] (CEPA) is New Jersey's.

In 1997, Dr. Mehlman sued [[w:Mobil|Mobil]], claiming protection under CEPA. Mobil denied this and filed a counterclaim against Princeton Scientific Publishing Co., Int.
There were two main issues in the court case:
1) Did Mobil have reason to fire Dr. Mehlman, namely for misusing Mobil's resources and personnel?
2) If not, does CEPA's protection apply in this case and cover a statement made in a developed foreign nation?

Mobil argued the first issue stating that Dr. Mehlman was fired for misusing company resources for the benefit of his wife's publishing company, thereby creating a conflict of interest. Mobil alleged Dr. Mehlman used Mobil personnel to edit articles, used Mobil's mail service for Princeton Scientific's books and articles, used the company's postage, hired consultants for personal lawsuits, and even used Mobil grants to support publishing patrons. 
Dr. Mehlman argued that in the many instances he dealt with Princeton Scientific at work, he acted on Mobil's behalf. As Mobil is a large corporation that does research, they often published articles in Princeton Scientific, explaining Dr. Mehlman's interaction with the publishing company. Dr. Mehlman testified that on many occasions he would get approval from superiors to take such actions, always acting in the best interest of Mobil. On some allegations, such as whether or not Mobil employees were reviewing articles, Dr. Mehlman had no comment. The jury eventually found that Mobil was already interested in firing Dr. Mehlman before these charges were brought up, dismissing them as fair grounds for dismissal, leading to the biggest argument in the case.

[[w:Whistleblower#Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA)|CEPA's]] purpose is to &quot;“To protect and encourage employees to report illegal or unethical workplace activities and to discourage public and private sector employers from engaging in such conduct.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theemployerhandbook.com/2011/04/reporting-a-customers-wrongdoi.html
|title=Whistleblowing on a customer is NOT protected activity in NJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by protecting employees from repercussion if they sufficiently show they reported an unethical act, then consequentially had adverse actions taken upon them.

The initial jury sided with Dr. Mehlman and awarded him $3.5 million in compensatory damages as well as $3.5 million in punitive damages. However, the initial trial judge disagreed. CEPA's intent is to stop companies from doing something that &quot;goes against the mandate to protect the public health.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt; Since Japan is well developed and can regulate itself, the judge did not want to allow CEPA to protect a statement aimed at a capable foreign entity. In order to not set a bad precedent, he took away the compensatory damages. Both Dr. Mehlman and Mobil wanted an additional $3.5 million, so they both appealed the decision.

In the Appellate Division of New Jersey's Supreme court, Dr. Mehlman argued that CEPA's intention was not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees, but rather encourage people to speak up when they see something wrong. The court agreed stating &quot;Mehlman identified a clear mandate of public policy which he reasonably believed that Mobil had violated when he objected in September 1989 to the distribution in Japan of gasoline with an excessive benzene content by Mobil's subsidiary MSKK.&quot; This reinstated the initial jury's decision, giving Dr. Mehlman a total of $7 million.

==Ethical Considerations==


====Mobil's Stance====
Mobil expects its employees to abide by certain ethical guidelines. These guidelines are intended to ensure honest and trustworthy practices. The company's Code of Ethics says, &quot;Even where the law is permissive, the Corporation chooses the course of highest integrity.&quot; It further states, &quot;the Corporation cares how results are obtained, not just that they are obtained.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Code&quot; /&gt; These two statements emphasize Mobil's commitment to honest work and avoiding shortcuts. Employee integrity is encouraged within the company. &quot;The Corporation's directors and officers support, and expect the Corporation's employees to support any employee who passes up an opportunity or advantage that would sacrifice ethical standards.&quot; This explicitly sates that employees must always uphold ethical standards in their work. This directly contradicts Mobil's reaction to Dr. Mehlman's actions in Japan, where he warned managers of the hazard of escalated levels of benzene in the gasoline. One other notable excerpt emphasizes that, &quot;safety procedures are not to be compromised to achieve other goals.&quot; This last ideal again contradicts Mobil's actions against Dr. Mehlman. Dr. Mehlman's decision was based purely on safety concerns. He wanted to ensure that the Japanese subsidiary's employees would not suffer from high levels of benzene exposure. Mobil's supposed ethical stance did not lead their actions in this case. &lt;ref name=&quot;Code&quot;&gt;[http://www.exxonmobil.com/corporate/files/corporate/investor_governance_ethics.pdf ExxonMobil Code of Ethics], ExxonMobil website&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mehlman's Stance====
Gauging Mehlman's opinions and ethical beliefs were difficult to obtain because unlike other facts surrounding the case, they were not found in a case summary. Mehlman was interviewed by Joy Horowitz, in her novel [http://www.joyhorowitz.com/books.htm/ ''Parts Per Million: The Poisoning of Beverly Hills High School'']. In the interview Mehlman claimed that the current accepted levels of benzene in the U.S. are too high. Working with [[w:Eula Bingham|Eula Bingham]], former director of [[w:Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration|OSHA]], he has been campaigning to lower the standard. Mehlman cites a 1984 study to back his efforts, in which a scientific review panel in California concluded that there were no safe levels to establish thresholds for benzene exposure. He also notes that the last study focusing upon exposure threshold levels was conducted in 1987 and since then no real effort has been taken by the government to research the topic more closely. From this time in the late 1980's, the [[w:American_Public_Health_Association|American Public Health Association]] has urged Congress to provide the necessary funding for an OSHA study that is up to date. Within the scientific community there is no longer a question whether benzene is capable of causing cancer and other illnesses. The main opposition to his efforts arises from defense attorneys of chemical industry firms that aim to stall progress by injecting uncertainty in findings in court cases. He states that debates are manufactured and do not cite the facts that need debating. The ability of defense attorneys to interject question into debates remains to be the main problem of establishing restrictions on [[w:Benzene|benzene]] levels. When asked about the possible reasons why an individual would allow such high levels of benzene, Mehlman replied that the individual must be influenced by external parties or economic factors. As inferred from Mehlman's interview, levels need to be decreased and special interests are currently in the way of creating restrictions on accepted levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=WjLUcoe5j00C&amp;dq=parts+per+million%2Bhorowitz&amp;q=Myron+Mehlman#v=snippet&amp;q=Myron%20Mehlman&amp;f=false Online excerpt from Horowitz's book], from Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
This case study is an illustration true professionalism. Myron Mehlman placed his career in jeopardy by reporting Mobil's  blatant violation of national regulations. Dr. Mehlman's actions place him amongst a large contingent of [[w:List_of_whistleblowers| fellow whistleblowers]]. [[w:Whistleblower|Whistleblower]] protection laws (e.g. CEPA) encourage employees to voice their concerns by eliminating the fear of repercussions. However, these laws may encourage employees to abuse their power due to the settlement fees awarded to the whistleblower by the courts.

William LeMessurier (pronounced Luh-MEASURE&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;Ramirez, A. (2007) William LeMessurier, 81, Structural Engineer, Dies. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a structural consultant for the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr.  In the 1970s, LeMessurier served as the structural engineer for Stubbin’s Citicorp Center in New York City.  At the time of its construction, the Citicorp building was the seventh-largest building in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.  It was also the first building of its size to contain a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_mass_damper tuned mass damper], a device that resists building sway due to wind&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;PBS. (2000). Citicorp Center. Retrieved 5/25, 2011, from http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/citicorp.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==William LeMessurier and the CitiCorp Building==


In June 1978, LeMessurier received a phone call from an engineering student writing a paper on the Citicorp building.  The student’s professor said that the building’s columns were misplaced.  LeMessurier explained that there was a church on the northwest corner of the site that they had to build around.  Thus, the Citicorp’s building had columns in the center of its sides instead of the corner so the corners [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/citicorp2_skyscraper.html cantilevered over the church].  LeMessurier also explained that the columns were in the best location to resist quarterly loads, or 45 degree wind or winds coming from the diagonal&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The phone call prompted LeMessurier, who also taught a structural engineering class at Harvard, to teach his students about wind loads.  While the New York Building Code requires designs only account for perpendicular winds, LeMessurier, out of his own curiosity, decided to calculate the forty-five degree wind load on his building.  He was surprised to discover that this wind increased the strain in some areas by 40%.  This worried LeMessurier because several weeks prior, he found out that the construction company used bolts instead of welded joints.  Bolts are cheaper but they are not as strong as welds.  To make matters worse, when deciding on the bolts’ spacing, only perpendicular winds were taken into account, not the stronger quarterly wind loads&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Concerned, LeMessurier flew to Ontario to test his predictions in a wind tunnel.  He discovered not only that his theoretical prediction was correct, but that actual wind loads could be much stronger.  The building would collapse in a 16 year storm.  That means the building had a one in sixteen chance of collapsing within a year.  The damper would decrease the chance to one in fifty five, but it runs on electricity that could easily go out in a big storm.  LeMessurier decided, along with Stubbins, to go to New York and explain the problem to Citicorp’s executives.  Within hours, Citicorp acquired generators and full-time tech support for the mass damper.  Two independent weather forecasters provided wind predictions and the American Red Cross began to formulate an emergency evacuation plan&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Citicorp issued a press release stating that engineers assured them there was no danger, but the engineers recommended that certain connections in the system be strengthened through additional welding.  Citicorp was following their recommendations saying, “We wear both belts and suspenders here.  That day, the New York Times left a message with LeMessurier.  He decided to return the call but the Times and other major papers in the area had gone on strike leaving the public unaware of the building’s structural instabilities&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Welders began work in August to reinforce the joints.  They worked at night in order to protect the building’s occupants from acrid smoke.  The welders were not finished early morning on Sept 1, when Hurricane Ella was sighted off Cape Hatteras and heading towards New York City.  Fortunately, Citicorp did not have to initiate its evacuation plan because the Hurricane took a turn away from the city.  All of the joints were reinforced by October, several weeks before the city’s newspapers resumed publication&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Even without the damper, the building was now able to withstand winds from up to a 700 year storm&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;Ramirez, A. (2007) William LeMessurier, 81, Structural Engineer, Dies. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==LeMessurier's Views of Engineering Ethics==

William LeMessurier passed away in 2007.  From the time of the CitiCorp building retrofit in 1978 to his death, LeMessurier used his experience with the CitiCorp building to educate others on engineering ethics.  LeMessurier told his story in his building engineering courses at Harvard University as an example of the benefits of blowing the whistle on oneself.  He stresses the importance of admitting mistakes and correcting them&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;Ramirez, A. (2007) William LeMessurier, 81, Structural Engineer, Dies. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;.

You have a social obligation. In return for getting a license and being regarded with respect, you’re supposed to be self-sacrificing and look beyond the interests of yourself and your client to society as a whole. And the most wonderful part of my story is that when I did it, nothing bad happened. |
[[w:William LeMessurier|William LeMessurier]]|}}


LeMessurier also emphasizes the respect and responsibility that comes with obtaining a professional engineering license in a [http://www.onlineethics.org/Popups/Video.aspx?ID=21492 lecture] at Harvard&lt;ref name=&quot;Video&quot;&gt;National Academy of Engineering(2006) William LeMessurier-The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis: A Lesson in Professional Behavior. Online Ethics Center for Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Because a professional engineer is respected by society, society deserves the engineer’s respect as well.  LeMessurier says this should drive all ethical decisions by an engineer.  Engineers must be willing to look beyond themselves and strive to achieve the best situation not just for clients, but for society as a whole.

I had information that nobody else in the world had.  I had power in my hands to effect extraordinary events that only I could initiate. I mean, sixteen years to failure--that was very simple, very clear-cut. I almost said, thank you, dear Lord, for making this problem so sharply defined that there's no choice to make.|
[[w:William LeMessurier|William LeMessurier]]|}}







While LeMessurier recognizes that whistle blowing was important in this case, he notes that he still struggled to make the decision. He felt that he had three options to choose from: silence, suicide, or fixing the problem.  LeMessurier felt that keeping silent was too risky, and he wasn’t willing to take the chance of losing lives.  Suicide was a cowardly move, and so he felt that the choice was made for him.  He must do the right thing and correct his mistake&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.




{{rquote|right|
It wasn't a case of 'We caught you, you skunk.' It started with a guy who stood up and said, 'I got a problem, I made the problem, let's fix the problem.' If you're gonna kill a guy like LeMessurier, why should anybody ever talk? |
[[w:Arthur Nusbaum|Arthur Nusbaum]]|}} 
  





LeMessurier also benefitted from the support of company officials.  Rather than being immediately blamed for the building’s problems, they respected his courage.  Instead of faulting him, they worked with him to fix the problem.  







LeMessurier feared that because of this case, his reputation would be marred.  He thought he would be perceived as an engineer who messed up a job and would no longer be trusted.  He also worried about the future of his business, [http://www.lemessurier.com/ LeMessurier Consultants], and the high cost of a settlement.  Quite the opposite actually occurred.  The settlement, totaling over $4 million, was paid by the CitiCorp company and LeMessurier’s insurance company.  As a result of the situation, his insurance premium was lowered.  In general, LeMessurier was regarded as being more trustworthy.  He gained respect from clients and other engineers for his actions, and he was seen as a forthright and competent engineer&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;Morgenstern, Joseph. City Perils, “THE FIFTY-NINE-STORY CRISIS,” The New Yorker, May 29, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;.  LeMessurier Consultants' business was not affected by LeMessurier’s involvement with the CitiCorp building retrofit, as it is still excelling today.  The company’s website boasts long lists of clients and awards.

==The Right to Information==

As previously mentioned, there was a press conference regarding the repairs to the Citicorp Building.  The statement that was issued assured the public that there was no danger.  However, considering the high probability that the building would collapse, it would seem that the press release understated the severity of the problem.  The full details of the building’s instability were not released to the public until an article in the New Yorker in 1995 (over 15 years after the repairs were completed).  

===Public Deceit===

{{rquote|right|
We had to cook up a line of bull, I’ll tell you. And white lies at this point are entirely moral. You don’t want to spread terror in the community to people who don’t need to be terrorized. We were terrorized, no question about that. |
[[w:William LeMessurier|William LeMessurier]]|}}

According to LeMessurier, white lies were completely necessary.  He argued that if the public found out about the problems with the building, terror would arise.  LeMessurier believed that the building was safe for occupancy in all but the most severe weather conditions.  He thought that as long as strict safety measures and evacuation plans were implemented there was no reason to raise an alarm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross Currents&quot;&gt;Kremer, Eugene. “(RE)EXAMINING THE CITICORP CASE: Ethical Paragon or Chimera” Cross Currents, 2002, Vol. 52, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 


It could be argued that in this particular case, deceiving the public worked well.  If panic had arisen as LeMessurier predicted, it is likely that the Citicorp building would need to be closed until the repairs were completed.  Keeping the building open meant that Citicorp’s employees could continue working and helped the company avoid losing money from lost productivity.  


The success LeMessurier’s public deceit strategy can be attributed to the fact that everything went according to plans.  The hurricane never came, evacuation plans did not need to be implemented, and the building did not collapse.  If luck had not been on LeMessurier’s side, it is possible that this case would be viewed very differently.

===The Code of Ethics for Engineers===

The Code of Ethics for Engineers is a document produced by the National Society of Professional Engineers that sets standards of conduct for practicing engineers.  Regarding the disclosure of information to the public, the code states, “engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner” and instructs engineers to “avoid all conduct or practice that deceives the public.” &lt;ref&gt; National Society of Professional Engineers (2011). NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers, http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;  This is a direct disagreement with LeMessurier’s actions involving the Citicorp building.  If this doctrine is to be taken as the absolute authority on engineering ethics, should LeMessurier’s actions have been condemned?  Or was public deceit acceptable considering the safety measures that were put in place?

==Moral==

Our story began when a student called LeMessurier to question the placement of the columns under the Citicorp building.  This took courage considering LeMessurier was far more experienced than the student.  Although the column placement was adequate, if the student had not questioned LeMessurier, it is possible that LeMessurier would not have discovered the problems with the bracing system in time to avoid disaster.

Once the problem became apparent, LeMessurier was faced with a difficult decision.  Should he blow the whistle on himself?  He knew that drawing attention to the issue could be disastrous to his career and reputation.  He also knew that avoiding the problem would put numerous innocent lives at stake.  It is estimated that 200,000 people could have died if the structure collapsed&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;Ramirez, A. (2007) William LeMessurier, 81, Structural Engineer, Dies. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Finally, attention should be brought to the individuals and groups who worked with LeMessurier to ensure the swift repair of the building.  When LeMessurier informed the Citicorp executives of the building’s instability, they reacted positively.  They did not fault LeMessurier or criticize him for making a mistake.  Instead, they offered their support in fixing the problem.  Without this cooperation, LeMessurier would have had a very difficult time implementing the necessary repairs to the Citicorp building.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Background===
In the mid-1970’s, Kansas City, Missouri was still best known by outsiders for the cattle trade. As part of an urban redevelopment plan to change the city image to a busy, modern, commercial center, a large, luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel was added to the plans. The hotel was to be a beacon on the skyline as the tallest building in the city. The Hyatt name had gained a reputation of grandeur and extravagance since the 1960’s, so it was the perfect choice to change the image of the city. The signature of the hotel chain was sweeping and open interior spaces. Following that tradition, a glass-enclosed atrium was designed to be the center piece of the Kansas City Regency Hyatt. The expansive interior space was highlighted with three seemingly floating walkways that connected the two sides of the hotel. The fourth floor walkway was directly above the second floor with the third floor independently to the side. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Skywalk Collapse&quot;, Seconds from Disaster, January 10th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground breaking of the hotel occurred in 1978 and Jack D. Gillum and Associates was contracted to take care of the structural engineering of the building. The firm was known for its innovative building design, but this architecturally dramatic building was going to be its biggest challenge yet. The contract that Jack D. Gillum and Associates signed was a fast track design and construct contract, meaning that construction began while the design plans were still being finished. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Skywalk Collapse&quot;, Seconds from Disaster, January 10th, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster struck early in the construction process in October 1979 when a tennis court sized section of the glass atrium roof collapsed. No one was injured in the accident. An in-house and peer review of the incident followed. The same problem was found by both parties: an incompatibility in the steel and concrete interface. The glass roof was repaired and the incident was written off as a one time problem. A further setback occurred in late 1979 when the general contractor went bankrupt. Construction was resumed with new management when Crown Center quickly took over the project. Finally, the new and spectacular Hyatt Regency Hotel opened its doors in July 1980. &lt;ref&gt; www.cmbg.org/papers/2004Presentations/Hyatt%20Collapse.ppt &lt;/ref&gt;

===Skywalks Collapse===
[[Image: Hyatt_Kansas_City_Collapse.gif‎ |481px‎|thumb|right|View of the Hyatt Lobby After Collapse]]
About a year after the opening on Friday, July 17, 1981, the hotel was holding a tea dance in the atrium. At 7:00 pm, a swing dance competition was being held. While the big band played, 2,000 spectators looked on, filling the atrium and walkways to get a better view. The event was much anticipated and people happily sang, drank, and danced. At 7:05 pm, a loud metallic crack stopped the band and dancers in their tracks. Without warning, the fourth floor skyway collapsed on to the second floor skyway immediately below and, with a crash, the entire 32 tons of concrete collided with the atrium floor. &lt;ref&gt;Gertstein, M. (2008). Flirting With Disaster. New York: Sterling  Publishing Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone within the vicinity of the walkways was killed or trapped by the falling concrete.

The disaster did not end there. The collapsing concrete of the walkways had punctured the water tanks for the whole hotel. Water was then pumping into the atrium. If there were survivors in the rumble of the walkways, they now faced the risk of drowning. With the quick thinking of the rescue crew, drastic measures were taken and a bulldozer was used to break the door from the outside. Heavy machinery and jack hammers were needed for the rescue effort to gain access to the tons of concrete. The last living victim was excavated from the rumble a full ten hours after the collapse occurred. In total, 114 people were killed and 216 others were injured, making the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse the most deadly structural failure to that point. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Skywalk Collapse&quot;, Seconds from Disaster, January 10th, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Cause of the Collapse===
Investigations after the Hyatt disaster revealed the primary cause of the walkway collapse: a significant design change in the steel beams attaching the walkways to the ceiling. Jack D. Gillum and Associates initially designed the walkways with a single steel rod attaching the second floor walkway to the fourth floor walkway and then to the ceiling. The drawing below shows the initial design on the left. 
[[Image: HRWalkway.svg‎ |500px‎|thumb|center|Hyatt Walkway Connection]]
However, Gillum’s design was modified significantly during construction. Havens Steel, the steel fabricator for the project, decided to change the design to use a double hanger rod box beam, shown in the right side of the image. This design would be easier to build, as it would not require threading the entire rod. Although easier to construct, the new design doubled the load on the rod running from the fourth floor walkway to the ceiling. While Havens Steel reportedly “checked” this design with Gillum and Associates in a phone call and made the modification on their shop drawings, the design was never submitted for approval or tested. Havens Steel built the new rods according to the shop drawings and the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) guidelines, assuming the design was structurally sound&lt;ref&gt;http://ethics.tamu.edu/ethics/hyatt/hyatt1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Jack Gillum later commented that “the connection that failed was never designed”, because no engineering analysis was performed to ensure the strength of the connection&lt;ref&gt;www.cmbg.org/papers/2004Presentations/Hyatt%20Collapse.ppt &lt;/ref&gt;.

The new double rod design proved itself insufficient when the walkways collapsed. The load of the concrete used in the walkways and weight of the people standing on them was too great for the rod connections. The box beams effectively collapsed, so that the walkways slipped off the rods. The image to the right illustrates the colossal failure of the rod connections. [[Image: Hyatt_Regency_collapse_support.PNG |477x‎|thumb|right|Hyatt Regency Collapse Support]]The fourth floor walkway connections failed first, resulting in the large popping noise heard by the crowds at the dance. The second floor walkways followed almost instantaneously&lt;ref&gt;http://ethics.tamu.edu/ethics/hyatt/hyatt1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The box beams had most likely been weakening and distorting during the year that the hotel had been open, but the added stress of the tea dance spectators caused the connections’ total failure.

It is important to note that even the initial connection designed by Gillum and Associates was under-engineered. The single rod design would only hold sixty-percent of the load required by AISC and Kansas City building codes &lt;ref&gt;http://matdl.org/failurecases/Building%20Cases/Hyatt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, when the design was modified and the load on the connections doubled, the connections could only hold thirty percent of the required load. Thus, the new rod connection was severely flawed.

Although the failure of the steel rods supporting the walkways was responsible for their collapse, it was not the only design problem with the Hyatt. The atrium roof collapsed during construction due to deficiencies in the concrete and steel interface. Gillum also later noted that changes were made to the screen wall design during construction&lt;ref&gt;www.cmbg.org/papers/2004Presentations/Hyatt%20Collapse.ppt &lt;/ref&gt;.  The horizontal supporting splices were removed for architectural reasons, a change also only made in the shop drawings.

===Swiss Cheese Model===
Marc Gerstein, in his book “Flirting with Disaster,” uses the Swiss Cheese model to help explain the Hyatt walkway failures. The layers of protection against failures have holes, and when all the holes line up disaster occurs. Gerstein claims that while poor structural engineering was the primary cause of the walkway failure, “it was the job of the engineering company to create a process  that trapped slips, engineering errors, and oversights”&lt;ref&gt;Gertstein, M. (2008). Flirting With Disaster. New York: Sterling  Publishing Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations into the causes of the collapse revealed several of the holes in the engineering company's design process that allowed such a poorly constructed series of skywalks to be built.

===Investigations===
After the tragedy, a public investigation was launched by the Natural Bureau of Standards to determine the cause of the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build82/PDF/b82002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the Kansas City Star hired a structural engineer, Wayne Lischka, to investigate privately as an undercover reporter.  Lischka took photos of the wreckage and from an examination of these photos, determined that the welded box beams holding the rods were what had failed.  Lischka went to City Hall and requested the blue prints for the building, only to find that the plans submitted to City Hall did not match what was actually built.  The Kansas City Star published these findings asserting that it was the welded box beams that led to the failure of the walkways.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Skywalk Collapse&quot;, Seconds from Disaster, January 10th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The NBS investigation eventually came to the same conclusion.  They recreated the welded box beams in their laboratory and applied a force that was estimated to be equal to the force of the walkways and the people that were standing on them during the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build82/PDF/b82002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that the beams were not able to withstand a sufficient amount of force.  The NBS report noted:

The hanger rod detail actually used in the construction of the second and fourth floor walkways is a departure from the detail shown on the contract drawings. In the original arrangement each hanger rod was to be continuous from the second floor walkway to the hanger rod bracket attached to the atrium roof framing. The design load to be transferred to each hanger rod at the second floor walkway would have been 20.3 kips (90 kN). An essentially identical load would have been transferred to each hanger rod at the fourth floor walkway. Thus the design load acting on the upper portion of a continuous hanger rod would have been twice that acting on the lower portion, but the required design load for the box beam hanger rod connections would have been the same for both walkways (20.3 kips (90 kN)).&lt;ref&gt;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build82/PDF/b82002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
After the investigations, the Missouri Board of Architects, Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors filed a complaint against Daniel Duncan, Jack Gillum and G.C.E. International Inc, charging gross negligence, incompetence, misconduct and unprofessional conduct in connection with the walkway collapse.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethics.tamu.edu/ethics/hyatt/hyatt1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  During the trial that took place, evidence was presented that showed that G.C.E did not adequately test the design of the walkways or fully investigate after the atrium collapse.  G.C.E was found responsible for the change from 1 rod to 2 rods and it was found that even if Havens did not specifically note the change in the beam design, G.C.E was still responsible for the final design check.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethics.tamu.edu/ethics/hyatt/hyatt1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Gillum, Duncan and G.C.E. were found guilty of gross negligence, misconduct and unprofessional conduct in November, 1984.  Duncan and Gillum lost their licenses to practice engineering in the states of Missouri and Texas.  G.C.E. had its certificate of authority as an engineering firm revoked.&lt;ref&gt;http://antoine.frostburg.edu/phys/invention/case_studies/disasters/kansas_city_walkway.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Society of Civil Engineering issued a report in response to the tragedy.  This report stated that the Engineer of Record has responsibility and authority for all aspects of the structural design.  The City of Missouri also overhauled their building codes, requiring that all load calculations be done by a city-appointed engineer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On December 7, 1982, an 1800 ft television tower collapsed during construction.  According to Bill Cordell, a chief engineer for KIKK radio station, the workers had hoisted one of the antennae atop the tower, and as they were raising the second antenna, a lifting pole failed and the antenna fell.&lt;ref&gt;''5 Workers Hurled to Deaths as a Texas Tower Collapses''. New York Times, December 8, 1982. ProQuest Historical Newspapers.&lt;/ref&gt;  The falling antenna severed one of the tower's supporting [[w:Guy-wire|guy wires]] and took out the entire tower in seventeen seconds.  Five workers were killed, three on the hoist and two on the tower. &lt;ref&gt;http://ethics.tamu.edu/ethics/tvtower/tv3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Cordell said these victims were employed by Worldwide Tower Service, Inc.  A New York Times article identified these victims as: Gene Crosby, 24, David Stewart, 21, Donald K. Owens, 21, Johnnie Wilson, 26, and Johnnie Bratten, 26.  Additionally, three other workers atop a nearby building that was crushed by the falling tower were left injured.&lt;ref&gt;''5 Workers Hurled to Deaths as a Texas Tower Collapses''. New York Times, December 8, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineer Andy Hudack videotaped this disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''5 Workers Hurled to Deaths as a Texas Tower Collapses''. New York Times, December 8, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the footage is included in this video: http://www.history.com/videos/engineering-disasters-antenna-tower-collapse#engineering-disasters-antenna-tower-collapse.

This case is eerily similar to the previous Hyatt Regency Skywalks disaster which is discussed on our colleagues' [[Professionalism/Jack Gillum and the Hyatt Regency Skywalks|Hyatt Regency Skywalks]] page.  Fast track design practices and divided responsibilities lead to the basic load calculation errors at the root of both disasters.

== Why the accident occurred ==
Design plans for lifting and installing worked for every section, until the final section.  This last section had microwave baskets attached to the sides of the antenna.  The lifting lugs, which provided attachment points for lifting cables, were located in such a way that the section could be lifted horizontally out of the loading truck.  However, when the section was rotated vertically for hoisting, the lifting lugs were placed so that the lifting cables would interfere with the microwave baskets.  The construction company needed to remove the microwave baskets so they could properly attach the lifting cables, but the design company would not permit them to do so.  As a result, the construction company designed a temporary extension arm.  As they were not professional engineers, they asked the design company to look over and approve of their plans.  The design company refused to help because they did not want to be held liable.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Ethics: TV Antenna Tower Collapse''. Department of Philosophy and Department of Mechanical Engineering. Texas A&amp;M University. June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical Issues==
The issues begin with an inadequate design of the hoisting lugs by World Wide Towers.  The design did not account for interference of the microwave baskets for the vertical lifting of the final section.  Harris Corporation did not realize that this was a problem until the section was about to be assembled.  Should World Wide Towers have designed the hoisting lug more carefully?  Should Harris have reviewed the plans more carefully before beginning work on the tower?&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Ethics: TV Antenna Tower Collapse''. Department of Philosophy and Department of Mechanical Engineering. Texas A&amp;M University. June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Wide Towers had had problems on previous projects when debris interfering with the wave guides after the microwave baskets were temporarily removed.  Therefore, when Harris requested temporary removal for assembly, World Wide Towers refused.  Should World Wide Towers have risked financial expense and allowed Harris to remove the baskets?&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Ethics: TV Antenna Tower Collapse''. Department of Philosophy and Department of Mechanical Engineering. Texas A&amp;M University. June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris decided to design an extension to the hoisting lug using an extension arm and U-bolts on site.  Since Harris did not have a professional engineer on staff, they asked World Wide Towers to review the plans.  World Wide Towers refused and Harris used the design anyway.  Should World Wide Towers have reviewed the design, even with the liability risk?  Should Harris have endangered the lives of their employees by using a design that was not approved by a PE?&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Ethics: TV Antenna Tower Collapse''. Department of Philosophy and Department of Mechanical Engineering. Texas A&amp;M University. June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, an extra moment on the extension arm across the U-bolts, not accounted for in design, coupled with faulty U-bolts that only carried about half the load for which they were rated, caused the accident.  Full liability was assumed by the bolt manufacturer, Stainless Inc., who had had previous problems with inadequate bolts and therefore wanted to stay out of court.  Was Stainless Inc. really fully responsible for the accident?  Should some of the liability been placed on World Wide Towers and Harris for negligence?&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Ethics: TV Antenna Tower Collapse''. Department of Philosophy and Department of Mechanical Engineering. Texas A&amp;M University. June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction is driven by budgets and schedules, and sometimes the fact that people's lives may be at stake does not factor into decision making.  This is a case where financial and liability concerns of the companies overshadowed ethical concerns leading to reckless decisions.  Even though full liability was assumed by the bolt manufacturer, the entire chain of events during the assembly of the last section was responsible for the accident.  If one of the companies had assumed ethics and human lives as the number one priority over financial gain, the deadly chain of events may have been stopped and the disaster avoided.

==Similar Cases==
Oddly enough, there are many similar cases to the Missouri City collapse. One that is strikingly similar is the case involving [[Professionalism/Jack Gillum and the Hyatt Regency Skywalks|Hyatt Regency Skywalks]]. Both of these occurred in the southern mid-west area of the United States and were a product of underestimating loads.   

While both involved failed load estimates, the Hyatt incident also had a faulty design to begin with, whereas the Missouri City collapse was the result of a makeshift plan to raise the antenna.  Another facet of construction that impacted both of these project was their fast-tracked schedules.  While keeping a construction project on schedule is important, it does not override the value of human life. The final designs for both the Hyatt and the TV antenna were not inspected by a qualified engineer.  Maybe if a certified engineer had looked at Harris's makshift plans, the collapse would not have occurred.

It's amazing that this failure even happened, given that the tower collapsed about a year and a half after the Hyatt incident. The Hyatt collapse had received a lot of press in the United States and should have caught the eye of the people working on this tower.

===Winkley Bridge===

==History==
In 1912, the county of Cleburne in Arkansas recognized the need for a bridge at Turney’s Ferry to connect the eastern section of the county to the county seat of Heber Springs. The county also recognized the need for two other bridges at different locations, Miller and Tumbling Shoals. Previously, only ferries served the community’s needs. A request was sent out for proposals on steel bridge designs with the specifications according to the commissioners of the county. No bids were received for this design. The commission then decided that a suspension wire bridge would suit their needs just as well as a steel bridge. The commission stated “It will be impracticable . . . to undertake the erection of steel bridges, because of their immense cost at the places selected, and we are convinced that suspension wire Bridges will, when properly built, serve the purposes of our people in a satisfactory way.”  Once proposals were sent out for a suspension wire bridge, the commission did receive a few bids. The winning bid was to contractor Harry Churchill. His bid for the three bridges was $26,000.The commissioners, &quot;not feeling justified in accepting said bid,&quot; negotiated with Churchill and closed the deal at $24,000. The cost of the bridge at Turney’s Ferry was proposed to be $9,670. Churchill started construction of the bridge in late May of 1912 and finished it on November 1, 1912. The bridge design was a streamlined suspension bridge. The two towers and deck of the bridge were both made of wood. The bridge was 550 feet long with the middle span being 450 feet. The deck was 10 feet wide.  In 1949 the wooden towers were replaced with steel towers. In 1968, a delegation of Cleburne County citizens asked the State Highway Department to replace the Winkley Bridge. The delegation wanted to make the bridge a tourist attraction. The proposal was eventually approved, and the bridge was programmed for replacement. In 1972, a new bridge was constructed a few hundred feet downstream from Winkley Bridge. Since the new bridge served the community’s needs, Winkley Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic, thus making it open only for pedestrians.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In 1985, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Throughout the lifespan of the bridge, a noticeable sway could be seen and felt on the bridge. This is how the bridge earned the nickname “The Swinging Bridge”. It was a popular pastime for people to go on the bridge and feel the sway and possibly even try to make it swing a little more. The bridge remained a popular tourist attraction until October 28, 1989. A church group of about forty people decided to swing the bridge from side to side. The bridge collapsed, killing 5 people and injuring dozens. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

==Collapse==
====Bridge Details====
The bridge deck was supported by two cable systems running the length of the deck on either side of the bridge.  Each cable system was 5&quot; in diameter, made up of 1/8&quot; diameter cables bundled together.  Both systems contained metal hangers spaced approximately every five feet that were attached to the bridge deck via metal plates on the underside of beams&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  

====Inspection====
In 1982 Cleburne County commissioned a team of engineers to inspect Winkley Bridge's structural condition.  While the team found rust to be present on the outer cables of the bundle, the inner cables were deemed rust free, and thus the investigative team concluded that the bridge was safe for pedestrian use for another 50 to 100 years. The lead engineer, however, did recommend that a corrosive resistant coating be applied to all of the bridge's cables and also suggested that an ultra-sound be conducted as to have a more complete analysis of the bridge cables.  Despite those recommendations, Cleburne County never orders such tasks to be completed.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

====Cause====
The bridge collapsed due to lateral outward swinging&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.  In short, the pedestrians on the bridge were swinging it from side to side. In doing so, this exerted greater stress and strain on the cable systems running along the length of the deck. As the bridge deck swung further out from side to side, the cables began to weaken until one of the systems snapped.  Upon snapping, the deck's weight cause it to begin to flip, causing the remaining cable system to snap as it was loaded beyond capacity.  After the second cable system failed, the deck turned completely over as it fell into the Little Red River below. In the aftermath of the collapse the investigating engineer from Little Rock, Arkansas, Frank Allison, cited rust as a contributing factor to the cable failure&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.  He stated that in some areas along the cable system, the individual cables on the exterior of the bundle had completely rusted through.  Once cables have rusted to the point of separation, they are essentially useless.  This lowers the cable system's calculated load capacity and no longer provides adequate support for the bridge deck.  

==Unanticipated Results==
As was demonstrated in the case of the Winkley Bridge, a structure's intended use may not always be its actual use.  The suspension bridge over the Little Red River was originally designed to allow vehicular access to Heber Springs from the east side of the county. Once closed to vehicles in 1972, the bridge was deemed acceptable for pedestrian use for the purpose of crossing the river.  An engineer could not have anticipated groups of people intentionally causing the suspension bridge to swing from side to side.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Bridge_%28London%29 Millennium Bridge] in London, England was a unique style suspension bridge that opening in 2000.  The bridge's cables run underneath the bridge as opposed to along the top attaching to towers as many traditional bridges do.  The bridge was closed two days after it opened, and was not reopened in 2002, after pedestrians complained about the unexpected swaying they felt when progressed over the River Thames.  This bridge sway was attributed to oscillations caused by pedestrian foot traffic.  Walking across the bridge initiated the swaying motion and as pedestrians continued to cross, the swaying's amplitude grew.  The solution was resolved by adding dampers to the bridge that absorbed pedestrians' foot vibrations, and thus reducing the amount of sway.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_%281940%29 Tacoma Narrows Bridge] disaster resulted in an effort to reduce the cost of building a new bridge.  The original proposal employed a truss system to support the deck that would allow wind to pass through them.  The final design, however, used girders in place of the trusses.  Girders are long beams with no openings that enabled the wind forces to push the bridge inducing the abnormal deck movement, and ultimately causing its collapse on November 7, 1940.

==Carlton v. Cleburne County==

A class action lawsuit, which was comprised of complaints from victims of the bridge collapse and families of the deceased was filed under the name of Jason Carlton against Cleburne County, Arkansas and the Quorum Court members—the same group that first initiated the engineering tests to determine if the bridge was safe and then the same group that did not pursue further investigation of the bridge cables per the engineer’s request. The plaintiffs argued that the victims of the bridge collapse were denied their due process rights—rights guaranteed to a person by all levels of government.  In this case, they claimed they were denied of their safety. This lawsuit also encompassed a complaint against the nearby Swinging Bridge Resort and its individual owners, which had a bridge easement on its property, claiming negligence in failing to warn the victims of an “ultra-hazardous danger.”  The Honorable [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Howard,_Jr. George Howard, Jr.], the Arkansas District Judge, ruled in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed and the case was brought to the Arkansas Circuit courts, in front of Judges Wollman, Ross and Murphy. On August 21, 1996, nearly 7 years after the Winkley Bridge collapse, the circuit court judges ruled in favor of the defendants again. The Circuit Court concluded that The Swinging Bridge Resort and its owners were immune from a lawsuit under Arkansas’ Recreational Use Statue, stating that the risk could have been avoidable by exercise of reasonable care.  Thus, the court ruled that the collapse was the responsibility of those on the bridge rather than the negligence of the owners.  The Court decided in favor of Cleburne County on the grounds that Cleburne County does not need to warn citizens about possible dangers.  Specifically, the Court stated that Cleburne County protected by the language of Arkansas’ Due Process Clause, which states “[the] clause is phrased as a limitation on the State’s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 

==Ethics==

This court case brings up several ethical issues. Cleburne County had information that citizens regularly swung the bridge for recreation, much like the aforementioned Millennium Bridge. Additionally, the County knew that there could be potentially catastrophic results from swinging the bridge. Yet, no preventative measures were taken to ensure that pedestrians did not swing the bridge. The County did not place any signs prohibiting swinging the bridge or warning against the possible dangers of swinging the bridge. Additionally, the Arkansas Quorum Courts did not heed the engineer’s recommendation of further investigation or to apply a corrosive resistant coating to the cables. Yet, from our research there was no resistance to the Quorum Court’s decision and no attempt to really push for an ultrasound of the bridge cables. We see in this case that once the bridge was deemed as “safe,” no further investigation was taken by nearly 70 years of minimal problems from the bridge. This level of confidence caused by so many years of bridge service could have been the reason that the Quorum Court members opted to not spend the money for further investigation of the bridge considering that it was only carrying pedestrian traffic compared to vehicular traffic. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing whether or not warning signs or further pleas to investigate the bridge cables would have prevented this disaster. This then begs the question, how much of safety is the responsibility of individuals versus an institution? This is a unique case compared to the other ethical cases we have seen in that there are no whistle blowers in this case.

=Satyendra Dubey=


Satyendra Dubey ([[Hindi]]: सत्येन्द्र दूबे) was born into a poor family in the small village of Shahpur of Bihar, India.  In 1990, he was admitted to the Civil Engineering Department of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Kanpur India Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur] to pursue his dream to become an engineer. He graduated in 1994, becoming the first person from his village to enter and graduate from an IIT&lt;ref name=&quot;gandhi2003&quot;&gt; Gandhi, Shailesh. Why was Satyendra Dubey betrayed? 10 12 2003. 2011 &lt;http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/dec/09guest.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. For several years, Dubey worked at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Surface_Transport_(India) Ministry of Surface Transport] before moving to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Authority_of_India National Highway Authority of India](NHAI) in July of 2002. AT the NHAI, Dubey was made the assistant project manager at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koderma Koderma]. He was responsible for managing the construction of a section of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Quadrilateral Golden Quadrilateral] highway project, a network connecting India's four largest cities. It is the largest road project in India and was initiated by the Prime Minister of India, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee Atal Bihari Vajpayee]&lt;ref name=&quot;pandey2010&quot;&gt; Pandey, Alok.

While working at the NHAI, Dubey discovered that the contracted firm assigned to build sections of the roads,  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen_and_Toubro Larsen &amp; Toubro], had been subcontracting the actual work to smaller  groups, controlled by the local mafia. He found that these smaller contractors did not have the expertise to build quality roads. Later on, Dubey reportedly had the contractor rebuild six kilometers of roads at a loss to the mafia. Dubey wrote to his boss, NHAI Project Director SK Soni, about the corruption in the contracting firm, but he received no response and faced several threats following his actions at Koderma&lt;ref name = &quot;gandhi2003&quot;/&gt;.

{{Rquote|left|'''A dream project of unparalleled importance to the Nation but in reality a great loot of public money... I will keep on addressing these issues in my official capacity in the limited domain within the powers delegated to me.'''|Dubey's Letter to the Prime Minister&lt;ref name = &quot;fernando2009&quot;/&gt;}}

In August 2003, against his own will, he was transferred to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaya,_India Gaya]. At Gaya, he experienced the same corruption found in Koderma. Frustrated with the lack of action, Dubey wrote directly to the Prime Minister, detailing the financial and contractual violations in the project. He had explicitly requested to have his identity kept secret, but despite this, the letter along with his personal information was forwarded to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Road_Transport_and_Highways Ministry of Road Transport and Highways]. It is believed that the contracting firm may have had access to this letter&lt;ref name = &quot;fernando2009&quot;/&gt;.

On November 27, 2003, Dubey was returning from a wedding. He reached Gaya railway station at three in the morning and found that his car was not able to start. Dubey never made it home. He was found by his personal driver, shot dead in Gaya&lt;ref name = &quot;fernando2009&quot;/&gt;.

As a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower whistleblower], Dubey had his own moral guidelines on what he thought was right and wrong. While many people would have chosen to look the other way, Dubey believed that it was his responsibility to bring corruption to the attention of his superiors, for the good of India. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Dubey's request to keep his identity hidden was not an act of avoiding responsibility, but rather to secure his own personal safety. The Prime Minister of India and the Indian government not only failed to assist Dubey in correcting these contracting violations, but their actions may have led to Dubey's murder. The cost of exposing corruption in India and the lack of responsibility from public officials describes the country's need to enact procedures and laws to protect whistleblowers.

=Public Outcry=


The public response to Dubey’s murder was immediate and widespread. The combination of his humble origins, his academic and professional successes, and his stance on corruption gave him a hero-like status.  The chairman of Transparency International, R.H. Tahiliani, gave Dubey the following praise:

{{cquote|Mr. Dubey laid down his life in fighting the scourge of corruption. He could either have gone with the tide or kept his anonymity by remaining in the background. But, he boldly chose to be in the forefront and fight for justice.

In the days following Dubey’s death, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_express The Indian Express], one of India’s major and respected newspapers, received over 25,000 angry letters condemning the incident&lt;ref name = &quot;indianprobes2003&quot;&gt; India Probes Whistleblower Murder.

Protests were staged throughout India, and the internet was abuzz with discussion forums, social networking groups, and petitions whose goal was to share information about the case and exert pressure on the government to respond more strongly. Created by fellow alumni of IIT-Kanpur, the yahoo group “Jago India,” was one such example—their front page read:

=Petition to the Prime Minister’s Office=

Among other efforts, a petition was quickly initiated to “demand a fully inquiry and justice” from the office of the Prime Minister (PMO)&lt;ref name = &quot;sinha2003&quot;&gt;Sinha, S.

The Petition’s specific request was for the PMO to form an “independent CBI inquiry free from any undue political influence&lt;ref name = &quot;sinha2003&quot;/&gt;.” The letter gathered over 50,000 signatures and perhaps as a result, ten days later Prime Minister Vajpayee requested an independent CBI inquiry into Dubey’s death. In a statement, Vajpayee said, &quot;Those responsible for his death, wherever they may be, will not be spared.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;indianprobes2003&quot;/&gt;

=Whistleblower Protection Bill=

In addition to pushing for a larger inquiry into Dubey’s murder, the public and some politicians began to endorse the ratification of a Whistleblower Protection Bill in India. Many blamed the PMO for revealing Dubey’s name despite his explicit request for anonymity, and believed that this legislation could prevent similar instances from occurring in the future. Resistance to the bill was sizable however, and it wasn’t until August of 2010 that the Indian Parliament enacted the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower_protection_act_%28India%29 Whistleblower Protection Bill].

=Comparison to Other Cases=

This chapter will compare Dubey’s case with the cases of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen Andersen], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co. Merck], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger the ''Challenger''], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg Daniel Ellsberg], Ed Turner, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Boisjoly Roger Boisjoly].

=== Corruption in Culture ===


==== ''Andersen'' ====
Corruption was steadily incorporated into Andersen’s culture through bad dealings that were never dealt with&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerstein2008&quot;&gt; Gerstein, M. (2008). Flirting with disaster: Why accidents are rarely accidental. New York, NY: Sterling Publishing.  &lt;/ref&gt;. The idea of normalization of deviance plays a big role in the increased corruption. In India, corruption is commonplace, with the country ranking 87th out of 178 countries in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_perceptions_index Corruption Perceptions Index]&lt;ref name=&quot;transparency2010&quot;&gt; Transparency. 2010. http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image: Merck_&amp;_Co.svg‎ |100px‎|thumb|right|Merk]]

====''Merck''====

Merck pressured researchers and scientist to keep silent about Merck’s VIGOR study&lt;ref name = &quot;Gerstein2008&quot;/&gt;. In Dubey’s case, the Prime Minister’s Office rejected Dubey’s request for anonymity, and their actions silenced Dubey forever.



===Political Pressures===
====''The Challenger''====
The governments of America and India played a huge role in the outcomes of the ''Challenger'' and Dubey, respectively. The ''Challenger'' was Ronald Reagan’s way to reform education in America&lt;ref name=&quot;richards2011&quot;&gt; Richards, W. J. (2011). Lessons learned from challenger. http://www.hallnj.org/index.php/topics/38-science-and-technology/1094-lessons-learned-from-challenger &lt;/ref&gt;. The Reagan Administration used the project as a public relations tool and most likely wanted to time the launch of the ''Challenger'' with Reagan’s State of the Union address&lt;ref name = &quot;Gerstein2008&quot;/&gt;. Although the White House denied any involvement with the decision to launch the space shuttle, the mounting political pressure may have caused the deaths of those on board the ''Challenger''. In Dubey’s case, the Golden Quadrilateral was the Prime Minister’s project. In Dubey’s words, it was “a dream project of unparalleled importance to the nation [of India].”&lt;ref name=&quot;fernando2009&quot;&gt; Fernando, A.C. (2009). Business ethics: An indian perspective. India: Dorling Kindersley. &lt;/ref&gt; Again, the government had high stakes in the project. The death of Dubey may have been caused by the circulation of his letter by the Prime Minister’s Office.

===Whistleblowers===
Dubey’s case is essentially a whistleblower’s story. Many individuals’ actions parallel to the bravery of Dubey’s. One individual is Daniel Ellsberg, who released the Pentagon Papers that detailed how the U.S. government lied about aspects of the Vietnam War&lt;ref name=&quot;apple1996&quot;&gt; Apple, R. W. (1996). Pentagon papers. http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pentagon_papers/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=pentagon%20papers&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt; . Another individual is Ed Turner, who refused to approve certain road projects&lt;ref name=&quot;harrisetal2009&quot;&gt; Harris, C. E., Pritchard, M.S., &amp; Rabins, M. J. (2009). Engineering ethics: Concepts and cases. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing. p.270&lt;/ref&gt;. Lastly, Roger Boisjoly tried to stop the launch of the Challenger, despite adversity&lt;ref name=&quot;boisjoly1987&quot;&gt; Boisjoly, R. M. (1987). Ethical decisions: Morton Thiokol and the space shuttle challenger disaster. American Society of Mechanical Engineers Annual Meetings. &lt;/ref&gt;. All of these people risked everything, and were met with negative consequences. Ellsberg was put on trial&lt;ref name=&quot;ellsberg2006&quot;&gt; Ellsberg, D. (2006). Daniel Ellsberg: Extended biography. http://www.ellsberg.net/bio/extended-biography&lt;/ref&gt;; Turner lost his job&lt;ref name=&quot;harrisetal2009&quot; /&gt;; and Boisjoly was shunned by his co-workers and eventually resigned&lt;ref name=&quot;partridge2001&quot;&gt; Partridge, E. (2001). Blissful Ignorance. http://www.crisispapers.org/Editorials/blissfull.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. However, these consequences were not as dire as Dubey’s, who lost his life in fighting corruption.

=Lessons or Conclusions=
There are many lessons that this case teaches about professionalism. One is that being ethical can be fatal, which leads to the question: Should a professional be willing to die for a cause? Some consider that self-sacrifice is a heroic act&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenstand2011&quot;&gt; Rosenstand, N. (2011). The ethics of self-sacrifice. http://philosophyonthemesa.com/2011/03/25/the-ethics-of-self-sacrifice/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harris2009&quot;&gt; Harris, E. S. (2009). The moral dimensions of properly evaluating and defining suicide. http://www.ohio.edu/ethics/2001-conferences/the-moral-dimensions-of-properly-evaluating-and-defining-suicide/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;. In other cases, some argue that professionals do not have an obligation for unrealistic self-sacrifice&lt;ref name=&quot;wueste1994&quot;&gt; Wueste, D. E. (1994). Professional ethics and social responsibility. London, England: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publisher. Page 74. http://books.google.com/books?id=aApoT4V9zU4C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=self-sacrifice+professional+ethics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9q0auSgpe2&amp;sig=vYd_R29qkIdd5kwMu1Ns9cY2Ga0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8sS4TdyANY-3tge3j6HeBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;milbank1999&quot;&gt; Milbank, J. (1999). The ethics of self-sacrifice. First Things, 91, 33-38. http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9903/articles/milbank.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Another lesson is that corruption is often institutionalized. Normalization of deviance plays a huge role in allowing corruption to spread and usually leads to future disasters. Most likely, a professional will face corruption in the work place, which leads to the question: What should a professional do in the face of corruption? Many groups have been formed to fight corruption, such as Global Witness&lt;ref name=&quot;globalwitness&quot;&gt; Global Witness. www.globalwitness.org&lt;/ref&gt;, Group of States against Corruption&lt;ref name=&quot;greco&quot;&gt; GRECO. http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/default_en.asp&lt;/ref&gt;, and Transparency International&lt;ref name=&quot;transparency&quot;&gt; Transparency. http://www.transparency.org/ &lt;/ref&gt;. While these groups show a strong backlash against corruption, corruption is still intact&lt;ref name=&quot;interpol2008&quot;&gt; Interpol. (2008). “Statistical information about corruption.” http://www.interpol.int/public/corruption/conventions/Statistics.asp&lt;/ref&gt;. Ultimately, Dubey’s actions did not dispel corruption in India&lt;ref name=&quot;transparency2010&quot; /&gt;. Yet, his actions have spurred individuals from many countries to fight against corruption, and that is a step in the right direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookCat}}
The following case illustrates the ethical issues involved with national security and the dual allegiances of national lab employees to their government contractor and the federal government.  As with any case, it is tempting to creating a hero or villain out of an individual rather than focusing on the interests of governments and corporations.  Although the authors have attempted to provide an unbiased account of the events and give equal weight to the perspectives of all actors, most of the sources have focused on Carpenter's role.  

==Background==

===Sandia National Laboratories===

[[w:Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia National Laboratories]] is an organization known as a &quot;GOCO,&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;GoCo Page&quot;&gt; Sandia page on GOCOs: http://www.sandia.gov/about/history/goco/ &lt;/ref&gt; meaning government run, contractor operated. In the case of Sandia, the contractor is [[w:Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin]]. Specifically, Sandia is one of three &quot;weapons labs&quot; in the United States, meaning that it is run by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) in the Department of Energy (DOE). The purpose of Sandia National Labs is best reflected by their mission statement:

&quot;We develop technologies to sustain, modernize, and protect our nuclear arsenal, prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, defend against terrorism, protect our national infrastructures, ensure stable energy and water supplies, and provide new capabilities to our armed forces.&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;Sandia Website&quot;&gt; Sandia's Official Website: http://www.sandia.gov/mission/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;

This mission statement shows the obvious importance of both physical and network security at Sandia National Labs.

===Shawn Carpenter===

To provide this network security, Sandia National Labs employs an entire department of security analysts whose job it is to recover stolen files and retrieve evidence following a network or system breach. This information is used not only to identify and aid in capturing the intruder, but also to figure out the vulnerabilities in the computer network that were exploited and how to prevent future intrusions. One of these employees was Shawn Carpenter.

In September 2003, Carpenter was investigating a network breach at Lockheed Martin when he first found evidence of a group of highly skilled and aggressive hackers. Several months later, Carpenter witnessed a similar attack at Sandia. After learning that the Army had experienced intrusions that appeared to follow the same patterns, Carpenter concluded that these hackers posed a greater threat than anyone had thought. He then began to &quot;back-hack&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;&gt; Vijayan, Jaikumar. Q&amp;A: Reverse hacker describes ordeal (February 26, 2007). Computer World.  Retrieved April 20, 2011 from Computer World website: http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9011832/Q_A_Reverse_hacker_describes_ordeal_&lt;/ref&gt; the intruders, tracing them to servers in South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan before ultimately pinpointing their origin to Guangdong, a province in southern China. Carpenter would later discover that this group of hackers was code-named Titan Rain by US authorities and was central to several ongoing investigations. In May 2004, Carpenter found many stolen documents stashed on a server in South Korea. These files included Lockheed Martin plans for NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as well as flight and mission planning software stolen from Redstone Arsenal, headquarters of the Army Aviation and Missile Command.

After finding these files, Carpenter met with his supervisors at Sandia, hoping to pass along the information he had gathered to the affected parties. Their response, however, was not what Carpenter expected. According to Carpenter, he was told &quot;We don't care about any of this. We only care about Sandia computers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt; Carpenter said he tried to find a way to give his findings to Sandia's counterintelligence department or to the authorities, but was told he was forbidden from doing so, that it &quot;wasn't [his] job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt; Against Sandia's wishes, Carpenter began communicating his discoveries with contacts in Army intelligence. A short time later, the Army sent Carpenter to the FBI, as federal regulations prevent military intelligence officers from collaborating with civilians. Beginning in October 2004, Carpenter worked as a confidential informant for the FBI, feeding them the information he had gathered on Titan Rain's activities. Within a few weeks, Carpenter's FBI handlers told him to stop actively hacking Titan Rain, however Carpenter continued to give them previously gathered information and analysis. At the same time they were accepting Carpenter's contributions, the FBI was also investigating him. FBI agents are supposed to validate all their informants and Carpenter's actions were illegal, as it is against U.S. law for American citizens to hack into foreign computers. In March 2005, the FBI ceased all communication with Carpenter, although they eventually decided against prosecuting him.

In January 2005, Sandia discovered that Carpenter was working with the FBI on the Titan Rain case and fired him, claiming his actions constituted an improper use of confidential information he had obtained at his job.

==Ethical Responsibility==

Three main groups, Shawn Carpenter, Bruce Held and Sandia National Laboratories, and the FBI, each faced different ethical issues.

===Shawn Carpenter===

For Carpenter, the central conflict was between performing the duties in his job contract and supporting his national government.  As part of his job, Carpenter regularly back-hacked into foreign servers to retrieve Sandia information or passwords.  His reports to his supervisors made his tactics clear even to a nonexpert.  However, the Titan Rain case was obviously more complex and could have more severe repercussions than his normal investigations.  In Carpenter's own words, &quot;The difference in this instance was that the rabbit hole went much deeper than I imagined.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

Moreover, Carpenter was a Navy veteran and his wife was in the Army reserve at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name =&quot;Time article&quot;&gt; Thornburgh, Nathan. The invasion of the Chinese cyberspies(August 29, 2005). Time Magazine. Retrieved April 20, 2011 from Time website: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1098961,00.html &lt;/ref&gt;  In the Navy, Carpenter had been trained that national security was his top priority.  When a purported &quot;National&quot; Lab dismissed evidence of a major security threat, Carpenter's military training and career interests came into conflict. He felt that Sandia's actions were &quot;a case of putting the interests of the corporation over those of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;  Carpenter's wife, Jennifer Jacobs, claims, &quot;This is what we have to do, because it's what we expect of others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlbJournal1&quot;&gt; Sandlin, Scott. Sandia hacker gets $4 million; analyst fired for FBI contact (February 14, 2007). Albuquerque Journal. Retrieved April 26, 2011 from Lexis Nexis Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; She raises the possibility that Carpenter acted in a self-interested form of morality.  He stood up to Sandia in the hopes that other professionals in similar circumstances would do the same.  In that way, the nation would be more secure.

===Sandia National Labs and Bruce Held===

To analyze the prospective of Sandia in this case, it is first important to know how Sandia is managed. As mentioned above, Sandia is operated by Lockheed Martin for the Department of Energy. The original purpose of contractors operating national laboratories was to move liability from the DOE to the contractor. If it became public that data was stolen from Sandia and numerous other Lockheed-operated facilities, then it would reflect poorly on the company as a whole. Also, an investigation of the data loss would bring unwanted scrutiny to the counterintelligence work at Sandia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt; Poor publicity can lead to contractors either failing to secure future contracts or even losing current contracts; therefore it was in Lockheed's best interest for the data theft to remain hidden. As a Lockheed-operated facility, all employees at Sandia technically worked for the company, and it could be argued that it is professional for employees to do what is best for the company.

Another factor in the decision making at Sandia National Labs is based on the highly secure environment. Security at the lab is intense; Carpenter said in an interview that of all of his colleagues at Sandia, only two are still willing to talk to him to this day due to a fear of wire-tapping at both home and work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt; Employees are also reminded that Sandia is an &quot;at-will&quot; employer, which Carpenter claims is to keep employees in line and make them fear for their jobs. This fear-based environment is best shown by Bruce Held, Sandia's Chief of Counterintelligence at the time of the events. In Carpenter's termination interview, Held allegedly said: &quot;You're lucky you have such understanding management. If you worked for me, I would decapitate you! There would at least be blood all over the office!&quot; Although Carpenter was the source for this quote, Held later testified that he remembered using the word &quot;decapitate&quot; and would not contest that he had said &quot;blood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

Sandia's official statement concerning Carpenter's termination was: &quot;Sandia does its work in the national interest lawfully. When people step beyond clear boundaries in a national security setting, there are consequences.&quot; Based on the prospective of Sandia in this case, it is doubtful that this official statement reflects the entirety of Sandia's justifications in the way they handled Shawn Carpenter's case.

===FBI===

From the FBI's perspective, Carpenter was both a liability and a valuable asset.  Hacking into foreign computers is illegal.  Even when Carpenter was performing his regular job and retrieving stolen Sandia information, he was breaking the law.  On the other hand, the Titan Rain investigation was important to national security interests and the US government cannot gather the same information as Carpenter.  In order to hack into foreign computers, the FBI would have to get the approval of the Department of Justice and a high-level diplomat.  While the military could legally launch a full-scale investigation, the justification would be &quot;preparation for war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time article&quot;/&gt;  Freelancers like Carpenter are able to provide the government with valuable information without creating diplomatic tension with China.  The FBI's request for Carpenter to cease investigating Titan Rain, while simultaneously using the information he provided, makes sense within this context.

==Conclusions==

Following his dismissal, Carpenter sued Sandia National Labs for wrongful termination.  On February 13, 2007, a jury awarded him $387,537 in compensation for lost wages and emotional distress, and $4 million in punitive damages.  They cited Sandia's &quot;cavalier attitude about national security and global security&quot; in addition to a lack of records of Carpenter's dismissal and the events leading up to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlbJournal1&quot;/&gt;

Carpenter's case begs the question of whether patriotism is included in professional ethics.  Even if Carpenter's information wasn't directly relevant to Sandia, it was critical to national security.  At the same time, there must be a clear dividing line between corporations and the US military and law enforcement.  Although in this case, the FBI and the New Mexico court system agreed that Carpenter's actions did not justify his termination, at what point would he have gone too far?  Also, what is the proper response of a government contractor to the potentially illegal activities of their employees?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookCat}}

In 2003 [[w:Mark Klein|Mark Klein]], a technician at [[w:AT&amp;T|AT&amp;T]], stumbled across a project with national significance involving AT&amp;T and the [[w:NSA|National Security Agency]] (NSA).  Inside one of its San Francisco buildings AT&amp;T had constructed a secured room that was fed a copy of all Internet traffic going through the building.  This chapter discusses the story leading up to Klein's ethical dilemma, what happened as a result, and some of the ethical issues surrounding this case.

== AT&amp;T and Mark Klein ==

[[File:Mark_Klein.jpg‎|thumb|left|250px|Mark Klein]]
In 2002, while Klein was serving as an employee of AT&amp;T in San Francisco, a representative from the NSA visited to interview AT&amp;T employees for a special job. Later, in January 2003, he observed that the AT&amp;T central office in San Francisco had a room (641A), where access was limited to this special employee. After Klein was relocated to this office in October 2003, he noticed surreptitious activity regarding the room. In particular, several documents that Klein used, including a December 10, 2002 document titled &quot;Study Group 3, LGX/Splitter Wiring, San Francisco&quot;, led him to infer that signals from optical fibers carrying Internet traffic were being split and sent into Room 641A. Other documents listed devices inside the secure room, such as the Narus STA 6400 (a &quot;Semantic Traffic Analyzer&quot;), which Klein suspected were processing large amounts of Internet traffic. Furthermore, he learned from other employees within AT&amp;T that similar rooms were in Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Klein concluded that the &quot;the NSA [would be] capable of conducting what amounts to vacuum-cleaner surveillance of all the data crossing the internet&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein&quot;&gt;Klein, M. (6 April 2006). &quot;Wiretap Whistle-Blower's Account&quot;. Wired. http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70621&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, his fear of losing his job kept him silent&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;Goodman, A.

Klein retired in 2004.  After information about warrantless wiretapping by the Bush administration was reported in December 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff&quot;&gt;Markoff, J., &amp; Shane, S. (13 April 2006). &quot;Documents Show Link Between AT&amp;T and Agency in Eavesdropping Case&quot;. The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Risen&quot;&gt;Risen, J., &amp; Lichtblau, E.

The Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;, Klein was motivated to reveal his own information&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, feeling that it was his duty to &quot;bring these facts to light&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Klein tried to have the ''Los Angeles Times'' run a story based on his information&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns&quot;&gt;Burns, M. (July/August 2010). &quot;Whistleblower's slog to get wiretap story into the media&quot;. St. Louis Journalism Review.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;Interview: Mark Klein. (9 January 2007). Spying on the Home Front. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/interviews/klein.html&lt;/ref&gt;, but the newspaper backed down after Director of National Intelligence [[w:John Negroponte|John Negroponte]] met with editors&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. After this, Klein attempted to get an article in the ''New York Times'', but they also appeared reluctant until the [[w: Electronic Frontier Foundation | Electronic Frontier Foundation ]] (EFF) desired to use Klein's testimony in  a case against AT&amp;T, which bolstered the newspaper to proceed with a report&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Lawsuits and Legislation ==

=== Lawsuits === 
Mark Klein took his findings to the EFF, which sued AT&amp;T in a class action lawsuit on behalf of citizens whose privacy was violated by its actions. (See [[w: Hepting v. AT&amp;T|Hepting v. AT&amp;T]].) Lawsuits were also filed against the NSA, [[w: Verizon Communications | Verizon]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/verizon-mci&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[w: George W. Bush | President Bush]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/18/eff_sues_bush/&lt;/ref&gt;. Of these, the EFF lawsuit against AT&amp;T showed the most promise for success, withstanding the government's motion to dismiss in July 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff2&quot;&gt;Markoff, J. (21 July 2006). &quot;Judge Declines to Dismiss Privacy Suit Against AT&amp;T&quot;. The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;. The legal basis on which these cases were built goes back to the 1970s and is outlined in the following section.

=== Legislation === 
The legislation regarding domestic surveillance goes back to the [[w:Watergate Scandal|Watergate Scandal]] of 1972.  As a result of the scandal, [[w: United States Congress | Congress]] passed the [[w:Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) in 1978 to limit the ability of the federal government to conduct surveillance. Under this law, the President could authorize surveillance of agents of foreign powers for up to one year.  To surveil any U.S. citizen required a warrant from the [[w:Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC).

After the [[w: September 11 attacks | terrorist attacks in 2001]], Congress passed a slew of legislation, including the [[w:Patriot Act|Patriot Act]] and the [[w:Authorization for use of military force against terrorists|Authorization For Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), giving the President increased powers to fight terrorism. The same year, President George W. Bush started his [[w:Terrorist Surveillance Program|&quot;Terrorist Surveillance Program']], in which he authorized the NSA by executive order to conduct warrantless surveillance as long as at least one party in the communication was believed to be outside the U.S.  FISA included a provision that allowed surveillance with &quot;any express statutory authorization&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1809.html|title=United States Code Title 50, Chapter 36, Subchapter I, § 1809|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Bush Administration claimed that the AUMF was such a statute and took advantage of this legal ambiguity to work with AT&amp;T.  Congress further reduced surveillance restrictions in 2007 with the passage of the [[w:Protect America Act of 2007|Protect America Act]].  This amendment to the FISA was to last one year and allowed monitoring as long as it was not targeted at a person &quot;reasonably believed&quot; to be in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protect&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110s1927enr/pdf/BILLS-110s1927enr.pdf|title=Protect America Act|author= 110th Congress|date= 2007-01-04|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also removed the warrant requirement provided at least one surveilled party was outside of the U.S. 

FISA was amended once more after the expiration of the Protect America Act.  The [[w:Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendment Act of 2008]] restated most of the provisions from the Protect America Act.  Furthermore, facing an election year and pressure from the Bush Administration, Congress also included a clause to give immunity to telecommunication companies, like AT&amp;T, for &quot;past or future&quot; cooperation with government surveillance efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-6304|title=FISA Amendments Act of 2008, SEC. 802.

As a result, the lawsuits mentioned above were thrown out.

== Ethical Implications/Issues ==

=== Privacy and the Internet ===

Mark Klein's belief that we have a right to privacy on the Internet eventually led him to blow the whistle on the NSA and AT&amp;T.  But do we really have that right? If so, who is responsible for protecting that right?

[[File:Applications-internet.svg|thumb|left|250px|The Internet gives us a limitless arena to communicate and share with others, but at what price?]]

Under the [[w: United States Constitution|Constitution]], we do not have an explicit right to privacy.  However, the court system has used the concept of &quot;reasonable [[w:expectation of privacy|expectation of privacy]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/389/347/case.html|title=Katz v. United States|author=Justice Harlan, concurring|date=1967-12-18|accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, particularly when hearing cases involving the [[w: Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution | 4th Amendment]] (See [[w:Katz v. United States|Katz v. United States]]).  Nearly half of U.S. states have some form of legislation guarding the privacy rights of Internet users.  Most simply require websites to have a privacy policy where they explain how user information will be used, letting the users make the choice.  However, Nevada and Minnesota have laws that go even further, requiring [[w: Internet service provider | Internet Service Providers]] to protect subscribers' private information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=325M|title=Chapter 325 M. Internet Privacy|author= 2010 Minnesota Statutes|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-205.html|title=Chapter 205: Crimes Against Property|author= Nevada Revised Statutes|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many believe that we do have an inherent right to privacy on the Internet, going so far as to call for an Electronic Bill of Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.techlawjournal.com/privacy/80515gore.htm|title=Excerpt from Vice President Al Gore's Address at NYU|author= Al Gore|date= 1998-05-14|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Privacy advocates argue that &quot;privacy protects us from abuses by those in power&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html|title=Schneier on Security - The Value of Privacy|author= Bruce Schneier|date= 2006-05-19|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Others, though, assert that &quot;privacy is dead&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-383709537384528624#|title=Privacy Is Dead - Get Over It|author= Steve Rambam|date= 2006-08-01|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2010/08/02/privacy-privacy-where-for-art-thou-privacy/|title=Privacy,Privacy, Where for Art Thou Privacy|author= Matthew Schafer|date= 2010-08-02|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;privacy fears have always been more of an emotional reaction than a rational one&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=dont-worry-about-whos-watching|title=Don't Worry About Who's Watching|author= David Pogue|date= 2011-01-01|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  All would agree, though, that humans have been trading privacy for convenience throughout history and that this case has made it particularly clear that the only way to truly keep information private is to not make it available in the first place.

=== Civil Liberties and National Security ===

Balancing the promotion of national security with respecting civil liberties is a problem all governments must address.  Acts of terrorism in the 2000s led many Americans to place increased value on security, and the government's focus shifted in that direction. Yet some Americans still opposed the changes made under the Bush Administration&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reformthepatriotact.org/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Americans fear the threats of terrorism and other dangers to national security, but also fear the loss of their civil liberties and the potential for the United States to become a police state.  This balancing act is difficult, and in a representative democracy the government will draw the line in a way that reflects the will of the people.  While the government tries to appease the majority, there will still be many citizens who do not agree with its decisions.

This presents a difficult situation for professional engineers.  They may at times find themselves in a situation where personal values clash with existing laws.  The story of Mark Klein provides a perfect example of this scenario.  Although the courts and the government found no misconduct in the case of Room 641A, Mark Klein believed that his and others' civil liberties were being violated and felt compelled to confront the issue.  In these scenarios, engineers are likely to find that they cannot enact change from within the company because of the absence of legal wrongdoing.  Engineers must then decide whether they are willing to continue working on a project that violates their personal values. 

This is only one example where these challenges arose and there are many other cases where engineers face a similar clash of personal values and existing laws (See [[Professionalism/Shawn Carpenter and Sandia National Laboratories|Shawn Carpenter]], [[Professionalism/Vioxx:_Merck_and_the_FDA|Vioxx]], [[Professionalism/The Ford Pinto Gas Tank Controversy|Ford Pinto]], [[Professionalism/Jeffrey Wigand and Brown &amp; Williamson|Jeffrey Wigand]]).

=== Ethical Duties ===
Although Mark Klein eventually revealed the evidence supporting his beliefs about Room 641A, his impending retirement influenced his decision to wait&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Klein certainly felt that he was protecting individuals' rights and pushing back against possible Orwellian intrusions into personal privacy&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. His determination that &quot;this potential spying appears to be applied wholesale to all sorts of internet communications of countless citizens&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; appears to have been a major motivation, but one may criticize his seemingly self-serving decision to hold out until after his retirement. However, one could further argue whether Klein truly had enough information to merit raising the alarm over this issue and whether or not it was ethical for him to use circumstantial evidence to blow the whistle. The coastal locations of Room 641A and its counterparts lends credence to the espoused stance of the executive branch that solely international Internet traffic would be investigated by the NSA&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the devices in those alleged rooms could also be altered to observe Internet communications within the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Congress also has ethical responsibilities in this case. Since Congress is expected to serve as a check on the executive branch&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison51&quot;&gt;Madison, J. &quot;Publius&quot;. (8 February 1788). Federalist No. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;, one could argue that Congress failed by effectively pardoning AT&amp;T and other telecommunications companies that cooperated with the Bush Administration&lt;ref name=&quot;110th Congress&quot;&gt;110th Congress. (10 July 2008). Text of H.R. 6304 [110th]: FISA Amendments Act of 2008. http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-6304&lt;/ref&gt;. Some would suggest that Congress was influenced by the coupling of this legislative pardon with a bill regarding national security&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu&quot;&gt;Wu, T. (2 November 2010). The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires.&lt;/ref&gt;. These views contend that legislators were coerced into approving the pardon lest they be seen as weak on national security in the upcoming elections in 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. If legislators indeed acted in this manner, then they cannot have been fulfilling their duties to uphold the current rule of law. However, there is also the possibility that Congress's own independent decision-making on this issue led the members of Congress to pass the Amendment and intentionally included all its provisions. 

Additionally, AT&amp;T has ethical responsibilities.  As a telecommunications company handling its clients' information, AT&amp;T would be expected to uphold the values  of a [[w: Common carrier|common carrier]] and treat all messages that it carries fairly even if the common carrier concept is not as uniformly applied nowadays&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieden&quot;&gt;Frieden, R. (December 1995). &quot;Contamination of the common carrier concept in telecommunications&quot;. Telecommunications Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, if AT&amp;T stops taking into account the welfare of its clients and allows another entity (e.g. the U.S. government) to hold unequal sway over its actions, then the company has essentially abandoned its important role to behave as a common carrier and has unduly expanded government's interference into the private sector. However, if the executive branch did truly have adequate justification for the actions performed by the Bush administration, then cooperation from telecommunications companies was necessary. Furthermore, AT&amp;T can unilaterally adjust its stated positions on certain issues such as when the company altered its privacy policy to say that essentially AT&amp;T and not its clients has the right to deal with its clients' information in any way that AT&amp;T pleases&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazarus&quot;&gt;Lazarus, D. (21 June 2006). &quot;AT&amp;T rewrites rules: Your data isn't yours&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Usaf.c5.galaxy.750pix.jpg|thumb|196px|right|The C-5A Galaxy]]

The [[w:C-5A Galaxy|C-5A Galaxy]] is a large aircraft carrier, contracted to [[w: Lockheed|Lockheed ]] by the U.S. Air Force in 1965.  The aircraft was primarily designed to transport heavy loads across the globe on short notice &lt;ref name =&quot;Factsheet&quot;&gt;C-5 Galaxy [factsheet]. (2009, June 5). Retrieved March 8, 2011, from U.S. Air Force website: http://archive.is/20120720095428/http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=84 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The Army was developing capabilities for rapid deployment but their equipment was significantly heavier and bulkier than the current cargo carriers could handle.  In supporting the Army in rapid deployment, the Air Force was responsible for developing a new state-of-the-art carrier to transport troops and massive equipment like the [[w: Bradley|Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] and [[w:HUMVEE|HUMVEE]].  As the largest airlifter in the U.S. Air Force, the C-5A was constructed with the ability and expectation of transporting such cargo.  However, when the promising aircraft started with a $1.9 billion proposal by Lockheed for a fleet of 115 C-5As at $16 million per plane and later jumped to $40 million per plane, individuals like  [[w:Ernest Fitzgerald|Ernest Fitzgerald]] could not sit in silence while it happened &lt;ref name =&quot;Texas&quot;&gt;Hoover, K., &amp; Fowler, W. T. (n.d.). Studies in ethics, safety, and liability for engineers. Retrieved March 8, 2011, from Rice, Berkely, The C-5A Scandal. website:  http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/archive/general/ethics/galaxy.html &lt;/ref&gt;.   

=The Key Concerns of the C-5A Galaxy=
The primary concern with the C-5A was the extreme costs due to development, maintenance, and renovations over time.  The aircraft experienced several design flaws that gained attention from both a performance perspective and cost perspective. 

==Cost==
From the beginning, the C-5A was influenced by money as five companies made proposals for the aircraft’s design.  However, while Boeing’s design was deemed the best by an Air Force evaluation team, officials gave the contract to Lockheed whose proposal was a lower total cost &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal ccc&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). Construction, confusion, and concealment. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 29-43). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The C-5A contractor decision came at a time when the production of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, the smaller generation of the Galaxy, was coming to a close at the Marietta Air Force Base dominated by Lockheed &lt;ref name =&quot;c-5 history&quot;&gt;C-5 History. (2006, April 2). Retrieved March 27, 2011, from http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/c-5-history.htm &lt;/ref&gt;.  If Lockheed did not receive the contract, the base was likely to close and impact the Georgia economy.  The decision to go with a lower cost model was the deciding factor in selecting Lockheed, according to United States Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell, but the $400 million in saving turned into a cost overrun of fives times that figure &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal birth&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). The birth of the Galaxy. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 1-17). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.

In January 1966, a civilian named Ernest Fitzgerald, first discovered the cost overruns in a routine trip to Marietta.  The following table shows the increase in the cost overrun within a two-year period:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Date
! Overhead Cost Above Contract

|-
| January 1966
| Fitzgerald discovers excess costs
|-
| August 1966

|-

|-
| December 1966
| $212 million
|-
| Summer 1968
| &gt; $1 billion
|-
| January 1969
| $2 billion
|-
|}

In November, Fitzgerald returned to Marietta where Lockheed denied overrun costs yet refused to provide cost figures.  Overrun costs had reached $212 million by December.  When the Comptroller of the Defense Department received a copy of the cost summary in January of 1967, it showed no overrun costs.  A request for the accurate costs followed as the Office of Secretary of Defense knew about the overrun costs &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal ccc&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). Construction, confusion, and concealment. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 29-43). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.   
   

==Performance==
The C-5A’s long struggle for success can be attributed to a combination of cost overrun and failure to meet high performance standards.  When Congress heard of the potential increases in costs, the only justification was the unchanging performance standards of the aircraft.  In June 1969, Fitzgerald revealed three contract changes that degraded the plane's performance.  The Air Force refused to provide additional information until after the Congressional hearings on the plane's concern had ended.  After the hearings, Fitzgerald received a complete summary that uncovered 46 changes in the plane's design and 789 specification changes &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal cracked wings&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). Cracked wings and other unforeseen difficulties. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 146-162). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Fitzgerald claimed that the specifications appeared to be written based on the plane rather than vice versa.   

Despite all of these contract changes, aircraft tests in June 1969 yielded cracked wings from the stress of the cargo weight, which was lighter than the contract requirements mandated.  A wing fix was designed to mitigate the problem, and the planes that were already built or under construction would have to be re-winged.  The cost of this fix was not revealed to Congress, nor was it successful in testing.  According to Representative Moorhead, Congress became frustrated with the decreased standards of the Galaxy's performance.  In June 1970, the first operational C-5A approached a welcoming crowd at [[w:Charleston Air Force Base|Charleston Air Force Base]], where upon landing, the aircraft blew a tire and another tire popped off down the runway &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal cracked wings&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). Cracked wings and other unforeseen difficulties. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 146-162). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.  While the plane was undamaged, it later went back to Marietta, where a fuel cell exploded during further testing, killing one mechanic, injuring another mechanic, and burning the entire plane.  Lockheed estimated the loss of one plane at $23 million whereas the Air Force estimated $60 million.  The event was not only a major monetary loss, but also a harsh reality of the program's failure.


=Ernest Fitzgerald: Whistle Blower to Congress=
At the time of the C-5 Galaxy controversy, Ernest Fitzgerald was the deputy for management systems for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller. Under this title he was responsible for the development of improved management controls, specifically including management information control systems, economic cost effectiveness analysis, statistical programs and analysis, cost estimating and analysis, and productivity enhancement and measurement &lt;ref name =&quot;Official Website of the U.S. Air Force&quot;&gt;http://archive.is/20121216223934/http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5423&lt;/ref&gt;. Fitzgerald was a mid-level civilian employee in the Pentagon whose values were shaped by harsh economic times growing up during the Great Depression in Birmingham, Alabama. Having served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and completed his bachelor’s of science in industrial engineering, he established himself as a pioneer in the field of defense industry cost control &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal ccc&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). Construction, confusion, and concealment. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 91-92). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The wasteful spending he observed in the Galaxy program bothered him, and ignored by Air Force management, he took his concerns to Congress.

Fitzgerald's largest ally in Congress was [[w:William Proxmire|Senator William Proxmire]], who fought against wasteful government spending &lt;ref name =&quot;CNN, 2005 - Wisconsin's maverick liberal&quot;&gt;CNN. (2005). Wisconsin's maverick liberal. Retrieved from:http://articles.cnn.com/2005-12-19/politics/proxmire.shields_1_genocide-treaty-golden-fleece-awards-transport-plane?_s=PM:POLITICS&lt;/ref&gt;.  Senator Proxmire first called Ernest Fitzgerald to testify before the Joint-Economic Committee in the fall of 1968.  Disturbed by the prospect of Fitzgerald's Congressional testimony, the Air Force initially refused to allow him to testify and intercepted a personal letter addressed to Fitzgerald from Senator Proxmire &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal cracked wings&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). The Ordeal of Ernest Fitzgerald. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 89-103). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Eventually, in January 1969, Fitzgerald revealed the deceptive practices by the Pentagon, contradicting claims that the project's continued funding would result in an aircraft with enhanced military capabilities. During the January hearings, Fitzgerald mentioned that Air Force officials were ignoring spare part and other costs; accounting for these costs had increased the 1965 cost projections from $300 million to over $1 billion only four years later &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal cracked wings&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). The Ordeal of Ernest Fitzgerald. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 89-103). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Furious about the disclosure, the Nixon administration felt that Fitzgerald had to leave.  Fitzgerald later found the Nixon administration had gone to lengths to attempt to discredit him and have him terminated for having divulged ‘classified’ information; in his book, he claims that officials went so far as falsifying documents to establish this  &lt;ref name =&quot;The Pentagonists: An Insider's View of Waste, Mismanagement, and Fraud in Defense Spending&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald, E. (1989). Carrying Out the Contract. In The Pentagonists (pp. 1-29). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Fitzgerald was ultimately fired in fall 1969 in what the Nixon administration called “reorganization,” but apparently there is some indication that Representative Gerald Ford’s office had been notified that Fitzgerald had “made it difficult” for Air Force Assistant Secretary &lt;ref name =&quot;The Pentagonists: An Insider's View of Waste, Mismanagement, and Fraud in Defense Spending&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald, E. (1989). Carrying Out the Contract. In The Pentagonists (pp. 1-29). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.
	


==A Special Relationship between Industry and Government==
Fitzgerald had not divulged any classified information, nor broken any laws.  Ultimately, Nixon officials secretly felt that Fitzgerald was not a team player and had undermined the chain of command.  Cost overruns accompanied by a cozy relationship between the Air Force and Lockheed bothered Fitzgerald about the C-5A project.  Fitzgerald's testimony threatened to do more than pull a plug on a wasteful and poorly managed program, but also shed light on the massive growth of the military industrial complex whose demise would harm the economic interests of very powerful interests - namely the defense industry.

Once it became evident that the costs for the C-5A were severely underestimated, Lockheed raced to improve the aircraft and modify contract requirements to speed up the delivery.  At the ceremony for the first finished C-5A in March 1968, taxpayers dollars were used to fly government officials, including members of the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|House and Senate Armed Services Committee]] and hundreds of other government personnel.  Lockheed employees distributed hefty press kits that announced the plan was meeting cost and production plans &lt;ref name =&quot;The C-5A Scandal ccc&quot;&gt;Rice, B. (1971). Construction, confusion, and concealment. In The C-5A scandal (pp. 29-43). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Whether the Air Force's mismanagement stemmed from political and economic interests or from a genuine pressure to allow Lockheed's excessive expenditures to persist because of sunk costs is unclear.  Nevertheless, the Air Force was determined to prove that the C-5A program was progressing according to plan. To invalidate Fitzgerald’s testimony, Air Force officials altered their cost estimates. The tampering with official documents was later determined in a hearing when true cost estimates were revealed. The resulting scandal during the Nixon administration contributed to an era “notoriously fraught with suspicion and distrust, anyone who instigated scandals that might threaten the image of the presidency was considered persona non grata” &lt;ref name =&quot;Struggles of Being Ernest&quot;&gt;Wimsatt, Allison Ross. (1999). The Struggles of Being Ernest. Industrial Management Magazine. 14(1). 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to an account in The Pentagonists, the White House reaction was that &quot;Mr. Fitzgerald had transcended the normal bounds of an executive branch employee.&quot; White House officials were &quot;concerned about the leaks that had occurred and the detrimental effect this was having on the image of the military overall” &lt;ref name =&quot;The Pentagonists&quot;&gt;The Pentagonists&lt;/ref&gt;.  Fitzgerald’s actions raised awareness and increased the role of Congress, and indirectly the American taxpayer, in defense spending.

==Conflicting Perceptions of Ernest Fitzgerald==
Fitzgerald embodied frugality and prudence when it came to financial matters, and disagreed with the mentality of many defense-contracting authorities. To the advocates of monitoring abuses in government financial management, Fitzgerald is regarded as an individual who prioritized truth over profit. Victories over Nixon and the Pentagon made Fitzgerald a legend or, as the New York Times called him, &quot;a folk hero to federal employees.&quot; &lt;ref name =&quot;A. Earnest Fitzgerald&quot;&gt;http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20092407,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Fitzgerald also received bipartisan support and admiration from Congressmen during his long-running appearances in trials. Senator Charles Grassley (Republican, Iowa) attributed Fitzgerald's efforts as &quot;one of the &quot;few major victories the taxpayers have had this decade.&quot;  Senator William Proxmire (Democrat, Wisconsin), applauded Fitzgerald for telling the truth &quot;about how the government spends the taxpayers' money.&quot;  Advocates also included members of the House of Representatives who shared their appreciation for Fitzgerald.  Representative Barbra Boxer (Democrat, California) went so far as to call Fitzgerald &quot;a true American hero&quot; for guiding Congress to effective reform &lt;ref name =&quot;Struggles of Being Ernest&quot;&gt;Wimsatt, Allison Ross. (1999). The Struggles of Being Ernest. Industrial Management Magazine. 14(1). 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

However, Air Force officials and several of Fitzgerald's colleagues disagreed with some of those meritorious statements. The assistant secretary for financial management and Fitzgerald’s boss, Richard Carver described a familiar attitude regarding Fitzgerald’s reputation.  He said, &quot;Ernie has the capacity to really irritate people.He has a kind of antagonistic way of doing things.” He also added that &quot;the average guy in the Air Force is persuaded that Ernie is more interested in headlines and raising heck than he is in getting the job done.&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;A. Earnest Fitzgerald&quot;&gt;http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20092407,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=Conclusion=
Fitzgerald would contend that the explosion in defense spending along with the lack of transparency and accountability in defense procurement are features not necessarily unique to one administration or one instance.  Fitzgerald was very uncomfortable with the vast growth of the military-industrial complex and the fraudulent accounting that took place at the Pentagon during his tenure.  It is difficult to tell whether Fitzgerald truly acted genuinely on ethical concerns regarding cost overruns or whether he was simply protecting himself.  It is certainly genuine to ask whether he would have blown the whistle if the plane was under budget, ahead of schedule, but under-performing.  Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that the Air Force and Lockheed look at the Galaxy project as they would any project: the first iteration or attempt at design is not satisfactory, and it is only with multiple iterations and investment of resources that engineering success can be attained.  Ultimately, each actor in this case had a different perspective, so the ensuing question is what to do when confronted with a problem, like Fitzgerald, where there are competing ethical perspectives?

The [[w:Ford_Pinto|Ford Pinto]] was a cheap subcompact car released in 1970 under the tagline “the little carefree car”. How did this harmless vehicle become synonymous with death and corporate greed? This chapter explores the environment in the automotive market and at Ford at the time, the Pinto’s design flaw and discovery, and the fallout that resulted. Much of the negative sentiment toward Ford was in response to their use of an economic risk-benefit decision making analysis which found that the cost of a recall would outweigh the value of the lives it would save. This chapter will also discuss the ramifications of using this type of analysis in the Pinto case and beyond.

==Background==
[[File:Ford Pinto.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Pinto]]
Subcompact cars emerged during the 1960s. Foreign companies like [[w:Volkswagen |Volkswagen]] and [[w:Toyota |Toyota]] found great success in Europe and Japan, and demand began to rise in the United States. Lee Iacocca, the president of Ford at the time, recognized this new demand for smaller cars, and led the initiative to design a Ford model called the Pinto. The typical time frame for getting a car from conception to production was 43 months, Lee Iacocca set the Pinto's at 25 months. Competition from foreign subcompacts and domestic companies like [[w: General Motors |General Motors]] and their Chevrolet Vega can be attributed to this ambitious time frame. Iacocca also stressed that the car must be under 2000 lbs and cost less than $2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;birsch&quot;&gt; Birsch, D., &amp; Fielder, J. (1994). The ford pinto case: a study in applied ethics, business, and technology. Albany: State Univeresity of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The faster Ford could get the Pinto into production, the more market share they could attain.

== Design Flaw ==

The Pinto controversy centered on a single design flaw which made this “carefree car” a potential deathtrap.  Despite owning a patent on an alternative tank design, Ford engineers chose to place the fuel tank at the back of the car, directly between the rear bumper and rear axle. This fuel tank placement was common for domestic and foreign cars at the time and was considered a conservative choice compared to the untested above-axle design. However, the potential dangers of this placement were exacerbated by other decisions made in the design process.  For instance, due to Iacocca's cost constraints, the walls of the fuel tank were exceptionally thin.  Additionally, the fuel tank design incorporated four poorly arranged bolts, which protruded from the rear differential directly adjacent to the tank.  As a result of these poor design choices, rear-end collision tests showed that, in collisions over 25 mph, the protruding bolts punctured the thin walls of the fuel tank, resulting in fuel leakage.  The danger of the Ford Pinto stems from this fuel leakage, for a single spark could ignite the leaked gas, potentially culminating in fatal consequences. 

While this flaw was discovered quickly during testing, the short timeframe of the Pinto’s development meant that final tooling had already begun. Tooling normally begins after product design and quality control are completed. However, the short production time of the Pinto required that tooling be completed while product design and development were finishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;birsch&quot;/&gt; If an error was found during testing, unless it was a major error, it would likely be overlooked.  Otherwise the production machinery would have to be retooled, making it impossible to reach the 25 month production timeframe.  Evidently, Ford did not deem this fuel leakage as a major design flaw because they did not undertake the efforts to retool the machinery.

== Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. ==

In May of 1972, Lily Gray was driving a 1972 Ford Pinto with thirteen year old passenger Richard Grimshaw. The car stalled and was rear ended by another. Upon impact, the fuel tank of the Pinto ruptured, leaked fuel, and quickly ignited, killing Lily Gray hours later after the accident and severely burning Richard Grimshaw.  As a result of the burns, Richard Grimshaw had to have over 90 surgeries.  The families sued Ford Motor Company, and, in 1978, a judgment was given against Ford, awarding the Gray family $560,000 and the Grimshaw family $2.5 million in compensatory damages. The jury also went on to award $125 million in punitive damages; although, this was later reduced to $3.5 million by the judge.&lt;ref&gt; Legget, C. (1999). The ford pinto case: the valuation of life as it applies to the negligence-efficiency argument . Retrieved from http://www.wfu.edu/~palmitar/Law&amp;Valuation/Papers/1999/Leggett-pinto.html &lt;/ref&gt;  The reason for such a large judgement was the troubling mix of rumors and facts that emerged during this case, which sparked a media frenzy.  The most notable of these is the document which came to be known as the “Pinto Memo”.

==The Pinto Memo and Its Risk-Benefit Analysis==

The Pinto Memo was a short document which included a cost-benefit analysis weighing the cost of an $11 per car fix against the cost of settling cases where the flaw caused death or injury.  The breakdown of the risk-benefit analysis is as follows:

'''Benefit:'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Burn Deaths !! Burn Injuries !! Burn Vehicles
|-
| Savings || 180 || 180 || 2100
|-
| Unit Cost || $200,000 || $67,000 || $700
|-
| Sub-Totals || $36,000,000 || $12,060,000 || $1,470,000
|-
| Total Cost || $49 million
|}

'''Risks:'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Car Sales !! Light Truck Sales
|-
| Sales || 11,000,000 || 15,000,000
|-
| Unit Cost || $11 || $11
|-
| Sub-Totals || $121,000,000 || $16,500,000
|-
| Total Cost || $137 million
|}

After the release of the memo, critics of Ford found several points of contention with Ford’s risk-benefit analysis.  For starters, while calculating the benefits, Ford claimed that the incidence of burn injuries would equal the incidence of burn deaths.  In reality, experts say that the ratio between burn injuries to burn deaths would be more along the lines of 10:1.&lt;ref&gt; Birsch, D. &amp; Fielder, J.H. The Ford Pinto Case. Albany, NY: The State University of New York Press. Retrieved from http://books.google.com/books?id=qIlPURPTx30C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Andrew+McGuire+ford+pinto+burn+injuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z-PrAx1rng&amp;sig=hAHxQe8eHGl2NVgSL5Rsf44B6tE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vde6TYjBDJG5tgewzKC0BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrew%20McGuire%20ford%20pinto%20burn%20injuries&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  If Ford had estimated the incidence of burn injuries to be 1800, ten times greater than the incidence of burn deaths, then the total cost of the benefit would have risen to $158 million, trumping the total cost of the risk.  As a result, Ford’s risk-benefit analysis would have indicated that it would be more cost effective for Ford to make changes to the Pinto’s fuel tank.

Additionally, Ford received flak for their low value of the human life.  In order to help them determine an appropriate value, the [[w:National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) suggested that Ford use $275,000, which in-and-of-itself is a relatively low estimate considering that most other federal agencies at the time set the value of human life at $350,000.  However, Ford ignored both of these estimates and chose a much lower value of human life: $200,000.&lt;ref&gt; SafetyXChange Staff (2008). Cost-Benefit Analysis: The Ford Pinto Example. Retrieved from http://www.safetyxchange.org/tools/cost-benefit-analysis-the-ford-pinto-example&lt;/ref&gt;  By choosing a number so low as $200,000, Ford consciously cut the apparent benefits of fixing the car, eliminating the burden of implementing changes to the fuel tank.  

Finally, critics also faulted Ford for inflating the unit cost of the repair to the car, claiming that it would cost $11 per vehicle.  At the time, several companies heard of Ford’s fuel tank issues and proposed several quick and cheap fixes to the car manufacturer.  For instance, Goodyear proposed a rubber bladder that would completely encase the fuel tank, preventing leakage in the event of a fuel tank rupture.&lt;ref&gt; Samuel, A. &amp; Weir, J. (1999).  Introduction to Engineering Design. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann. Retrieved from http://books.google.com/books?id=xxuyvQR34O4C&amp;pg=PA347&amp;dq=ford+pinto+goodyear+bladder&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=adi6TeL9M8bcgQeN16TdBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ford%20pinto%20goodyear%20bladder&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  The total cost of this fix would have been less than $5.  However, Ford disregarded these cheap and simple solutions and, instead, claimed that the cost of the fix would be $11.  As a result, this inflation of the unit cost of the fix consequently inflated the total cost of the risks.

Thus, if Ford had heightened the likeliness of burn injuries occurring, had increased their value for human life, and had used a cheaper unit cost of the repair fix, then Ford's risk-benefit analysis would have indicated that it would be more cost effective to implement the repairs than to risk human life.  While each of these individual critiques irked the public, ultimately, what led to the media frenzy and public outcry was Ford's implementation of the value of human life in its risk-benefit calculations.  Prior to the release of the Pinto memo in the Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. lawsuit, the public was predominantly unaware of the widespread use of the value of human life in cost analysis - companies typically kept this practice under wraps.  Therefore, when this practice was revealed and put in the limelight, the American public was shocked by its morbid nature.  After all, is not human life priceless?  Ultimately, the Pinto memo instigated the debate over the assignment of a dollar value to the human life.

While the controversy behind the use of the value of human life in risk-benefit analysis still persists, it has become not only a common practice but an expected practice.  In fact, most federal agencies actually require companies to carry our risk-benefit analysis using their predetermined values of human life.  For instance, the [[w: Food and Drug Administration |Food and Drug Administration]] requires pharmaceutical companies to conduct risk-benefit analysis on the safety of their drugs; the [[w: Environmental Protection Agency |Environmental Protection Agency]] requires chemical companies to conduct risk-benefit analysis on the extent of the effects of their air pollution.  Nowadays, the controversy behind its usage does not revolve around its ethical implications but around the precise dollar amount assigned to the human life.  The debate asks: how exactly we are to determine this monetary value?  Are some lives worth more than others?  Is the college graduate worth more than the high school drop-out?

==Further Backlash==

Future investigations would put Ford in hot water for their actions related to the Pinto. In 1974, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 301, legislation that was intended to tighten the standards for fuel system integrity in accidents, was ready to be released.  If this legislation passed, it would have necessitated a change in the Pinto design. Ford lobbied to delay this legislation and succeeded in delaying it for two years. Ford managers voted to delay a fix for new models until it was legally required.&lt;ref name=&quot;mother&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Pinto Madness | work = [[w:Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]], |author=Dowie, Mark|date=September/October, 1977 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the Grimshaw case concluded, Ford was headed back to the courtroom. An Elkart County, Indiana public prosecutor charged Ford Motor Co. with reckless homicide and criminal recklessness after three women died when their Pinto was rear-ended on the freeway. Although the charges were dropped, this was the first time ever that a company faced criminal charges in a product liability case. This is certainly indicative of the public anger at Ford's seemingly callous attitude toward its customers' safety. Mounting pressure from the public and regulatory agencies finally led to a voluntary recall in 1978.

== The Ford Pinto Myth? ==

The Ford Pinto is constantly brought up as an example of poor business ethics. However, later studies have made the claim that the case was a misunderstanding, blown out of proportion by the media. For instance, in regards to the Pinto memo, the public was lead to believe that this was an internal Ford document meant to weigh the cost of court settlement versus redesign of the Pinto. In actuality, the memo was prepared for the NHTSA to investigate the problem of fuel-system fires from rear-end impact, lateral collisions, and vehicle rollover. The memo was also not prepared only for Ford vehicle predictions, but for the cost of tort liability to be taken by all American car companies from fuel-system fires. In the Grimshaw court case the defendants lawyers knew of this, but tried to use the document as a way to show Ford's lack of concern for safety. The judge in the case ruled against admissibility, a fact that was little known to the public at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;schwartz&quot;&gt; Schwartz, G.T. (1990). The myth of the Ford Pinto case. Rutgers Law Review, 43, 1013-1068. &lt;/ref&gt; Public perception was also skewed by the ''[[w:Mother Jones (magazine) |Mother Jones]]'' article that first released the Ford Pinto memo. The article used emotional terms such as &quot;firetrap&quot;, &quot;death trap&quot;, and &quot;lethal car&quot; that, along with the Pinto Memo, left people with a distrust in the Pinto and in Ford. The ''[[w:Mother Jones (magazine) |Mother Jones]]'' article also estimated that 500 to 900 persons were killed in fires attributed to the fuel tank design. This was followed by a 60 minutes segment where they accused Ford of buying 2000 deaths and 10000 injuries because they wanted to build a cheaper car. However, a NHTSA study indicated that only 27 deaths and 24 nonfatal burn injuries were attributed to rear-end fuel tank leakages.&lt;ref name=&quot;schwartz&quot;/&gt; There was a difference between the facts and the public perception of the Ford Pinto, but Ford executives did know of a safety issue with their fuel tank design and decided against a redesign. This leaves the question, does the Ford Pinto case represent poor ethical decision making or how bad publicity can affect a company?

=Toyota Motor Corporation=
The Toyota Corporation was founded in Japan in 1937 by  Kiichiro Toyoda.  In 1972, Toyota began manufacturing operations in the United States and started full-scale vehicle production by 1986.  They have become the world's largest automaker in both production and sales, producing over 8.5 million vehicles in 2010 &lt;ref&gt; The Truth About Cars, 2011. “TTAC Announces the Top 3 Automakers of 2010.

Toyota is a publically traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and is currently valued to have a market capital of $123.33 billion &lt;ref&gt; Yahoo Finance, 2011.  “Toyota Motor Corp.”.  http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TM &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reputation==
Over the years, Toyota automaker has earned its renowned reputation as &quot;the world's best automaker&quot; by making safe and reliable transportation for billions of consumers. But this favoritism has dropped since 2009 as Toyota recalled 2.3 million vehicles spread across eight of its models due to  unintended acceleration. Erich Merkle, president of Autoconomy.com believes, &quot;People don't buy [Toyotas] for their good looks... [or] their cash-back or financing offers. They buy them because they have a lot of confidence in the quality and safety of the vehicle.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Toyota's Reputation Takes a Huge Hit&quot; http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/27/news/companies/toyota_sales_halt/index.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Toyota has won numerous awards from J.D. Power and Associates to back up these claims.  Toyota placed first among all corporations and earned 10 segment awards in 2007 in the J.D. Power and Associates Vehicle Dependability Study.  For the 13th-consecutive year, the Lexus LS Luxury Sedan was the top performing model for the industry.  The Vehicle Dependability Survey is one of many studies that indicates Toyota and Lexus quality continues to improve &lt;ref&gt; “Toyota Earns 10 JD Power Vehicle Dependability Awards” http://www.autospies.com/news/Toyota-Earns-10-JD-Power-Vehicle-Dependability-Awards-18780/ &lt;/ref&gt;.

Public opinion of Toyota’s cars are strongly positive, but the company has dealt with issues that predate the 2009 recalls.  In September 1986, Toyota was ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to recall vehicles for speed control problems &lt;ref&gt; “Toyota Recall” http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/automobile-accidents/toyota-recall-a-time-line-of-toyotas-checkered-safety-history.aspx?googleid=278022 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Toyota also settled an unintended acceleration incident internally and did not report the incident to the NHTSA until 5 years later &lt;ref&gt; “Toyota’s Safety Problems” http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1962218,00.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

=A Twofold Problem Lead to Recall=
===Sticking Accelerator===

Despite Toyota's reputation for quality and long-lasting vehicles, the company faced challenges of a sticking accelerator pedal in many 2009-2010 models. A friction problem occurred when drivers pressed the accelerator pedal under certain operating temperatures and humidity conditions&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Toyota Recall Recap: Floormats, Sticky Pedals, AND User Error&quot;, 2010. http://www.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1055164_toyota-recall-recap-floormats-sticky-pedals-and-user-error &lt;/ref&gt;. An increased friction in the accelerator pedal mechanisms caused the pedal to become &quot;harder to depress, slower to return, or, in the worst case, mechanically stuck in a partially depressed position&quot;, shown in this [http://www.statesman.com/multimedia/dynamic/00165/WEB0202toyota_brake_165262c.jpg pedal diagram]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/toyota-gas-pedal-fix-is-on-the-way-207185.html |title=Toyota: Gas pedal fix is on the way |publisher=Statesman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; MSNBC, 2010. &quot;No easy answer to why Toyota accelerators stick&quot;. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35110966/ns/business-autos/ &lt;/ref&gt;. The sticking accelerator forced Toyota to recall over 5.4 million vehicles worldwide with 2.43 million in the U.S alone. The accelerator recall cost Toyota over $2 million in losses and lawsuits. In addition to its financial costs, the foreign manufacturer risked losing its strong American trust in quality and safety.

===Floormats===
Some Toyota dealers sold unapproved floor mats that were too thick to lay properly under the accelerator pedal without rubbing against it. The depressed accelerator pedal caught underneath thick floormats, unapproved by NHTSA standards, and did not allow the pedal to return to its natural position. Thus, the partially depressed pedal rendered an unintended acceleration, causing multiple vehicle accidents and crashes.

===User Error===
While Toyota was quick to adapt the keyless technology of push-start engines to its newer models, they failed to give adequate user instructions of how to stop the engine in case of an emergency. The push-start button should be held down for three seconds, while the engine is in neutral during an emergency to shut off. However, the company neither placed any warnings on its vehicle dashboards nor included guidance in its vehicle manual, even though many users never review it. After the NHTSA released its investigations, the lack of driver instructions forced Toyota to further expand its recalls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though Toyota could have improved driver safety with more intuitive emergency operations, drivers do make mistakes. Two highly publicized cases reveal panicked drivers unintentionally pressed the accelerator pedal, instead of the brake, causing an accident because &quot;investigators found either strong indications that the driver's account of the event is inconsistent with the findings of the analysis&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Toyota Recall Recap: Floormats, Sticky Pedals, AND User Error&quot;, 2010. http://www.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1055164_toyota-recall-recap-floormats-sticky-pedals-and-user-error &lt;/ref&gt;.

=Toyota's Ethical Lessons=
===Responsiveness===
The biggest pitfall in Toyota's recall was its untimely response to its manufacturing defects. They underestimated the seriousness of the problem and lagged an effective response, which put customer's lives at risk. Although the company claimed to have made solving these issues its number one priority, Toyota management failed to give an immediate public explanation of what happened &lt;ref&gt; Kageyama, 2010. &quot;Toyota Recall Could Have Large Impact On Sales&quot;. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/02/toyota-recall-could-have_n_445531.html &lt;/ref&gt;. They ignored making any public announcements or apologies until January 21, 2010, two weeks after their last recall. Although they recommended a short-term solution where unsecured floormats should be zip-tied to its hook or removed altogether, they failed to recognize their internal issues. A better internal risk management system could have helped Toyota identify where product weaknesses could occur &lt;ref&gt; Connor, 2010. &quot;Toyota Recall: Five Critical Lessons&quot;. http://business-ethics.com/2010/01/31/2123-toyota-recall-five-critical-lessons/ &lt;/ref&gt;. They failed to understand the source of the problem immediately, despite its claims of a &quot;new standard of responsiveness&quot;. As a result of the lagged reaction to recalling defective vehicles, Toyota was held liable and fined $16.4 million.

===Responsibility===
Toyota attempted to hide using unapproved floormat thickness for over four months. However, ignoring this seemingly small problem led to greater problems for the company in the long run. Evidence was found as Toyota management &quot;bragged about saving the company $100 million because they negotiated a reduced floor mat recall&quot; &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Toyota's Legal Issues, Independent Testing, and Little Black Boxes&quot;. February, 2010. http://www.tundraheadquarters.com/blog/2010/02/23/toyotas-legal-troubles-independent-testing-and-little-black-boxes/ &lt;/ref&gt;. Toyota should have been more responsible for its brand and correcting issues when they occur immediately, despite heavy potential losses in revenue. In this case, the company was clearly at fault for not accepting immediate responsibility for its ignorance in the sticking accelerator case.

===Ownership===
Despite Toyota's poor decision to put revenue ahead of customer safety, one of the company's strengths is accepting ownership of their failures. After recognizing their technical issues, Mike Michels, a Toyota spokesman, stated during a New York Times interview, &quot;I don’t want to get into any kind of a disagreement with CTS. Our position on suppliers has always been that Toyota is responsible for their cars” &lt;ref&gt; Connor, 2010. &quot;Toyota Recall: Five Critical Lessons&quot;. http://business-ethics.com/2010/01/31/2123-toyota-recall-five-critical-lessons/ &lt;/ref&gt;. They acknowledged their failure in resolving braking issues quickly and efficiently.
&lt;br /&gt;
After facing enormous negative publicity, Toyota proved its claim that its anti-braking software and electronic throttle controls were safe. US regulators and independent testing from Exponent reported electronic flaws in its throttle system were not to blame for reports of sudden, unintended acceleration and floor mat issues&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Toyota's Legal Issues, Independent Testing, and Little Black Boxes&quot;. February, 2010. http://www.tundraheadquarters.com/blog/2010/02/23/toyotas-legal-troubles-independent-testing-and-little-black-boxes/ &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, 2011. &quot;Toyota recalls 2.17 million vehicles in U.S.&quot; http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/02/24/article/toyota_recalls_217_million_vehicles_in_us &lt;/ref&gt;. This independent analysis validated Toyota's claim for safety, which helped customers regain a sense of trust in the brand.

=Involved Individuals with Ethical Dilemmas=

===Akio Toyoda and Toyota's Changing Business Strategy===
As CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation, Akio Toyoda can be held responsible for Toyota's change in business strategy, from prioritizing safety to prioritizing profits.  Akio claims they could not train their employees fast enough to reflect their historic standards of quality and excellence, which lead to their safety breakdown &lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, 2010. &quot;Toyota:  We grew too fast&quot;. http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/169480/toyota-we-grew-too-fast &lt;/ref&gt;.  Professor Ed Hess at the University of Virgina agrees, saying, &quot;[Fast growth] can create serious business risks that if not properly managed can dilute a company's brand and destroy its value&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Reliable Plant, 2010. &quot;What Every Business Can Learn From Toyota's Fall&quot;. http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/23530/Businesses-can-learn-from-Toyota &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

Toyota's strategy change is the reason they hid knowledge of floor mat pedal entrapment issues from the public in order to maintain sales.  In fact, it is illegal for an automaker to withhold defect information from the public for more than five days after the discovery of a flaw is made &lt;ref&gt;Bibeka Shrestha, 2010. &quot;Toyota To Pay $32.4M Over Defect Report Delays&quot;. http://www.law360.com/topnews/articles/216521/toyota-to-pay-32-4m-over-defect-report-delays &lt;/ref&gt;. The ultimate result of Toyota's heel dragging was a fine of $16.4 million from the NHTSA, the highest ever levied by the department &lt;ref&gt;CBS.com, 2010. &quot;Toyota Won't Contest $16.4 Million Civil Fine&quot;. http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/18/business/main6409394.shtml &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

This aspect of the Toyota recall analysis is very similar to the case of the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003.  At that time, NASA had a very similar change in business structure.  Their historic mantra of &quot;If its not safe, say so&quot;, while still in effect, became overshadowed by a new motto of &quot;Faster, Better, Cheaper&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Keith Cowing, 2003. &quot;NASA Responds to the Columbia Accident Report: Farewell to Faster - Better - Cheaper&quot;. http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=864 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;NASA, 2011. &quot;NASA Safety and Hazard Reporting&quot;. http://www.nasa.gov/audience/safety/reporting/Safety_reporting.html &lt;/ref&gt;. This change in priorities reflects a time where NASA tried to maximize its budget, rather than the safety of its astronauts.  NASA's new internal structure can be seen as a large contributor to the hostile environment that kept Rodney Rocha, an employee who knew of the potential flaw, from sending an email to alert the people who would have the power to stop the shuttle reentry &lt;ref&gt;Rodney Rocha, 2003. &quot;RE:  STS-107 Wing Debirs Impact, Request for Outside Photo-Imaging Help&quot;. http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/2706main_COL_rocha_email_030122.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Both the Columbia and Toyota cases show that loss of life and significant damage to property can happen when safety is neglected as the most important company policy.

===Yoshimi Inaba===
Yoshimi Inaba, president of the North American Toyota division, received a memo categorizing a negotiated recall saving Toyota $100 million as a “win” for the company &lt;ref&gt;Toyota Washington DC, 2009. &quot;Toyota Washington DC&quot;. http://www.beasleyallen.com/newsfiles/Toyota%20Memo-Toyota-Wins.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. These savings resulted in an increased risk for consumers whose cars were not included in the negotiated recall.  The decision outlined in the memo is very similar to the Ford Pinto debacle of 1977, where Ford saved money by taking a risk that ultimately killed many people &lt;ref&gt;Jim Motavalli, 2010. &quot;At the Toyota Hearing, Remembering the Pinto&quot;. http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/at-the-toyota-hearing-remembering-the-pinto/ &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

Both Toyota and Ford received a lot of criticism from the public for their decisions valuing financial gain over human lives. Most critics agree it is an atrocious act for a company to place a value human life, and place profit above customer safety &lt;ref&gt;Kurt Niland, 2010. &quot;Toyota's cost-savings memo valued money over life&quot;. http://www.beasleyallen.com/news/Toyota%27s-cost-savings-memo-valued-money-over-life/ &lt;/ref&gt;.  However, Professor Kip Viscuchi of Harvard College and Professor Ted Gayer of Georgetown University disagree. They argue the average value of a statistical life is $6 million &lt;ref name=&quot;V+G&quot;&gt;Kip Viscusi and Ted Gayer, 2002. &quot;Safety at Any Price?&quot;. https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/8baddf16-2bb8-412e-9b77-4dcd7b770231/11.Viscusi-Gayer.Safety-at-Any-Price.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

Using the average statistical value for a human life, the $100 million saved by Toyota is equal to over 16 lives saved.  Toyota was faced with the dilemma to spend the money and possibly save lives, or save it and risk people dying.  The ethical decision becomes more complicated when the ultimate use of the saved $100 million comes into consideration.  If the money used to develop advanced air bags is ultimately saving thousands of human lives, is it ethical for Toyota to knowingly take actions that would lead to the death of a few individuals?  If Toyota knew for sure that only one person would die from their $100 million savings, would it be ethical for them to knowingly commit that person to death just to save $100 million?&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is still unclear what the unquestionable factors that caused the explosion on Deepwater Horizon are. Yet this event brings to light many flaws in professionalism. A few factors will be touched on that may have influenced the explosion.  More importantly, these factors will give a glimpse into the unethical rational of the ''professionals'' involved and let you, as the reader, decide whether you define this incident as a mere accident or a failure to act in a professional manner. &lt;br /&gt;

The objective of oil companies is to locate and extract [[w:hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] or fossil fuel miles within the earth.  Particularly over water, large vessels known as deep sea [[w:Semi-submersible|semi-submersibles]] are sent to tap into this hydrocarbon filled rock miles below the seafloor known as ''payzones.'' The $560 million &lt;ref&gt; Offshore-Technology.com. (May 7th, 2010). ''Deepwater Horizon: A Timeline of Events.'' &lt;retrieved from http://www.offshore-technology.com/features/feature84446/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; semi-submersible drilling rig named [[w:Deepwater_Horizon|Deepwater Horizon]], contracted by [[w:Bp|BP]] and owned by [[w:Transocean|Transocean]], was sent in late January 2010 to drill the [[w:Macondo_well|Macondo well]] in the Gulf of Mexico &lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.

[[File:Mobile-offshore-drilling-unit.gif|thumb|Deep sea semi-submersible]]

==The Explosion==
Drilling for oil is a delicate and dangerous process because of the high pressure in these ''payzones.''  This business of drilling utilizes mud, steel casings, and cement to create an equilibrium without releasing the high pressure within the earth. As a path is drilled, pipe is used to transport high density mud to counter balance the high pressures within the earth.  If the weight of the mud is too low, oil and pressure can enter the pipe and cause a ''kick'' and potentially destroy all the drilling equipment used.  If the weight of the mud is too high, the mud pressure may fracture the ''payzone'' and the oil will be irretrievable.  Steel casings are used to line the well hole for stability. Devices called centralizers are used to keep the casings in place. The whole system is sealed with cement to prevent fluid and pressure leakage.  Continuous readings of the pressures and volumes of fluid in the system are monitored. In an emergency, especially if the pressure is too high, the crew drilling can shut off the well and sever the connection to the rig via a [[w:Blowout_preventer|blowout preventer]] before a disaster ensues. &lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire.jpg|thumb|left|Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire]]

Deepwater Horizon struck their intended ''payzone'' but unfortunately the pressure of the mud fractured the area around the hydrocarbon filled rock. The new plan was to pump the area with high viscous fluid in hopes to seal the fracture, then to install a final steel casing for future oil and gas extraction.  The final casing was placed and stabilized with centralizers and cemented by [[w:Halliburton|Halliburton]] subcontractor. &lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

On April 20th, 2010 between 9:40 pm and 9:43pm evidence of a kick occurred when mud spewed from the rotary onto the rig deck &lt;ref&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Testimony of Randy Ezell.''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. At 9:49 the first explosion occurred on Deepwater Horizon. A Transocean representative, during government hearings, compared the explosion to “a 550-ton freight train hitting the rig floor,” followed by what he described as “a jet engine’s worth of gas coming out of the rotary” &lt;ref&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Testimony of Bill Ambrose.'' Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;

After this initial explosion, the crew immediately tried to seal the well however their control of the blow out preventer failed &lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;/&gt;.  The following moments included more explosions and eventually led to 11 deaths, 17 injuries &lt;ref&gt; Welch, William. (May 25th, 2010). USA Today. ''Memorial service honors 11 dead oil rig workers.'' Retrieved from &lt; http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-25-oil-spill-victims-memorial_N.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, and after months of leakage from the Macondo well, 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf &lt;ref&gt; Hoch, Maureen.

Retrieved from &lt;http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/08/new-estimate-puts-oil-leak-at-49-million-barrels.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Negative Pressure Test Overlooked==
A negative-pressure test is a measure of checking the strength of the cement seal.  Hours before the explosion, a negative-pressure test was performed and there was evidence of fluid buildup and increased pressure in the well.  However, the drilling crew continued on with their routine even though there was a clear sign of danger &lt;ref name=&quot;national academy&quot;&gt; National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. (November 16th, 2010). ''Interim Report on Causes of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig Blowout and Ways to Prevent Such Events.'' Retrieved from &lt;http://www.nationalacademies.org/includes/DH_Interim_Report_final.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Were the individuals responsible in monitoring the pressures trained correctly in determining the readings displayed by a negative-pressure test? While it may still be unclear, it is certain that if the crew was aware of the warning signs from this test, the well could have been shut down in time and the disaster fully prevented. &lt;br /&gt;

==Decision to Use Fewer Centralizers==

One possible source of the explosion comes from the inadequate use of centralizers.  Centralizers are key components in ensuring a good cement job; they help keep the steel casings centered when cementing a solid barrier &lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling.''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  BP contacted their supplier, Weatherford, for more centralizers in order to plug their well for future oil production.  Their original design called for sixteen centralizers&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-CEC 8848-58) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;, but on April 1, Weatherford had only six “sub” centralizers in stock&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-MBI 129238-39) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The alternative to using “sub” centralizers was to use “slip on” centralizers.  These would slide onto the casing, rather than screw in like the “subs”.  The BP team leader, John Guide, was not in favor of using these because they risk catching on other equipment while the casing is lowered&lt;ref&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Interview of John Guide.''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;



BP made no effort to request new modeling from Halliburton to predict the effect of using only six centralizers, nor did they inform them of their decision&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-MBI 128489) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;.  One Halliburton engineer, Jesse Gagliano, happened to overhear a discussion on the rig concerning the use of only six centralizers&lt;ref&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Testimony of Jesse Gagliano''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  He ran computer simulations using proprietary modeling software, which led him to conclude that they would need more than six centralizers to prevent leakage of pressure and fluid&lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling.''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

Gagliano went to BP with this information on April 15&lt;ref&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Testimony of Jesse Gagliano''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  With John Guide not present, drilling engineer, Gregory Walz, ordered fifteen additional “slip on” centralizers, which was the most they could immediately obtain from Weatherford&lt;ref name=&quot;commission&quot;&gt; National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). ''Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling.''  Retrieved from &lt;http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Gagliano reconfirmed that using fifteen additional centralizers along with the original six would provide greater protection from leakage.  Walz emailed John Guide, telling him they should honor Gagliano’s model and use the “slip on's” despite Guide's concern with them.  Also, he ensured that these centralizers were custom built for a previous BP rig; therefore, it was a safe option&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-CEC 22433) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

When the “slip on” centralizers arrived, BP engineer Brian Morel identified them as being conventionally designed instead of custom built like they expected.  Morel voiced his concern about this in an email to BP Operations Drilling Engineer Brett Cocales, where he questioned the need for the additional centralizers&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-MBI 128379) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Cocales disagreed with his opinion, but ended by saying: “But, who cares, it’s done, end of story, [we] will probably be fine and we’ll get a good cement job. I would rather have to squeeze [remediate the cement job] than get stuck above the WH [wellhead]&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-CEC 22669) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;.  John Guide also identified the centralizers as being the wrong type.  The last minute addition of these centralizers concerned him and he ultimately decided to use only six&lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-CEC 22433) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

The BP investigation reported that the 15 additional “slip on's” were in fact the custom built type they had ordered, and the team had mistaken them for the wrong kind.  To this day, there are conflicting accounts from BP whether they were or were not the correct type&lt;ref&gt; BP. (September 8th, 2010). ''Deepwater Horizon Accident Investigation Report.'' Retrieved from &lt;http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/incident_response/STAGING/local_assets/downloads_pdfs/Deepwater_Horizon_Accident_Investigation_Report.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

If BP had sought help from Halliburton, rather than waiting for them to catch one of their mistakes, they could have determined whether additional centralizers would be needed.  They could have then based their decision on a full examination of potential risks, so they could order the correct number and type of centralizers needed.  Instead, they were stuck making a misguided last minute decision.   It is uncertain whether the failure to use six instead of an additional fifteen centralizers was a direct cause of the blowout, but the process BP took to arrive at the decision to use only six shows some of the critical flaws in their management, as well as poor communication practices between BP and Halliburton. &lt;br /&gt;

==Mismanagement==
Choices made by management leading up to the explosion played a role in the safety and integrity of Deepwater Horizon.  In management, some decisions have to be made for safety reasons which may compromise other technical functions.  Some compromising decisions had unclear motivations, and some decisions were made with insufficient resources. &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Minerals management service seal.PNG|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Minerals Management Service]]


[[w: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement|The Mineral Management Service]] (MMS) is a federal agency who is responsible for leasing, safety and environmental compliance with offshore drilling.  They approve drilling permits and inspect drilling rigs.  There is evidence that they were more relaxed in regulations in cases including the Deepwater Horizon.  One example of mismanagement occurred when there were more applications coming in for drilling than there were engineers qualified to approve them.  So the MMS hired engineers who would be willing to approve the overload of applications coming in.  However, MMS did not have specific qualification requirements for the engineers.  &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Department of the Interior, Outer Continental Shelf Safety Oversight Board. (September 1, 2010). ''Report to the Secretary of the Interior.'' Retrieved from &lt;http://www.noia.org/website/download.asp?id=40069&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

Many regulations promote safety in design and maintenance of offshore drilling rigs.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Oil Spill Response Plans are a couple examples of regulation which require vessels to have plans set up in worst-case-scenario situations. &lt;ref&gt;  &quot;What information must I include in the “Emergency response action plan” section?&quot; 30 C.F.R. § 254.23 &lt;/ref&gt;   When looking back through reports, BP did not use the required detail to show real preparation in a worst-case-scenario situation, and MMS did not challenge it, inspect the rig appropriately, or have the capacity for running high risk analysis on the report. &lt;ref &gt; The Response Group on behalf of BP, &quot;Regional Oil Spill Response Plan-Gulf of Mexico&quot; (June 30, 2009), App. H: 5, 17, 
and 32 Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  

There were instances in the months leading up to the explosion that management decisions were made which may have compromised the integrity of the full operation as well as in compromising the effectiveness of the project in order to provide more safety.  In drilling, BP had a goal of reaching 20,200 feet &lt;ref&gt;  Internal BP document (BP-HZN-MBI 126338)Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt;, but stopped at 18,360 due to issues of well integrity and safety. The Transocean crew made a judgment call when determining whether the mud circulation pressure they found was valid.  The drilling mud subcontractor determined that 570 pounds per square inch (psi) would be required and the crew reading only obtained 340 psi.  In testing a different circulating pump they determined the gauge was broken.  It is unclear as to exactly why they decided this value was due to a broken gauge. &lt;ref &gt; Internal BP documents (BP-HZN-MBI 137367, 21304) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

BP made compromises on different issues, taking risks in some areas to provide safety in others.  Another example is when they decided to reduce the amount of cement they pumped into the well to reduce the pressure on the well.  The amount they pumped provided for a column 500 feet above the ''payzone'', even though their own requirements called for the column to reach 1000 feet above.  The purpose of the cement is to reduce contamination risk such as leakage and helps protect against placement errors. &lt;ref &gt;  30 C.F.R. § 250.421 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Internal BP document (BP-HZN-MBI 193549) Referenced in National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. (January 11th, 2011). Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

==Conclusion==

Drilling for oil is a complex system. Many parties are involved and must interact efficiently in order to accomplish their goals in a safe and efficient manner. Management failed in their abilities to prevent such a disaster as shown by all this evidence. The negative-pressure test was clearly overlooked. If guidelines and protocol were enacted for pressure testing this disaster would not have occurred. The decision to use too few centralizers conveys the quick decision of leadership without taking the time to look into every scenario. This could have very well contributed to the high pressure build-up and cement failure. Finally, the broader management of oil companies via government organizations became lax in enforcing safety regulations. This may have caused a trickledown effect which ultimately led the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Can future disasters in complex systems be prevented after examining this event? Yes they can as long as professionals in management do not let factors sway them away from making ethically rational decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This chapter will detail various angles of the response to the 1982 Chicago area Tylenol poisonings. This unprovoked, seemingly random event sparked major public alarm and a public relations nightmare for [[w:Johnson &amp; Johnson|Johnson &amp; Johnson]], the maker of [[w:Tylenol|Tylenol]]. The focus will be on the public's, Johnson &amp; Johnson's, and the government's response to the murders and how each led to new legislation and safety precautions aimed at protecting American citizens.

=Overview=

==Johnson &amp; Johnson At-a-Glance==
At the time of the 1982 Chicago area Tylenol killings, Johnson &amp; Johnson owned Tylenol, the most successful over the counter drug product in the United States. Tylenol had over 100 million users and outsold [[w:Anacin|Anacin]], [[w:Bayer|Bayer]], [[w:Aspirin|Bufferin]], and [[w:Excedrin|Excedrin]] combined&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot;&gt;http://www.ou.edu/deptcomm/dodjcc/groups/02C2/Johnson%20&amp;%20Johnson.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and accounted for over 15% of J&amp;J's profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraudMarketing&quot; /&gt;

==Timeline==
On September 29, 1982, 12 year old Mary Kellerman died from taking one Extra Strength Tylenol capsule after waking up sick. That same morning, Adam Janus took Tylenol and died shortly thereafter. To cope with their grief, Adam’s brother, Stanley, and sister-in-law, Theresa, ingested Tylenol from Adam’s bathroom, both dying within 48 hours. Soon, tampered Tylenol would claim the lives of Mary Reiner, Paula Prince, and Mary McFarland, bringing the total death toll to 7 innocent Chicagoans.

==Potassium Cyanide==
An immediate investigation was launched after two firefighters called in to report a possible connection between the deaths and Tylenol, having heard numerous radio reports detailing the incidents.

Tests showed that the victims had unknowingly ingested Extra Strength Tylenol capsules laced with [[w:Potassium cyanide|potassium cyanide]] (KCN). KCN is an odorless, colorless substance that looks much like regular granulated salt. However, KCN can cause death within 45 minutes of exposure, commonly from cardiac arrest which most of the victims experienced.

Later reports said that the killer took several bottles of Tylenol off various drug store shelves, emptied the [[w:Paracetamol|acetaminophen]] (the active ingredient in Tylenol) out of some capsules, filled them with KCN, and replaced the bottles back on the shelves. The killer used 65mg in each tainted capsule—10,000 times the needed dose to kill a human being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aero&quot;&gt;http://www.aerobiologicalengineering.com/wxk116/TylenolMurders/crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Thomas Kim, a physician working in the Chicago area at the time:

&lt;blockquote&gt; “The victims never had a chance. Death was certain within minutes”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922991,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=Media Attention/Public Reaction=
The national media focused intensely on the Tylenol murders, working it initially as deaths of American citizens by a trusted consumer product.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot; /&gt; ABC, NBC, and CBS all led their broadcasts with the Tylenol story. More than 100,000 new stories ran in newspapers and on television. TV coverage, throughout the crisis, would continue to emphasize the deaths related to the story until more information was relayed to the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot; /&gt;
	
The public listened to media reports and J&amp;J press conferences and returned Tylenol bottles to police stations and drug stores, or else discarded them at home. The intense media attention caused nationwide panic. Several Chicago area hospitals received hundreds of phone calls about possible poisonings, with one logging 700 calls in one day. One doctor went as far to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If it was going to be a lethal dose, you wouldn't have time to call&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=Johnson &amp; Johnson's Reaction=
Johnson &amp; Johnson found itself in a very difficult position. One of its leading products killed seven people in a very concentrated area. The company had never established a permanent public relations division other than advertising and marketing. With quick thinking and help from police and the FDA, J&amp;J made several brand-saving decisions in just weeks of the start of the crisis.

On October 5, 1982, seven days after the first reported death, Johnson &amp; Johnson issued a nationwide recall of all Tylenol Extra Strength capsules.  This included over 31 million bottles at an estimated retail value of over $100 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aero&quot; /&gt;  Their market share collapsed practically overnight from 35% down to 8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraud&quot; /&gt;  But by making this decision, Johnson &amp; Johnson showed that they were not willing to take any risks with the public’s safety, even if it cost them millions of dollars.

In the days following the first death, J&amp;J set up two 1-800 hotlines to deal with the massive panic and interest. One was set up for the general public for answering questions and fielding concerns of Tylenol users. The other was for news organizations that used a daily pre-recorded message with updated statements from the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berge&quot;&gt;Berge, T. (1990). The First 24-Hours. Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; CEO [[w:James E. Burke|James Burke]] worked the national newsmagazines like 60 minutes and talk shows like The Phil Donahue Show to reach Americans efficiently.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot; /&gt; Using TV allows the public to put a face to the problem, allowing J&amp;J to shorten the distance some perceived J&amp;J was putting between the company and the crisis. 

In the weeks that followed, Johnson &amp; Johnson continued making the good decisions working towards recovery.  They worked closely with the Chicago Police Department, FBI, and [[w:Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to find suspects.  Customers were able to exchange Tylenol capsules for caplets, which are more difficult to tamper with.  On November 11, 1982, Tylenol was reintroduced with a new, triple-sealed package. Tylenol became the first product in the industry to use a tamper resistant packaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot; /&gt;  This new sealing design made it nearly impossible for someone to tamper with the contents without being noticed.  

They also coupled this recovery effort with heavy ad campaigns and price promotions where you could save up to $2.50 per bottle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aero&quot; /&gt; Television and newspaper advertisements proclaimed Tylenol as a brand you can “trust.” In less than a year, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s market share had increased back up to 29%.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraudMarketing&quot;&gt;http://americanfraud.com/marketingtylenol.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Within several years, Tylenol had once again become the most popular over-the-counter analgesic in the U.S.

Johnson &amp; Johnson was able to remain in a positive light with the media and maintain great public relations with its swift actions.  They continued to make improvements in quality control. Along with the tamper resistant packaging, J&amp;J developed new random inspection procedures before the shipment of Tylenol to retailers. The Washington Post reported that, “Johnson &amp; Johnson has effectively demonstrated how a major business ought to handle a disaster”.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;Knight, Jerry. (1982). Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s quick and effective decision-making skills, it gained one of the best reputations for safety and public wellbeing of any company out there today. Stephen Greyser of Harvard Business School said about the management of the crisis:

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;It's been about as effective a rescue job as I've ever seen in marketing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraudMarketing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Johnson &amp; Johnson seemed to show a perfect example of how businesses should professionally and ethically react to crises.  They placed human lives above profit and focused on long term sustainability.  Johnson &amp; Johnson quickly recalled Tylenol bottles and notified the public sufficiently to prevent further poisonings.  Seeming to not be influenced by cost benefit analysis, Johnson &amp; Johnson made the largest recall ever in the drug industry.  A recall of this size and Johnson &amp; Johnson's willingness to publicize the crisis proves their commitment to prioritizing human lives over profits.  Johnson &amp; Johnson's thorough reaction to the crisis cost incredibly high amounts of short term profits, but their thorough response allowed consumer confidence to reemerge and sustain long term profitability.

=Government Response=

The government responded to this tragedy with three goals in mind.  The first set out to remove all contaminated bottles still in stores and homes.  Second, they wanted to capture the murderer.  Third, and most importantly, they wanted to prevent future &quot;copy cat&quot; murderers.

The [[w:Food_and_Drug_Administration|FDA]] worked with Johnson &amp; Johnson to successfully remove contaminated products from store shelves and in homes.  Once local authorities and Johnson &amp; Johnson found a connection between the murders and  Tylenol the FDA worked with Johnson &amp; Johnson to investigate Tylenol bottles sold in nearby stores.  The investigation found 3 contaminated bottles, prompting the FDA and Johnson &amp; Johnson to issue a total recall of Tylenol across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;



The [[w:Fbi|FBI]] and local police worked with Johnson &amp; Johnson to capture the murderer by implementing a nationwide manhunt.  Handcuffed by few leads, the FBI investigated two primary suspects and a half a dozen secondary suspects.  James H. Lewis became a primary suspect when he sent a hand written letter of extortion to Johnson &amp; Johnson.  He demanded Johnson &amp; Johnson wire $1 million to a specified bank account if they wanted the Tylenol poisonings to stop.  Johnson &amp; Johnson immediately reported the letter to police instead of paying the $1 million to Lewis.  The FBI searched for an evasive Lewis.  After two months of searching, they found him residing in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraudMarketing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewis was sentenced to 20 years for extortion, but prosecutors could not convict him for the Tylenol murders.  Roger Arnold became the second primary suspect when reports surface that he had been telling Chicago tavern owners stories about killing people with cyanide.  Police found a slew of weapons when arresting Arnold including chemistry books.  One chemistry book, entitled “The Poor Man's James Bond,” explained how to poison a person with cyanide capsules.  Arnold also worked in a Jewel Repackaging Factory that packaged Tylenol in Chicago for thirteen years.  However, Arnold was never convinced for the Tylenol murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraud&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigation is ongoing, but has not produced a murderer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aero&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed the Tylenol Bill in May of 1983 to prevent future copy cat murderers.  The bill made tampering with packaged products a federal offense.&lt;ref name=&quot;eightiesclub&quot;&gt;http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id298.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The FDA also implemented new tamper resistant packaging regulations.  The FDA required drug products contain a distinctive barrier to entry.  Additionally, the FDA required each drug container to have a label explaining how the barrier to entry works.  The two new regulations allowed users to easily tell if the drug container has been opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot;&gt;http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/tylenol_murders/4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Instantiation of the Tylenol Bill and new FDA regulations sparks an interesting ethical debate.  The debate raises two questions.  1.  Does the government have a responsibility to regulate product packaging?  2.  Is government regulation of product packaging a necessary infringement on free market principles?  Government is responsible for protecting its citizens from enemy states and terrorists.  Those who tamper with manufactured products seem to be targeting the general civilian public.  Moreover, they seem to increase public fear and harm civilians.  Intentions to create fear and harm among the general public fall well within the definition of terrorists.  Therefore, the government is responsible for protecting its citizens from package tampering terrorists.  Protection of citizens from terrorist threats is a necessary infringement on free market principles.

=Present Day=
During the crisis, the Illinois Attorney General, Tyrone Fahner, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; “We’ll get him one way or the other. Even nuts make mistakes. And if it’s some sort of screwball cult, they’ll turn on each other for the money”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraud&quot;&gt;http://americanfraud.com/1982tylenolmurders.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, the case remains unsolved after more than 28 years. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s offer of a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the Tylenol killer is still on the table. As previously stated, several men were convicted of crimes related to the Tylenol murders, but not for the murders themselves. 

Though in 2009, the FBI case related to Tylenol poisonings was re-opened. The Chicago bureau of the FBI searched James Lewis’s home in Cambridge, Massachusetts and seized several boxes worth of evidence and an old-style Macintosh computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;TribuneFeb&quot;&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-tylenol-probe-06-feb06,0,4057633.story&lt;/ref&gt; According to an FBI statement, it was “conducting a complete review of all evidence…prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity”.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/us/05tylenol.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in a further sign that investigators were still pushing to solve the case, James Lewis was ordered to provide fingerprint and DNA samples to authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;TribuneJan&quot;&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-tylenol-suspectjan10,0,6771029.story&lt;/ref&gt;

=Conclusion=
This case teaches valuable lessons about ethical responsibilities of corporations and the government.  Johnson &amp; Johnson display a good example of how corporations should respond to a crisis.  They are ethically responsible for putting the safety of their stakeholders before profits.  Putting the safety of their stakeholders before profits may reduce short term profits but will likely ensure long term prosperity.  The government has a duty to protect its citizens from terrorists.  This case is an exceptional model of how corporations and government should work together to preserve the safety of the general public.

==Introduction==
This chapter will explore professional ethics by analyzing the actions of '''Sherron Watkins''' during the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal Enron Scandal].  It will address the actions of Enron executives during the period leading up to the collapse and discuss the role of Sherron Watkins in uncovering the scandal.  In particular, we will show that Watkins's actions triggered the chain of events that led to the collapse of Enron.  We will also investigate whether Watkins could have done more than she did or if she was simply acting in her own self-interest.  By investigating this case, we intend to dissect the complex nature of how to act in compromising situations that may arise at work, thereby providing professionals an example to follow if they encounter a similar situation.

==Background: Enron Corporation==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron Enron] is one of the most infamous corporations in history.  The company defrauded investors and employees of $14 billion while top executives exercised stock options exceeding $115 million&lt;ref name=&quot;SGITR&quot;&gt; The Smartest Guys in the Room. Dir. Alex Gibney. (2005). Jigsaw, 2929 Productions. DVD&lt;/ref&gt;. In its prime, Fortune named Enron the most innovative company for 6 consecutive years&lt;ref name=&quot;innovative&quot;&gt;&quot;Enron Named Most Innovative for Sixth Year&quot;. Enron Corporation. 29 April 2011. http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/examples.enron.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, to disguise the true financial condition of the company, top executives used aggressive accounting practices (fraud), special purpose entities, and falsified financial reporting. This ultimately led to the collapse of Enron, resulting in the world’s biggest bankruptcy at the time&lt;ref name=&quot;SGITR&quot;/&gt;.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Lay Kenneth Lay], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling Jeffrey Skilling], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fastow Andrew Fastow] were the three main conspirators in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Scandal Enron scandal]. Kenneth Lay was the founder and CEO, until hiring Jeffrey Skilling to take over.  Andrew Fastow, the CFO, created and managed several [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_purpose_entity special purpose entities] which allowed Enron to isolate financial risk of its specialized assets. A special purpose entity (SPE) is a limited company or partnership that is created to accomplish specific or short-term objectives. Among the largest SPEs Fastow created was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LJM_%28Lea_Jeffrey_Michael%29 LJM].  All transactions between Enron and LJM ensured that certain assets were not reported on Enron financial statements &lt;ref name=&quot;SGITR&quot;/&gt;. The debt sustained in LJM investments was transferred to four new SPE’s named Raptor I-IV. In court, it would be revealed that Raptor SPE’s resulted in $1.2 billion reduction in Enron’s shareholder equity&lt;ref name=&quot;Velociraptors&quot;&gt;Flood, Mary.

==Sherron Watkins==
Sherron Watkins has been a certified public accountant since 1983 and holds a masters degree in professional accounting. &lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins Testimony&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/107/hearings/02142002Hearing489/watkins.pdf | title=Watkins, S. (2002).  Prepared Witness Testimony: Watkins, Sherron.  The House Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career at Arthur Anderson in 1982, then worked at MG Trade Finance from 1990 to 1993. She began working for Enron in 1993, and in 2001, became Vice President of Corporate Development, working directly for Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. While working for Fastow, Watkins reviewed the assets Enron considered selling.  She discovered that a number of Enron's assets were hedged with the Raptor SPE, which was set to have a shortfall, leading to its inability to cover the $700 million she believed it owed Enron.



====The Facts====
On August 14, 2001, CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned. Chairman Kenneth Lay became the CEO and called an all-employee meeting on August 16 to address Skilling's resignation. In response to a request for questions to discuss at that meeting, Watkins submitted an [http://energycommerce.house.gov/107/hearings/02142002Hearing489/tab11.pdf anonymous memo] to Lay, detailing her concerns about the accounting problems facing Enron. &lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins Testimony&quot; /&gt; At the meeting, Lay urged any employee troubled by Enron’s practices to contact top management.  Watkins subsequently consulted Cindy Olson, a member of Enron's top management, to discuss the memo submitted to Lay.  Afterward, Olson encouraged Watkins to meet with Lay.

Watkins and Lay met for just over half an hour on August 22. Watkins had prepared five memos totaling seven pages in length that outlined the problems facing the company. Additionally, she provided an analysis of Raptor’s economics and a risk assessment and control group presentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins Testimony&quot; /&gt; After their meeting, Lay assured Watkins that he would look into her concerns. Then Watkins returned to work and never brought her concerns to public attention. The memos she presented to Lay were made public in January of 2002 during the Congressional investigation of Enron.

====Whistleblower?====
After learning of Watkins's memos, TIME magazine made Watkins its person of the week on January 18, 2002. She was commended for her &quot;pull-no punches, put-it-on record&quot; letter. &lt;ref name=&quot;TIME person of week&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,194927,00.html | title=Pellegrini, F. (2002).  Person of the Week: 'Enron Whistleblower' Sherron Watkins.  TIME.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2002, following the fallout from the Enron scandal, TIME magazine anointed Watkins one of its 2002 persons of the year. In the article entitled &quot;Persons of the Year 2002: The Whistleblowers&quot;, TIME lauded her courage in bringing her concerns to the CEO of Enron and starting the investigation that led to the downfall of Enron. TIME praised her as a woman &quot;of ordinary demeanor but exceptional guts and sense&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;TIME 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003998-1,00.html
 |title=Lacayo, R. &amp; Ripley A. (2002).  Persons of The Year 2002: The Whistleblowers. TIME.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they said she &quot;did right just by doing [her job] rightly, which means ferociously, with eyes open and with bravery the rest of us hope we have and may never know if we do&quot;.  &lt;ref name=&quot;TIME 2002&quot; /&gt;

====Or not?====
However, not all the media response was favorable. In the TIME article that named her person of the week the author notes “Watkins never really blew a whistle&quot; and argues a whistleblower would have made the letter public long before August 2001. &lt;ref name=&quot;TIME person of week&quot; /&gt;  Forbes released a much more critical article titled: Sherron Watkins Had Whistle, But Blew It.  Far from anointing her a whistleblower, the author likened Watkins actions to a bystander in a bank robbery telling the robber to “stop robbing the bank” while providing him with “ways to avoid getting caught”. &lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/2002/02/14/0214watkins.html | title=Ackman, D. (2002). Sherron Watkins Had Whistle But Blew It. Forbes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lay claimed to know nothing of Skilling’s and Fastow’s actions, but should Watkins have believed him?

==Analysis of Actions==

====Enron====
Lay, after consulting general counsel, decided Enron should retain an outside law firm to conduct an investigation into Watkins’s concerns. They selected [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinson_and_Elkins Vinson &amp; Elkins (V&amp;E)], assisted by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen Arthur Andersen], to lead the effort&lt;ref name=&quot;Investigation 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/wsj/docs/enron/sicreport/index.html
 |title=Powers, W. (2002).  Enron Special Investigation Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both of these groups, however, had been involved in Enron’s dealings, including the SPEs Watkins was questioning&lt;ref name=&quot;House Committee&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/107/action/107-89.pdf
 |title=Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (2002).  The Financial Collapse of Enron Part 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. For this reason Watkins specifically asked Lay that V&amp;E not conduct this investigation&lt;ref name=&quot;House Committee&quot;/&gt;. Despite this clear conflict of interest, Lay and Enron’s General Counsel went ahead with the selection. They believed “V&amp;E would be able to conduct an investigation more quickly than another firm, and would be able to follow the road map Watkins had provided” &lt;ref name=&quot;Investigation 2002&quot;/&gt; due to its familiarity with Enron matters.

Further hindering the investigation was its severely limited scope. It was determined V&amp;E’s review would not include questioning the accounting treatment and advice from Arthur Anderson, or a detailed review of individual transactions&lt;ref name=&quot;Investigation 2002&quot;/&gt;. The specific issues Watkins brought to Lay were not going to be investigated. The results of the investigation were, therefore, largely predetermined by its scope and nature. The groups who helped create Enron’s accounting schemes were now being asked to critique themselves. It is not surprising that V&amp;E concluded the facts revealed in this preliminary review did not warrant a further widespread investigation by independent counsel or auditors. Both V&amp;E and Arthur Anderson had strong motivations to keep Enron operating business as usual. As Gerstein notes, Arthur Anderson was heavily reliant on income from the Enron account&lt;ref name=&quot;Disaster&quot;&gt; Gerstein, M. (2008). Flirting with Disaster: Why accidents are rarely accidental.&lt;/ref&gt;. These companies were, therefore, not likely to report on any malfeasance which occurred under their watch.

Not everyone at Enron, however, was as receptive to Watkins’ concerns. Upon learning of her memo and meeting with Kenneth Lay, Andrew Fastow requested Watkins be terminated and wanted her computer seized&lt;ref name=&quot;House Committee&quot;/&gt;. As Fastow created and managed the LJM entities, he had significant personal motivations to protect them. He almost certainly knew he would be implicated if a formal investigation was conducted, and therefore worked to keep information from being disclosed. On Enron’s top management Watkins commented “I think Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow are highly intimidating, very smart individuals, and I think they intimidated a number of people into accepting some structures that were not truly acceptable&lt;ref name=&quot;House Committee&quot;/&gt;&quot;. Dissent and questioning of top Enron’s management was discouraged at all levels of the company. This gives us some insight into the corporate culture of Enron, and may help explain why only a few in a company of 20,000 plus employees came forward to voice concerns.

====Sherron Watkins====
In analyzing Sherron Watkins actions the question remains: did she do enough? After the initial investigation concluded there was no wrongdoing, Watkins went back to work. She could have gone public with her memo and likely prompted a detailed investigation, but decided to keep her actions within the company. It is tempting, therefore, to equate Watkins’s situation to that of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Applegate Dan Applegate]. Both displayed personal motivations for not taking further action. In her memo Watkins wrote “My 8 years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume”&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins Memo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/107/hearings/02142002Hearing489/tab11.pdf| title=Sherron Watkins Memo to Kenneth Lay}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also when asked at the Congressional subcommittee hearing why she did not confront then CEO Skilling with her concerns earlier Watkins responded “I did not want to do that without the safety net of a job in hand”&lt;ref name=&quot;House Committee&quot;/&gt;. In both cases the memos, to some degree, were “CYA” letters, protecting their writers in the case of legal action.

There are, however, important distinctions between the two cases. Watkins did not simply deliver a memo to her immediate supervisor and return to work as Applegate did. Instead she met with the CEO of the company, received his assurances that her concerns would be looked into, and saw an investigation launched. It is easy to look back and say Watkins should have done more, spoken out earlier and gone public when internal actions produced no results. In a conventional sense Watkins is not even a whistleblower. However, she did something no one else at Enron was willing to do. Sherron Watkins met with the CEO, told him the company had a serious problem, and that it needed to be fixed.

==Conclusion==
Perhaps nothing conveys Watkins's concern better than a line from her sworn testimony to Congress. Regarding why she felt compelled to tell Lay of the problems facing Enron, Watkins states &quot;my understanding as an accountant is that a company could never use its own stock to generate a gain or avoid a loss on its income statement.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins Testimony&quot; /&gt; This statement is packed with meaning. In essence, her expertise and knowledge of accounting, the core of her professionalism, tells her that something is wrong. She felt a professional obligation to resist Enron's fraudulent accounting practices and to make them known. As professionals, engineers may not encounter fraudulent accounting, but they surely could encounter a situation in which some action violates their professional expertise, leaving them feeling the same way as Watkins. By substituting the words &quot;a professional&quot; in place of &quot;an accountant&quot; in Watkins's statement, this idea becomes evident: &quot;my understanding as a professional is that...&quot;. The test for these professionals is how they act when feeling this way. Do they stand up in the name of their profession like Sherron Watkins, or do they merely become a bystander and turn a blind eye toward the situation? Clearly there are many variables to weigh when answering this question. Watkins went through that process. However, when times were most difficult, she let her moral compass of professional ethics guide her to a decision.

The WorldCom accounting scandal is an important case in ethics.
==WorldCom Background==
WorldCom started as a small long distance telephone service provider in a small in Mississippi. During this time period in the early 90’s, their business model was the resale of long-distance telephone service from larger telephone companies like AT&amp;T to individual consumers and businesses. It later transitioned into a wholesale long distance service provider through the acquisition of various companies and network facilities during the mid to late 80’s. From 1990 to 2001, WorldCom boosted its reported revenues from $154 million to 39.2 billion.&lt;ref name = &quot;WorldCom&quot;&gt;Moberg, D., &amp; Romar, E. (2002, ). [http://www.scu.edu/ethics/dialogue/candc/cases/worldcom.html Worldcom]&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved into the second-largest long distance telephone company in United States and one of the largest companies handling Internet data traffic. It was truly a global telecommunications company that boasted 22 million customers and an international presence in more than 100 countries.


===Business Strategy===
WorldCom’s main growth strategy was mergers and acquisitions, and employed little focus on the organic development and growth of its own network facilities, instead opting to buy another companies assets. Between 1991 and 1998, WorldCom successfully completed 65 acquisitions and spent 60 billion dollars and accumulated 41 billion dollars in debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldCom&quot;&gt;Moberg, D., &amp; Romar, E. (2002, ). Worldcom. website: http://www.scu.edu/ethics/dialogue/candc/cases/worldcom.html&lt;/ref&gt; Every acquisition successfully completed further increased WorldCom profit and revenue, and eventually WorldCom became the darling of Wall Street, where numerous Investment banks, stock analysts, and brokers made strong buy recommendations to investors. By 1997, WorldCom’s stock had risen from less than a dime to over $60 dollars, giving them ample capital to pursue bigger and bolder acquisitions to expand their revenue and profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldCom&quot;&gt;Moberg, D., &amp; Romar, E. (2002, ). Worldcom. website: http://www.scu.edu/ethics/dialogue/candc/cases/worldcom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===MCI Acquisition===

MCI communications had received a lot of interest in 1994 from British Telecom, who acquired a 20% minority ownership stake in MCI communications. In late 1997, British telecom made a 19 billion dollar bid for MCI communications, which was later trumped by WorldCom’s 30 billion dollar offer in stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldMCI&quot;&gt;(1997, October 3) [http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/03/business/british-telecom-outbid-for-mci-is-facing-hard-choices.html?pagewanted=2 British telecom, outbid for mci, is facing hard choices]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications in a deal worth 35 billions dollars. This this was composed of 30 billion dollars in WorldCom stock and 5 billion dollars in assumed MCI communications debt. &lt;ref name = &quot;WorldCom&quot;&gt;Moberg, D., &amp; Romar, E. (2002, ). Worldcom. website: http://www.scu.edu/ethics/dialogue/candc/cases/worldcom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

WorldCom’s acquisition of MCI Communication was met with some opposition from US and European regulation due to concerns on its effect on the telecommunications market. One concern was the fact that the merger would develop an excessive amount of market power over the Internet, which would lead to higher prices for consumers.&lt;ref&gt; (1998, March 3).[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1998/03/11/tec_223934.shtml U.S. Studying Worldcom-MCI Impact on Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; This would undermine the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was created for the intention of promoting competition within the telecommunications sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;British&quot;&gt;Schiller, D. (1998, April 1). [http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/studies_baddealfull/ Bad deal of the century: The worrisome implications of the worldcom-mci merger] &lt;/ref&gt; Also, It was feared the merger of WorldCom and MCI communications could impose serious social costs by reducing the amount of resources and capital needed to adequately modernize the shared telecommunications network. Despite these concerns, the WorldCom acquisition of MCI communication was approved. This acquisition was WorldCom’s most significant acquisition and made them into a salient global telecommunications company.&lt;ref name=&quot;British&quot;&gt;Schiller, D. (1998, April 1). Bad deal of the century: The worrisome implications of the worldcom-mci merger. Retrieved from Economic Policy Institute website: http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/studies_baddealfull/&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently to the merger with MCI communications, WorldCom encountered numerous difficulties in the integration of MCI communications billing systems and network infrastructure. WorldCom’s management was responsible for properly integrating the old and new businesses of WorldCom and MCI communications into a cohesive company. WorldCom was also responsible for the financial integration of the company’s assets, revenue, goodwill, and debt. WorldCom’s inability to adequately execute the WorldCom and MCI Communications integration resulted in an increase in costs and the erosion of profits. WorldCom failed to develop a unified corporate culture among their business units and board of directors. Also the inefficient management of MCI communications’ technical service centers led to the development of duplicate centers that further exacerbated WorldCom’s costs.&lt;ref name = &quot;WorldCom&quot;&gt;Moberg, D., &amp; Romar, E. (2002, ). Worldcom. website: http://www.scu.edu/ethics/dialogue/candc/cases/worldcom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sprint Merger===

After the successful completion of the MCI merger, WorldCom sought an even bigger merger to further bolster their revenues, profits, and network facilities. In 1999, WorldCom proposed a $129 billion merger with Sprint Corp to form one of the largest corporate unions in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;block&quot;&gt;McDonald, T. (2000, June 24). [http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/3611.html Eu to block worldcom/sprint merger]&lt;/ref&gt; IT was met it immense scrutiny from US and European Regulators who were concerned the newly formed company would be dominant and topple Internet competition in the USA and Europe. In 2000, European and US regulators blocked the proposed merger of WorldCom and Sprint, putting WorldCom under intense pressure to increase revenue and profits in order to appease Wall Street and shareholders.&lt;ref name=&quot;block&quot;&gt;McDonald, T. (2000, June 24). [http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/3611.html Eu to block worldcom/sprint merger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
===Motivation===
WorldCom had embarked on a path of non-sustainable growth by acquisition of new companies. The integration of the newly acquired companies was difficult and made efficient management of the entire corporate entity practically impossible. The telecom industry faced a decrease in demand at the end of the dot-com boom, which was when the economy entered a recession&lt;ref name=&quot;govt report&quot;&gt;Bob Lyke, &amp; Mark Jickling (2002). WorldCom: The Accounting Scandal. Website: [http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/13384.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; WorldCom was affected by the recession and was unable to generate the sales they had projected. WorldCom had an oversupply of telecom capacity that it could not sell due to the decline in customer demand. WorldCom paid third party providers for long-distance telecom lines that were being underutilized. The high cost of line capacity, combined with declining customer demand led to a fall in net revenue, hence putting pressure on WorldCom to generate better results.

===The Scandal===
The increased pressure on WorldCom to deliver results resulted in the employment of “creative accounting” that made WorldCom’s profit look much larger than it actually was. This entailed reporting over $3.8 billion in line costs as capital expenditures rather than current expenses. Classifying line costs as capital expenditure meant that it was considered an asset; this would have permitted the company to spread its expenses on the telecom line into the future, since capitalized assets were depreciated annually, and were not reported on the income statement of the company. &lt;ref name=&quot;govt report&quot; /&gt;In the short term, costs fell, and revenue remained stable, implying an increase in profit (profit = revenue – cost). This made the company look like it was performing significantly better than it actually was, and in turn lied to shareholders and investors.

===Exposing the Scandal===
During an internal audit led by Cynthia Cooper, the auditors observed rather unusual accounting entries in the capital expenditure account in the WorldCom wireless division. Cynthia Cooper reported this to the external audit firm, which was Arthur Anderson.  Internal auditors report to external auditors, who have the responsibility of reporting to investors and shareholders.  Author Anderson told the internal auditors that all “aggressive” accounting entries were balanced out on a companywide basis. Soon after, Cynthia Cooper received a phone call from the chief financial officer of WorldCom Scott Sullivan, who asked her to delay the capital expenditure audit. This made the internal auditors more suspicious, Cynthia and her team delved deeper into this investigation and eventually got the WorldCom controller David Meyers to confess.&lt;ref name=&quot;confess&quot;&gt;WorldCom Whistle-blower Cynthia Cooper. 2008. Website: [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/10590507]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Aftermath===
On June 25th 2002, WorldCom admitted that the company had classified $3.4 billion in payments for line cost as capital expenditure rather than current expenses. WorldCom could no longer manage their debt and in July 2002 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company had over $104 billion in assets, making it the largest bankruptcy in the United States at the time&lt;ref name=&quot;bankruptcy&quot;&gt;WorldCom Files Largest Bankruptcy Eever (July, 2002). Website:[http://money.cnn.com/2002/07/19/news/worldcom_bankruptcy/]&lt;/ref&gt;.
The CEO Bernard Ebbers, CFO and other executives involved in the scandal were prosecuted and went to prison. The internal audit team moved on to new jobs and Cynthia Cooper was revered for her role in uncovering this scandal.

==Major Players==
There are three major players in the WorldCom accounting scandal: Cynthia Cooper, Bernard Ebbers, and Scott Sullivan. The actions of Ebbers and Sullivan pushed the company into bankruptcy and later found guilty of securities fraud. Cooper, the whistle blower, helped bring the scandal to light.

===Cynthia Cooper===
Cynthia Cooper is thought of as a prime example of a whistleblower for her role in uncovering the WorldCom accounting scandal. She was among Time Magazine’s persons of the year in 2002. &lt;ref name=&quot;personOftheyear&quot;&gt;Time Magazine, (December2002) Website: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003998,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;Cynthia, a native of Mississippi, was an accountant that worked as the vice president of internal audit at WorldCom. She quit her job after the scandal and founded her own consulting firm. She also gives talks to students, professionals and companies on professionalism and whistleblowing, and shares her personal experiences. She also published a book in 2008 called “Extraordinary Circumstances: The Journey of a Corporate Whistleblower” that talked about her life, WorldCom and her lessons learned.

===Bernard Ebbers===
Bernard Ebbers was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of WorldCom at the time the scandal broke out. He acquired much of his wealth through the acquisitions of telecom companies in the late 1990s. In 1999, Ebbers' net worth was about $1.4 billion. &lt;ref name=&quot;EbbersBio&quot;&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Bernard-Ebbers-233081 Bernard Ebbers Biography], Biography.com. Retrieved 4-18-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his stock holdings were used to invest in real estate and other property.

When WorldCom's stock price dropped significantly in the early 2000s, Ebbers was pressured to provide more collateral for loans backed by his shares in the company. To prevent him from selling his shares, WorldCom's board of directors granted him several loans to prevent him from selling the stock. By 2002 these loans amounted to $408 billion, including interest. &lt;ref name=&quot;SECInvestigation&quot;&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723527/000093176303001862/dex991.htm#ex991902_77 Report of Investigation], Securities and Exchange Commission. Retrieved 4-18-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebbers resigned as CEO in April 2002, under pressure by the board of directors and amidst a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into $400 million in loans issued to him. &lt;ref name=&quot;TimeMag&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002408,00.html The Rise and Fall of Bernie Ebbers] ''Time''.

In March 2004 Ebbers was indicted on 3 charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. &lt;ref name=&quot;DOJ&quot;&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/u.s.-charges-ex-worldcom-ceo-bernard-ebbers U.S. Charges Ex-Worldcom CEO Bernard Ebbers] FBI.

He was found guilty on all counts in March 2005, with a 25 year sentence imposed in July. &lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071300516.html Ebbers Gets 25-Year Sentence For Role in WorldCom Fraud] washpost.com.

Published 7-28-2006. Retrieved 4-18-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scott Sullivan===
Scott Sullivan was the Chief Financial Officer and treasurer for WorldCom, and was responsible for the fraudulent accounting practices of the company. Under the direction of Ebbers, Sullivan oversaw the making of accounting entries that were not in line with generally accepted accounting principles to give WorldCom a false image of profitability. &lt;ref name=&quot;SECInvestigation&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As Cynthia Cooper began investigating suspicious accounting entries with Arthur Andersen, WorldCom's accounting firm, Sullivan initially did not resist the motion. He later asked her to stay out of such matters. &lt;ref name=&quot;SCU&quot;&gt;[http://www.scu.edu/ethics/dialogue/candc/cases/worldcom.html WorldCom] Dennis Moberg (Santa Clara University) and Edward Romar (University of Massachusetts-Boston). Retrieved 4-17-11&lt;/ref&gt; As Cooper's investigation continued, more evidence of fraud was found, prompting Sullivan to ask her to hold off on the investigation until the third quarter 2002. She refused, and in June 2002 Sullivan was fired.

In August 2002 Sullivan was indicted on two charges of securities fraud and five charges of false reports. &lt;ref name=&quot;CFO&quot;&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3006142?f=related Line Charges: Ex-WorldCom CFO Indicted]''CFO'' August 29, 2002.

He pled guilty to these charges, and was sentenced to five years in jail. His cooperation with prosecutors helped him get a reduced sentence, as he also testified against Ebbers at trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,165409,00.html Ex-WorldCom CFO Scott Sullivan Gets 5 Years]FoxNews.com.

[[Image:Corporal Patrick Tillman.jpg|thumb|right|Corporal Patrick Tillman just after enlistment in the Army in 2002]]
This chapter explores the details of Pat Tillman's life and the U.S. government's cover up of his death in Afghanistan. It also analyzes what lessons we can gain from this case and how we can apply these lessons our lives.

==Early Life==
:
On November 6th, 1976, Mary and Patrick Tillman gave birth to their first of three sons— Patrick Daniel Tillman in a small city of California called Fermont. Growing up, Tillman shared a special relationship with his family, especially his brother Kevin who would later enlist with Tillman. Later in life, Tillman became close to his high school friends particularly Marie Ugenti, Tillman’s high school sweetheart. The two would get married right before the Tillman brothers enlisted. In high school, Tillman quickly became the star of the Leland High School football team after initially being cut from the baseball team his freshman year. By the start of his senior year of high school in 1993, Tillman was considered one of the nation’s best players. He was credited with 110 tackles, 31 touchdowns, and averaged 25.7 yards per reception. On December 4th, 1993, Tillman helped Leland win the Central Coast Section (CCS) championship and Tillman was named one of two CCS MVPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot;&gt;, Krakauer, J. (2010).

Retrieved from http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Tillman_Pat.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:
Despite his achievements as a football star in high school, Tillman was considered too small to play football in college and drew little interest from college programs. However, Arizona State showed interest and Tillman was able to secure the last available scholarship offer. By his junior year, Tillman became a starting linebacker for the Sun Devil’s and was second on the team in tackles. By his senior year, Tillman lead the team in tackles and was named the Pac-10’s defensive player of the year. Like college programs, Tillman was largely ignored by the NFL except for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals Arizona Cardinals]. Tillman was selected in 1997 as the 226 overall draft pick. In his rookie year, Tillman switched to safety position and started 10 of the 16 games that season. Tillman quickly gained recognition throughout the NFL as an extremely skilled safety. At one point in his career, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Rams St. Louis Rams] Tillman a five year, 9 million dollar contract. However, Tillman felt extreme loyalty to the team that drafted him when no one else would and turned down the offer to continue playing for the Cardinals. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Carter&quot; /&gt;

Following the attacks of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks September 11th], Tillman finished the remaining 15 games of the NFL season and following the completion of the season, Tillman enlisted in the Army. He turned down a three year, 3.6 million dollar contract from the Cardinals and with his brother Kevin, who turned down a chance to play professional baseball, the Tillman brothers enlisted. Tillman chose to enlist because he felt his life playing football was no longer important given what had happened to his country. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Carter&quot; /&gt; In two different interviews Tillman gave the following quotes:

==The Accident==
:
On April 22nd, 2004, Tillman was operating as a member of 2nd Ranger Battalion around Khowst, Afghanistan. Tillman’s platoon, which included his brother Kevin Tillman, was sent out to do a clearing operation in the village of Manah. With them was a broken down HUMMV in tow. One of the platoon’s HUMMV began experience steering problems as a result of towing the HUMMV. At around 9:00 AM local time, the platoon stopped in a village to assess the situation and decided that the HUMMV could no longer be towed.  After receiving word from superiors that there would not be support to come get the HUMMV the platoon hired a local tow truck to take the HUMMV with them on the mission. This took several hours as it was difficult for the platoon to organize the tow truck and deal with the curious locals. Superiors advised them to split into two serials (groups) to proceed with the mission. Serial 1, which contained Tillman, was sent on to Manah to complete the sweep mission there. Serial 2’s, containing Kevin Tillman, goal was to go meet with the tow truck driver, go to a hard topped road to drop off the HUMMV, and then to rendezvous with Serial 1 in Manah. Around 4:30 PM, dusk in this location, an ambush occurred on Serial 2 as they drove through a canyon with enemies firing from the canyon’s edge. Hearing the ambush, Serial 1 turned around to provide support for Serial 2. Part of Serial 1, including Tillman, dismounted from their HUMMVs and moved forward to secure the area. At this point Tillman and an Afghani soldier took cover behind a boulder where the Afghani soldier was killed. Tillman deployed a high-density smoke grenade to mark his location as friendly. When the firefight ended and a cease-fire was called, it was found that Tillman had been shot in the head three times and had been killed in action. The platoon immediately suspected that fratricide, friendly fire, was to blame for Tillman’s death. The platoon called their superiors and requested transport for Tillman’s body and the wounded as well as reinforcements to help secure the area. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/static/projects/pages/CIDTillman.pdf Military Times .PDF Document copies] Copy of US Army CID report&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cover Up==
:
By 10:00 p.m. on the day of Pat’s death, Kevin Tillman was arriving at Forward Operating Base Salerno. All phones and Internet terminals available to enlisted men had been shut down to prevent information reaching the press before the next of kin was notified. 8:30 a.m. the following day Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Bailey arrived on scene and spoke with the soldiers from both serials. Bailey determined that, in accordance with Article 15-6 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, an investigation was necessary and informed his superior saying “I’m sure it’s a fratricide, sir, but I think I owe you the details. Let me do this investigation and I’ll give it to you as quickly as I can.” Bailey appointed Captain Richard Scott to head the 15-6 investigation. Though Scott was a highly regarded officer he was under direct command of those he was expected to investigate. As Bailey was well aware, Article 15-6 required “the investigating officer to be senior in rank to anyone whose conduct or performance he may investigate,” yet this decision that was first of numerous irregularities that spanned years and caused the Tillman family prolonged and significant pain. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt;
:

Captain Richard Scott completed his 15-6 investigation on the 4th of May, the day after Tillman’s memorial service. The report claimed, among other things, that “leadership played a critical role and greatly contributed to the fratricide incident…” The report proceeded up the chain of command until it reached Colonel Nixon and Lieutenant Colonel Bailey, at which point it disappeared. Additionally, when a 15-6 investigation is initiated, military law dictates that those in command must alert the Criminal Investigation Division (CID), who in turn would complete an independent criminal investigation. When the CID heard of suspected fratricide, they immediately sent a special agent to inquire. The special agent was intercepted by the legal advisor of Bailey’s boss, Major Charles Kirchmaier, who provided fraudulent information and was congratulated on “keeping the CID at bay.” Over the course of three years, four separate investigations were completed: three deficient Army 15-6 investigations and one two-year long investigation conducted by the Department of Defense inspector general’s office, which was also glaringly deficient. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt;
:
As soon as Bailey informed his superior, Colonel Nixon, that the cause of Tillman’s death was friendly fire, Nixon delivered the shocking news to his boss, Brigadier General Stanley McChrystal. McChrystal in turn shared the information with Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, and General Bryan Brown, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. From there, the word of fratricide was sent via secret back channels to the highest levels of the Pentagon and the White House. As decreed by a federal statute and several Army regulations, Marie Tillman was supposed to be notified that an investigation was being conducted, even if fratricide was only suspected, and “be informed as additional information about the cause of death becomes known.” In addition to this initial oversight, all those involved with the investigation were under strict orders to say nothing about friendly fire to the Tillman Family. These orders lead to several instances where those involved had to explicitly deceive the Tillman’s, even at the memorial service of their loved one. In fact, the Tillman family wasn’t informed that fratricide was suspected until the 24th of May, when Bailey recognized that it was no longer possible to keep the secret contained. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt;
:
The glaring deficiencies described above, though they caused a great deal of pain, could all be a terrible collection of oversights and mistakes. Though a number of things happened that removed all doubt as to whether the deceit was intentional. Standard operating procedures for soldiers killed in action require that his or her uniform, and all other appropriate articles, be returned to the United States with the body for use as forensic evidence. When Corporal Tillman’s body was returned to Forward Operating Base Salerno, his uniform, body armor, notebook and other belongings were burned. In addition to the destruction of evidence, McChrystal submitted a falsified award recommendation. It contained misleading information pertaining to the events surrounding Tillman’s death, as well as two forged witness statements. The documents mentioned nothing of fratricide and in fact stated, “Corporal Tillman put himself in the line of devastating enemy fire.”  Many times throughout the document it creates the impression that Tillman was killed by enemy fire. By any measure, the recommendation was fraudulent. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt;
:
After four failed investigations, the Tillman family was summoned to testify before the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It was here the Tillman’s learned that punishment was meted out by the same party that was guilty and investigating itself. Of those that were responsible for the death of Corporal Tillman some received written reprimands while a few were “released for standards” – often referred to as a “slap on the wrist.” A soldier can be RFS’d for accidentally discharging a weapon, or talking back to an officer. For their part in the ordeal, both Bailey and Nixon were promoted. Of those responsible for the “cover-up” most received “memoranda of concern” or nothing at all, and the only officer that received anything resembling punishment was Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger Jr., who was censured for lying under oath but had conveniently retired from the army 18 months earlier.  Needless to say the Tillman family was stunned. &lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot; /&gt;

==Lessons==
Though this is not directly related to engineering, there are a number of things that can be taken away from this case. The first, and perhaps most important lesson, can be learned from Pat Tillman himself. Pat had an incredibly thorough understanding of his ethical perspective and followed it without compromise. This is something that we can all learn from. Regardless of what the circumstances are, always be true to yourself and always stand by what you believe in. The second lesson learned from this case is that self-regulation is a dangerous and easily corruptible practice. The final lesson learned is that no matter how bad the situation or how terrible the outcomes, one should always act with honesty and integrity.

==E.F. Schumacher==
[[w:E._F._Schumacher|Ernst Friedrich Schumacher]] was a well known economist during the 60's and 70's.  A protege of [[w:John_Maynard_Keynes|John Maynard Keynes]], Schumacher developed a set of principles known as Buddhist Economics as a response to how society approached production. He lived during a time where consumerism was progressing at an unattainable pace.  Goods were produced without regard to the potential negative consequences. Natural resources (e.g. land and fossil fuels) were not being maintained and instead were being destroyed and depleted. Schumacher wrote several books that called these things to attention while emphasizing the importance of global sustainability.

==Literary Works==
====Small is Beautiful====
In Schumacher's must influential book, [[w:Small_is_Beautiful|''Small is Beautiful'']], he discusses two main themes: 1) our world's 'problem of production' and 2) the proper use of land.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is beautiful: Economics as if people mattered. New York: Harper &amp; Row. &lt;/ref&gt;  His first argument is that society has an incorrect view of our natural resources. Instead of treating these resources as capital, we use them like income.  The difference is monumental: income resources have a continuous supply while a capital resource has a finite supply.  With this approach, Schumacher explains, our natural resources that are so crucial to production will be used up.  And as with capital, once they are depleted, they are gone forever. Furthermore, Schumacher disagrees with  transferring technology as a final solution for developing countries.  That is, '''supplanting''' technology to solve another country's problems. Instead, developed countries should educate developing countries with how to be self-sufficient.  In order for a country to be economically stable, it will take a solution unique to its needs.


In regards to treatment of land, Schumacher quotes the book ''Topsoil and Civilisation'',  
::::::::::&quot;Man, whether civilised or savage, is a child of nature - he is not the master of nature. He must conform his actions to certain
::::::::::natural laws if he is to maintain his dominance over his environment. When he tries to circumvent the laws of nature, he usually
::::::::::destroys the natural environment that sustains him. And when his environment deteriorates rapidly, his civilisation declines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dale and Vernon Gill Carter.  Topsoil and Civilisation. (University of Oklahoma Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; 


Farmers were depleting nutrients by over planting their fields. As a plot of land became barren, farmers would move to another area and continue to overuse the land.  This practice contributed to the severity of the dust bowl during the 1930's.  Schumacher encouraged crop rotation instead of planting on every square foot of land. Giving a field time to naturally replenish will allow it to grow healthier crops.  The health of land would be maintained longterm while its productivity would also increase.

====Good Work====
[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|thumb|Ford assembly line - 1913]]
Schumacher also wrote, ''Good Work''. The book argued that bigger is not always better.  Although growth and increased efficiency were normally seen as beneficial, Schumacher identified several negative repercussions.  First, the growth of small towns into massive cities was detrimental to an individuals identity.  The significance of a person declined as people began to be treated as a statistic.  These 'mega-cities' also lessened the sense of community as personal interaction decreased.  Schumacher saw this affect the workplace as well.  As a company grew too large, it functioned as a collection of smaller and independent companies.  Furthermore, was the conditioning of workers required for mass production good for society?  Assembly line workers were treated like machines in order for the 'system' to function efficiently.  Schumacher saw this as destroying an individual's identity. 


''Good Work'' also presents the question: When is complex too much?  The more complex a system is the harder it becomes to solve a problem within the system.  For example, as computers become increasingly complex, technical problems no longer can be solved by individuals.  Instead, technical support has to be outsourced to someone who is specialized in the given area.  Schumacher argues that people no longer can solve things themselves and are becoming overly reliant on outside help.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1985). Good work. New York: Harper &amp; Row. &lt;/ref&gt; His last main argument was against large corporations running local stores out of business.  Although Wal-Mart can supply a larger variety of goods at lower costs, is it worth destroying 'mom and pop' stores.  Small farms could no longer compete with the larger farm conglomerates that could sell their products at lower costs. He also thought centralization was not good for society. By having only one brick factory for an entire region, anyone who worked in that field had to relocate in order to keep their job.

==&quot;Schumacher's&quot; Philosophsy==
====Roots of Modern Industrialism====
In critiquing modernity Schumacher knew it was necessary to understand the history behind the ideals of “bigger, faster, and cheaper”.   He traced its origins to the ideas of [[w:René_Descartes|Rene Descartes]].  Descartes wrote that ‘those who seek the direct road to truth, should not bother with any object of which they cannot have a certainty equal to the demonstrations of arithmetic and geometry”.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Descartes. Rules for the Direction of the Mind. Translated by E.S. Haldane and G.R.T. Ross, Encyclopedia Britannica. (Chicago, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even questions like 'what makes me happy?', Descartes would insist can be reduced to numerical proportions and answered in a mathematical or scientific way.  Philosopher and theologian [[w:Jacques_Maritain|Jacques Maritain]] summed up the implications of Descartes philosophy, writing “Cartesian evidence goes straight to mechanism.  It mechanises nature; it does violence to it; it annihilates everything which causes things to symbolize with the spirit, to partake of the genius of the Creator, to speak to us.  The universe becomes dumb.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Maritain. The Dream of Descartes.(Chicago, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  
This mechanization manifested itself in [[w:Social_Darwinism|social darwinism]].  It is the application of evolution to the &quot;development not only consciousness, self-awareness, language, and social institutions, but also the origin of life itself&quot; that Schumacher finds both absurd and disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;E.F. Schumacher.  A Guide for the Perplexed. (Harper Perennial, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical science can tell us nothing of these things.  It reduces man's transcendent nature to a scientific description.  Using evolution to examine the origin of life is like using a ruler to examine the Sistine chapel.

====2 Types of Problems====
Schumacher considers two categories of problems: convergent and divergent.  A convergent problem is one that can be solved.  For example, a design problem like how to make a two-wheeled, man-powered means of transportation.  Various solutions are offered until they finally converge on a final answer: the bicycle.  Divergent problems are such that the more they are clarified and logically developed, the more they diverge, until some solutions appear to contradict.  Schumacher uses education as an example.  Teaching requires both giving students freedom and creating order.  Freedom and order are contradictions at a logical level, but they cease to conflict at a higher level, at a human level, where compassion and altruism become available.

====The Problem of Ethics====
[[w:Ethics|Ethics]] is a divergent problem.  This is because the most fundamental question of ethics is 'what is &quot;the good&quot;’, what is 'truth'.  Or as Schumacher puts it, “If a thing is said to be good, but no one can tell me what it is good for, how can I be expected to take any interest in it?”&lt;ref&gt;E.F. Schumacher.  A Guide for the Perplexed. (Harper Perennial, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  
To answer such questions, Schumacher insists that we must stop treating man as a machine and recognize the discrete differences or ontological jumps between levels of beings.  But just because it falls into the divergent question, it does not mean there is not a truth surrounding it.  Socrates implored us to seek that truth when he said, “I must first know myself”&lt;ref&gt;Hackforth, R. (tr. and ed.). Plato's Phaedrus. (Cambridge University Press, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those individuals of the past whom we still consider the wisest and greatest, like [[w:Socrates|Socrates]], also shared a belief in a being greater than man.  They considered it the most important and profound of all truths.  As [[w:St._Thomas_Aquinas|St. Thomas]] puts it, &quot;The slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the highest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained of lesser things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ., In Sullivan, D. J., &amp; Dominicans. (1955). The Summa theologica. Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica. &lt;/ref&gt;

====3 Tasks====
Schumacher provides three tasks necessary for achieving true human progress:

1. Learn from society and &quot;tradition&quot; and find one's temporary happiness in receiving directions from outside.

2. Interiorize the knowledge one has gained, sift it, sort it out, keeping the good and jettisoning the bad. This is the process of individuation, becoming self-directed.

3. After completing these two tasks, one must 'die to oneself', to one's likes and dislikes, to all one's egocentric preoccupations.  This requires the very best help that can possibly be found.  Then one ceases to be directed from the outside, and ceases to be self-directed.  One has gained freedom, or one might say, one is then God-directed.&lt;ref&gt;E.F. Schumacher. A Guide for the Perplexed. (Harper Perennial, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Schumacher’s&quot; Solutions==
[[File:Sierck les Bains Lorraine France 07 east town.jpg|thumb|Sierck les Bains Lorraine France 07 east town|left]]
Schumacher sees 500,000 people as the ideal size for a city. He argues that this number provides all the
benefits of a large city (such as arts, education, and business), without all of the additional problems of
an exceedingly large city (such as transportation, healthcare, sanitation, etc). After this optimal size, the
increase in population is not adding value to the city, only adding to the problems that must be solved.
Schumacher applies this idea that bigger is not always better to other organizations as well, including
countries and companies.

====[[w:Buddhist_economics|Buddhist Economics]]====

Schumacher uses the principles of Buddhism as the basis for his economic theory. He intends these
ideas not as a set of spiritual or religious values, but rather as a practical, reasonable approach; one that
finds a healthy medium between reckless materialism and economic stagnation.

Work (labor) is viewed slightly differently by employers and employees, but both parties have a negative
view of work. Employers see labor as a cost to be minimized, while employees see
labor as a necessary sacrifice to be minimized. Schumacher says, &quot;The ideal from the
point of view of the employer is to have output without employees, and the ideal from the point of view
of the employee is to have income without employment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is beautiful: Economics as if people mattered. New York: Harper &amp; Row. &lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism, however, sees work as having intrinsic value for the healthy development of
character. Schumacher points out that organizing work in such a manner as to take the human element
out of it, (for example, reducing labor by using mechanization or reducing creative involvement by using
detailed division of labor) is missing the point of work entirely. The tendency of
employees to constantly strive for leisure as an alternative for work is also missing the point. Rather, Shumacher says
that “…work and leisure are complementary parts of the same living process and cannot be separated
without destroying the joy of work and the bliss of leisure.”&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is beautiful: Economics as if people mattered. New York: Harper &amp; Row. &lt;/ref&gt; Both are required in order to fully enjoy the
benefits of the other.

Modern economics considers consumption to be the sole purpose of all economic activity, and
the effort required for production as the means to that end. Buddhist economics alternatively considers
human well-being to be the end and purpose, and consumption to be the means to that end. Each view tries to achieve maximum ends while requiring the minimum means. Modern economics tries to achieve maximum ownership and consumption with minimized work, and Buddhist economics tries to
achieve maximum well-being with minimized consumption.

He argues that the implementation of this idea would be advantageous to ease tension in relationships
between groups of people. He says, “As physical resources are everywhere limited, people satisfying
their needs by means of a modest use of resources are obviously less likely to be at each other’s throats
than people depending upon a high rate of use. Equally, people who live in highly self-sufficient local
communities are less likely to get involved in large-scale violence than people whose existence depends
on world-wide systems of trade.”&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is beautiful: Economics as if people mattered. New York: Harper &amp; Row. &lt;/ref&gt;

Another contrast Schumacher makes between the modern and Buddhist economic outlook is the
importance each puts on natural resources. The modern economist tends to count nothing as
expenditure other than human effort, and therefore does not realize the extent of his current
expenditure of natural non-renewable resources. Buddhist economics takes into account these
expenditures (as consumption to be minimized) and therefore utilizes natural resources more
responsibly.

In this chapter, we will discuss the thoughts of mathematician, [[Wikipedia:Neo-Luddism| Neo-Luddite]], and serial killer Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Kaczynski and compare them with the ideas of more mainstream thinkers.  We limit our picture of Kaczynski's thoughts to those presented in his manifesto, &lt;i&gt;Industrial Society and Its Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm|title=The Unabomber Trial: The Manifesto|date=Sept 22, 1995|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Of these ideas, we are specifically interested in the ethical considerations that Kaczynski thinks should guide the progress of science and technology and the values that he thinks define modern technical professionals.  These ideas combine to form a unique perspective on professional ethics for engineers. All quotations from Kaczynski are taken from his manifesto and referenced by paragraph number. 

==Background==
In this section, we will briefly describe Kaczynski's life, through the publication of his manifesto and his subsequent arrest, to provide context for his ideas.  Kaczynski, born in 1942, was recognized early as an academic prodigy, with special abilities in mathematics. At the age of 16, he was accepted as a student to Harvard University, where he studied math and physics &lt;ref name=recluse/&gt;.  Kaczynski went on to earn his PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan, where his award-winning dissertation &lt;ref name=dissertation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=755308911&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=1&amp;clientId=1564&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;cfc=1|title=Boundary Functions|last = Kaczynski|first = Ted|date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; was widely praised by the faculty members he worked with &lt;ref name=thesispraise&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/26/us/prisoner-of-rage-a-special-report-from-a-child-of-promise-to-the-unabom-suspect.html|title=PRISONER OF RAGE -- A special report.;From a Child of Promise to the Unabom Suspect|last=McFadden|first=Robert|date=May 26, 1996|accessdate=April 29 ,2011|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  After a short-lived professorship at UC Berkeley, Kaczynski resigned and built himself an isolated wood cabin in rural Montana. [[File:Young theodore kaczynski.jpeg|thumb|Kaczynski at Berkeley]]

From the early to mid-70's Kaczynski lived in this cabin without electricity or running water, learning a variety of survival skills and reading books about sociology and philosophy &lt;ref name=recluse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/bkgrdstories.defendant.htm|title=Bookish Recluse Lived Sparse Cabin Existence|last = Schwartz|first=John|coauthors = Kovaleski, Serge|newspaper = The Washington Post|date=April 4, 1996|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1978, he began a series of 16 bombings, mostly targeting university professors and computer store owners &lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;.  He was widely referred to as  &quot;the Unabomber&quot; prior to his identification and arrest.  Kaczynski's attacks culminated with a letter to the New York Times, which demanded that a reputable newspaper or journal publish his 35,000 word manifesto regarding the dangers of modern industrial-technological society. Though there was some initial hesitation &lt;ref name=hesitation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.ethics.htm|title=Manifesto Poses Ethical Dilemma for Two Newspapers|last = LaFraniere| first = Sharon|coauthors = Thomas,  Pierre|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = July 1, 1995|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the New York Times and the Washington Post published the Unabomber manifesto on September 19, 1995 &lt;ref name=publishmanifesto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.pubs.htm|title=Statement by Papers' Publishers|last = Graham|first=Donald|coauthors=Sulzberger, Arthur|date=September 19, 1995|accessdate=April 29, 2011|newspaper = The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While a costly FBI investigation had been underway since the first bombing, Kaczynski was not caught and arrested until April 3, 1996 &lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/bkgrdstories.ted.htm|title=16 Bombs, Three Deaths|date = 1998|accessdate=April 29, 2011|newspaper = The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after his brother recognized the writing style of the published manifesto &lt;ref name=brother&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/trialstory.htm|title=FBI Gives Reward to Unabomber's Brother|last = Claiborne|first=William|date=August 21, 1998|accessdate= April 29, 2011|newspaper = The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In May 1998, Kaczynski was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole &lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;.

==Values==
To understand Kaczynski's ethical perspective, we must first determine what he defines as &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;.  He never defines this explicitly, concluding that &quot;in a discussion of this kind one must rely heavily on intuitive judgment&quot; (paragraph 231).  He appears to assume a shared, intuitive understanding with the reader of what things are right.  His occasional examples fall in line with conventional ideas.  In paragraph 153, for example, he identifies &quot;good purposes, such as discouraging child abuse or race hatred&quot;.  His full definition  of what is right cannot be typical, though, because society deemed his deliberate, murderous bombings criminal.  We must therefore carefully analyze the things that Kaczynski classifies as right and wrong.  

He justifies most of his objections to the modern industrial system by attributing &quot;immense suffering all over the world&quot; (paragraph 169) to it.  We may thus conclude that Kaczynski considers the suffering of people bad.  He deliberately inflicted suffering on people, though, which appears to violate this simple precept.  What, according to Kaczynski, makes some suffering worth causing?  He provides hints in the section on &quot;Human Suffering&quot; (paragraphs 167-170), where he states that &quot;it is not all certain that the survival of the [industrial] system will lead to less suffering than the breakdown of the system would&quot; (paragraph 169) and &quot;one has to balance the struggle and death [of a revolution] against the loss of freedom and dignity&quot; (paragraph 168).  These excerpts suggest that Kaczynski's guiding principle is a sort of [[w:Utilitarianism| Utilitarian]] arithmetic for minimizing net human suffering.  He makes this explicit for his own actions in paragraph 96, claiming that to have &quot;some chance of making a lasting impression, we've had to kill people&quot;.  He casts his murders as negative actions but believes that this harm was outweighed by the exposure of his writing.  

==Kaczynski's picture of psychology==
Kaczynski's views on the ethics of technology rely on his model of human psychology and the ways that its interactions with modern technology allegedly lead to suffering.  Kaczynski believes that a core element of human psychology is what he calls the &quot;power process&quot; (paragraph 33).  He theorizes that, in order to have healthy, functional lives, people must formulate goals and exert nontrivial efforts to attain them. Reaching goals without effort is not sufficient; Kaczynski offers the trend that &quot;leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized&quot; (paragraph 34) as evidence for the value of the power process.  Kaczynski also believes that people derive the greatest enjoyment from participating in this process independently, claiming that &quot;most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy&quot; (paragraph 42) to feel satisfied.  

Some goals, such as food and shelter, are necessary for survival.  When meeting these goals is a nontrivial endeavor, people are required to participate in the power process.  According to Kaczynski, however, the &quot;effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality&quot; (paragraph 41) by modern industry.  In other words, he thinks we have become like the &quot;leisured, secure aristocracies&quot; (paragraph 34) of past ages.  Much of the manifesto is devoted to describing the psychological pathologies that supposedly follow from this disruption of the power process.  

Not all modern people lose touch with the process, though; some people formulate artificial goals.  This idea has precedent in A.H. Maslow's writings on the &quot;hierarchy&quot; of human needs.  Maslow claims that, when basic goals are reached, &quot;At once other (and 'higher') needs emerge and these, rather than physiological hungers, dominate&quot;&lt;ref name=maslow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/50/4/370/|title=A theory of human motivation|last = Maslow|first = Abraham|journal = Psychological Review|volume = 50|issue=4|pages=370-396|date=July, 1943|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p. 375). Kaczynski refers to the nontrivial efforts that people make toward such goals as &quot;surrogate activities&quot; (paragraphs 38-41).  Kaczynski's list of examples includes &quot;scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist&quot; (paragraph 40).  Of particular relevance to professional engineering ethics is Kaczynski's identification of technical professions as surrogate activities.  

==Technical professionals==
Kaczynski devotes a section of his manifesto to &quot;The Motives of Scientists&quot; (paragraphs 87-92).  He argues that scientists (and presumably other technical professionals) pursue their careers as surrogate activities, mainly to fulfill the power process.  Kaczynski dismisses the objections that scientists might be motivated by curiosity (paragraph 87) or the &quot;benefit of humanity&quot; (paragraph 88).  He reaches the conclusion that &quot;science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human race&quot; (paragraph 92).  This surrogate activity -- that every engineer partakes in -- is thus at best orthogonal to Kaczynski's implicit guiding ethical principle:  minimizing total human suffering.  As we saw in his discussion of the disrupted power process, Kaczynski thinks that the advancement of technology can in fact work against human welfare.  

==Small-scale vs. Organizational technology==
It is important to note that Kaczynski did not hate all forms of technology. He defines two forms of technology as &quot;small-scale&quot; and &quot;organizational&quot; (paragraph 208). Small-scale technology &quot;can be used by small-scale communities without outside assistance.&quot; This includes technology such as steel and the water wheel.  Organizational technology requires organization on the social level, and falls into disrepair if that organization disappears.  An example Kaczynski gives is the Roman aqueduct system.  It was not maintained after the empire's collapse, while small-scale Roman technologies survived (paragraph 208). He hypothesizes that the refrigerator (among other things) would meet a similar fate if modern society collapsed (paragraphs 209-210).  Kaczynski endorses small-scale technology while condemning organizational technology.　[[Professionalism/E.F._Schumacher|E.F. Schumacher]] made a similar distinction and reached the similar (but less militant) conclusion that [[w:Small_is_Beautiful|''Small is Beautiful'']].  

In a portion of Kaczynski's manifesto entitled &quot;The Future&quot;, he outlines some of the dangers of organizational technologies. Two of the particular risks involve artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Kaczynski argues that our reliance upon machines will progress to the point where they make the majority of decisions for us. At this point, &quot;People won't be able to just turn the machines off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide&quot; (Paragraph 173).  This sentiment was expressed by E.M. Forster almost a century earlier in his short story &lt;i&gt;The Machine Stops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name=machinestops&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html|title=The Machine Stops|last=Forster|first=E.M.|date=1909|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to the more recent concept of [[Lentis/The_Singularity|the Singularity]].  Computer scientist [[Professionalism/Bill_Joy|Bill Joy]] stated that, although Kaczynski was &quot;criminally insane&quot;, he &quot;saw some merit in&quot; Kaczynski's reasoning about the dystopian possibilities for computing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Joy|first=Bill|newspaper=Wired|date=April, 2000|accessdate=April 29, 2011|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us}} &lt;/ref&gt;.  Even if humans remain in control, Kaczynski claims that advances in the field of genetic engineering will &quot;continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed&quot; because &quot;once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point&quot; (Paragraph 177). Kaczynski thinks that the inevitable regulation of genetic engineering (paragraph 123) would lead to a curtailment of the autonomy that he believes enhances the power process (paragraph 42), concluding that &quot;The only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human beings&quot; (paragraph 124). The popularity of the film &lt;i&gt;Gattaca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name=gattaca&gt;{{cite video|people=Niccol, Andrew|Publisher =Columbia Pictures|date=1997|title=[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/ Gattaca]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a depiction of a genetically engineered society, released shortly after the Unabomber's arrest, suggests widespread sympathy for this view.

==Conclusion==
Kaczynski classifies certain technologies as ethical and others as unethical, on the basis of their alleged effects on overall human welfare.  This implies a set of ethical principles for technical professionals that is very different from the motivations that Kaczynski thinks actually drive science and technology forward.  While Kaczynski's sanity is questionable &lt;ref name=sanity&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/kaczynski122697.htm|title=Kaczynski Resists the Insanity Defense|last=Booth|first=William|date=December 26, 1997|accessdate=April 29, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sanity2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/bkgrdstories/psych0109.htm|last=Booth|first=William|date=January 9, 1998|accessdate=April 29, 2011|title=Kaczynski Agrees to Mental Exam, Seeks to Represent Himself}}&lt;/ref&gt;, we find that some of his conclusions are compatible with those of more mainstream authors and may even resonate with the general public.  This makes his perspective worthy of consideration, in spite of the criminal actions that got it published.

{{cquote|A mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janis&quot;&gt;Janis, Irving L. Victims of Groupthink. Boston. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;|||Groupthink as defined by Irving Janis, principal investigator of Groupthink|}}

[[Wikipedia:Groupthink | Groupthink]] is a phenomenon that occurs when members of a cohesive group are concerned with quickly reaching a consensus in their decision making without critically analyzing and evaluating ideas.
The term was coined by [[Wikipedia:William H. Whyte | William H. Whyte]] in 1952 and was studied extensively by [[Wikipedia:Irving Janis | Irving Janis]]. Janis analyzed numerous foreign policy disasters such as [[Wikipedia:Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor | Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and [[Wikipedia:Bay of Pigs | Bay of Pigs]] and found group cohesion to be the cause.

==Causes and Symptoms of Groupthink==
Irving Janis identified a number of group properties that would lead to the emergence of groupthink:
# Directive and promotional leadership
# Cohesiveness of the group
# Insulation of the group from the outside
# Lack of methodical decision-making procedures&lt;ref name=&quot;Esser&quot;&gt;Esser, James K. (1998). Alive and well after 25 years: A review of Groupthink research. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. Vol 73. pp. 116-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groupthink encompasses a number of symptoms which frequently lead to poor decision making:
# Illusions of invulnerability
# Illusions of unanimity
# Rationalization of the warnings
# Intolerance to those opposed to the group and  [[Professionalism/Mark Klein and Room 641A | whistle-blowers]]
# Self-censorship of ideas deviating from the group consensus
# Complete faith in the morality of the group

==Case Studies of Groupthink==
These case studies highlight the importance of recognizing and avoiding groupthink as a professional engineer.
===Challenger===
[[Wikipedia:Space Shuttle Challenger | Challenger]] was destroyed in a launching accident on January 28, 1986. Cause of the accident was attributed to a faulty O-ring on the solid-fuel rocket booster which failed in the cold weather. All seven crew members died on board, including a woman who would have been the first [[w:Teacher in Space Project | teacher in space]].

From Janis’s perspective, groupthink was responsible for the Challenger disaster, specifically cohesiveness, directive leadership, and group insulation. This case exhibited many symptoms of groupthink: launch crew members rationalized warnings from the engineers, they had an illusion of invulnerability based on their past success, and the managers belittled the engineers for always wearing their &quot;engineering hats&quot; and stereotyped them as ignorant.

===Pearl Harbor===
[[w:Attack on Pearl Harbor | Pearl Harbor]] demonstrates two symptoms of groupthink: illusions of invulnerability creating excessive optimism and encouraging risk taking, and rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group’s assumptions. Americans ignored the fact that Japan had a tendency to launch brutal attacks before declaring war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;Walsh, H. (1989). Groupthink (pp. 16).  Hartland Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the US government underestimated the Japanese' intentions and continued sending scrap iron, oil, and other raw materials to Japan well into 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;/&gt;  Nine years before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, [[w:Frank Herman Schofield | Admiral Frank Schofield]] anticipated a possible attack on Hawaii from the Pacific.  The military confirmed his theory that aircrafts attacking from the Pacific would be undetected and would wreak havoc on the harbor. Despite these results, the military refused to re-examine their defenses.

===Bay of Pigs===
The [[w:Bay of Pigs Invasion | Bay of Pigs Invasion]] was an assault on Cuba in 1961 by approximately 1400 United States trained Cuban exiles. The invasion was an utter failure when about 20,000 Cuban soldiers ended the assault within three days. Irving Janis attributed the cause of the disaster to groupthink.

Janis attributed the causes of groupthink in the Bay of Pigs to cohesion, secrecy, biased leadership, and lack of critical methodology&lt;ref name=&quot;Janis&quot;/&gt;. One group would make decisions started by another group--which contributed to cohesion--since many considered a good start to the presidential term to be more important than the decision. The Bay of Pigs was meant to be a surprise invasion, so secret meetings were held with little outside communication. [[w:John F. Kennedy | Kennedy]]'s presence at meetings inspired biased leadership since no one wanted to question his statements.  Finally, they lacked methodical decision-making procedures. These factors all led to illusions of invulnerability, illusions of unanimity and suppression of personal doubt among advisers.

=====Cuban Missile Crisis=====
Irving Janis used the [[w:Cuban Missile Crisis | Cuban Missile Crisis]] to contrast the disaster at the Bay of Pigs. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a thirteen day long diplomatic crisis where the United States fought to keep Soviet missiles from being set up in Cuba.

After witnessing the failure of his administration at the Bay of Pigs, [[w:John F. Kennedy | Kennedy]] made significant changes to the way that decisions were made within his offices.

#Advisers were asked to join discussions, not only as representatives with narrow responsibilities, but ready to think critically about all aspects of policy. 
#Meetings were more open and less formal. Guests were invited frequently and explicitly asked to voice detailed opinions.
#Rather than always meeting as a full Executive Committee, meetings consisted of subgroups which included various White House Staff.
#Kennedy frequently chose to not attend meetings so he would not influence the opinions of group members.

These changes significantly improved the decision-making process of Kennedy's administration and enabled them to successfully negotiate the removal of the missiles. When Janis evaluated the new decision making process, he determined that no symptoms of groupthink were evident.

===Religion===
Religion is “a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects,”&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary&quot;&gt;(2011) Dictionary.com. http://dictionary.reference.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a group belief system, which involves organized behaviors and rituals. Directive leadership is a fundamental part of many religions, and homogeneity of members’ social background and ideology is inherent to religion in general,&lt;ref name=&quot;McCauley&quot;/&gt; which are both causes of groupthink.  

=====Janis' Symptoms of Groupthink Demonstrated by Religion=====
''Unquestioned belief in the morality of the group, causing members to ignore the consequences of their actions'': As Charles Selengut states, “the history and scriptures of the world’s religions tell stories of violence and war as they speak of peace and love.”&lt;ref&gt;Selengut, Charles (2008-04-28).

==Research Findings and Laboratory Tests==
{{cquote|Questions can be raised as to the utility of using groupthink for research.|||Henningsen, Henningsen, Eden &amp; Cruz&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, D. D., Henningsen, M. L. M., Eden, J., &amp; Cruz, M. G. (2006). Examining the Symptoms of Groupthink and Retrospective Sensemaking. Small Group Research, 37, 36-64.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

According to Clark McCauley&lt;ref name=&quot;McCauley&quot;&gt;McCauley, C. (1989). The nature of social influence in groupthink: Compliance and internalization.
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, 250–260.&lt;/ref&gt;, groupthink occurs due to directive leadership, members’ homogeneous background and ideology, and isolation of the group from outside sources of information and analysis.
A concept of groupthink has been extensively studied and challenged by the researchers.

In his book, Janis considered group cohesion to be the most important antecedent of groupthink &lt;ref name=&quot;Janis&quot;/&gt;. Based on laboratory studies, many researchers such as Mullen, Anthony, Salas, and Driskell &lt;ref&gt;Mullen, B., Anthony, T., Salas, E., &amp; Driskell, J. E. (1994). Group cohesiveness and quality of decision making: An integration of tests of the groupthink hypothesis. Small Group Research, 25, 189–204.&lt;/ref&gt; found weak or no support for the hypothesized relationship between cohesion and groupthink symptoms. 
Esser&lt;ref name=&quot;Esser&quot;/&gt;, McCauley&lt;ref name=&quot;McCauley&quot;/&gt; and Tetlock&lt;ref&gt;Tetlock, P. E., Peterson, R. S., McGuire, C., Chang, S., &amp; Feld, P. (1992). Assessing political group dynamics: A test of the groupthink model. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, 403–425.&lt;/ref&gt; also found that the group cohesion is not predictive of groupthink. Hogg&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, M., Hains, S. 1998. &quot;Friendship and group identification: a new look at the role of cohesiveness in groupthink.&quot; European Journal of Social Psychology. Vol. 28. pp 323-341. &lt;/ref&gt; argue that cohesiveness is not cause of groupthink because one cannot distinguish cohesiveness from friendship or social attraction.

In a study of variables such as cohesiveness, leadership, dominance, accountability, and threat, only two variables were supported to be causes of groupthink symptoms&lt;ref&gt;Park, W. (2000). A comprehensive empirical investigation of the relationships among variables of the groupthink model. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 21, 873–887&lt;/ref&gt;. It was found that the insulated groups has tendency to consider fewer alternatives and groups with directive leaders use less available information&lt;ref&gt;Flowers, M. L. (1977). A laboratory test of some implications of Janis’s groupthink hypothesis.
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35, 888–896.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Preventing Groupthink==
After concluding his case studies, Janis proposed some techniques to prevent groupthink&lt;ref name=&quot;Janis&quot;/&gt;. Awareness of the causes and symptoms of groupthink helps group members limit its negative effects.

#The group leader should assign each member the role of &quot;critical evaluator&quot; and encourage objections and criticism.
#Group leaders must describe the problem using unbiased statements to avoid partiality.
#The organization should set up several independent groups to tackle each problem.
#The group should periodically split into subgroups with different leaders to discuss ideas then reconvene to work out issues.
#Each group member should discuss issues with trusted associates outside of group meetings.
#Each meeting, one or more qualified outside experts should attend meetings and challenge ideas of group members.
#One member each meeting should be given the role of [[w:Devil's advocate | Devil's Advocate]].
#The group should analyze all possible intentions of involved parties.
#After reaching preliminary consensus, each member should vividly voice all residual doubts about the decision


Janis' prevention proposals were based on his experience and observations but not scientifically validated. Although his suggestions make sense, they have not been scientifically proven. Overall, there is startlingly little research done on the practical applications of groupthink. &lt;ref&gt;Rose (2011). Diverse Perspectives on the Groupthink Theory. Emerging Leadership Journeys, Vol. 4 Iss. 1, 2011, pp. 37- 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the limited practical research on groupthink, Hart proposes adding 'group accountability' to the list of preventions&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed, A. A., &amp; Wiebe, F. A. (1996). Toward a process theory of groupthink. Small Group Research, 27(3), 416-430.&lt;/ref&gt;. The end goal in preventing groupthink is in positive decision outcomes, so even beyond preventing groupthink, the following suggestions are valuable.
#Create backup plans in case of failures
#Hold the decision making group accountable for their decisions&lt;ref&gt;Hart, P. (1998). Preventing groupthink revisited: Evaluating and reforming groups in government. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 73, 306-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remarks==
Group decision-making or cohesion is not always a bad thing. [[W:Collective wisdom | Collective wisdom]] or Group wisdom is when shared knowledge by individuals and groups are used to solve problems and conflicts. As long as the group does not fall into the trap of groupthink, cohesiveness of a group is useful especially during decision-making in the military.

The following example cases are recommended for further studies:
* North Korea
* Watergate
* Marshall Plan
* Northern Rock
* Vietnam War

Related words:
* Abilene paradox
* Bandwagon effect
* Collective behavior
* Communal reinforcement
* Group polarization
* Group serving bias
* Herd behavior
* Spiral of silence

==Introduction==
[[File:Bill joy.jpg|Bill joy]]
==Personal History==
From and early age Joy showed promising signs as a mathematician&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html&lt;/ref&gt;, excelling in high school and took advanced courses at the University of Michigan, where he received at B.S in Electrical Engineering &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Bill,Joy&lt;/ref&gt; and first discovered computers.  He was enthralled with the idea of a machine that could solve problems and had a clear notion of correct and incorrect &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Joy continued in his education at the University of California at Berkeley where he received a M.S. in Computer Engineering &lt;ref&gt;http://berkeley.edu/tour/students/famous_alumni2.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  While at Berkeley, Joy worked with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRG Computer Systems Research Group] where he is accredited with the development of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution BDS] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix UNIX], which is the software that Apples eventually based it's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X Mac OS X] operating system on.  Joy is also attributed with developing the text editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi vi], which is still used today, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell csh] while at Berkeley.

===Early Career===
In 1982 Joy co-founded [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems Sun Microsystems] with several other Berkeley graduates.  While at Sun, he further established himself as a leader in computer software design, where he produced the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_platform#Edition Java Platform] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_(protocol) Network File System (NFS)], which allows users to access files through a network.  While at Sun, Joy was exposed to the rapid development of technology and was shocked by how fast things were changing, an experience that acted as the foundations for which his claims in his article, &quot;''Why the Future Doesn't Need Us''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Currently, Joy is a partner in the venture capital firm [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiner_Perkins_Caufield_%26_Byers Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, &amp; Byers] which focuses on IT, biotech, and green technologies &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kpcb.com/team/index.php?all&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Why the Future Doesn't Need Us==
Joy received further notoriety when he wrote [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_future_doesn't_need_us &quot;''Why the Future Doesn't Need Us''&quot;] for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine) Wired Magazine]  in April 2000. In it he expresses his concerns for the direction technological advancements are headed and the rate at which they are getting there. He discusses his fear for self-replicating robots and how the spread of knowledge in the 21st Century is facilitating the advancements of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (GNR).

'''Introduction of Ideas &amp; Misgivings'''

Joy opens the article by recalling when his concerns for new technologies first emerged. It was in conversation with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle John Searle] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil] that Joy began to take seriously the threat of independent technologies that could have a stronger hold on human society. He tells how Kurzweil said &quot;that the rate of improvement of technology was going to accelerate and that we were going to become robots or fuse with robots or something like that.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy talks about how these fears that at one time seemed outlandish suddenly seemed realistic coming from two professionals he highly respected. During this conversation Kurzweil had a copy of his then forthcoming novel [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines The Age of Spiritual Machines]. Joy read an excerpt and was even further disturbed by a quotation from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_kacynski Ted Kacynski]. In it Kacynski suggests and reasons, &quot;that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines' decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Search of Knowledge'''

Joy sees the issues emerging from advancing technology rooted in a relentless search for knowledge. He recognizes that knowledge is good and the desire to know is part of human nature, but he questions the necessity of knowledge, especially at the cost of human race. He claims the the only way to protect ourselves is too limit or relinquish our pursuit of knowledge. He sites Nietzsche who calls the &quot;'will to truth,' or 'truth at any price'&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt; as dangerous. Joy thinks that unlimited access to knowledge could lead to mankind's demise.

'''NBC vs GNR'''

Joys misgivings regarding the pursuit of truth at any cost ties directly to his fears regarding the advancement of technology in the advancements in 21st Century technologies genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (GNR).

In ''&quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us&quot;'' Joy draws a parallel between GNRs and 20th Century nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) technologies. He claims that pursuit for truth and knowledge led to humanity bringing itself to the brink of its own destruction. Joy discusses how the advancement of the atomic bomb continued for the sake continued advancement and if it hadn't been stopped it would have led to the end of mankind.

Joy raises the question if humanity is headed in the same direction with the spread of GNR technologies and what it will take to stop the spread of knowledge. What scares him more is not that we are doing the same thing with different technologies, but instead how much easier GNRs can be spread over NBCs. NBC technologies require incredible resources in time, space and money. With GNRs since the resources required to advance and implement these technologies are so much less the knowledge with how to use them is enough to actually use them. Compound this fact with the increased spread of knowledge in today's society and Joy fears for our future.

'''Media Examples'''

Though Joy's fears seem farfetched and crazy it's obvious that these fears are shared by many. A simple look at today's media and it's easy to see how his fears are a common thread in many movies, television shows, and other pop culture sources.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix The Matrix], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator The Terminator], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still The Day the Earth Stood Still] are prime examples.

==Joy's Ethics==

While Joy mainly offers a bleak view of the future without adequate action by the scientific community, he is less explicit on the actions that engineers and scientists need to take to avoid this development. Specifically, he does not give a code or guide that will help fellow coworkers, or shed light on what Joy believes is a true professional engineer. However, he does reference some principles or phrases that he believe are important for people to keep in their minds during scientific endeavors. From these statements as well as other  ideas he outlines, an extrapolated &quot;guide&quot; can be created that partially encompass Joy's attitude towards professional ethics. The following list is by no means Bill Joy's work or views, but is simply an extrapolated assumption made by the authors. It is meant to guide the engineer away from actions or tendency that could potentially cause technological developments or scientific breakthroughs that are detrimental to human society, and thus avoid Joy's apocalyptic prophecies.



'''- Understand and respect the order of nature and natural selection.'''

Repeatedly, Joy references the idea that if we create something that is more evolutionary fit than us, then by natural selection they will inevitably overtake us and eventually condemn us to extinction. This point is meant to convey the idea that the chaotic natural order shows no preference to us or any other species, and we are subject to its rules. Furthermore, natural ecosystems in general have a specific order to them as well, and creation of a technological or biological organism that could throw off this balance and wreck havoc on local or the global ecosystem.

'''- Humility in the pursuit of technological advancement.'''

Joy believes that often during scientific discovery, we are overly arrogant of our own abilities. Essentially, the scientific community must restrain from hubris considering there are forces that we do not know, or have not researched completely, and those that are still out of our control. Similar to nuclear technology, we are often teetering upon on edge between sustained control of a system and complete failure or destruction. 

'''- Understand the fragility and inefficiencies of human-made systems.'''

Similar to the previous point, however this is more aimed at the fragility of our society, not that of our creations. From his work on computers, Joy came to realize that even his most powerful computational creations were still susceptible to complete failure with a single aspect that goes awry. He uses this metaphor to describe society, and how despite our views of social flexibility and survivability, an unforeseen factor that attacks a key aspect of our lives could bring the entire social structure down with it. For example, our reliance on electric power makes us susceptible to danger if the power grid were to be suddenly ineffective or under the control of a malevolent artificial intelligence. 

'''- Reject the idea of truth at all cost.''' 

This is relatively simple: the ends do not always justify the means. In Joy's view, the means can feasibly create a scenario where the opposite to the original end is created. For example, research into a nanotechnological cure for cancer could inadvertently lead to a self-replicating protein inhibitor that retards normal cell development in humans. Instead of viewing science as a realm of knowledge where all must be known, the scientist or engineer must use caution in the act of discovery and see it as a potential hazard to life. He is not saying that all development must be viewed with fear and skepticism, but that certain technologies have obvious dangers and their full potentials in all ways, both beneficial and damaging, should be treated with care. 

'''Knowledge is no excuse for inaction.'''

One of Joy's most common criticisms of the modern scientific community is that although many eminent and normal members alike agree that an out-of-control technology is highly possible, he sees no sign that they are doing anything about it. Therefore, although you understand a problem or possible future, you have a responsibility to respond to that problem. This also closely aligns with Joy's view of whistle-blowers, we he alludes are essentially in the process of technological development. 

'''Be aware of the consequences of your actions, both direct and indirect.'''

This principle is common among all the others, and defines the safest approach to a detrimental situation. Essentially what is entails is that during the act of scientific creation or engineering creation, the creator must be aware of possible ways that this technology could be abused, uncontrollable, directly dangerous, or manipulated if in the wrong hands. However, one must also try to envision how the technology could be developed further, or incorporated into other technology, that could make it potentially harmful. The principle is simple, but it is easier said than done. 



Finally, Joy does outline that he believes that &quot;to verify compliance, require engineers and scientists to adopt a strict code of ethical conduct, resembling the Hippocratic Oath, and that they have the courage to whistleblow if necessary.&quot; '&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html&lt;/ref&gt;  '''''

=Introduction=
The pharmaceutical industry is a marketing giant.  They spend twice as much money marketing their products than researching and developing them.  The pharmaceutical industry has more motivation to sell their products than to innovate new treatments that improve quality of life. 

Pharmaceuticals are marketed in a variety of ways intended to affect doctors, patients, and even children. Pharmaceutical companies create incentives for physicians to promote their brand-name drug and to give away free samples. When patients describe a vague set of recurring symptoms that are associated with a condition, they become convinced that they have a condition requiring the use of a particular drug. Tragically, children are often convinced in similar ways -- the [[w:TeenScreen|TeenScreen]] program, for example, was funded by pharmaceutical companies to diagnose high school students with certain psychiatric conditions requiring the use of brand name drugs.

In this chapter, we will present the techniques used by pharmaceutical companies to promote and sell their products.  We will also discuss the various consequences of these techniques and how they are ethically unsound.

=Advertising=
===[[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]===
The 1997 FDA guidelines that allowed drug companies to greatly expand the scope of their direct-to-consumer advertising required the companies to “present a fair balance between information about effectiveness and information about risk.” &lt;ref name=&quot;TV Commercial Study&quot;&gt; University of Georgia (2008, January 4). Most TV prescription drug ads minimize risk information, study finds. Science Daily. Retrieved from http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080103161527.htm. &lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA’s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications (DDMAC) oversee direct-to-consumer advertising, monitoring ads to make sure information is “truthful, balanced, and accurately communicated.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Prescription Drug Ads&quot;&gt; Huh, J., DeLorne, D. E., Reid, L. N., &amp; An, S. (2010, March). Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising. Clinical and Health Affairs. &lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has been criticized by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) for its inability to ensure that all ads are reviewed adequately.

===[[w:Direct-to-Consumer Advertising|Direct-to-Consumer Advertising]]===
There are three types of direct-to-consumer advertising: 
*'''Help seeking''' advertisements discuss a particular disease or health condition and advertises to the consumer to “ask your doctor” about the condition if you experience these symptoms. No particular product is mentioned within the advertisement. &lt;ref name=&quot;Direct-to-Consumer Ads&quot;&gt; Vogt, D. U. (2005, March 25). Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. Congressional Research Service Report for Congress. CRS-1 – CRS-32. &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Reminder''' advertisements calls attention a particular product, but it does not mention a particular health condition that the product treats. These advertisements target physicians that would recognize the product and be reminded. &lt;ref name=&quot;Direct-to-Consumer Ads&quot; /&gt;

*'''Product claim''' advertisements include the product’s name and a therapeutic claim about the specific product. &lt;ref name=&quot;Direct-to-Consumer Ads&quot; /&gt;


Product claim advertisements are the most common and most memorable ones in public media, coming in the form of [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7113065002106695432# commercials] and [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZiPiXEv_Q_g/SQm6buyR8OI/AAAAAAAABf0/D6iTei9qFDg/s400/Lunesta-v-Ambien.jpg magazine advertisements]. They are also the only type of ads that the FDA directly regulates.

Common techniques used in pharmaceutical commercials include: peaceful happy people, pleasant music, calming animation and colors, “free sample”, etc. These techniques shroud the information or disclaimers presented about the product. These gimmicks are used to entice the consumer rather than educate them about the drug.

As hear in drug commercials and seen on magazine ads, it states “ask your doctor about . . .” This phrase of “ask your doctor about” a certain prescription drug turns normal people into their own doctors, self-prescribing their own medication, going to their physicians requesting a specific drug. As a result, physicians may feel pressured to sign patient prescription requests. Therefore, these physicians are no longer paid for their judgment, but rather their signature.

These commercials and advertisements may also turn “normal people into patients. The ordinary experiences of life become a diagnosis, which makes healthy people feel like they're sick.” quote from Dr. Lisa M. Schwartz of the Dartmouth Medical School. &lt;ref name=&quot;Drug Ads Sell a Problem&quot;&gt; Rowe, J. (2006, Aug 21). Drug ads sell a problem, not a solution. The Christian Science Monitor. Retrieved from http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0821/p09s01-coop.html. &lt;/ref&gt; These ads may magnify problems, implying that if you experience these symptoms, you might need medication. Therefore these direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads may also harm public health by advocating drug use as a primary response to medical conditions that can often be remedied in other ways such as diet, exercise, stress reduction, and other preventive measures.

===Ad Disclaimer===
A study from the University of Georgia, led by Dr. Wendy Macias, analyzed a week’s worth of direct-to-consumer commercials on broadcast and cable television. They found that the average 60 second commercial contained less than 8 seconds (13% of total ad time) of side effects disclaimer, while the average 30 second commercial contained less than 4.4 seconds (15% of total ad time) of disclaimers, and most of the 15 second commercial devoted no time at all to disclaimers. Almost all commercials disclosed side effect disclaimers in a voice over with 2.2% of commercials providing text form along with the voice over. &lt;ref name=&quot;TV Commercial Study&quot;&gt; University of Georgia (2008, January 4). Most TV prescription drug ads minimize risk information, study finds. Science Daily. &lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the commercial is filled with gimmicks that are used to entice consumers rather than educate them about the drug of the health condition.

===Perception of Risk===
The information and disclaimers provided during commercials is “often presented in a way that most people aren’t likely to comprehend or even pay attention to.” (quote from Dr. Wendy Macias, associate professor in the University of Georgia, Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication). &lt;ref name=&quot;TV Commercial Study&quot; /&gt; Though the FDA is supposed to regulate and review these ads, some physicians ethically criticize these direct-to-consumer advertisements because the information provided obscures information about a drug’s risk, therefore reducing the perceived health risks associated with the drug. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prescription Drug Promotion&quot;&gt; Rosenthal, M. B., Berndt, E. R., Donohue, J. M., Epstein, A. M., &amp; Frank, R. G. (2003, June). Demand effects of recent changes in prescription drug promotion. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. 1-33. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Another case where perception of risk is altered is in the advertising of withdrawal syndrome. [[w:SSRI discontinuation syndrome|Discontinuation syndrome]] is an alternative term for [[w:Antidepressant|antidepressant]] [[w:withdrawal|withdrawal]]. It was renamed in 1996, from withdrawal to discontinuation syndrome after a symposium hosted the drug manufacturer [[w:Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lily]]. Common symptoms include headache, irritability, nausea, blurred vision, sexual dysfunction, brain zaps, and bone pain. These symptoms are common to all of [[w:Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor|SSRI antidepressants]]. This renaming of [[w:Side Effect|side effects]] to an unfamiliar name, such as renaming withdrawal to discontinuation syndrome, obscures the information about the drug's risk, therefore reducing the perceived risk associated with the drug. 

Fava et al. concluded that 78% of patients who took the SSRI antidepressant [[w:Venlafaxine|Effexor]] would suffer discontinuation syndrome if they try to stop taking it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fava&quot;&gt;Fava M, Mulroy R, Alpert J, Nierenberg A, Rosenbaum J (1997). &quot;Emergence of adverse events following discontinuation of treatment with extended-release venlafaxine&quot;. Am J Psychiatry 154 (12): 1760–2&lt;/ref&gt; When a patient wants to come off Effexor, his or her doctor typically recommends first switching to another anti-depressant with a lower probability of experiencing discontinuation syndrome. It may take months to complete draw down off an SSRI antidepressant. Some patients resume taking their antidepressants due to the severity of the discontinuation symptoms.

===Health Care Costs===
It is reported that every dollar spent on these [[w: Pharmaceutical Marketing|pharmaceutical advertisements]] yields an additional 4.2 dollars in sales. The money spent on advertising prescription drugs is passed on to consumers by raising the price of these drugs. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prescription Drug Promotion&quot; /&gt;

Reports of pharmaceutical company spending shows that twice as much money is spent on advertisement than research and development. The top 25 direct-to-consumer advertised prescription brands accounted for 62% of total direct-to-consumer ad spending in 2008. &lt;ref name=&quot;Direct-to-Consumer Ad Spending&quot;&gt; Gebhart, F. (2009, April 27). DTC ad spending decreased last year. Commercial Alert. Retrieved from http://www.commercialalert.org/news/archive/2009/04/dtc-ad-spending-decreased-last-year. &lt;/ref&gt; Total pharmaceutical expenses rose from 11.4 billion in 1995 to 29.9 billion in 2006. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prescription Drug Ads&quot;&gt; Donohue, J. M., Cevasco, M., &amp; Rosenthal, M. B. (2007). A decade of direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. The New England Journal of  Medicine, 357(7), 673-681. &lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical companies are for-profit business entities whose purpose is to make money. These companies advertise prescription drugs to increase their profits, not necessarily to improve public health. The marketing tactics used in direct-to-consumer advertisements may manipulate, create false impressions, and otherwise mislead consumers instead of educating them about the drug. &lt;ref name=&quot;Direct-to-Consumer Ads&quot; /&gt;

'''Brand Name vs. [[w:Generic Drugs|Generic Drugs]]'''

Physicians usually prefer cheaper generic drugs to more expensive name-brand ones, thereby limiting pharmaceutical companies’ ability to influence physicians through traditional marketing tools. In an attempt to regain control of the retail prescription drug market, companies shifted their focus in the late 1990s from direct-to-physician to direct-to-consumer advertising. &lt;ref name=&quot;Prescription Drug Ads&quot; /&gt;
An ethical argument by critics is that these ads drive up health care costs by steering consumers to costly drugs they may not need when less expensive, generic drugs can often be just as effective. &lt;ref name=&quot;TV Commercial Study&quot; /&gt;

===Benefits of [[w:direct-to-consumer advertising|Direct-to-Consumer Advertising]]===
The results of FDA surveys showed that the proliferation of direct-to-consumer advertising has led many patients to become aware of newly available medical treatments for certain health conditions, motivating patients to ask better questions of the healthcare provider. Surveys established that a positive public health response to the advertising was that patients sought additional information about those health conditions for themselves or loved ones. &lt;ref name=&quot;Direct-to-Consumer Ads&quot; /&gt;


=Patent Extenders=
In the pharmaceutical industry, the biggest profits are secured from monopolies on brand-name drugs protected by patents.  Because of the monopoly on the drug, typical brand-name drugs can be marked up to $4.00 per dosage unit &lt;ref name=&quot;Branded drug prices soar...&quot;&gt; Beasley,  D. (2011, Mar 23). Branded drug prices soar as generic pressures rise. Reuters. Retrieved from http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/23/us-branded-drug-prices-idUSTRE72M57X20110323. &lt;/ref&gt;, therefore they are a large profit generator.  When the patent expires, the monopoly no long exists and other pharmaceutical manufacturing companies can produce essentially the same drug and sell it at significantly lower price, therefore the brand-name drug loses 85% of the market share &lt;ref name=&quot;Retaining Patent Profits&quot;&gt; Pearce III J. A. (2008, Apr 1). Retaining patent profits. Drug and Develop Magazine. Retrieved from http://www.dddmag.com/Article-Retaining-Patent-Profits.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Therefore it is economically advantageous to create patents and monopolies on pharmaceuticals for the least cost. Patent extenders are drugs which are produced by slightly altering another drug whose patent recently expired. This is typically done by slightly changing the chemical compound of the previous patent expired drug to create a &quot;new&quot; drug for which a new patent can be obtained. These drugs are often marketed as breakthrough drugs with many advantages over the patent expired drug.  However, these patent extenders are often similar or even identical to the drugs they replace. This behavior is highly unethical because, while the patient sees no additional benefit in a drug's effectiveness, they are paying a premium price for the new patented drug. As a result, pharmaceutical companies earn large profits without innovating a 'new' more beneficial drug.

There are a number of examples of patent extenders, two of which are presented below. 

===[[w:Desvenlafaxine|Pristiq]] and [[w:Venalafaxine|Effexor]]===

Pristiq is a classic example of the patent extender.  In 2008, Effexor's patent expired.  Faced with a loss of profit, [[w:Wyeth|Wyeth]] (now part of [[w:Pfizer|Pfizer]]) created Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), which is the [[w:active metabolite|active metabolite]] of Effexor (venalafaxine). Effxor and Pristiq are chemically very similar and when Effexor enters the body, the liver turns (metabolizes) it into Pristiq and then distributed via the bloodstream. That is, once these two drugs are metabolized within the body, they are chemically identical. Nonetheless, Pristiq is can be marked up to as high as $4.00 per unit, whereas the generic version can be priced as low as $0.25 per unit. Moreover, through the use of free samples and direct-to-consumer advertisements, patients are given Pristiq even though Effexor or other generic alternatives may be just as effective.

===[[w:methylphenidate|Ritalin]] and [[w:methylphenidate|Concerta]]===
Another strategy used to create patent extenders is the creation of extended release drugs. Ritalin is a psychostimulant containing [[w:methylphenidate|methylphenidate]], while Concerta is simply a capsule form of the very same substance. Nevertheless, Concerta has been patented until 2018 &lt;ref name=&quot;Concerta&quot;&gt; Generic Contra. (2011) eMedTV. Retrieved from http://adhd.emedtv.com/concerta/generic-concerta.html. &lt;/ref&gt; and marketed to parents with children who have [[w:Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD]] as a superior drug to Ritalin.

=Conclusions=
Pharmaceutical companies unethically market their drugs with the sole goal of maximizing profits. As business entities, success is measured by financial earnings and profits through pharmaceutical sales, rather than medical breakthroughs that improve overall quality of life. Thus, it is in each pharmaceutical company's interest for people to think they are ill. [[w:pharmaceutical marketing|Pharmaceutical marketing]], therefore, attempts to convince consumers that they have an illness and that a particular drug is the solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Nimbyism=

'''NIMBY''' (or Nimby), an acronym for '''Not In My Back Yard''', describes the negative reaction of community members towards projects that will negatively impact them if placed near their homes. Such projects include highways, railways, airports, landfills, hazardous waste facilities, power plants, chemical plants, housing developments, tall buildings, wind turbines, prisons, and numerous other facilities. These facilities often benefit a large group of people with their services; however they negatively impact a smaller population of citizens who live near the facilities. When citizens fight against proposed facilities near their homes, proponents of these facilities dub them &quot;Nimbyists.&quot; 

This analysis will focus particularly on hazardous waste facilities and their impact on minority groups, particularly as these cases relate to Nimbyism and Environmental Justice.

==BKK Landfill==
The term NIMBY was coined by Emilie Travel Livezey in ”Hazardous waste,” &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY&lt;/ref&gt; an article published in 1980 in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Science_Monitor The Christian Science Monitor]. Livezey states that “people are now thoroughly alert to the dangers of chemical wastes. The very thought of having even a secure landfill anywhere near them is anathema to most Americans today.” &lt;ref&gt;Emilie Travel Livezey, “Hazardous waste,” The Christian Science Monitor, November 6, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Livezey’s assertion of the American attitude towards potentially harmful landfills being located near their homes is best exemplified by the BKK Landfill case. 

The BKK Landfill, located in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Covina,_California West Covina, California], was built in 1962. During operation, the 583-acre site received over 84 Million gallons of industrial and household waste, making it California’s largest http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazardous_waste hazardous waste] management facility.&lt;ref&gt;ttp://www.westcovina.org/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=2564&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the landfill began operation, West Covina, which is 100 miles outside of Los Angeles, California, was mostly undeveloped. However, by the 1980’s there were over 40,000 residents living within a 1 mile radius of the landfill. Awareness of potential health hazards, particularly exposure to carcinogens, along with trash spills, truck accidents and foul odors raised concerns. In 1980, 7,532 residents signed a petition to close the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Dupont, Baxter &amp; Theodore, Environmental Management:Problems and Solutions, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after social activists organized protest groups to picket the entrance of the facility and organize a local ballot initiative.

Inquiries into the environmental impacts of the landfill followed local resistance. The Department of Toxic Substance Control, a department within the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Environmental_Protection_Agency California Environmental Protection Agency], studied the BKK Landfill in 1980. The study concluded that the hazardous liquids would not pose a threat as long as they were properly contained. Furthermore, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California University of Southern California’s] medical school conducted a risk assessment study in 1980 to investigate the incidence of cancer in the community surrounding the landfill. The research indicated that there was no statistically significant increase in the rate of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Projects/upload/BKK_CEQA_IS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with evidence that the site did not produce harm to the surrounding community, resistance did not stop until the facility was shut down. In early 1984, the congressional representative for West Covina demanded that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)] terminate the operation of the toxic waste disposal site at once.&lt;ref&gt;Dupont, Baxter &amp; Theodore, Environmental Management:Problems and Solutions, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; An inspection by US EPA in 1984 found underground migration of liquid waste and its by-products in every direction out of the facility &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Projects/upload/BKK_CEQA_IS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The US EPA and the California Department of Health and Safety prohibited receipt of further liquid wastes and approved plans to dig more wells to prevent contaminated ground water from leaking &lt;ref&gt;http://www.westcovina.org/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=2564&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the site was prohibited from receiving hazardous waste and in 1996 the landfill closed. Today, the site is a center for community activity, containing a [http://wikimapia.org/9370815/Big-League-Dreams-Sports-Park-West-Covina “Big League Dream”] sports complex, public golf course and other commercial development &lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanrecycler.com/0604us2.shtml)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Warren County PCB Landfill==

In 1978, a black tank trucker illegally dumped over 30,000 gallons of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)] –tainted fluids along 240 miles of roads through 14 counties of North Carolina. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciesin.org/docs/010-278/010-278chpt2.html#fn41&lt;/ref&gt; PCBs are man-made organic chemicals that can cause cancer, and adversely affect the immune system, reproductive system, nervous system, and endocrine system. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/effects.htm&lt;/ref&gt; PCBs were so dangerous that they were banned by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] in 1979. The PCB laced liquids came from the Ward Transformer Company in Raleigh, North Carolina. &lt;ref&gt;http://ncpcbarchives.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The company provided various services for transformers, switchgears and other similar kinds of electrical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/region4/waste/npl/nplnc/wardxfnc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; State officials calmed that the dumpers were attempting to evade new EPA regulations that made waste disposal more transparent and costly. 
In 1978, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hunt North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt] decided to bury the contaminated soil near the community of Afton located in Warren County, NC.&lt;ref&gt;ttp://www.ciesin.org/docs/010-278/010-278chpt2.html#fn41&lt;/ref&gt; In December of 1978, the Hunt Administration annouced that “public sentiment would not deter the state from burying the PCBs in Warren County,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_County_PCB_Landfill&lt;/ref&gt; Local citizens later deemed the site &quot;Hunt's Dump.&quot; Of the 90 sites that were considered, Warren County had the highest percentage of African-Americans (more than 84%) and ranked 97th in per capita income out of the 100 counties in NC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciesin.org/docs/010-278/010-278chpt2.html#fn41&lt;/ref&gt; In [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_for_the_People Science for the People], Ken Geiser and Gerry Waneck described the Warren County PCB siting decision:

&quot;The site at Afton was not even scientifically the most suitable. The water table of Afton,North Carolina, (site of the landfill) is only 5-10 feet below the surface, and the residents of the community derive all of their drinking water from local wells. Only the most optimistic could believe that the Afton landfill will not eventually leach into the groundwater. Unless a more permanent solution is found, it will only be a matter of time before the PCBs end up in these people's wells.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Geiser and Waneck, &quot;PCBs and Warren County,&quot; p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1982, over 500 citizen of Warren County began to protest the landfill,&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpcbarchives.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were led by local residents Ken and Deborah Ferruccio. They were joined by organizations such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Church_of_Christ United Church of Christ (UCC)].&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpcbarchives.com/)&lt;/ref&gt; The protests spurred District of Columbia Delegate, Walter E. Fauntory to begin the 1983 Study of Hazardous Waste Landfills And Their Correlation With Racial And Economic Status Of Surrounding Communities by the U.S. General Accounting Office. The study found that four out of five hazardous waste landfills in the South were in impoverished, minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpcbarchives.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations also inspired the UCC to create a Commission for Racial Justice. In 1987, the Commission produced a report, Toxic Waste and Race in the United States: A National Report on the Racial and Socioeconomic Characteristics of Communities with Hazardous Waste Sites, which concluded that race and ethnicity were the most significant factors in determining where to sit environmentally hazardous facilities. A follow-up report confirmed that a disproportionate environmental burden on communities of color had grown since the 1987 report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/envjust/ch2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

	The protests and subsequent reports attracted national media attention. Despite this public dissent, the landfill was still built.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calpeacepower.org/0302/peopleandfull.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its construction, activist organization insisted that the site must be decontaminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calpeacepower.org/0302/peopleandfull.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A life-long Afton citizen remarked that, “If I drink two glasses of this water my stomach will get upset right away” and that he believed the the landfill clean-up was not a priority because, “...we're poor and black, that’s the number one reason.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/125589/&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure from these organizations force the Hunt Administration to begin decontamination in 2001. Clean-up was completed in 2004 and cost the state 17.1 million dollars, 26 years after the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_County_PCB_Landfill&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Policy==
The environmental justice movement was sparked by the Warren County PCB Landfill case. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_justice Environmental Justice] refers to the movement to end Environmental Racism through fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people when implementing environmental policies.Citizens of Afton carried more of the burden of a hazardous material than the rest of the county. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciesin.org/docs/010-278/010-278chpt2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The community experienced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_racism Environmental Racism], a term that refers to any policy or regulation that negatively affects minority communities disproportionately. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Chavis_Muhammad Benjamin Chavis Muhammad], an prominent member of both the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Church_of_Christ United Church of Christ], coined this phrase in the 1980's in the midst of the Warren County case.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_justice Environmental Justice] refers to the movement to end Environmental Racism through fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people when implementing environmental policies. Environmental Justice is intended to prevent inequitable environmental burdens.

Title VI of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964 Civil Rights Act of 1964] ensures that all United States agencies which receive federal funds practice nondiscrimination. However, after the Warren County case garnered publicity, it was clear that further action was necessary to ensure environmental justice. On February 11, 1994, former [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton President Clinton] issued [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12898 Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Population]. This order stated that “each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12898.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The order included a timeline for development of an interagency working group and intragency regulations.

===Environmental Protection Agency===
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] leads the interagency working group outlined by [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12898 Executive Order 12898]. The working group meets monthly and is comprised of members of 15 federal agencies and several White House offices. The EPA also sponsors grants and programs to promote Environmental Justice on a national, regional and local level. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Transportation===
Responding to the Environmental Justice movement and [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12898 Executive Order 12898], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation United States Department of Transportation (DOT)] issued  the Order to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. The DOT considers Environmental Justice in all aspects of decision making, from early-stage policy and planning through construction and maintenance. The order persists through federal agencies, such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Highway_Administration Federal Highway Administration], state DOTs, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_planning_organization Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs)] and transit providers, such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Metropolitan_Area_Transit_Authority Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/ejustice/dot_ord.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=Ethical Implications of NIMBYism=

Contrasting the BKK Landfill and the Warren County case, environmental racism is apparent. In the affluent community surrounding the BKK Landfill, political leaders and government organizations reacted to the resident's concerns. However, in the poor community in Warren County, action was not taken by the government for years. The disproportionate environmental burden placed on low-income, minority communities is due to the disparity in access to political power and decision making &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciesin.org/docs/010-278/010-278chpt2.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

These cases were extreme scenarios, dealing with the health conditions of the residents surrounding the facilities. Many other NIMBY cases relate to quality of life, for instance the a new highway will produce noise and traffic and might lower property values, but will not significantly impact the health of nearby residents. These cases give &quot;Nimbyists&quot; a bad reputation. However, landfill and hazardous waste cases can impact the health of the Nimbyists who oppose them. This begs serious ethical questions, mainly, where to build these facilities and who to affect.

==Is Environmental Justice the Solution?==
Environmental Justice policies aim to evenly distribute the environmental burden of all projects. Further researchers might consider studying the effectiveness of these policies in their implementation with more recent cases. The Environmental Justice movement is moving toward and end to Environmental Racism, but it does not eliminate the effects of Nimbyism, just redistributes them.</text>

==Introduction==
[[File:Baby.jpg|135px|left|thumb|Human Life]]

Professionals make many types of decisions, but perhaps the most difficult are those that involve life and death. Sometimes fatalities are a secondary concern, for instance when a Civil Engineer designs a traffic intersection with the goal of maximizing throughput but also minimizing risk of injury or death. Other times, saving lives is the primary goal, as is the case when a governmental agency considers approving a new drug or treatment. 

When organizations and individuals make these decisions, they implicitly or explicitly determine the value of a human life. This valuation varies widely depending on calculation methods and value systems. It is not always clear which approach is the most appropriate in a given situation, which has sometimes led to controversy, like the famous case of the Ford Pinto. Some would go further and argue that any approach to valuing life is in appropriate regardless of the situation. The uncertainty surrounding the value of human life presents serious ethical concerns for those tasked with making potentially fatal decisions.

==Methods of Valuing Human Life==

===Statistical Method===

One way to determine the value of a human life is to calculate the value of a statistical life based on decision making in the labor market. Laborers' [[w:Willingness to pay|willingness to pay]] to reduce their chance of dying provides a quantitative measure of how much they value their lives. Viscusi and Gayer &lt;ref name=&quot;VG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viscusi|first1=W. Kip|last2=Gayer|first2=Ted|date=2002|title=Safety at Any Price?|journal=Regulation|volume=25|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the best way to measure workers' attitude towards risk is to compare average pay across industries that have different risk profiles. Direct and indirect surveys could also provide the same information, but are likely to be less accurate because they are strictly hypothetical. Using Vicusi and Gayer's preferred approach, workers seem to demand about $600 to take on an additional 1 in 10,000 chance of dying&lt;ref name=&quot;VG&quot; /&gt;. This suggests that the value of a human life is about $6 million. Other studies using willingness to pay put the range for the value of a human life at $3 to $8 million&lt;ref name=&quot;VG&quot; /&gt;. Even using the lower end of the range, the willingness to pay approach suggests a high value for human life, particularly compared to [[w:Present value|present value]] of lifetime earnings (PVLE). The highest value PVLE reports is $1,517,045 for males age 20-24&lt;ref name=&quot;PVLE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Max|first1=Wendy|last2=Rice|first2=Dorothy|last3=Sung|first3=Hai-Yen|last4=Michel|first4=Martha|date=2000|title=Valuing Human Life|journal=Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are several important limitations to the value derived from a market based approach. First, it is based on average salary across industries. As a result, there may be variation among individuals' valuations of risk that is not captured in this figure. Also, the figure is calculated based on actual death rates and actual compensation. However, when an employee makes a judgmental decision, he or she uses perceived risk and perceived compensation. Since compensation is almost always salary, the employee is likely to have a complete understanding of the benefits. However, public perception of fatality risk may not always accurately reflect the real risk. If employees tend to underestimate risk in a given industry, then the calculated value of a human life would be too low. For example, the table to the right displays the ten deadliest occupations in the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;BOJ&quot;&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2010). ''Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries.''&lt;/ref&gt;, several of which are typically perceived as safe jobs.

===QALYs=== 
Like any industry, the healthcare field  has limited resources and therefore must make decisions about what treatments to provide and which groups will receive them.  The decisions made reflect trade-offs between costs and benefits of one treatment as opposed to another.  To standardize this process, decision makers use a single value that takes into account both the quality and quantity of years added to an individual’s life from a given medical procedure.  One such measure is the [[w:Quality-adjusted_life_year|quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).

An example taken from a NYTimes.com article, provides a practical application of QALYs. 
“If a blind person’s quality of life is “worth” 0.75 points per year, a treatment that would restore him to perfect vision — and raise his quality of life to 1 per year — is worth 0.25 per year of life. If the person lived another 30 years, the treatment would be worth 7.5 QALYs, or 30 times 0.25.
With QALYs, that treatment would produce the equivalent of keeping 10 patients on dialysis — whose lives are also “worth” 0.75 points per year — alive for a year.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/businessspecial3/11life.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this analysis, and the option to restore one blind person’s vision (who would on average continue to live for another 30 years) or to keep 10 patients alive on dialysis (for one year), the decision should be based on whichever has the lower overall cost.
However, it is not typical for two cases to be compared side-by-side like the previous example.  Instead, organizations like insurance companies will use dollar cost per QALY as a measure of whether or not to provide a treatment to an individual.  Some may argue that it is unethical to deny someone a treatment that could save their life.  However, others respond that it is unethical to provide expensive treatments to someone that (with the treatment) would only live a few more months, when, for the same cost, a number of lives could be extended for years.  As an example, some cancer medicines cost as much as $1.4 million per QALY, while “some people without insurance do not have access to cholesterol-lowering drugs, which cost just a few thousand dollars per QALY.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/businessspecial3/11life.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful, then, to have a benchmark cost per QALY against which insurance companies and other healthcare providers can assess a treatment’s added value.  In Great Britain, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) values 6 additional months of life at $22,000 dollars and does not fund treatments whose cost per six months exceeds this number &lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124692973435303415.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In the wall street journal opinion article that mentioned this benchmark, the comparison is made between Britain’s healthcare system and President Obama’s proposed “ObamaCare” and asserts that while Obama wants to spend less on healthcare, he intentionally fails to explain &quot;how [other countries] ration care to [reduce costs]” &lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124692973435303415.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The article concludes that “the inevitable result…will be some version of a NICE board that will tell millions of Americans that they are too young, or too old, or too sick to be worth paying to care for.”  For an article with such an apparent and emotional claim, the 141 comments on the article (as of April 2011) tend to portray respondents as more reasonable and understanding of the inherent limitations of the healthcare system.  David Siktberg sums up the argument very nicely in his response to another commenter.  “You write as if it is a crime to consider the value of very expensive treatments, and their efficacy. We all must die one day, and it is inappropriate to spend public funds (or communal funds in a private health insurance system) attempting to defer inevitable death at any cost and under any circumstance.&quot;

==Cases==
===Pinto=== 
[[File:1974 Ford Pinto.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Pinto]]
Shortly after the release of the 1971 [[w:Ford Pinto|Pinto]], [[w:Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company]] identified a defect in the fuel system that would result in destruction of the vehicle under certain circumstances. Ford was also aware of a modification that would fix this problem, at a cost of approximately $11 per vehicle. In order to assess if the modification should be implemented, Ford performed an industry standard cost-benefit analysis. Ford estimated that fixing the defect would result in a benefit to society of approximately 180 less burn deaths, 180 less serious burn injuries, and 2,100 less burned vehicles. Ford used the standard costs provided by the National Highway Transit Safety Authority (NHTSA) to complete this part of the analysis, resulting in a figure of $49.5 million. With 11 million cars and 1.5 million trucks on the road at the time of the analysis, a fix would have cost $137 million. After performing the analysis, Ford decided not to implement the fix.

When the extra accidents occurred as a result of the decision, many of the victims sued Ford. The most notable of these cases was Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company. This case arose when Lily Gray was driving with thirteen year old Matthew Grimshaw in May of 1972. The car was rear ended, and the resulting fire killed Lily Gray and left Matthew Grimshaw with serious, disfiguring burn injuries. Predictably, both victims were awarded damages to compensate them for their losses. The family of Lily Gray was awarded $560,000, and Matthew Grimshaw was awarded $2.5 million. However, the most important aspect of the case occurred when the internal Ford cost-benefit analysis document was admitted into evidence. The jury was outraged by the cold, calculating mindset displayed in the document, and awarded $125 million in punitive damages in order to deter Ford Motor Company from similar acts. The judge later reduced these punitive damages to $3.5 million. The large discrepancy between the jury's reaction and judge's reaction may represent the difference between the emotional response and the logical response, but the point is salient nonetheless. Many members of the public find it abhorrent that companies put a price on the value of their lives.

==Public Opinion on Valuing Human Life==
Public opinion and professional opinion often disagree about how much a human life is worth. For instance, even after educational focus groups, 10% of respondents felt that cost effectiveness analysis should never be used to determine public health decisions &lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gold|first1=Marthe|last2=Sofaer|first2=Shoshanna|last3=Siegelberg|first3=Taryn|date=2007|title=Medicare And Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Time To Ask The Taxpayers|journal=Health Affairs|volume=26|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This implies an unwillingness to assign dollar values to life, even if it results in more effective health care overall. Research also suggests that common psychological decision biases affect perception of the value of a life. In particular, people are irrationally sensitive to percent savings when valuing human life, so saving 1,000 out of 2,000 people is preferred to saving 1,000 out of 90,000 although the total life saved is the same&lt;ref name=&quot;Fether&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fetherstonhaugh|first1=David|last2=Slovic|first2=Paul|last3=Johnson|first3=Stephen|last4=Friedrich|first4=James|date=1997|title=Insensitivity to the Value of Human Life: A Study of Psychophysical Numbing|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=14|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When it comes to the healthcare industry, it is very easy to consider the cost-benefit analysis of providing healthcare until the decisions hit home.  In the comments section of the previously mentioned Wall Street Journal article about Great Britain's healthcare system, Brad Gronek says “Under the English [NICE] system, my mother, who had Multiple Sclerosis, would not have been around to raise my brother and sister.”
Anthony Reid recounts that “Watching my dad suffer through his last year with cancer, I can tell you the patient has zero say in whether a treatment is worth the price.” These difficulties suggest that valuing human life will continue to be an ethical challenge for professionals for years to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
It should be noted that although these movements are named, due to the infinite possibilities of an environment, there is an infinite variation in the number of movements which can be applied as different situations will require adaption. Another important factor is that because parkour emphasizes efficiency, although several movements may be used to cross an obstacle, the fastest is considered to be the &quot;best&quot; parkour.  Just as a martial artist may not pick the most suited movement in the heat of the moment, a practitioner of parkour may use a less efficient movement while missing a potentially more efficient option, be it because of lack of experience or a misjudgment of the obstacle to be overcome. Nonetheless, the ultimate goal of parkour is to minimize these misjudgements and be as efficient as possible as often as possible. On-the-spot judgment thus becomes an important part of the practice.

==Movement-Related Differences==
Many traceurs, including a large majority of veterans and those who learn from them, have foregone certain movements in training. Specifically, most traceurs do not practice drops higher than 6 feet or any rooftop jumping. This is to better preserve the body and the image of Parkour, so that spreading the art becomes easier to do. It has also become somewhat of a debate as to whether or not drops should be considered a &quot;move&quot; at all. It should be noted that some traceurs still practice drops and rooftops.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Proposition 99''' is an initiative statute which appeared on the November 8th, 1988 California general election ballot, as the ''Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act''.  It was passed by a majority vote of the electorate.  Its primary effect is to impose a 25-cent per pack state excise tax on the sale of tobacco cigarettes within California, with approximately equivalent excise taxes similarly imposed on the retail sale of other commercial tobacco products, such as cigars and chewing tobacco.  Additional restrictions placed on the sale of tobacco include a ban on cigarette vending machines in public areas accessible by juveniles, and a ban on the individual sale of single cigarettes.  Revenue generated by the act was earmarked for various environmental and health care programs, and anti-tobacco advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Tobacco/Documents/CTCPProp99Initiative.pdf California Department of Public Health. &quot;Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988&quot; (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Proponents of the act believe it is a useful public health measure which discourages tobacco use by Californians.  Critics of the act contend that it is a regressive tax which punishes the disproportionately working class smokers, rather than the multi-billion dollar tobacco industry, and that the anti-smoking education program constitutes political propaganda.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The word ''ki''==

The word ''[[wikt:ki|ki]]'' is a relative pronoun that means &quot;which&quot; or &quot;that&quot;, as you have learned [[Haitian Creole/Basic Grammar|previously]], as in &quot;the person ''that'' is over there&quot;. It also is an adjective that means &quot;which&quot; or &quot;what&quot;, as in &quot;''which'' one do you need?&quot;, equivalent to the French ''[[wikt:quel|quel]]''. It is ''not'' used as a pronoun, as in &quot;''which'' is bigger?&quot;. It is used as follows:

:''Ki peyi sa ye?'' What country is that?
:''Ki manje ou fè?'' Which food do you want?

===Other uses===

This word is used in conjunction with other nouns to form the equivalents of other (pronoun &amp; adverb) question words. 

{|
|
* ''ki jan'' = what manner = how
* ''ki kote'' = what place = where
* ''ki bò'' = what place = where
|
* ''ki lè'' = what hour = when
* ''ki moun'' = what person = who/whom
* ''ki sa'' = what ''pron.'' (''Sa'' is not the usual word for &quot;thing&quot;, however; ''bagay'' is.)
* ''poukisa'' = for what = why
|}

* Note: often you can find the word ''ki'' used as a prefix: ''kijan'', ''kimoun'', ''kisa''.

Examples:
:''Ki jan ou rele?'' How are you called? = What is your name?
:''Kimoun ou ye?'' Who are you?
:''Poukisa yo pa vle ale?'' Why don't they want to go?

===Use of ''ye''===
The use of question words triggers [[w:wh-movement|wh-movement]], placing the verb at the end. This causes the word ''[[wikt:se|se]]'' (to be) to turn into ''[[wikt:ye|ye]]'', as you learned [[Haitian Creole/Se|previously]].

I created the structure for the Open Educational Resources page.  Additionally, I inserted the OER Logo image and input the content in the Pros v. Cons and Support sections, as well as the corresponding references.  I was a little rusty on my programming language and was surprised the various instructions and help for adding reference links or inserting the image were not more user friendly.  However, once I got it going and figured those hiccups out things went well and I was happy with the outcome.  Wikibooks is quite an interesting endeavor, if passionate about a topic I would definitely utilize this in the future to add content.

=== Peer comment: Peggy ===
Nice job Andrea. I really liked the Pros v. Cons section. And I had the same problem with trying to insert an image - and the image was already a part of WikiMedia! When I read the help section it sounded like you would have to have someone else insert the picture for you - is that true?


=== Peer Comment: Teresa ===
Nice page!  Very informative.  I like that you addressed the financial issue, I was wondering how these resources are able to provide the free availability.  Informing of the uses by major educational institutions also makes the OER more trustworthy.

=== Peer Comment by Jenn B. === 
Nice job of creating your page, especially as yours was from scratch.  You laid out a nice framework for others to now add to what you have created.

=== Peer Comment: Courtney ===
Very good job creating your page!  Very well-organized, informative, and easy to read!

=== Peer Comment:  Michele ===
Nice job with this!  I too was concerned with the quality and knowing that it is rated by others really helps.  I may look into this just for self-education.  Thanks!

=== Peer Comment:  Louise ===
Yes, very nice work!  I found the learning curve to be fairly easy - once I got over a bump or two, I could easily add content with various font settings.

=== Peer Comment: Tom S. ===
Great job!  This project would definitely be much harder when needed to start from scratch.  You laid out a clear, clean overview of the OER.

== Julie's Contribution ==

I added the information in the &quot;Defined&quot; and &quot;Initiatives&quot; sections.  This was all new to me, and I am grateful that Andrea set up the skeleton format.  This activity is definitely something that I would like to practice a bit more and eventually introduce to my class.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Area Between Two Curves===
&lt;p&gt;The area between two curves can be more easily states as the area between two graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this you must take the antiderivative of the two functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is denoted by have a capital letter such as &lt;math&gt;F(x) \quad and \quad G(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take the graphs &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x^{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us also take the area between 2 and 4 as denoted by &lt;math&gt;2 \leq A \leq 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{2}^{4}x^{2}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)*x^{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)*x^{4}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now evaluate the antiderivatives from 2 to 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x)=[\left ( \frac{1}{3} \right ) *4^3]-[\left (\frac{1}{3} \right) *2^3]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x)=[\left(\frac{1}{3} \right)*64]-[\left(\frac{1}{3} \right)*8]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x)=[\left(\frac{64}{3} \right)]-[\left(\frac{8}{3} \right)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\left(\frac{56}{3} \right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we will evaluate the antiderivative G(x)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;G(x)=[\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)*4^4]-[\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)*2^4]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;G(x)=[\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)*256]-[\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)*16]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;G(x)=[64]-[4]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;G(x)=60&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we take '''F(x)-G(x)''' to find the area between the two curves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{56}{3}\right)-\left(\frac{180}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(-\frac{124}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;math&gt;2 \leq A \leq 4&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x^3&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left(-\frac{124}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A definite integral can also be defined as

&lt;p&gt;The area under the curve is found by finding [a,b]&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Evaluating a Definite Integral===

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have the parabola '''&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;''' and you want to find the area from x=2 to x=4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;2 \leq A \leq 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{2}^{4}x^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take the integral of the function you have to do the opposite that of the derivative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the variable x will have a number added to it.  So, &lt;math&gt;x^{(a+1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the number gets inverted and brought out front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a+1} * x^{(a+1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{2}^{4}x^{2}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we integrate and plug (b) into the indefinite integral and subtract the integral from (a) plugged into the indefinite integral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;[\frac{1}{3}*4^{3}]-[\frac{1}{3}*2^{3}]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we evaluate the integral&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;[\frac{1}{3}*64]-[\frac{1}{3}*8]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;[\frac{64}{3}]-[\frac{8}{3}]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{56}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{56}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;center&gt; is the area underneath the curve from 2 to 4.  In other words &lt;math&gt;2 \leq A \leq 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual Basic allows you to do many things with strings.  This is particularly important if you are wantint to extract data from text, search text, or generally manipulate text.  Some of the functions you might be interested in are:
*ToUpper 'converts the entire string into Upper case
*ToLower 'converts the entire string into Lower case
*Split 'splits a string into different parts, see below
For the exam you are dealing with a CSV file.  This has '''comma''' separated values, so we might have to find the data that is hiding in the commas.  Take a look at the example below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;    
Sub Main()
        Dim temp As String
        temp = &quot;Henry,45,Michael,34,Sara,67,Barry,90&quot;

        Dim fields() As String

        'load the fields array with all the items
        fields = Split(temp, &quot;,&quot;) ' split the temp string into array elements depending on where it finds the comma

        ' loop through each of the items in the array fields and print them on separate lines
        For i = 0 To UBound(fields) 'UBound gets the number of items in the array fields, in this case 7 (0-7, 8 items)
            Console.WriteLine(Trim$(fields(i))) ' Trim takes off all the extra white spaces
        Next

        Console.ReadLine()

    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
Output:
 Henry
 45
 Michael
 34
 Sara
 67
 Barry
 90

When you add information it's really important that you reference where you took it from so it's actually valid. -Melissa
==  ==
I want to congratulate the three of you on being the first to break ground on our wikibook!
-PN


For some reason my References aren't automatically showing up in a section on the bottom of the page. -Melissa


Hey, so the other chapters' references do show up on the Latest draft page. I don't know what they're doing different. I think what you're doing is correct. Lemme look into it some more. -Nikhita


Okay, I got it! We had to place a tag where we want our references to appear. I don't think we had to do that last time. It's all good now :-)     - Nikhita


Alright, I have revised and copy-edited the chapter the best I could. I had to eliminate a lot of words/facts to cut down the words. Its 3:50pm now on Friday.. I am signing off from here. I think all looks good now! -- Nikhita


== Suggestions ==

&lt;/b&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;Elaborate on sabotage, or eliminate theory completely to improve flow&lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;Make clear what MIC is&lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;More quotes (????)&lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color: grey;&quot;&gt;Talk about working conditions&lt;/p&gt;


I think we've covered the grey(ed) points. -- Nikhita

== To Do: ==


#&lt;p style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;Need more in &quot;Bad Decisions&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt; Write &quot;Chain of events&quot; section &lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt; Write &quot;Conclusion&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt; Revise&lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;p style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt; Copy edit&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== beta index ==

The beta index (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) measures the connectivity relating the number of edges to the number of nodes. It is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac{e}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

where e = number of edges (links), v = number of vertices (nodes)

The greater the value of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the greater the connectivity. As transport networks develop and become more efficient, the value of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; should rise.

== cyclomatic number ==

The cyclomatic number (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) is the maximum number of independent cycles in a graph.

&lt;math&gt;u=e-v+p&lt;/math&gt;

where  p = number of graphs or subgraphs.

== alpha index ==

The alpha index (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) is the ratio of the actual number of circuits in a network to the maximum possible number of circuits in that network. It is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{u}{2v-5}&lt;/math&gt;

Values range from 0%—no circuits—to 100%—a completely interconnected network.



== gamma index ==

The gamma index (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) measures the connectivity in a network. It is a measure of the ratio of the number of edges in a network to the maximum number possible in a planar network (&lt;math&gt;3(v-2)&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{e}{3(v-2)}&lt;/math&gt;

The index ranges from 0 (no connections between nodes) to 1.0 (the maximum number of connections, with direct links between all the nodes).

== Completeness ==

The number of links in a real world network is typically less than the maximum number of links and the completeness index used here captures this difference.  This measure is estimated at the metropolitan level. 

&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{complete} = \frac{e}{e_{max}} = \frac{e}{{v^2}-{v}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; refers to the number of links or street segments in the network and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; refers to the number of intersections or nodes in the network.  Compare with the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; index above.

== König number ==

The König number (or associated number) is the number of edges from any node in a network to the furthest node from it. This is a topological measure of distance, in edges rather than in kilometres. A low associated number indicates a high degree of connectivity; the lower the König number, the greater the [[Transportation Geography and Network Science/Centrality | Centrality]] of that node.

== eta index ==
The eta index (&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;) measure the length of the graph over the number of edges.

&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{L(G)}{e} &lt;/math&gt;

== theta index  ==
The theta index  (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) measure the traffic (Q(G)) per vertex.

&lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{Q(G)}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

== iota index ==
The iota index (&lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;) measures the ratio between the length of its network and its weighted vertices.

&lt;math&gt; \iota=\frac{L(G)}{W(G)} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; W(G)=1,\forall o=1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; W(G)=\sum_{e}2*o,\forall o&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Utility-Based Measure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Accessibility''' refers to the ease of reaching destinations. People who are in places that are highly accessible can reach many other activities or destinations quickly, people in inaccessible places can reach fewer places in the same amount of time.

A measure that is often used is to measure accessibility in a transportation analysis zone ''i'' is:

&lt;math&gt;
Accessibility_i  = \sum_j {Opportunities_j } \times f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; = index of origin zones
* &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = index of destination zones
* &lt;math&gt;f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)&lt;/math&gt; = function of generalized travel cost (so that nearer or less expensive places are weighted more than farther or more expensive places).

This is sometimes in contrast with '''Access''' which is a binary indicator of whether a destination can be reached on a network.

We use the Figure  to first introduce accessibility as a network concept.  As shown on the top, there are two cities (or nodes), city A and city B.  There are therefore two travel markets: A-B and B-A.  The middle case adds one city, and one link, but greatly increases the number of travel markets: A-B and B-A remain, but A-C and C-A, and B-C and C-B are added (we increased by four markets to a total of six).  One link tripled the number of Origin-Destination (O-D) pairs served.  The bottom case adds one more link (for a total of 3), but the number of markets again increases significantly: we still have A-B, B-A, A-C, C-A, B-C, and C-B; but now we also have A-D, D-A, B-D, D-B, and C-D and D-C.  The number of markets doubled (we increased by 6 markets to a total of 12).


[[Image:TGNS_NetSize.png |thumb|right| Networks to illustrate size]]


This phenomenon, dubbed the “Law of the Network” (and in a computer networking context, Metcalfe’s Law) can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;S=N(N-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:	

S = the size of the network (number of markets)

N = the number of nodes

(To illustrate: with 2 nodes: S = 2*1 = 2, with 3 nodes: S = 3*2 = 6, with 4 nodes: S = 4*3 =12, etc.) 

The value of S grows non-linearly as nodes are added to the network, until all nodes are connected.  Clearly there is increasing value to the network as it gets larger.  Since people are willing to pay more for goods of higher value, we would expect that people would pay more to belong to a larger network (live in a larger city). 

Accessibility (A) differs from Network Size (S), in that accessibility multiplies each interaction by a function of the travel cost, such that far away interactions have less weight than nearby interactions.  Accessibility also replaces the simple measure, number of nodes, with a slightly more sophisticated measure, e.g. number of jobs, to measure employment accessibility (or number of workers to measure labor force accessibility).  This allows us to see how well the system connects workers with jobs.

== Cumulative Opportunities ==
=== Specification ===
The isochronic or cumulative opportunity measure is one of the basic and early measures discussed in the literature (Vickerman, 1974; Wachs &amp; Kumagai, 1973).  This approach counts the number of potential opportunities that can be reached within a predetermined travel time (or distance).  

&lt;math&gt;A_i = Sum_j B_j * a_j&lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;A_i &lt;/math&gt; 		Accessibility measured at point i to potential activity in zone j

&lt;math&gt; a_j&lt;/math&gt;		Opportunities in zone j

&lt;math&gt; B_j&lt;/math&gt;		A binary value equals to 1 if zone  is within the predetermined threshold and 0 otherwise
  
For instance this measure can be used to identify the number of recreational opportunities around a residential location i  that are within 400 meters (approximately one quarter mile) of network distance (zone j).  This measure does not account for the size of the facility (attractiveness) or the impedance of reaching it (cost).  It is widely used in hedonic modeling to control for access to neighborhood amenities.  It is simple to understand and calculate, but makes an artificial distinction that opportunities 399 meters away are valuable, while those 401 meters away have no value.

=== Illustration ===
[[Image:TGNS_TC-Cumop.png|thumb|right| Number of jobs within 10 minutes of travel time by automobile during the morning peak in 2000]]

The isochronic or cumulative opportunity measure counts the number of potential opportunities that can be reached within a predetermined travel time (or distance). The Figure  shows the cumulative opportunity measure of accessibility to jobs for the Twin Cities metropolitan region measured at 10 minutes of travel time during the morning peak hour from origins.

Planners and non-professionals can easily interpret this measure. A main point of weakness of the measure is that it does not account for people’s actual choices of residence and employment location. Also it equally weights people within the same bin of travel time without considering the attractiveness of the areas where they reside or where they are employed. A similar measure can be produced for various time ranges.  It is noticed from the figures the increase in the number of opportunities with the increase in travel time. Around 70% of the Transportation Analysis Zones had more than 1,281,710 jobs within a 50 minute travel time, which indicates the current level of accessibility in the region. 

Similarly cumulative opportunity measures can be produced for other destinations (besides jobs). 

== Gravity-based Measure ==

=== Specification ===

The gravity-based measure discussed in (Hansen, 1959) is still the most widely used general method for measuring accessibility, although it is more complex in calculations and has some points of weaknesses. 

 
&lt;math&gt;A_{im}=\sum\limits_{j}^{{}}{O_{j}f(C_{ijm})}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;A_{im}=\sum\limits_{j}^{{}}{O_{j}C_{ijm}^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;A_{im}=\sum\limits_{j}^{{}}{O_{j}\exp (\theta C_{ijm})}&lt;/math&gt;


Where

&lt;math&gt;A_{im}&lt;/math&gt;  		Accessibility at point i to potential activity at point j using mode m

  
&lt;math&gt;O_{j}&lt;/math&gt;		The opportunities at point j 

 
&lt;math&gt;f(C_{ijm})&lt;/math&gt;	The impedance or cost function to travel between i and j using mode m

 
&lt;math&gt;\exp (\theta C_{ijm})&lt;/math&gt;	Negative exponential function to travel between i and j using mode m

The differences between various studies of accessibility that utilize this method are mainly in functional forms that measure the cost to move between origin and destination and how opportunities are calculated.  The opportunities can be the frequency of bus service when measuring accessibility to transit service, while it can be the number of employees when measuring the accessibility to work, or park size when measuring accessibility open space.  The accessibility measure is expected to increase with the increase in the opportunity measure.  The summation is used so as to include all potential sites j that might encompass desired activities.  In other words, if we are measuring accessibility to the Mall of America in the Twin Cities, the total number of individual sites j (denoted with a capital J) will be equal to one since only one Mall of America exists in the Twin Cities.  Meanwhile measuring accessibility to shopping malls in the same region will require calculating the previous function to all shopping malls in the region, while using a factor such as number of stores or mall area or retail employees as the potential variable to differentiate between the various shopping mall sizes.  This is done using each shopping mall as a destination j then calculating the accessibility variables for each  until we have J (J=total number of destinations) values of accessibility to be summed at the end of the process.  

Accessibility is expected to decline the farther the opportunities are from the origin.  Much of the literature defines impedance using a negative exponential function.  When we say “farther” that can be in terms of time or distance or generalized cost.

The previous equation is applied to measure accessibility using a single transportation mode m. Accessibility can be measured in the same manner for various modes of transportation then a comparison can be conducted.  For example accessibility to jobs can be measured using automobiles, public transit and bicycling.  The findings can then be compared to identify underserved areas or locations that need more attention in terms of accessibility using a certain mode.  

Major disadvantages of this accessibility measure are the need to develop an impedance factor (though coefficients from destination choice or trip distribution models already estimated for regional transportation planning models are often used), and the appropriate weights for the destination (e.g. should retail be number of stores, number of retail jobs, or area).  Combining the modes is also difficult.  One might use one of the following composite measures:
 
&lt;math&gt;A_{i}=\sum\limits_{j}^{{}}{\sum\limits_{m}^{{}}{O_{j}M_{ijm}}f(C_{ijm})}&lt;/math&gt; 

where:

&lt;math&gt;M_{ijm}&lt;/math&gt; = share of mode m in market ij (0-1)

But in the above the mode share in a market also depends on the cost of travel, so the analysis weights travel costs doubly. We could use

&lt;math&gt;A_{i}=\sum\limits_{j}^{{}}{\sum\limits_{m}^{{}}{O_{j}f(C_{ijm})}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we could introduce a new mode and instantly increase accessibility, even if the new mode was essentially identical to existing modes.



One might simply want to say something like this:

&lt;math&gt;A_{i}=\sum\limits_{m}^{{}}{A_{im}M_{im}}&lt;/math&gt;

or
 
&lt;math&gt;A_{i}=\max \left( A_{im} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


But these equations ( use mode share at the origin, while mode share is a trip (origin and destination-based) phenomenon, so these measures lose information.

[[Image: TGNS_TC-Gravity_negexp.png |thumb|right| Gravity-based accessibility to jobs by auto in the Twin Cities region in 2000 using a negative exponential impedance function]]

The gravity-based measure developed by Hansen (1959) is still the most widely used general method for measuring accessibility, although it is complex in calculations and has some points of weaknesses. The Figure shows the Twin Cities metropolitan region with the gravity-based accessibility measured to jobs in the region (following equation 3b).  The accessibility levels are shown in shades of color. The unit of analysis used in developing this measure is the TAZs, while using the reciprocal of the square of travel time between each TAZ as the impedance function.  The attractiveness of a TAZ is calculated based on the number of jobs reported by the LEHD dataset that was previously used in the previous figure. The reciprocal of travel time squared, a common and widely used impedance function, is used as the impedance value when calculating this measure of accessibility.  


Major disadvantages of this accessibility measure are the need to develop an impedance factor (though coefficients from destination choice or trip distribution models already estimated for regional transportation planning models are often used), and the appropriate weights for the destination (e.g. should retail be number of stores, number of retail jobs, or area). Combining the modes is also difficult.

First it is important to note that comparing accessibility measures should be done in a relative manner and not through comparing numbers directly. It is clear from comparing Figures 5 and 6 that similarities exist between the two measures of accessibility. TAZs with high levels of accessibility in the cumulative opportunities map tend to have high numbers of jobs within the 10 minutes travel time range in the gravity map. Both maps indicate centralization in the level of accessibility to jobs in the Twin Cities region similar to the centralization observed in the 10 minutes cumulative opportunity measure of accessibility. A statistical analysis conducted later in this report shows the relationship between these measures. It is clear that areas with high levels of accessibility to jobs are located in the area including and surrounding the two major downtowns in the region (Minneapolis and Saint Paul).

Another alternative is to change the impedance function used in generating the gravity-based measure of accessibility. Figure 7 shows the level of accessibility to jobs in the Twin Cities region using travel time and an exponential function with &lt;math&gt;\theta= -0.1 &lt;/math&gt; (following equation 3c) multiplied by the travel time between each TAZ of origin and destination.


The process of selecting the appropriate impedance function is complicated and requires several trials. The reciprocal of travel time squared was the first function used (following Newton’s Laws of Gravity).  Some researchers generate various impedance functions and include them as part of a land value analysis to reach the most appropriate measure that is statistically most correlated with land value (and thus how people perceive the effect of transportation on land). This concept is explored later in the report.

Similarly an accessibility measure to the number of employees in a region can be developed to measure the ease of jobs reaching their potential employees. 


== Utility-Based Measure ==

The most complex and data intensive is the utility-based measure.  Several researchers use this method since it adheres to travel behavior theories (Ben-Akiva &amp; Lermand, 1977; Neuburger, 1971). The general specification of the measure is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;A_n^i=ln[\sum_{\forall C_n} exp(V_{n(c)})]&lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;A_n^i&lt;/math&gt;  	Accessibility measured for individual n measure at location i

&lt;math&gt;V_{n(c)}&lt;/math&gt;  	Observable temporal and spatial component of indirect utility of choice c for person n

&lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;  	Choice set of person n

This measure incorporates individual traveler preferences as part of the accessibility measure compared to the gravity model where the variation is not present across people living in the same zone. The gravity model implies that all people in zone i will experience the same level of accessibility.  In reality people choose destination &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to maximize benefit. This is done through comparing the benefits from going to &lt;math&gt;j_1&lt;/math&gt; to the benefit of going to &lt;math&gt;j_2&lt;/math&gt;.  

For example suppose we are measuring accessibility to grocery stores.  A person n will choose shop c based on prices and other factors like cleanliness of the store. Still other choices are available for this person, who weights going to this one as more valuable than the others.  This measure imitates the human choice since the attractiveness of each destination is included.  It is based on economic benefits that people derive from having access to certain activities. This measure has several advantages yet its complexity and data intensity are the main barriers to implementing it.

== Constraints-Based Measure ==

High levels of accessibility to various activities in a city can be present, yet the amount of time available in a day that people can spend to reach these activities might not.  This leads to the constraints-based measure or people-based measure of accessibility (Wu &amp; Miller, 2002). For example if a person is at node i at time t1 while at time t2 the same individual has to return to i then the time t = t2 - t1 constrains the number of j destinations available. 

== Composite Accessibility Measure ==

A fifth measure is the composite accessibility measure. A composite measure is suggested by (Harvey Miller, 1999) where he combines space-time and utility-based measures in one measure.  This approach introduces a higher level of complexity where time constraints are superimposed.  The composite accessibility measure requires more data than utility-based measures and it is even more complex in terms of calculations and accordingly generalizing it for usage is not an easy task.

[[Image:TGNS_NetworkDistance.png|thumb|right180px|Network Distance]]

'''Circuity''' is the ratio of network to Euclidean distance (its reciprocal is '''Directness''')

The presence of a transportation system (including networks and modes) dissuades people from  traveling to their destinations in a straight line by providing the opportunity to move faster if more circuitously; while buildings, and other infrastructure (including transportation networks when they act as barriers), and features of nature such as rivers and mountains may constrain the direction of movement.  

Distances in transportation research can be measured using geographic information systems (GIS) in three forms: Euclidean distance, network distance, and Manhattan distance.  Manhattan distance is not commonly used in transportation research since it is generally meaningful only on a grid system, which holds strictly in few urban contexts.  Euclidean distance is the airline distance measured between origins and destinations &quot;as the crow flies&quot;, while the network distance, which is a more realistic representation of movements between origins and destinations, is the distance between origins and destinations measured along a transportation network, usually using the shortest path  (Miller 2001), these are shown in the figures. 


== Evidence ==
Love and Morris (1979) estimate road distance between two points using analytic models primarily for facilities location problems.   Newell (1980) indicated that network distance measured for a randomly selected set of points in an urban environment is about 1.2 times the Euclidean distance. Other research O'Sullivan (1996) finds circuity factors of 1.21 to 1.23 at various transit station catchment areas.  The measure has also been used at the national level Ballou (2002), and for pedestrian and bicycle travel (dubbed pedestrian route directness) (Dill 2003), with much higher values than  observed for automobile travel.  The measure has also been considered by Wolf (2004)  using GPS traces of actual travelers route selections, finding that many actual routes experience much higher circuity than might be expected. Samaniego and Moses (2008) find that road networks are built as if traffic is completely decentralized, while travel itself remains mixed between centrality (all destinations in a central business district) and decentralization (trips go to the nearest destination), perhaps explaining some of the observed circuity. Selection of any random pair of points in an urban environment and measuring circuity (the ratio of network to Euclidean distances) may lead to a different answer than the circuity experienced from an actual selection of an origin and destination by locator-travelers. 

A question that arises is whether the differences between Euclidean distance and network distance are small and constant.  Levinson and El-Geneidy (2009) test that proposition, positing that this assumption only holds when variation in the network is minor and when self-selection is not present.  The issue of self-selection has largely been neglected in analysis of network circuity.  While it is commonly understood that residents choose homes considering attributes of accessibility to work, shopping, schools, amenities, quality of neighborhood life, availability of public service, quality of the house (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) and costs of living, the implications of this for measurement of circuity have not previously been noted in the literature. An analysis of circuity bears on the question of home-work location.

Levinson and El-Geneidy (2009) show that circuity measured through randomly selected origins and destinations exceeds circuity measured from actual home-work pairs.  Workers tend to choose commutes with lower circuity, applying intelligence to their home location decisions compared to their work.  The authors posit this is because locators wish to achieve the largest residential lot for the shortest commute time, all else equal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Whiptail''' is a program that allows shell scripts to display [[w:Dialog box|dialog boxes]] to the user for informational purposes, or to get input from the user in a friendly way. Whiptail is included by default on [[w:Debian|Debian]].
:From the [http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/w.html Linux Dictionary]: whiptail is a &quot;dialog&quot; replacement using newt instead of ncurses.
:From its README: whiptail is designed to be drop-in compatible with dialog(1), but has less features: some dialog boxes are not implemented, such as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.

==Info box==
A simple type of dialog box in Whiptail is the ''info box''. This shows a dialog box containing text to the user.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
whiptail --title &quot;Example Dialog&quot; --infobox &quot;This is an example of an info box.&quot; 8 78
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, the value of &lt;tt&gt;--title&lt;/tt&gt; is displayed at the top of the dialog box. The first argument to &lt;tt&gt;--infobox&lt;/tt&gt; is the dialog box text which is shown beneath the title. The next two arguments specify the height and width of the dialog box. The width is set to 78 as most terminals will be at least 80 columns or more.

==Message box==
A message box is very similar to an info box, except that it waits for the user to hit the OK button. Usage is similar to the info box:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
whiptail --title &quot;Example Dialog&quot; --msgbox &quot;This is an example of a message box. You must hit OK to continue.&quot; 8 78
&lt;/source&gt;

==Yes/no box==
The simplest way to get input from the user is via a Yes/no box. This displays a dialog with two buttons labelled Yes and No.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
whiptail --title &quot;Example Dialog&quot; --yesno &quot;This is an example of a yes/no box.&quot; 8 78

exitstatus=$?
if [ $exitstatus = 0 ]; then
    echo &quot;User selected Yes.&quot;
else
    echo &quot;User selected No.&quot;
fi

echo &quot;(Exit status was $exitstatus)&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Input box==
A way to get free-form input from the user is via an input box. This displays a dialog with two buttons labelled Ok and Cancel.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
INIT=Blue
COLOR=$(whiptail --inputbox &quot;What is your favorite Color?&quot; 8 78 $INIT --title &quot;Example Dialog&quot; 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3)

exitstatus=$?
if [ $exitstatus = 0 ]; then
    echo &quot;User selected Ok and entered &quot; $COLOR
else
    echo &quot;User selected Cancel.&quot;
fi

echo &quot;(Exit status was $exitstatus)&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Text box==

==Menus==
Whenever you want to present a list of options to the user, whiptail has several dialog types to choose from.

A '''menu''' should be used when you want the user to select one option from a list, such as for navigating a program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
whiptail --title &quot;Menu example&quot; --menu &quot;Choose an option&quot; 20 78 16 \
&quot;&lt;-- Back&quot; &quot;Return to the main menu.&quot; \
&quot;Add User&quot; &quot;Add a user to the system.&quot; \
&quot;Modify User&quot; &quot;Modify an existing user.&quot; \
&quot;List Users&quot; &quot;List all users on the system.&quot; \
&quot;Add Group&quot; &quot;Add a user group to the system.&quot; \
&quot;Modify Group&quot; &quot;Modify a group and its list of members.&quot; \
&quot;List Groups&quot; &quot;List all groups on the system.&quot; 

&lt;/source&gt;

The values given to --menu are:
* The text describing the menu (&lt;tt&gt;&quot;Choose an option&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;)
* The height of the dialog (&lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;)
* The width of the dialog (&lt;tt&gt;78&lt;/tt&gt;)
* The height of the menu list (&lt;tt&gt;16&lt;/tt&gt;)

The rest of the values are a list of menu options in the format &lt;tt&gt;tag item&lt;/tt&gt;, where &lt;tt&gt;tag&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the option which is printed to &lt;tt&gt;stderr&lt;/tt&gt; when selected, and &lt;tt&gt;item&lt;/tt&gt; is the description of the menu option.

If you are presenting a very long menu and want to make best use of the available screen, you can calculate the best box size by.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
eval `resize`
whiptail ... $LINES $COLUMNS $(( $LINES - 8 )) ...
&lt;/source&gt;

==Check list==
At some point, you will want to present options to the user which would not be appropriate to place in a menu. 

A '''check list''' allows a user to select one or more options from a list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
whiptail --title &quot;Check list example&quot; --checklist \
&quot;Choose user's permissions&quot; 20 78 4 \
&quot;NET_OUTBOUND&quot; &quot;Allow connections to other hosts&quot; ON \
&quot;NET_INBOUND&quot; &quot;Allow connections from other hosts&quot; OFF \
&quot;LOCAL_MOUNT&quot; &quot;Allow mounting of local devices&quot; OFF \
&quot;REMOTE_MOUNT&quot; &quot;Allow mounting of remote devices&quot; OFF 

&lt;/source&gt;

When the user confirms their selections, a list of the choices is printed to &lt;tt&gt;stderr&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Radio list==
A '''radio list''' is a dialog where the user can select one option from a list. The difference between a radio list and a menu is that the user selects an option (using the space bar in whiptail) and then confirms that choice by hitting OK. 

&lt;!-- example --&gt;

==Progress gauge==
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash
{
    for ((i = 0 ; i &lt;= 100 ; i+=30)); do
        sleep 1
        echo $i
    done
} | whiptail --gauge &quot;Please wait&quot; 5 50 0
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Healthy Diet ==

&quot;We are what we eat&quot; says the ancient Indian system of health and well being called Ayurveda. In our modern day and age, we don't seem to be paying very much attention to our foods (how they are made) and our body (what we eat). I find that schools and homes both encourage poor choice of foods. Follow these simple steps to get you and your family back to healthy eating. Healthy Eating can protect your body from a variety of diseases including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

=== Simple Dos and Don'ts ===
; 5 Simple Dos
* Eat a balanced diet ([http://www.mypyramid.gov US Food pyramid]) consisting of 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables and small portions.
* Buy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food Organic Foods] (Fruits, Vegetables, Milk) ([http://www.ewg.org/sites/foodnews/ Pesticides in Fruits/Veggies]) with USDA Seal in your Saturday markets or elsewhere.
* Read Ingredients and choose whole grain products (whole wheat bread over white bread or brown rice over white rice) and high GI (Glycemic Index) foods
* Increase the consumption of Omega Fatty Acids (found naturally in fish, walnuts, flax seed)
* Drink Plenty of Fluids (Filtered Water, Green or Herbal Tea) and Take Supplements

; 5 Simple Don'ts
* Don't Buy products that use partially hydrogenated oils (a.k.a. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat Trans Fat]) and high fructose corn syrup (a.k.a. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup HFCS])
* Don't eat a lot of High GI foods
* Don't drink several glasses of fluids that are not healthy (coffee, coke, etc.)
* Don't Eat when you are not hungry

=== More Do's ===

* Utilize Green Leafy Vegetables
* Go with high fiber foods (fruits/vegetables over highly processed foods). 
* Switch to Green or White Tea instead of Coffee/Tea.
* Using Olive Oil instead of Corn/Sunflower oil in your foods
* Use Flax oil
* What about coconut oil? [http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/ Coconut Oil Research] suggests that Coconut oil has health benefits.
* Incorporate Anti Inflammatory foods (ginger, turmeric, broccoli, garlic) into your diet.
* Use brown rice instead of white rice.

=== More Don'ts ===
* Dont buy berries (blueberries, strawberries) or other thin skinned fruit's non-organic. They contain the highest residue of pesticides.
* Don't consume foods that are deep fried on a regular basis.
* Don't Buy products that have high fructose corn syrup (a.k.a. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup HFCS])

=== Shopping ===
Find a grocery store that stocks natural and organic food. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market Whole Foods] is one of them.

==== Costco Shopping ====
In the US [http://www.costco.com Costco] has started to carry numerous organic and healthy choices. If you are a Costco shopper in the US, look for the following items (Organic Brown Basmati Rice, Organic Flaxseed, Organic Oatmeal, Organic Cereal, Organic Soymilk). There are produce such as Bananas that I have found that are Organic.


=== Diets ===

=== Special Needs ===

=== Recipes ===
; A 52 week plan
* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Snack
* Dinner

=== Health/Food/Case Studies ===
* A friend reduces his triglycerides by reducing his rice consumption and increasing his Omega-3's
* I lost 9 lbs over 6 weeks by incorporating healthy foods into my diet.
* Your own case study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise ==

Moving and physical exertion are good for you. Exercise can help reduce your weight, can prevent diseases (such as heart attack). You can get by with as little as 15 mins a day of good physical activity. However I have come up with a rule which is to exercise as many times as you eat (on most days I exercise 2-3 times a day). While aerobic exercises are a great start, building strength through weights and ab exercises go a long way in burning fat.

=== Simple Dos and Don'ts ===
; 5 Simple Dos
* Walk at least 30 mins every day
* Learn Stretching or Yoga Postures and practice them
* Build core strength through ab exercises (pilates), weights
* Do it in a team setting as often as you can. Involve your family or friends or co-workers.
* Do it in everyday activities (take the stairs instead of elevator, walk to the end of the parking lot, gardening, Saturday market shopping etc.)

; 5 Simple Don'ts
* Don't start an exercise regime without talking to your doctor.
* Don't Keep the same regimen every day Mix it up.
* Don't do it alone. Don't procrastinate, and don't buy expensive equipment.
* Don't make it boring. Keep it fun. Watch your favorite show on TV while working out, or listen to some great music or enjoy the out doors.
* Don't over exert (e.g. keep heart rate in the zone, or increase weights gradually)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Devanagari is an Abugida system, having 12 vowels and 34 consonants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida wikipedia entry for Abugida]&lt;/ref&gt;

Being Abugida basically means that when writing consonant followed by vowel, instead of writing them as two characters, vowel is &quot;mixed&quot; into character.

Thus, writing in Devanagari yields a much compressed way of expression, while at the same time it is hard to write due to complex formations (&quot;mixtures&quot;). Well, at first, at least.

Important difference:
::Vowels and consonants in Devanagari can be pronounced in only '''1''' way. Thus, a word written in Devanagari cannot have two different ways of pronunciation. For example, in crude terms, &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;put&quot; will use different vowels in Devanagari.

==Examples==
::ka = का (as in '''Ka'''rtoffel. Those who know German will read this correctly)
::ki = कि (as in '''Ki'''ll)
::kee = की (as in '''Key''')
::ke = के (as in '''Ka'''te Wins'''la'''te)
::ko = को (as in '''Co'''ne)
::ku= कु (as in '''Cou'''ld)
::cut = कट
::put = पुट

Don't worry about the symbols right now! Just note one important thing: that a similar symbol (क) is repeated everytime, just with different &quot;attachments&quot;. It follows from it that this symbol represents the ''sound'' of ''k''. Rest of the attachments represent vowel addition.

The last two symbols are given just for comparison:
# &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;put&quot;, in English, have three different characters, while in Devanagari, only two.
# &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;put&quot; not only have different characters, but also different &quot;attachments&quot;  (vowels) in them.

As an example to difficulty #2, the combinations of the consonant &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क&lt;/font&gt; (''k'') with the different vowels are:

* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क&lt;/font&gt; (ka)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;आ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;का&lt;/font&gt; (kā)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;इ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;कि&lt;/font&gt; (ki)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ई&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;की&lt;/font&gt; (kī)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;उ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;कु&lt;/font&gt; (ku)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ऊ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;कू&lt;/font&gt; (kū)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ऋ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;कृ&lt;/font&gt; (kri)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ए&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;के&lt;/font&gt; (ke)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ऐ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;कै&lt;/font&gt; (kai)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ओ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;को&lt;/font&gt; (ko)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;क् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;औ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;कौ&lt;/font&gt; (kau)

Special cases:
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;र् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;उ&lt;/font&gt;  = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;रु&lt;/font&gt; (ru)
* &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;र् &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ऊ&lt;/font&gt;  = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;रू&lt;/font&gt; (rū)

Some consonants may combine with each other to form other consonants (termed as ''conjunct consonants'' or &lt;font size = &quot;+1&quot;&gt;संयुक्त् वर्ण&lt;/font&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vowels (स्वर)==
In Devanagari, vowels can be classified into five types:

#&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ह्रस्व&lt;/font&gt; or short vowels
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''अ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''इ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''उ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ऋ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ऌ''&lt;/font&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;दीर्घ&lt;/font&gt; or long vowels.
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''आ''&lt;/font&gt; 
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ई''&lt;/font&gt; 
##&lt;font size =&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ऊ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size =&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ॠ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size =&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ॡ''&lt;/font&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;संयुक्त&lt;/font&gt; or conjunct vowels.
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अ&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;इ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ए''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अ&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ई&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ऐ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अ&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;उ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''ओ''&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अ&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;ऊ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''औ''&lt;/font&gt; 
#&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;अनुनासिक&lt;/font&gt; or nasal vowels
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''अं''&lt;/font&gt; 
#&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;विसर्ग&lt;/font&gt;
##&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;''अः''&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Consonants==

Independently, all consonants are written with a &lt;font size = &quot;+1&quot;&gt;हलन्त&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font size = &quot;+1&quot;&gt;विराम&lt;/font&gt; (i.e. a '&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;\&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;' underneath). When a vowel is attached to a consonant, the &lt;font size =&quot;+1&quot;&gt;हलन्त&lt;/font&gt; is removed. 

===Consonants in alphabetical order===
In Devanagari, the placement of consonants in alphabetical order are horizontally grouped in accordance with the body part where their sounds originate from.

 '''Example:'''
 
 The line &lt;font size = &quot;+1&quot;&gt;त् थ् द् ध् न्&lt;/font&gt; can be referenced as &lt;font size = &quot;+1&quot;&gt;त वर्ग&lt;/font&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brief History ==
Retired in June of 2010. Work history includes (in order):
* Electronic Musical Instrument Technician
* Industrial Instrument Technician (Electrical, Electronic, Pneumatic)
* Nuclear Electronics Technician (20yrs)
* Technical Report Writer (Submarine Operation / Maintenance)
* Programmer / Analyst

Education
* Too many electronics schools to mention. Or even remember.
* Associates degree, Engineering from Thomas Nelson Community College

== Motivation ==
As you might guess, I've read a lot of technical manuals. It is not an exaggeration to say that poorly written technical articles have been the bane of my existence. Retirement is the perfect opportunity to exact some revenge and perhaps smooth the way for those who still struggle to make sense of technical content.

In retirement I have found that I still need something to do. Who knew?

== Why Do I Think You Care? ==
I don't, but if you have read this far...&lt;br /&gt;

I assume that you are here from following the trail of one of my edits. You would be asking &quot;Who is this idiot(genius) that destroyed(perfected) my writing?&quot;. My purpose, then is to briefly introduce myself and offer a sample of my writing. Please note that the writing style I use here is not appropriate for any kind of technical article.

== Projects ==
=== [[LaTeX]] ===
I have started using LaTeX to make math formula reference sheets for my own use. The Wikibook is a great reference but it has some issues with organization and readability. I am certainly not a LaTeX authority but I can massage existing technical content for improvements in clarity. In the meantime, I am learning rapidly. Actually, the subject of electronic typesetting is quite interesting.

Be assured that I take great care not to introduce technical errors. In fact, my editing is likely to be quite timid until I get a better feel for the community.

'''American English''': I have no linguistic knowledge beyond American English. Therefore, I will not presume to disturb sections that deal with other languages.

[[File:TGNS_TrainsPlanesAutos.png|thumb|right|400px|Autos, Trains, and Planes]]

This figure 'Autos, Trains, and Planes', which is standard in transportation economics or geography, shows the &quot;optimal&quot; mode for a particular distance. For short distances the lower fixed costs of making an auto trip outweigh its slower running speed. At longer distances, the high fixed access costs of airplanes are compensated by a faster travel times. Trains are historically in the middle.  A similar graph applies to freight, just change the modes to Autos to Trucks, Passenger Trains to Freight Trains, and Planes to Ships. The question is whether there is a range between d1 and d2, that is, does rail actually dominate both autos and planes over any region. In terms of travel time it probably does, and looking only at operating cost, it might. In terms of overall cost, including the fixed cost of construction of a new HSR line, it probably does not under current cost structures. The size of this range, if it exists, is, however, empirical, and subject to change with costs and technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Models of Network Formation ==

This section will discuss Models of Network Formation also referred to as “Generative Network Models.”  These models offer an explanation to the question of why a network should have a certain set of predetermined parameters (e.g. power-law degree distributions).  That is, they model the mechanisms by which networks are created and explore the resultant network structures of certain hypothesized generative mechanisms.  “If the structures are similar to those of networks we observe in the real world, it suggests-though does not prove-that similar generative mechanisms may be at work in real networks.” (Newman, 2010)

== Preferential Attachment ==

[[File:Long tail.svg|thumb|right| Power-Law Distribution]]

Many networks are observed to have degree distributions that approximately follow power laws, at least in the tail of the distribution.  In the 1970s, Derek Price first proposed a network formation model that explained this observation which was inspired by the work of economist Herbert Simon and statistician Udny Yule (Yule Process).  Price expanded Simon’s mathematical explanation of how the “rich-get-richer” (also a power-law distribution) to the network context, calling it “cumulative advantage” (more well known as preferential attachment coined by Barabasi and Albert in 1999).

=== Price’s Model ===
Price specifically applied this process to a model of a citation network.  In this model, papers are published continually (added one by one), yet not necessarily at a constant rate and newer papers cite older papers.  The edges in this network are directional and are created but never destroyed.  The central assumption of Price’s model is that a newly appearing paper cites previous ones chosen at random with probability proportional to the number of citations those previous papers already have plus a constant a, where a&gt;0.  
Consider a price model network where &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the in-degree of vertex i. Now suppose a new vertex is added to
the network. Then the probability of the citation made to a particular vertex, say ''i'' is proportional to &lt;math&gt;q_i+a&lt;/math&gt;.
Normalizing the above term, we get the probability of citing a vertex, say ''i'' by a newly introduced vertex is given by, 

&lt;math&gt;p_i=\frac{q_i+a}{\sum(q_i+a)}&lt;/math&gt;

If average number of citations for a given paper is c, with certain variance according to the properties of the network then as as the network size becomes very large, the fraction of vertices in the network that have in-degree q becomes: (Newman, 2010 pp- 490-494) 

[[Image:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|Example of a random network and a scale-free network|400px|right|Random network (a) and scale-free network (b). In the scale-free network, the larger hubs are highlighted.]]

&lt;math&gt;p_q=\frac{B(q+a,2+a/c)}{B(a,1+a/c)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

q=in-degree

a=constant

c=average out-degree of network (or average bibliography size)

where beta function is defined as &lt;math&gt;B(x,y)=\frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)}&lt;/math&gt;

and gamma function as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1}e^{-t}\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the Beta function falls off as a power law for large values of x, with exponent y.  Applying this, we find that for large values of q (q&gt;&gt;a) the degree distribution goes to:

&lt;math&gt;p_q \sim q^{-(2+\frac{a}{c})}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus Price’s model for citation network gives rise to a degree distribution with a power-law tail.  More generally speaking, each paper could be considered a node and each citation a link.  Here, links are added to existing nodes at a probability proportional to the number of links already reaching that node.

=== Model of Barabasi and Albert ===
Developed independently in the 1990s, the Barabasi-Albert model is the best known generative network model in use today.  Similar to Price’s model, vertices are added one by one to a growing network and connected to existing vertices.  However, these connections are undirected and the number of connections made by each vertex is exactly c (unlike Price’s model where c is allowed to vary from step to step).  Connections are made in proportion to the undirected degree, k.  By treating the Barabasi and Albert model as a special case of Price’s model, Newman, 2010 shows that:
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|500xp|right| Model of Barabasi and Albert]]


&lt;math&gt;p_k=\frac{2c(c+1)}{k(k+1)(k+2)}&lt;/math&gt;

for k ≥ c

Where:

c=number of connections made by each vertex

k=degree of vertex

&lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of vertices with k degrees.


In this case, when k becomes very large the degree distribution becomes:

&lt;math&gt;p_k \sim k^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Extensions and Further Properties of Preferential Attachment Models ===

=== Thought Question ===
What other networks’ formation could be accurately described using preferential attachment (considering either Price’s model or Barabasi-Albert)?

== Vertex Copying Models ==
Though preferential treatment offers a plausible explanation for power-law degree distributions, it is not the only means by which networks can grow (Newman, 2010).  Suppose newly added vertices copied a fraction of the connections of an existing vertex and the remainders are filled out by other existing vertices (e.g. a new paper copied a fraction the bibliography of an existing paper).  As analyzed by Newman, 2010, the degree distribution of a large network under this model will asymptotically follow a power-law distribution (Newman, 2010).

== Network Optimization Models ==
Previous network structures are based, for the most part, on successive random processes, which are blind to the large-scale structures that are being created.  A network growth mechanism that may be more suited to transportation networks is structural optimization.  The optimization in this case involves a trade-off between travel time and cost.  One of the simplest forms of this type of mechanism was developed by Ferrer i Cancho and Sole in 2003.  This model seeks to minimize the following quality function (Ferrer i Cancho &amp; Sole, 2003):

&lt;math&gt;E(e,l)=\lambda e+(1-\lambda)l&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

e=number of edges in a network

l=mean geodesic distance between vertex pairs (dissatisfaction measure)

λ=a parameter in the range 0≤λ≤1

In this model, the cost of maintaining the network is represented by the variable m.  This is the same as saying the cost of operating an airline is proportional to the number of routes it operates, for example.  Following the airline example, the variable l would be the average number of legs required to journey from one point to another.  This is obviously a simplification of a complex network.  The parameter λ provides a balance between a network with the minimum number of edges possible and a fully connected network.  From this model it can be seen that by placing a moderate weight on λ, l is minimized and the optimal result is a star graph.  This offers a simple explanation of why the hub-and-spoke system is so efficient (Newman, 2010).  As it turns out, a non-star graph solution only appears when: &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; \frac{2}{n^{2}+2}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Star graphs.svg|thumb|400px|center| Star Graph Examples]]

The degree distributions of this model, as determined by Ferrer i Cancho and Sole, ranged from an exponential distribution to a power-law distribution as the value of λ changes.  This was proposed only for local minima.

Gastner and Newman, 2006 generalizes the model presented by Ferrer i Cancho and Sole by considering not only the number of legs in a journey but also the geographic distance traveled (Newman, 2010).  The term l is replaced by t, where t=u+vr (Newman, 2010).  In this expression u and v are constants associated with a fixed time and pace (1/speed) on a link and r is the distance traveled on the link.  For example, u could be considered the check in, waiting, taxiing, etc. time at an airport and pace would be the reciprocal of the average velocity traveled during a flight.  This introduces a spatial aspect into the model where before only topological considerations were accounted for.  However, this model also produces only numerical results.

=== Thought Question ===
By changing the values of u and v in Gastner and Newman’s model, what assumptions could be drawn about the geometry of the resultant network?

      <comment>Another corollary</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We prove some results that are needed in the application of calculus to trigonometry.

'''Theorem:''' If &amp;theta; is a positive angle, less than a right angle (expressed in radians), then 0 &lt; sin(&amp;theta;) &lt; &amp;theta; &lt; tan(&amp;theta;).

'''Proof:''' Consider a circle, centre O, radius r, and choose two points A and B on the circumference such that angle AOB is less than a right angle.  Draw a tangent to the circle at B, and let OA produced intersect it at C.  Clearly

:0 &lt; area(&amp;Delta; OAB) &lt; area(sector OAB) &lt; area(&amp;Delta; OBC)

i.e.

:0 &lt; {{frac|1|2}}r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin(&amp;theta;) &lt; {{frac|1|2}}r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;theta; &lt; {{frac|1|2}}r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;tan(&amp;theta;)

and the result follows.

'''Corollary:''' If &amp;theta; is a negative angle, more than minus a right angle (expressed in radians), then 0 &gt; sin(&amp;theta;) &gt; &amp;theta; &gt; tan(&amp;theta;).  (This follows from sin(-&amp;theta;) = -sin(&amp;theta;) and tan(-&amp;theta;) = -tan(&amp;theta;).)

'''Corollary:''' If &amp;theta; is a non-zero angle, less than a right angle but more than minus a right angle (expressed in radians), then 0 &lt; |sin(&amp;theta;)| &lt; |&amp;theta;| &lt; |tan(&amp;theta;)|.

'''Theorem:''' As &lt;math&gt;\theta \rightarrow 0, \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\tan(\theta)}{\theta} \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' Dividing the result of the previous theorem by sin(&amp;theta;) and taking reciprocals,

:&lt;math&gt;1 &gt; \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} &gt; \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

But cos(&amp;theta;) tends to 1 as &amp;theta; tends to 0, so the first part follows.

Dividing the result of the previous theorem by tan(&amp;theta;) and taking reciprocals,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} &gt; \frac{\tan(\theta)}{\theta} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Again, cos(&amp;theta;) tends to 1 as &amp;theta; tends to 0, so the second part follows.

'''Theorem:''' If &amp;theta; is as before then &lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) &gt; 1-\frac{\theta^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = 1-2\sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) &lt; \frac{\theta}{2} \text{ so}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) &gt; 1-2\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2 = 1-\frac{\theta^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' If &amp;theta; is as before then &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) &gt; \theta-\frac{\theta^3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''

:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\theta) = 2\sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 2\tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \cos^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) &gt; \frac{\theta}{2} \text{ so}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\theta) &gt; 2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \cos^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = \theta \left( 1- \sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) &lt; \frac{\theta}{2} \text{ so}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1-\sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) &gt; 1-\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2 \text{ so}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) &lt; \theta \left( 1 - \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2 \right) = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' sin(&amp;theta;) and cos(&amp;theta;) are continuous functions.


'''Proof:''' For any ''h'',

:&lt;math&gt;|\sin(\theta+h) - \sin(\theta)| = 2|\cos \left(\theta+\frac{h}{2} \right)||\sin \left(\frac{h}{2} \right)| &lt; h&lt;/math&gt;,

since |cos(x)| cannot exceed 1 and |sin(x)| cannot exceed |x|.  Thus, as

:&lt;math&gt;h \rightarrow 0, \, \sin(\theta+h) \rightarrow \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;,

proving continuity.  The proof for cos(&amp;theta;) is similar, or it follows from

:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\theta) = \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Scope of this Section==

Automotive vehicles are complex, and there have been tens of thousands of different models manufactured and sold since the model-T. The information required to comprehensively repair all of these models would take up a dozen university libraries. If you spend your life studying and practicing auto repair, you will likely only ever learn and focus on a tiny fraction of the knowledge necessary to sustain the complicated and varied auto industry. The average person may choose to pleasantly ignore it to make them feel smarter, but their auto mechanic likely knows hundreds and hundreds of things that they don't.

There is no need to be intimidated by this. Your ability to repair a car will ultimately have much more to do with your dedication to learning how than with how good you do in the tests they give in school. Likewise, all successful auto mechanics are in the same boat as inexperienced you: despite their vast knowledge, there is much more to know about cars than they know. Yet they manage to repair cars anyway. How? Because a lot of '''the basics are the same''', and because they '''specialize'''. And because where the basics are not the same, or where the systems go beyond their depth of knowledge, they '''know how and when to consult a reference''', and '''when to hand the work to someone else'''.

That is what the &quot;understand&quot; section aims to teach you:
*The widely-shared basics within the specialty of most consumer cars manufactured within the last few decades.
*A sense of how much you don't know, and how to learn further about a subject if you would like
: The aim is to summarize systems, not make them out to be simpler than they are. Any simplification of a system must be accompanied by an awareness of how much information is being simplified, and directions to getting a more realistic picture.
*Knowledge of common go-to-references to use in the case of repairing a particular car.
*A sense for what cases in which you really do need to hand repairs to someone else.

This section does not aim to distract the reader with knowledge of:
*How to engage in purposes besides repair (such as car modding or upgrading)
*Basics common to what are niche markets, such as classic cars or racing cars. Most people learning about automotive repair will not be doing so to learn about those. 
*Painstakingly in-depth knowledge of extremely complex systems, no matter how common they may be. Once more, the number of readers who need to know, and want to spend the time necessary to understand each and every intricacies of automatic transmission are a small number. Our goal is to summarize, give a general idea, and then allow the reader to go more in-depth if they'd like. However, again, when summarizing, the goal is to do so in a way that does mislead the reader as to the nature or complexity of these systems.

Please enjoy, add to, and refine this &quot;understand&quot; section. With time and dedication, anyone can develop the mental tools necessary to do productive automotive repair: basic knowledge, specialization, reference resourcefulness, and sense for when to step back.

== Too Many Cooks? ==

I have used Wikipedia over the last few years, mostly to satisfy my own curiosity about a particular subject, but only recently (this week, actually) had the temerity to make my own contribution. I wonder how (or if) it is possible to create or maintain professional-grade reference material when anybody who comes along can dabble in the content.

I like the concept. I like having an immense store of reference material available from my own home. I like being able to contribute. I expect chaos.

What is your experience?

There is a staggering amount of TeX, LaTeX, Fill_In_The_Blank_TeX material out there. Selecting content for a basic users' guide is a daunting task. I can see how this could get out of hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Decide whether it is a good idea for you to repair it ==
=== Do I have the knowledge I need? ===
=== Do I have/Can I get the tools? ===
=== What are the chances I will do something wrong? ===
=== If I do something wrong, how bad could it be? ===

== Decide whether it is financially wise for you to repair it ==
=== Am I doing this to save money? ===
People try to learn and practice auto-repair for many reasons. Saving money on tasks is a big and very realistic reason to learn basic automotive maintenance and repair. Yet it is not the only reason. Other reasons people like to learn auto repair:
*Fixing and maintenance of cars can be an enjoyable hobby.
*Taking pride in being able to fix cars. Being able to fix a car demonstrates skill and dedication.
*To develop their skills for future auto repair jobs, whether personal, for friends, or as part of preparation for entry-level auto mechanic work.

As well, a big factor in people's learning and practice of auto-repair is how much free time they have.

For these reasons, often the financial prudence of engaging in auto repair is not the only factor that goes into decisions about how to approach the field. There are occasions where doing a repair can just not add-up in an immediate financial sense, but in those cases to many casual and serious students of auto-repair, it can still be worth it. It's not all about the $$. That said, many other students are also just busy people, who are working a job, and maybe raising a family, who approach auto-repair mainly for its money saving potential to make their life more economical.

For those students, there are situations where repairing a car themselves, or at all, just doesn't make that much sense dollar-wise. These situations are listed below. Think about the above reasons, and why you want to learn auto-repair, and it can help you make smart decisions when these situations come up.

=== If so, is it financially a good trade-off for my time? ===

In terms of saving money, you have to look at the trade off of extra hours it will take you to do a repair job instead of taking it to the shop vs. how much money you save. And to evaluate that trade off, it helps to think in terms of how much free time you have, and how much you normally make per hour. If you work 40 hours a week already, and you were thinking about it in terms of immediate financial cost-benefit, it doesn't make much sense to spend ten hours on a repair that will save you eighty dollars after buying $20 in tools and $50 in replacement parts (most jobs that take ten hours will save you more than that!).

But if you're one of those individuals whose can afford, financially and in regard to time to focus on the other benefits to car maintenance (fun and a sense of competence and accomplishment) and long-term benefits (practice of skills which can allow for faster and more complex work in the future) which you may be seeking, you might end up doing it anyway.

=== If so, if I do not have the tools, will buying the tools be worth it? ===

Even the most common jobs for automotive maintenance require a pretty wide tool set, and this tool set is an investment which should generally be made after deciding one wants to seriously begin learning how to take care of their car. Yet each system of a car can require special tools, many of them tools which are only required for that make or model of car. Sometimes buying all the tools necessary to do a repair can be more than the cost of taking the car to the shop, where they already have the tools. Or it can close enough to the cost that it makes the savings no longer enough to be worth doing it yourself.

Now, maybe once you buy those tools you can keep them around for a long time. It's up to you to decide whether you're ever likely to use them again, or if you are, if it's likely to be so far in the future that they'll just take up space rusting in the garage. It's up to you to decide, but we encourage you to be realistic.

=== If so, are the replacement part costs worth the money? ===

Replacement parts are a whole different ballgame. When you decide whether to buy replacement costs, what you are deciding on is not whether it's worth repairing the car yourself (you should be able to provide any replacement part you buy to an auto-mechanic as well), but whether it's worth repairing the car at all!

In most repair cases it is. But most cars, eventually down the road, will run into a position in which it is not, at which point it will be either scrapped, or otherwise re-purposed (sold to an enthusiast, converted into a lawn ornament indefinitely stranded on concrete blocks, etc). Let's offer of an example of what this point might look like: let's say you have a really old car, passed down through your family or bought used a couple years ago when you needed a car on the cheap. With 100k or more on the odometer, if that car's transmission or engine becomes irreversibly damaged, the replacement part might cost more than the value of the car itself! And that's not even including installation costs of your time (for DIY) or money (for a mechanic).

'''Always find out first!'''

As repair enthusiasts, we are the last to recommend sending the car &quot;out to pasture&quot; if it doesn't need it. Here are steps you need to take before you metaphorically curb the car. 

'''1. Decide how much the value of the car would be ''to you'' if you fixed it.'''
If you bought all the parts to bring that lemon back in working order, how much would it be worth afterward?

Remember, we are not talking about an abstract value in a blue book. If you think the car would be worth $2500, make sure it would be worth that much to you. Are you reasonably sure you would get that much money for it if you wanted to sell it? If you had $2500 instead of this car, and you could buy this car but only for that exact amount, would you buy it instead of another car? If the answer to each question is 'no', perhaps you need to lower your valuation of the car after fixing it.

It may be financially wise at this point to do a personal, or have a mechanic do an inspection of the car to assess for other impending major problems that would have to be fixed, and factor those into either the value of the car, or (if you plan to fix them) the cost of repair. If you plan to fix them yourself you can factor these costs in more conservatively.

'''2. Look at how much it will cost, and check out your options'''

You do not need to only buy new car parts. There are many places to buy used/after-market working parts (and many places to get ripped off with broken parts! Make sure to do your homework on how to be a smart consumer).

Let's say that by buying some discount and used parts which you are relatively sure will work, fixing the car will cost $1400 and several days of your time, or an additional $1700 instead of those days if you took the car and its parts to the mechanic.

'''3. If the cost of repair exceeds the value of the car to you after repair, it is time to scrap the car.'''

The best case scenario is that you happen to know of anyone who wants the car for other purposes (classic car show?) or is able to make this equation work for them better (perhaps the problem is one which you cannot repair, and it is the cost of service alone that makes the cost of repair expensive beyond financial sense)

The other scenario, and not one which is necessarily terrible, is to strip the car for resalable parts, and sell the remains to a scrap dealer. If this is not worth the time for you, it may simply be a better option to sell the car to a scrap dealer, or to one of many businesses which depend on buying, reselling parts of, and then scrapping dilapidated cars. Ask around and see which strategy will get you a good price. 

Cars, which are machines containing hundreds of complex, fast moving little parts which see years of use and climate damage, are not capable of lasting forever. Most cars, one way or another, will at some point end up abandoned and junked. This is why you don't see many cars from the 50s still on the road. The best thing you can do is make sure the scrapping of a car happens no earlier than necessary.

==If you have decided to repair it, follow proper safety procedure==
===This includes making sure you know how to be safe while doing repairs===
===Pre-repair Safety Checklist===
'''These are not just here to annoy you or bother you with details. Following safety procedures will ''save your life''. Continually disregarding measures for your own safety when doing automotive repairs will leave you permanently disabled or kill you. Neither a working car nor a devil-may-care attitude are of any use to you if you are dead.'''

# I am in a reasonable state of mind to perform automotive repairs (Sober, well-rested the night before, not under extreme pressure or stress, emotions well under control, demeanor relaxed but present. Hydrated and fed).
# I am arranged appropriately (No loose clothing. Hair is tied up. ''All'' jewelry removed. Cigarettes put out).
# I am aware of and well-read on basic safety procedures for each step of the task I am about to do.
# I have brought along proper safety equipment for the task I am about to do (This includes, ALWAYS: gloves, hard splash-free (sealed off) goggles, and a fire extinguisher).
# I am working in a well-ventilated area (parking lot, flat field, or driveway is ideal. Garage should only be used near door with door open. Or, working in a professional garage with a working, adequate professional ventilation system).
# I am working in a setting in which no one will get hurt if I temporarily am distracted from my work (there are no ''unsupervised'' young children or animals. Any unsupervised older children have been properly instructed in and demonstrated they are capable of staying clear of the car).
# I am working in a setting in which I concentrate on my work (no major distractions, again including unsupervised children or animals).
# Any cars I am working on are in a proper state to be repaired (engine off, parking break on, gearshift in park. Engine cooled down and not hot. Wheels properly blocked before being jacked up. Jacked up properly if so).
# Any toxic chemicals I am working with are in a safe area accessible only by an adult and sealed when not in use at that very moment. After work is finished, they are returned, sealed, to an area accessible only by an adult.
#When using toxic chemicals, even I am not working on the car, chemicals are kept several feet from, and not directly below my mouth, nose and eyes. When using toxic chemicals, I have safety equipment on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Purification ==
Generally to purify water you boil it and most bacteria will then be gone. At high altitudes, where water boils at a significantly lower temperature, boiling may not reliably kill enough bacteria to make the water safe. Boiling will not remove toxic chemicals or contamination so the water may still be unfit to drink.

== Filtration ==
There are a few methods

#Filter paper
#Reed beds grow around pollution ergo they take pollutants in from the water
#Reverse osmosis

Nice job on the creation of this page.  It was very informative.  I recently saw a reference to an Alexa page but didn’t really know what it was.  Now I do!  I also believe the Wayback Machine seems very helpful and am anxious to try it out myself.  Thank you!  ---N.K. 2011

Peer Comment by Jenn B.-  Very thorough, especially as yours was created from scratch.  You laid out a nice framework for others to now add to what you have created.


Nicely organized and informative!  Great job.  -SLR

You offer a lot of great information - I really liked the wayback machine information![[User:Margaret.mourer|Margaret.mourer]] ([[User talk:Margaret.mourer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Margaret.mourer|contribs]]) 02:12, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

MW- I really enjoyed your content matter. I love the wayback machine and show it to my students to demonstrate how nothing ever goes away! It is very nice and professional looking! Good work!</text>

Before you get into planning a Blitz, maybe take a look at reports of past blitzes to get ideas:

* [[PermaBlitz/ACT|PermaBlitz ACT]] - Blitz reports from the [[w:Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]]


==Summary of the stages==

* Download the full book (PDF)
* Download the full book (editable)
* Order a printed book ($--)

==Are you ready?==
Stuff about how to find, join, or form a PermaBlitz posse. DO you have ideas for your project? How are you designing? Budgeting.. documenting..

::[[/Are you ready?|Read more]]

==6 weeks out, needs analysis==
* Pick a date for your Permablitz
* At this stage you should arrange a consultation with a Permaculture designer to work out needs, wants and capabilities. This is best done by organising a site analysis by Permaculture designer. It is also important at this stage to give the designer a budget range so that they design your garden accordingly

::[[/Needs analysis|Read more]]

==4 weeks out, design==
*At this stage you should get back to the Permaculture designer in order to view and discuss their design for your garden. You will need to finalise this design and make sure it integrates all of your needs and wants

::[[/Design|Read more]]

==2 weeks out, preparation and organisation==
* Create a list of all the materials and resources that you will need.
* Stuff for kids?
* Animals..
* Access
* Begin the promotion of your Permablitz
* Start to grow seedlings to plant on the day
* Ask your designer to draw you up a design that is easy to read and understand so that you will be able to successfully create your permagarden

::[[/Preparation and organisation|Read more]]

==Permablitz==
* Weed and Clear
* Create Garden beds
* Plant
* Mulch and compost
* Have a good time!

::[[/The Blitz|Read more]]

==After==
* Make sure to thank everyone who helped with your Permablitz
* Possibly arrange a follow up consultation with your Permaculture designer 1‐6 months after your Permablitz to make sure your garden is functioning to its full extent

Mathematical typesetting is one of LaTeX's greatest strengths.

== Math Packages ==

If your document requires only a few simple mathematical formulas, plain LaTeX has most of the tools that you will need. If you are writing a scientific document that contains numerous complicated formulas, [[LaTeX/Packages|packages]] are available that introduce commands that are more powerful and flexible than the ones provided by LaTeX.

'''TODO:''' List packages that are used in the examples.

== Math Environments ==

LaTeX uses [[LaTeX/Absolute Beginners#LaTeX_environments|environments]] to typeset mathematical notation. They can be separated into two categories based on how formulas are presented:

* ''text'' - text formulas are displayed in-line, that is, within the body of text where it is declared. e.g., I can say that ''a'' + ''a'' = 2''a'' within this sentence.
* ''displayed'' - displayed formulas are separate from the main text.

As maths require special environments, there are naturally the appropriate environment names you can use in the standard way. Unlike most other environments, however, there are some handy shorthands to declaring your formulas. The following table summarizes them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Type
! Environment
! LaTeX shorthand
! TeX shorthand
|-
| Text
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{math}...\end{math} }}
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\(...\) }}
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$...$}}
|-
| Displayed
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{displaymath}...\end{displaymath} }} or 
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{equation*}...\end{equation*} }}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\[...\]}}
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$$...$$}}
|}
'''Note:''' Using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$$...$$}} should be avoided, as it may cause problems, particularly with the AMS-LaTeX macros. Furthermore, should a problem occur, the error messages may not be helpful.

Additionally, there is a second possible environment for the ''displayed'' type of formulas: {{LaTeX/Environment|equation}}. The difference between this and {{LaTeX/Environment|displaymath}} is that {{LaTeX/Environment|equation}} also adds sequential equation numbers by the side.

If you are typing text normally, you are said to be in ''text mode'', while you are typing within one of those mathematical environments, you are said to be in ''math mode'', that has some differences compared to the ''text mode'':
# Most spaces and line breaks do not have any significance, as all spaces are either derived logically from the mathematical expressions, or have to be specified with special commands such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}}
# Empty lines are not allowed. Only one paragraph per formula.
# Each letter is considered to be the name of a variable and will be typeset as such. If you want to typeset normal text within a formula (normal upright font and normal spacing) then you have to enter the text using [[#Adding text to equations|dedicated commands.]]

=== Inserting &quot;Displayed&quot; maths inside blocks of text === 
In order for some operators, such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\lim}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sum}} to be displayed correctly inside some math environments (read {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$......$}}), it might be convenient to write the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}} class inside the environment. Doing so might cause the line to be taller, but will cause exponents and indices to be displayed correctly for some math operators

== Symbols ==

Mathematics has lots and lots of symbols! If there is one aspect of maths that is difficult in LaTeX it is trying to remember how to produce them. There are of course a set of symbols that can be accessed directly from the keyboard:
 + - = ! / ( ) [ ] &lt; &gt; | ' :

Beyond those listed above, distinct commands must be issued in order to display the desired symbols. And there are ''a lot!'' of Greek letters, set and relations symbols, arrows, binary operators, etc. For example: 

{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 \forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

Fortunately, there's a tool that can greatly simplify the search for the command for a specific symbol. Look for Detexify in the [[#External links|external links]] section below.

==Greek letters==

Greek letters are commonly used in mathematics, and they are very easy to type in ''math mode''. You just have to type the name of the letter after a backslash: if the first letter is lowercase, you will get a lowercase Greek letter, if the first letter is uppercase (and only the first letter), then you will get an uppercase letter. Note that some uppercase Greek letters look like Latin ones, so they are not provided by LaTeX (e.g. uppercase ''Alpha'' and ''Beta'' are just &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; respectively).
Lowercase epsilon, theta, phi, pi, rho, and sigma are provided in two different versions.  The alternate, or ''var''iant, version is created by adding &quot;var&quot; before the name of the letter:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon, \varepsilon,
 \zeta, \eta, \theta, \vartheta, \iota, \kappa, \lambda,
 \mu, \nu, \xi, \pi, \varpi, \rho, \varrho, \sigma, \varsigma,
 \tau, \upsilon, \phi, \varphi, \chi, \psi, \omega, 
 \Gamma, \Delta, \Theta, \Phi, \Omega
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon, \varepsilon,
 \zeta, \eta, \theta, \vartheta, \iota, \kappa, \lambda,
 \mu, \nu, \xi, \pi, \varpi, \rho, \varrho, \sigma, \varsigma,
 \tau, \upsilon, \phi, \varphi, \chi, \psi, \omega,

 \Gamma, \Delta, \Theta, \Phi, \Omega&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Operators ==
An operator is a function that is written as a word: e.g. trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms and exponentials (log, exp). LaTeX has many of these defined as commands:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 \cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;\cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

For certain operators such as [[w:Limit (mathematics)|limits]], the subscript is placed underneath the operator:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 \lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

For the [[w:Modular arithmetic|modular operator]] there are two commands: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bmod}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pmod}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 a \bmod b
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 a \, \bmod \, b
\,&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 x \equiv a \pmod b
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 x \equiv a \pmod b
\,&lt;/math&gt;}}

To use operators which are not pre-defined, such as [[w:argmax|argmax]], see [[../Advanced Mathematics#Custom operators|custom operators]]

== Powers and indices ==
Powers and indices are equivalent to superscripts and subscripts in normal text mode. The caret (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) character is used to raise something, and the underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) is for lowering. If more than one expression is raised or lowered, they should be grouped using curly braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;).
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

An underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) can be used with a vertical bar (&lt;math&gt;|&lt;/math&gt;) to denote evaluation using subscript notation in mathematics:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=\[
 f(n) = n^5 + 4n^2 + 2 {{!}}_{n=17}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 f(n) = n^5 + 4n^2 + 2 |_{n=17}
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Fractions and Binomials ==
A fraction is created using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\frac{numerator}{denominator}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. (for those who need their memories refreshed, that's the ''top'' and ''bottom'' respectively!). Likewise, the [[w:Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]] (aka the Choose function) may be written using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\binom}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is also possible to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\choose}} command without the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

You can embed fractions within fractions:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}&lt;!----&gt;}{y-z}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}{y-z}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Note that when appearing inside another fraction, or in inline text &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, a fraction is noticeably smaller than in displayed mathematics. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tfrac}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dfrac}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; force the use of the respective styles, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textstyle}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}}. Similarly, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tbinom}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dbinom}} commands typeset the binomial coefficient.

Another way to write fractions is to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\over}} command without the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 {n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
\]
| render=
&lt;math&gt;
 {n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

For relatively simple fractions, it may be more aesthetically pleasing to use [[#Powers and indices|powers and indices]]:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 ^3/_7
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
^3/_7
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you use them throughout the document, usage of {{LaTeX/Package|xfrac}} package is recommended.
This package provides {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sfrac}} command to create slanted fractions. Usage:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
Take \sfrac{1}{2} cup of sugar, \dots
 \[
  3\times\sfrac{1}{2}=1\sfrac{1}{2}
 \]

Take ${}^1/_2$ cup of sugar, \dots
 \[
  3\times{}^1/_2=1{}^1/_2
 \]
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-xfrac-example.png|400px]]}}

Alternatively, the {{LaTeX/Package|nicefrac}} package provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nicefrac}} command, whose usage is similar to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sfrac}}.

=== Continued fractions ===
Continued fractions should be written using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cfrac}} command&lt;ref name=amsmath/&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 
          + \cfrac{1}{a_2 
          + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + a_4}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;   x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 
           + \cfrac{1}{a_2 
           + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Roots ==
The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt}} command creates a square root surrounding an expression. It accepts an optional argument specified in square brackets (&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;) to change magnitude:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}&lt;!----&gt;}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
\sqrt[n]{1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt[n]{1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}


Some people prefer writing the square root &quot;closing&quot; it over its content. This method arguably makes it more clear just what is in the scope of the root sign. This habit is not normally used while writing with the computer, but if you still want to change the output of the square root, LaTeX gives you this possibility. Just add the following code in the preamble of your document:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
% New definition of square root:
% it renames \sqrt as \oldsqrt
\let\oldsqrt\sqrt
% it defines the new \sqrt in terms of the old one
\def\sqrt{\mathpalette\DHLhksqrt}
\def\DHLhksqrt#1#2{%
\setbox0=\hbox{$#1\oldsqrt{#2\,}$}\dimen0=\ht0
\advance\dimen0-0.2\ht0
\setbox2=\hbox{\vrule height\ht0 depth -\dimen0}%
{\box0\lower0.4pt\box2}&lt;!----&gt;}
|render=[[Image:Latex_new_squareroot.png|thumb|right|250px|The new style is on left, the old one on right]]
}}
This TeX code first renames the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt}} command as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oldsqrt}}, then redefines {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt}} in terms of the old one, adding something more. The new square root can be seen in the picture on the right, compared to the old one. Unfortunately this code won't work if you want to use multiple roots: if you try to write &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[b]{a}&lt;/math&gt; as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt[b]{a}&lt;!----&gt;}} after you used the code above, you'll just get a wrong output. In other words, you can redefine the square root this way only if you are not going to use multiple roots in the whole document.

== Sums and integrals ==
The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sum}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\int}} commands insert the sum and integral symbols respectively, with limits specified using the caret (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) and underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;):
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i 
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i 
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \int_0^\infty e^{-x}\,dx
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^\infty e^{-x}\,dx
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

There are many other &quot;big&quot; commands which operate in a similar manner:
{|
| &lt;code&gt;\sum&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\sum \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\prod&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\prod&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|

|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|

|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\bigwedge&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\int&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|

|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\iint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\iint&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\iiint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\iiint&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\iiiint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\iiiint&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\idotsint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\int \! \cdots \! \int&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

For more integral symbols, including those not included by default in the Computer Modern font, try the {{LaTeX/Package|esint}} package.

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\substack}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; allows the use of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}} to write the limits over multiple lines:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \sum_{\substack{
   0&lt;i&lt;m \\
   0&lt;j&lt;n
  }&lt;!----&gt;} 
 P(i,j)
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\overset{\scriptstyle 0&lt;i&lt;m} {\scriptstyle 0&lt;j&lt;n}} P(i,j)
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you want the limits of an integral to be specified above and below the symbol (like the sum), use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\limits}} command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \int\limits_a^b
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_a^b
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
However if you want this to apply to ALL integrals, it is preferable to specify the {{LaTeX/Parameter|intlimits}} option when loading the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[intlimits]{amsmath}
}}

Subscripts and superscripts in other contexts as well as other parameters to {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package related to them are described in [[LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#Advanced_formatting|Advanced Mathematics]] chapter.

For bigger integrals, you may use personal declarations, or the {{LaTeX/Package|bigints}} package &lt;ref name=LM&gt; http://hdl.handle.net/2268/6219&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Brackets, braces and delimiters ==
&lt;small&gt;''How to use braces in multi line equations is described in the [[LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#Braces_spanning_multiple_lines|Advanced Mathematics]] chapter.''&lt;/small&gt;

The use of delimiters such as brackets soon becomes important when dealing with anything but the most trivial equations. Without them, formulas can become ambiguous. Also, special types of mathematical structures, such as matrices, typically rely on delimiters to enclose them.

There are a variety of delimiters available for use in LaTeX:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 () \, [] \, \{\} \, {{!}}{{!}} \, \{{!}}\{{!}} \, 
 \langle\rangle \, \lfloor\rfloor \, \lceil\rceil
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
() \, [] \, \{\} \, || \, \|\| \, \langle\rangle \, \lfloor\rfloor \, \lceil\rceil
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Automatic sizing ===
Very often mathematical features will differ in size, in which case the delimiters surrounding the expression should vary accordingly. This can be done automatically using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right}} commands. Any of the previous delimiters may be used in combination with these:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \left(\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right)
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right)
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
If a delimiter on only one side of an expression is required, then an invisible delimiter on the other side may be denoted using a period (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Manual sizing ===
In certain cases, the sizing produced by the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right}} commands may not be desirable, or you may simply want finer control over the delimiter sizes. In this case, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\big}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Big}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bigg}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Bigg}} modifier commands may be used:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 ( \big( \Big( \bigg( \Bigg( 
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
( \big( \Big( \bigg( \Bigg( 
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Matrices and arrays ==
A basic matrix may be created using the {{LaTeX/Environment|matrix}} environment&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;&gt;requires the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package&lt;/ref&gt;: in common with other table-like structures, entries are specified by row, with columns separated using an ampersand ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&amp;}}) and a new rows separated with a double backslash ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}})
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \begin{matrix}
  a &amp; b &amp; c \\
  d &amp; e &amp; f \\
  g &amp; h &amp; i
 \end{matrix}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
a &amp; b &amp; c \\
d &amp; e &amp; f \\
g &amp; h &amp; i
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To specify alignment of columns in the table, use starred version&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;&gt;requires the {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \begin{matrix}
  -1 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix}
 =
 \begin{matrix*}[r]
  -1 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix*}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{matrix}
  -1 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix}
 =
 \begin{matrix}
  -1 &amp; \,\;\;3 \\
  \,\;\;2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The alignment by default is {{LaTeX/Parameter|c}} but it can be any column type valid in {{LaTeX/Environment|array}} environment.

However matrices are usually enclosed in delimiters of some kind, and while it is possible to use the [[#Automatic sizing|&lt;tt&gt;\left&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\right&lt;/tt&gt; commands]], there are various other predefined environments which automatically include delimiters:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Environment name
! Surrounding delimiter
! Notes
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|pmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;( \, ) &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|pmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;( \, ) &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|bmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;[ \, ] &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|bmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;[ \, ] &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Bmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\{ \, \} &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Bmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\{ \, \} &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|vmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;| \, | &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|vmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;| \, | &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Vmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\| \, \| &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Vmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\| \, \| &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of colums in optional parameter
|}

When writing down arbitrary sized matrices, it is common to use horizontal, vertical and diagonal triplets of dots (known as [[w:ellipsis|ellipses]]) to fill in certain columns and rows. These can be specified using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vdots}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ddots}} respectively:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 A_{m,n} = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} &amp; a_{m,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{m,n} 
 \end{pmatrix}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
A_{m,n} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\
a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2,n} \\
\vdots  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
a_{m,1} &amp; a_{m,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{m,n} 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
In some cases you may want to have finer control of the alignment within each column, or want to insert lines between columns or rows. This can be achieved using the {{LaTeX/Environment|array}} environment, which is essentially a math-mode version of the [[../Tables#The tabular environment|&lt;tt&gt;tabular&lt;/tt&gt; environment]], which requires that the columns be pre-specified:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \begin{array}{c{{!}}c}
  1 &amp; 2 \\ 
  \hline
  3 &amp; 4
 \end{array}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c}
1 &amp; 2 \\ 
\hline
3 &amp; 4
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

You may see that the AMS matrix class of environments doesn't leave enough space when used together with fractions resulting in output similar to this:

&lt;math&gt;
 M = \begin{bmatrix}
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0\\
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0           &amp; \frac{1}{6}\\
       0           &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
     \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

To counteract this problem, add additional leading space with the optional parameter to the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}} command:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 M = \begin{bmatrix}
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0           \\[0.3em]
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0           &amp; \frac{1}{6} \\[0.3em]
       0           &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
     \end{bmatrix}
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 M = \begin{bmatrix}
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0           \\[0.3em]
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0           &amp; \frac{1}{6} \\[0.3em]
       0           &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
     \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you need &quot;border&quot; or &quot;indexes&quot; on your matrix, plain TeX provides the macro {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bordermatrix}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
M = \bordermatrix{~ &amp; x &amp; y \cr
                  A &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \cr
                  B &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \cr}
\]
|render=[[Image:bordermatrix.png|150px]]
}}


=== Matrices in running text ===
To insert a small matrix, and not increase leading in the line containing it, use {{LaTeX/Environment|smallmatrix}} environment:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
A matrix in text must be set smaller
$\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
a&amp;b\\ c&amp;d
\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$
to not increase leading in a portion of text.
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-smallmatrix.png|370px]]
}}

== Adding text to equations ==

The math environment differs from the text environment in the representation of text.  Here is an example of trying to represent text within the math environment:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 50 apples \times 100 apples = lots of apples^2
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 50 apples \times 100 apples = lots of apples^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

There are two noticeable problems: there are no spaces between words or numbers, and the letters are italicized and more spaced out than normal. Both issues are simply artifacts of the maths mode, in that it treats it as a mathematical expression: spaces are ignored (LaTeX spaces mathematics according to its own rules), and each character is a separate element (so are not positioned as closely as normal text).

There are a number of ways that text can be added properly. The typical way is to wrap the text with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} command &lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; (a similar command is {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mbox{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}, though this causes problems with subscripts, and has a less descriptive name). Let's see what happens when the above equation code is adapted:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 50 \text{apples} \times 100 \text{apples} 
 = \text{lots of apples}^2
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 50 \text{apples} \times 100 \text{apples} = \text{lots of apples}^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The text looks better. However, there are no gaps between the numbers and the words. Unfortunately, you are required to explicitly add these. There are many ways to add spaces between maths elements, but for the sake of simplicity you may literally add the space character in the affected {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text}}(s) itself (just before the text.)
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 50 \text{ apples} \times 100 \text{ apples}
 = \text{lots of apples}^2
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 50 \text{ apples} \times 100 \text{ apples} = \text{lots of apples}^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Formatted text ===
Using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text}} is fine and gets the basic result. Yet, there is an alternative that offers a little more flexibility. You may recall the introduction of [[LaTeX/Formatting#Font Styles and size|font formatting commands]], such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textrm}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf}}, etc. These commands format the argument accordingly, e.g., {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf{bold text}&lt;!----&gt;}} gives '''bold text'''. These commands are equally valid within a maths environment to include text. The added benefit here is that you can have better control over the font formatting, rather than the standard text achieved with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text}}.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 50 \textrm{ apples} \times 100
 \textbf{ apples} = \textit{lots of apples}^2
\]
|render=&lt;math&gt;
 50 \;\textrm{ apples} \times 100 \;\textbf{ apples} = \textit{lots}\;of\;apples^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Formatting mathematics symbols ==
So we can format text, what about formatting mathematics? There are a set of formatting commands very similar to the font formatting ones just used, except they are aimed specifically for text in maths mode (requires {{LaTeX/Package|amsfonts}})
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! LaTeX command
! Sample
! Description
! Common use
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathnormal{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;math&gt;ABCDEF abcdef 123456\,&lt;/math&gt;
| the default math font
| most mathematical notation
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathrm{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| this is the default or normal font, unitalicised
| units of measurement, one word functions
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathit{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;math&gt;\mathit{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| italicised font
| 
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathbf{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| bold font
| vectors
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathsf{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| [[w:sans-serif|Sans-serif]]
|
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathtt{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;font style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;ABCDEFabcdef123456&lt;/font&gt;
| [[w:Monospace font|Monospace (fixed-width) font]]
|
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathcal{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| Calligraphy (uppercase only)
| often used for sheaves/schemes and categories
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathfrak{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsfonts&quot;&gt;requires &lt;tt&gt;amsfonts&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;amssymb&lt;/tt&gt; packages&lt;/ref&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| [[w:Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]]
| Almost canonical font for Lie algebras
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathbb{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsfonts&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{ABCDEF abcdef 123456}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| [[w:Blackboard bold|Blackboard bold]]
| Used to denote special sets (e.g. real numbers)
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathscr{…}&lt;!----&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;require &lt;tt&gt;mathrsfs&lt;/tt&gt; package&lt;/ref&gt;
| 
| [[w:Script (typefaces)|Script]]
| 
|}
The maths formatting commands can be wrapped around the entire equation, and not just on the textual elements: they only format letters, numbers, and uppercase Greek, and the rest of the maths syntax is ignored. 

To bold lowercase Greek or other symbols use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\boldsymbol}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;; this will only work if there exists a bold version of the symbol in the current font. As a last resort there is the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pmb}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; (poor mans bold): this prints multiple versions of the character slightly offset against each other
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
 \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n)
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n)
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
To change the size of the fonts in math mode, see [[../Advanced Mathematics#Changing font size|Changing font size]].

=== Accents ===
So what to do when you run out of symbols and fonts? Well the next step is to use accents:

{|
| &lt;code&gt;a'&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a'\,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a''\,&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a'''\,&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a''''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a''''\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\hat{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\hat{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bar{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\overline{aaa}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\overline{aaa} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\check{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\check{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\tilde{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\tilde{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\grave{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\grave{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\acute{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\acute{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\breve{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\breve{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\vec{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\dot{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\dot{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\ddot{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\dddot{a}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\ddddot{a}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\not{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\not{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |

| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\widehat{AAA}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\widehat{AAA} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; |
| &lt;code&gt;\widetilde{AAA}&lt;/code&gt; ||
|}

==Plus and minus signs==

Latex deals with the + and - signs in two possible ways. The most common is as a binary operator. When two maths elements appear either side of the sign, it is assumed to be a binary operator, and as such, allocates some space either side of the sign. The alternative way is a sign designation. This is when you state whether a mathematical quantity is either positive or negative. This is common for the latter, as in maths, such elements are assumed to be positive unless a - is prefixed to it. In this instance, you want the sign to appear close to the appropriate element to show their association. If you put a + or a - with nothing before it but you want it to be handled like a binary operator you can add an ''invisible'' character before the operator using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={}&lt;!----&gt;}}. This can be useful if you are writing multiple-line formulas, and a new line could start with a = or a +, for example, then you can fix some strange alignments adding the invisible character where necessary.

== Controlling horizontal spacing ==

LaTeX is obviously pretty good at typesetting maths—it was one of the chief aims of the core Tex system that LaTeX extends. However, it can't always be relied upon to accurately interpret formulas in the way you did. It has to make certain assumptions when there are ambiguous expressions. The result tends to be slightly incorrect horizontal spacing. In these events, the output is still satisfactory, yet, any perfectionists will no doubt wish to ''fine-tune'' their formulas to ensure spacing is correct. These are generally very subtle adjustments.

There are other occasions where LaTeX has done its job correctly, but you just want to add some space, maybe to add a comment of some kind. For example, in the following equation, it is preferable to ensure there is a decent amount of space between the maths and the text.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
  f(n) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    n/2 &amp; \quad \text{if $n$ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2 &amp; \quad \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
  \end{array} \right.
\]

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n/2 &amp; \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
-(n+1)/2 &amp; \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}\\ 
\end{cases} 
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

This code produces errors with Miktex 2.9 and does not yield the results seen on the right.
Use \textrm instead of just \text.


(Note that this particular example can be expressed in more elegant code by the {{LaTeX/Environment|cases}} construct provided by the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package described in [[LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#The_cases_environment|Advanced Mathematics]] chapter.)

LaTeX has defined two commands that can be used anywhere in documents (not just maths) to insert some horizontal space. They are {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\qquad}}

A {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} is a space equal to the current font size. So, if you are using an 11pt font, then the space provided by {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} will also be 11pt (horizontally, of course.) The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\qquad}} gives twice that amount. As you can see from the code from the above example, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}}s were used to add some separation between the maths and the text.

OK, so back to the fine tuning as mentioned at the beginning of the document. A good example would be displaying the simple equation for the indefinite integral of ''y'' with respect to ''x'':

&lt;math&gt;\int y\, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

If you were to try this, you may write:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[ \int y \mathrm{d}x \]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}

However, this doesn't give the correct result. LaTeX doesn't respect the white-space left in the code to signify that the ''y'' and the d''x'' are independent entities. Instead, it lumps them altogether. A {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} would clearly be overkill is this situation—what is needed are some small spaces to be utilized in this type of instance, and that's what LaTeX provides:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Command
! Description
! Size
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\,}}
| small space
| 3/18 of a quad
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\:}}
| medium space
| 4/18 of a quad
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\;}}
| large space
| 5/18 of a quad
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\!}}
| negative space
| -3/18 of a quad
|}

NB you can use more than one command in a sequence to achieve a greater space if necessary.

So, to rectify the current problem:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[ \int y\, \mathrm{d}x \]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y\, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[ \int y\: \mathrm{d}x \]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y\;\;\!\! \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[ \int y\; \mathrm{d}x \]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y\; \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The negative space may seem like an odd thing to use, however, it wouldn't be there if it didn't have ''some'' use! Take the following example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
  \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      n \\
      r
    \end{array}
  \right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\left(
   \begin{matrix}
     n \\
     r
   \end{matrix}
   \right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;
}}


The matrix-like expression for representing binomial coefficients is too padded. There is too much space between the brackets and the actual contents within. This can easily be corrected by adding a few negative spaces after the left bracket and before the right bracket.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\[
  \left(\!
    \begin{array}{c}
      n \\
      r
    \end{array}
  \!\right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\left(\!
   \begin{matrix}
     n \\
     r
   \end{matrix}
   \!\right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

In any case, adding some spaces manually should be avoided whenever possible: it makes the source code more complex and it's against the basic principles of a What You See is What You Mean approach. The best thing to do is to define some commands using all the spaces you want and then, when you use your command, you don't have to add any other space. Later, if you change your mind about the length of the horizontal space, you can easily change it modifying only the command you defined before. Let us use an example: you want the ''d'' of a ''dx'' in an integral to be in roman font and a small space away from the rest. If you want to type an integral like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\int x \; \mathrm{d} x}}, you can define a command like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\dd}{\; \mathrm{d}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}
in the preamble of your document. We have chosen {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dd}} just because it reminds the &quot;d&quot; it replaces and it is fast to type. Doing so, the code for your integral becomes {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\int x \dd x}}. Now, whenever you write an integral, you just have to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dd}} instead of the &quot;d&quot;, and all your integrals will have the same style. If you change your mind, you just have to change the definition in the preamble, and all your integrals will be changed accordingly.

==Advanced Mathematics: AMS Math package==

The AMS ([[Wikipedia:American Mathematical Society|American Mathematical Society]]) mathematics package is a powerful package that creates a higher layer of abstraction over mathematical LaTeX language; if you use it it will make your life easier. Some commands {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} introduces will make other plain LaTeX commands obsolete: in order to keep consistency in the final output you'd better use {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} commands whenever possible. If you do so, you will get an elegant output without worrying about alignment and other details, keeping your source code readable. If you want to use it, you have to add this in the preamble:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{amsmath}
}}
 
===Introducing text and dots in formulas===
{{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} defines also the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dots}} command, that is a generalization of the existing {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}}. You can use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dots}} in both text and math mode and LaTeX will replace it with three dots &quot;…&quot; but it will decide according to the context whether to put it on the bottom (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}}) or centered (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}}).

===Dots===

LaTeX gives you several commands to insert dots in your formulas. This can be particularly useful if you have to type big matrices omitting elements. First of all, here are the main dots-related commands LaTeX provides:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code !! Output !! Comment
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dots}} || &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; || generic dots, to be used in text (outside formulas as well). It automatically manages whitespaces before and after itself according to the context, it's a higher level command.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}}|| &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; || the output is similar to the previous one, but there is no automatic whitespace management; it works at a lower level.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}} || &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; || These dots are centered relative to the height of a letter. There is also the binary multiplication operator, &lt;tt&gt;\cdot&lt;/tt&gt;, mentioned below.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vdots}} || &lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt; || vertical dots
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ddots}} || &lt;math&gt;\ddots&lt;/math&gt; || diagonal dots
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\iddots}} ||  || inverse diagonal dots (requires the mathdots package)
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hdotsfor{n}&lt;!----&gt;}} || &lt;math&gt;\ldots \ldots&lt;/math&gt;|| to be used in matrices, it creates a row of dots spanning ''n'' columns. 
|}

Instead of using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}}, you should use the semantically oriented commands. It make it possible to adapt your document to different conventions on the fly, in case (for example) you have to submit it to a publisher who insists on following house tradition in this respect. The default treatment for the various kinds follows American Mathematical Society conventions.

=== Summary ===

As you begin to see, typesetting math can be tricky at times. However, because Latex provides so much control, you can get professional quality mathematics typesetting with relatively little effort (once you've had a bit of practice, of course!). It would be possible to keep going and going with math topics because it seems potentially limitless. However, with this tutorial, you should be able to get along sufficiently.

{{TODO|
* introduce symbols from [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial9/symbols.pdf]
* add symbols from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wasysym/wasysym.pdf]
* consider adding symbols from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf] -- the list of nearly all symbols available for LaTeX
* Consider, instead of using the symbols from the above mentioned, using what has already been introduced in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_markup] instead of retyping the tables
* How to box an equation within an align environment
* Color in equations

      <comment>/* 4-band axial resistors */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Identifying resistors ===

Most axial resistors use a pattern of colored stripes to indicate resistance. SMT ones follow a numerical pattern.  Cases are usually brown, blue, or green, though other colors are occasionally found like dark red or dark gray.  (''Do the case colors mean something?  If so, let's indicate it.)

=== 4-band axial resistors ===

4 band identification is the most commonly used color coding scheme on all resistors. It consists of four colored bands that are painted around the body of the resistor. The scheme is simple: The first two numbers are the first two significant digits of the resistance value, the third is a multiplier, and the fourth is the tolerance of the value. Each color corresponds to a certain number, shown in the chart below.  The tolerance for a 4-band resistor will be 2%, 5%, or 10%

For example, if you are looking for a 12K (12000 ohm) resistor with ±5% tolerance, you would be looking for a Brown (1) Red (2) Orange (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) Gold (±5%) resistor.

12&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ohm = 12000 Ω = 12 kΩ

Note that red to violet are the colors of the rainbow where red is low energy and violet is higher energy.  Resistors use specific values, which are determined by their tolerance.  These values repeat for every exponent, 6.8, 68, 680.  This is useful because the digits, and hence the first two or three stripes, will always be similar patterns of colors, which you will learn to recognize without checking a chart.  To help you remember them, the standard values for 10% resistors are:

:{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!bgcolor = &quot;#B8860B&quot;|1!!bgcolor = &quot;#000000&quot;|&lt;font color = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;0&lt;/font&gt;

=== 5-band axial resistors ===

5-band identification is used for higher tolerance resistors (1%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1%), to notate the extra digit.  The first three bands represent the significant digits, the fourth is the multiplier, and the fifth is the tolerance.

=== SMD/SMT resistors ===

SMD (surface mounted device) or SMT (surface mount technology; same thing) resistors are found mostly on devices where large scale integration is present. They generally use an alphanumeric numbering system.  

:[[Image:Register3.jpg|150px]]

For surface mount resistors, a numerical code is used.  For 10% tolerance resistors, 3 numbers are used, for 1% resistors, 4 digits are used.  The scheme is similar to color codes, in that the first two or three digits are the significant digits, and the last digit is the multiplier (expressed as an exponent of 10).  This is easy to remember as &quot;the first digits then as many zeros as the last digit after it&quot; ohms.  &quot;683&quot; for instance, represents 68 with three zeros after it: 68 000 = 68 kΩ.  Likewise, &quot;4991&quot; represents 499 with 1 zero after it: 499 0 = 4.99 kΩ.

For small resistance values, an alternate notation is often used. For these, an R is used in place of the decimal. For example, 5R6 = 5.6 Ω.

They are small.

=== Large resistors ===

For large power resistors and potentiometers, the value is usually written out implicitly as &quot;10 k&amp;Omega;&quot;, for instance.

=== Examples ===

:[[Image:Resistors_axial.jpg]]

In the top example, the colors are [http://www.okaphone.nl/calc/resistor.shtml?ohm=10k&amp;tol=5 brown (1) - black (0) - orange (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) - gold (5%)]. This means 1 0 &amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega; ± 5% = 10 ± 0.5 kΩ.  This resistor has a value anywhere from 9.5 to 10.5 kΩ

The second example has 5 stripes.  They are [http://www.okaphone.nl/calc/resistor.shtml?ohm=10k&amp;tol=1 brown (1) - black (0) - black (0) - red (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) - brown (1%)].  This means 1 0 0 &amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega; ± 1% = 10 ± 0.1 kΩ.  This resistor then has a value anywhere from 9.9 to 10.1 kΩ.

Note that these are both 10 kΩ.

The third example is a larger power resistor, and is labeled [http://www.okaphone.nl/calc/resistor.shtml?ohm=56&amp;tol=5 green (5) - blue (6) - black (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) - gold (5%)].  This means 5 6 &amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega; ± 5% = 56 ± 2.8 Ω.  This resistor then has a value anywhere from 53.2 to 58.8 Ω.  It has a higher power rating than the others, which is not labeled, but is obvious from its larger size.

== Capacitors ==

[[Image:Capacitors electrolytic.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Axial (top) and radial (bottom) electrolytic capacitors]]

=== Electrolytic capacitors ===

Axial electrolytic capacitors are electrolytic capacitors that have connections on both ends. These are most frequently used in devices where there is no space for vertically mounted capacitors. See photograph above.

The arrowed stripe indicates the polarity, with the arrows pointing towards the negative pin. '''Warning:''' connecting electrolytic capacitors in reverse polarity can easily damage or destroy the capacitor.  Most large electrolytic capacitors have the voltage, capacitance, temperature ratings, and company name written on them without having any special color coding schemes. Most electrolytic capacitors in general have light blue, black, dark purple or brown colors, although some specialized ones come in yellow and other colors. If for some reason you are uncertain about the polarity, the can is always the negative connection. Most axial caps have both ends visible. The positive end has a rubber insulation and the negative side is only aluminium.



Radial electrolytic capacitors are like axial electrolytic ones, except both pins come out the same end. Usually that end (the &quot;bottom end&quot;) is mounted flat against the PCB and the capacitor rises perpendicular to the PCB it is mounted on. This type of capacitor probably accounts for at least 70% of capacitors in consumer electronics (that don't use SMT components). See photograph above.

Like their axial counterparts, many radial electrolytic capacitors have the voltage, capacitance, temperature ratings, polarity, and company name directly written on them without having any special color coding schemes.'''

=== Tantalum capacitors ===

Tantalum capacitors are useful due to their low leakage current, reliability, and their ability to keep stable capacitance over a wide range of temperatures. below is a diagram:


They have special markings. The stripe on the side indicates polarity. Usually with a store bought component, the longer lead is positive. '''Warning:''' connecting tantalum capacitors in reverse polarity can easily damage or destroy the capacitor. Generally it will have the capacitance written in &amp;micro;F, and the working voltage below it. In some cases (often when &amp;micro;F is not printed), the value (in pF) is encoded with three numbers; the first two digits being the significant figures, with the third being the multiplier (i.e. number of zeros). Tantalum capacitors are most commonly dipped and have a shiny coating, as well as vary in color, being yellow, red, and sometimes blue. Most '''axial''' tantalum capacitors look completely different.

The dark line on the SMT variety is the positive terminal.  The dipped axial through-hole variety will be marked with a + or a dark line to indicate the positive terminal.

=== Ceramic capacitors ===

Ceramic capacitors are generally non-polarized and almost as common as radial electrolytic capacitors.

:[[Image:Condensador ceramico.jpg|80px]]

Generally, they use an alphanumeric marking system.  The number part is the same as for SMT resistors, except that the value represented is in pF.  They may also be written out directly, for instance, 2n2 = 2.2 nF.  For capacitors the tolerance code is:

:{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!Tolerance Code!!Tolerance
|-
|A ||± 0.05 pF
|-
|B ||± 0.1 pF
|-
|C ||± 0.25 pF
|-
|D ||± 0.5 pF
|-
|E ||± 0.5%
|-
|F ||± 1%
|-
|G ||± 2%
|-
|H ||± 3%
|-
|J ||± 5%
|-
|K ||± 10%
|-
|L*||± 15%
|-
|M ||± 20%
|-
|N*||± 30%
|-
|P*||−0% +100%
|-
|S*||−20% +50%
|-
|W*||−0% +200%
|-
|X*||−20% +40%
|-
|Z ||−20% +80%
|}

letters with * are not used consistently.

''how similar is this to resistors?''

For example, .047K = .047 µF 10%.

The dielectric material is sometimes designated by another code:
(note: the materials in the table below are not ceramic capacitors as implied, but plastic and paper)
:{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!Marking ||Material
|-
|KT      ||Polyester Film / Foil
|-
|MKT     ||Metallized Polyester (PETP)
|-
|KC      ||Polycarbonate Film / Foil
|-
|MKC     ||Metallized Polycarbonate
|-
|KS      ||Polystyrene Film / Foil
|-
|KPS     ||foil/pps?
|-
|MPS     ||Metallized pps
|-
|KP      ||Polypropylene Film / Foil
|-
|MKP     ||Metallized Polypropylene
|-
|MP      ||Metallized paper
|}

Please note that the table above is valid most of the time but not always because it is not a real standard. To be real sure you may check the data sheet from the manufacturer in mind.

The cap color can also indicate the dielectric:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet Red/Orange Orange/Orange Yellow/Orange Green/Orange Blue/Orange Red/Violet
C0G/NP0 N030 N080 N150 N220 N330 N470 N750 N1000 N1500 N2200 N3300 N4700 P100
|}

more info at http://my.execpc.com/~endlr/markings.html

==== Axial ceramic capacitors ====

These often have a yellow body, and use the same color band system as resistors, except that the value indicated is in pF.

=== Multilayer Ceramic capacitors ===

:[[Image:Multilayerceramic png1.PNG]]

These usually use the same alphanumeric system.

=== SMD/SMT capacitors ===

These are often not even labeled.  If they are labeled, it is the same system as SMT resistors, but representing pF.  Polarized capacitors are marked with a stripe on the ''positive'' end of the package, though some electrolytic SMT capacitors are marked on the ''negative'' end of the package. They are rectangular, and often black or tan colored.  The black capacitors are easily mistaken for diodes due to the white stripe on one end...

== Inductors ==

''External resources:''
* http://www.elexp.com/t_induct.htm

Sometimes the value of an inductor is printed directly on it.  If no units are given, µH can be assumed.  If it looks like the system used by SMT resistors, it is probably that system, except that the value represented is in µH.

=== Axial inductors ===

If an inductor uses the color code system, the value represented is in µH.  Expect to see a wide silver or gold band before the normal colored bands, and a thin tolerance band at the end.
but have some more information that is not given.

==Operation==
Operational Amplifier is used to amplify the difference of two input voltages.
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = A ( V_+ - V_- )&lt;/math&gt;

Op Amp can also be used as Inverting or Non Invering Voltage Amplifier
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = A V_+  with  V_- = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = A V_-  with  V_+ = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Or as a Voltage Comparator of the two input voltages
: If &lt;math&gt;V_+ &gt; V_-&lt;/math&gt;  Then &lt;math&gt;V_o = V_ss&lt;/math&gt;
: If &lt;math&gt;V_+ &lt; V_-&lt;/math&gt;  Then &lt;math&gt;V_o = -V_ss&lt;/math&gt;
: If &lt;math&gt;V_+ = V_-&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Transistor==
Transistor is a Semi Conductor Bipolar Junction device that has three terminals namely Base, Collector, and Emitter
:[[File:Transistor-photo.JPG|200px]]

==Transistor construction==
: [[File:NPN BJT (Planar) Cross-section.svg|200px]]

A BJT consists of three differently [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] semiconductor regions, the ''emitter'' region, the ''base'' region and the ''collector'' region.  These regions are, respectively, ''p'' type, ''n'' type and ''p'' type in a [[PNP transistor|PNP]], and ''n'' type, ''p'' type and ''n'' type in a [[NPN transistor]]. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: ''emitter'' (E), ''base'' (B) and ''collector'' (C).

The ''base'' is physically located between the ''emitter'' and the ''collector'' and is made from lightly doped, high resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the base region to escape being collected, thus making the resulting value of α very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large β. A cross section view of a BJT indicates that the collector–base junction has a much larger area than the emitter–base junction.

The bipolar junction transistor, unlike other transistors, is usually not a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5.  The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector.  The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down.  The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation.  The reason the emitter is heavily doped is to increase the emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base.  For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.

: [[Image:Transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|200px]]

The low-performance &quot;lateral&quot; bipolar transistors sometimes used in [[CMOS]] processes are sometimes designed symmetrically, that is, with no difference between forward and backward operation.

Small changes in the voltage applied across the base–emitter terminals causes the current that flows between the ''emitter'' and the ''collector'' to change significantly. This effect can be used to amplify the input voltage or current. BJTs can be thought of as voltage-controlled [[current source]]s, but are more simply characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base.

Early transistors were made from [[germanium]] but most modern BJTs are made from [[silicon]]. A significant minority are also now made from [[gallium arsenide]], especially for very high speed applications (see HBT, below).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Multivibrator 555==
The [[Practical_Electronics/555|555 timer IC]] provides a very versatile, effective, and easy-to-use astable mode. By changing component values, one can get frequencies from a maximum of about 300kHz to as low as limited by the leakage of the capacitors used in the circuit. It can also have the mark-space ratio altered almost limitlessly.

==Basic Circuit==

The basic 555 astable circuit is set up like this.

[[image:555 Astable Diagram.svg|300px|center]]

*At higher frequencies and loads, it is advisable to put a 100nF capacitor between Pin 5 and 0V.

The frequency and mark-space ratio are defined by the values of R1, R2 and C1 only. For a roughly even (1:1) mark-spce ratio, R1 is usually set at 1K, and the other resistor (R2) and capacitor are changed to alter the frequency. If better control over the mark-space ratio is required, use the next circuit.

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + 2R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 \times \left( R_1 + R_2 \right) \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

There is an online calculator [http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Bill_Bowden/555.htm here] that will give the frequency, high time and low time for a given set of components.

==Variable mark-space ratio==

This variation allow much easier control of the mark-space ratio without too much impact on the frequency. The only difference is a diode petween Pins 6 and 7, with the cathode at Pin 6. The effect of this is to [[Practical_Electronics/Glossary#S|shunt]] resistor R2 when charging C1. This means that C1 charges though R1 only. This removes R2 from the &quot;high-time&quot; equation, and make calculating the mark-space ratio easier and prevents the frequency from being altered excessively by changes in the mark-space ratio ( although this still happens to a certain extent).

[[Image:555 Mk-sp Diagram.svg|300px|center]] 

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::''This is different to the [[#Design equations|design equation]] for the standard 555 Astable. (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of 2R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 \times R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Mini-astable==

This astable uses fewer components than the basic astable, and requires only the IC, one resistor and one capacitor, plus the Pin 5 capacitor for final versions.

[[Image:555 Mini Astable Diagram.svg|300px|center]]

This astable has a MSR of approximately 1:1, but this tends to increase under heavy current load, as the output does not swing fully to the power supply. This astable is not a reliable source of frequency, and should never be used where an accurate, stable clock is needed.

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{0.72}{R_1\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

==Pin 4 Enable==
Pin 4 is normally held high, and in this state it does nothing. However, when Pin 4 is brought low, the 555 is disabled, and the output is held low. This can be used to turn an astable on when desired. An example of this is the [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/Double Astable|double-astable bleeper]], which uses the output from one astable to enable another, faster astable.

Pin 8 should '''not''' be used as the enable pin, as this will draw all the current needed to run the device from the triggering circuit.

==Other astable circuits==

*[[Practical_Electronics/Frequency Modulation/555|Frequency Modulation]]
*[[Practical_Electronics/Astable/Diminishing Frequency|Diminishing Frequency]]

==Units of Design Equations==

The units that the components values and frequency are measure in are the standard base units: ohms, farads and hertz. This are often inconvenient, as the value for componets are usually several orders of magnitude away from the base unit. It is possible to use more conveninet units to calculate the frequency, and the common combinations are given below:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Resistance!!Capacitance!!Period!!Frequency
|-
|&amp;Omega;||F||s||Hz
|-
|M&amp;Omega;||&amp;mu;F||s||Hz
|-
|k&amp;Omega;||&amp;mu;F||ms||kHz
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why this book? ==
There are countless blogs, books, and manuals on car repair. So why this book, why here{
So what us is a wikibook? What do I stand to gain from reading, writing, and editing a wikibook?
# Wikibooks are free as in speech because they use a [[w:creative commons|Creative Commons]] License. This makes their information more &quot;durable&quot; than a commercial, copyright only book.
##Someone may have a very nice auto repair blog up with a great post on diagnosing whether a new alternator is needed, but tomorrow they could decide to stop paying the hosting for that site or to delete that post.
## What's more, now that the website or post is down, it's usefulness as a teaching tool is lost forever. If you re-post the information on the site, especially of a commercial blog, the owner might come after you.
##With a wikibook, if this wikibook ever goes down or gets lost, or the text you liked gets edited in a way you don't like, or even if it does not and the wikibook is as great as ever, you can copy the text and share it and modify it, and publish a version modified however you'd like. So long as you give credit to the other original authors and allow other people the same rights with your modified version. This way, the information is designed to be freely sharable. If this wikibook becomes very good, you could print out a page and pass it around, or even sell it as a cheap packaged book on the street, and it would be legal. 
##With a wikibook, you are reading and contributing to a body of knowledge that cannot be taken away from the public just because one of the authors decides they'd like to keep it away from people now (for whatever reason, financial etc.) or lock it up on a website filled with ads and spam. This is a book whose information can always be used as a resource to help out the public.
# Wikibooks can conveniently and constantly be improved and updated.
##The auto industry is a constantly changing and developing field. Most of it stays the same over the years, but there are always crucial changes to car design, and always differently designed models coming out. It is for this reason that _any_ book that is to remain relevant in the field of auto repair needs to be able to be updated.
##When an error is found in a typically published, copyrighted book, all you can hope to do is e-mail the author and hope they release a new version. Until then, all copies of the book will have that error. With wikibooks, when you find an error, you can easily fix it if you can demonstrate that the information you're replacing it with has the evidence behind it.
##If you find this book inadequate when learning about auto-repair, feel free to improve and adjust and build upon it while you are in the process of learning. This is a community project!
# At the time of writing, with the exception of a few sites, there are very few good, free, resources on auto repair foundations.
##There are, without doubt, many resources available on the internet, and a handful of these really do provide some nice basics. Of these handful, the fact that they are restricted creative property means they could be changed, disappeared, edited, loaded with ads, misleading information, or put behind a paywall.
##Nonetheless, there are some good references on the internet, and this book can, as a living online ebook, act as a hub for the more navigable, unique, and established resources for specialties of auto repair.

Follow these links to find out more about what [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks|the site wikibooks is]], and why content that is [[w:open content|free-as-in-speech]] is a [[Help:Contributing|great]] thing for education worldwide, though it may come off as a bit [[w:Replies_to_common_objections|unorthodox]] at first.

== External Resources ==
There is too much information on auto repair to ever store in this one book. The point of this section is to not list every external resource offline or online ever. It is to list free resources that are popular or unusual in their usefulness, efficacy, or insightful take on the subject of auto repairs. It is also to list classic resources so you can understand any references people make to them (some of these may not be free).

      <comment>/* Random Graph */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Random Graph===
A random graph is a graph generated by some random processes. The theory of random graph was founded by Erdős and Rényi in a series of papers in the 1950's. 

In most of the random graph models, the number of vertices is fixed and edges among them are placed in some random ways. One of the simplest way to do this is to also fix the number of edges and place them uniformly and randomly among all possible pair of vertices. In other words, we generate a probability distribution of graphs with v vertices and e edges, and each of them have the same probability. This model is often referred to as G(v,e) where v denotes the number of vertices and e denotes the number of edges.

Although G(v,e) appears to be a simple model, it turns out that it is not easy to obtain some of the important properties we are interested in. Thus, another slightly different model has been proposed and most of the mathematical work has been conducted on this model called G(v,p) where v denote the number of vertices and p denote the probability of having an edge between each pair of vertices. &lt;ref&gt;Newman. Networks: an introduction&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the graph in G(v,p) model is constructed by scanning through each pair of the n vertices and place an edge between them with probability p.

===Example===



===Properties===
The probability of having e edges in G(v,p) is
:&lt;math&gt;p^e(1-p)^{\binom v2 -e}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For example, considering a random graph G(3,0.8), the probabilities that the graph have one, two or three edges are shown as follows:
[[File:Random 3.png|600px|center|Random graph G(3,0.8)]]

Probabilities of a graph with e edges
:&lt;math&gt;P(e)=\binom {\binom v2}e p^e(1-p)^{\binom v2 -e}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Number of random graphs(v vertices) have e edges:
:&lt;math&gt;N(e)=\binom {\binom v2}e &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, there are 15 different random graphs with 4 vertices and 2 edges:
[[File:Random 42.png|600px|center|random graphs with 4 vertices and 2 edges]]

Expected number of degrees
:&lt;math&gt;\binom v2 p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Expected degree value
:&lt;math&gt;c=(v-1)p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Degree distribution
:&lt;math&gt;p_k = \binom {v-1}k p^k(1-p)^{v-1-k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In large networks where mean degree is approximately constant (e.g. social network), the degree distribution becomes Poisson distributed

===Clustering Coefficient===
The clustering coefficient measures the transitivity of the network. It is defined as the probability that two network neighbors of a vertex are also neighbors of each other. Since in G(v,p), each pair of vertices is connected with probability p independent of everything else, the clustering coefficient C is
:&lt;math&gt;C=p=\frac{c}{v-1}&lt;/math&gt;


===Giant Component===
One important characteristic studied in random graph is how the graph evolves when v becomes large. More specifically, if we know that most of the vertices in graph are connected as v goes to infinity, then it means there exists a component grows at a comparable rate as the graph. This component is called giant component. It can be shown that a giant component exists if and only if the mean degree value is greater than 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For now, because this section is under construction, pick up some basic information at [[w:Four-stroke|wikipedia]] which doesn't really cover the topic from an angle of the understanding needed to repair a variety of cars, but still has much useful information.

Because automotive systems are complicated and can be unintuitive to people who have never thought about them before, and people learn differently. In each system, there will be multiple explanations, so that visuals may complement words, and one way of explaining it may be complemented by another, etc.

== The basics: The modern automotive engine summarized in... ==
=== A paragraph with highlighted terms ===
====Summary====
Air enters the engine and is mixed with gasoline to form an '''air-fuel mixture'''. This gasoline vapor enters the '''cylinders''' of the engine, (which are, as the name implies, cylindrical containers) through an '''intake valve''' (a kind of flap that can open or close). The piston compresses the air-fuel mixture and the sparkplug ignites the mixture, forming a small fiery explosion within the cylinder which pushes the piston outward. The piston then (on momentum from its connecting rod) pushes the exhaust out, and is refilled with the air-fuel mixture again. This is called the '''four-stroke cycle'''. The movement of the piston (as propelled by the combustion of the air-fuel mixture) is turned into rotational motion by a connecting arm, and the rotational motion from all of the pistons is used to turn a '''crankshaft'''. The rotation of the crankshaft is the main purpose of the engine. The rotation of the crankshaft provides the power for all systems powered by the engine. The crankshafts rotational power is used both to turn the '''camshaft''' (another shaft, usually above the cylinders, whose rotation mainly functions to open and close the intake and exhaust valves of the engine in time with the four-stroke cycle) and is transferred via the '''flywheel''' to the '''transmission'''.

=== A vocabulary of its prominent parts with definitions ===
;Engine Block
:The &quot;body&quot; of the engine - refers to either the shell of the engine or the shell and all the parts of the engine housed within.

;Cylinder
:a space in which a piston travels and in which air is introduced, pressurized, combusted, and then leaves as the core part of the engine process.

;Piston
:moves within the cylinders and is the part that engages in the up and down motion enacted by the four-stroke process of the cylinders. The up and down motion of the piston is converted by a connecting arm (or connecting &quot;rod&quot; not to be confused with the &quot;rod that refers to pushrod) into rotational motion of the crankshaft.

;Sparkplug
;Valves
:Each cylinder of the engine requires at least one intake and at least one exhaust valve (most engines have one of each). The intake valve blocks and lets in the engine's air-fuel mixture into a single cylinder to later be ignited. The exhaust valve blocks and lets out the burned exhaust gas of its cylinder into the exhaust system.

;Connecting Rod
:connects pistons to crankshaft in a way that serves as kind of a flexible, mobile &quot;joint&quot; that allows the up-and-down motion of the piston to be driven by and drive the crankshaft.

;Cylinder Head
:the ends of a cylinder. Contains the intake valve and the exhaust valve for each cylinder. The piston comes in the other end. Its central purpose is to seal off air around the cylinder, so the piston can do its job (pressurize the chamber)

;Camshaft
:OHV (OverHead Valve, also known as l-heads or push rods.)
:SOHC and DOHC (Single and Double OverHead Cam)
;Pushrods 
Small hardened rods that receive the upward &quot;push&quot; from the lifters and push the rocker arms. (Note: non-exsistant on overhead cam motors &quot;OHC/DOHC&quot;)

;Rocker arm
:in an OHV/pushrod/l-head engine design, the rocker arm converts radial movement from either a push rod or directly by a cam lobe of the camshaft, into linear movement against a valve stem

;Timing Chain, or instead Timing Belt
Two different parts designed to serve roughly the same purpose. Most engines use one of these to connect the camshaft to the crankshaft to synchronize the camshaft so that it makes one revolution for every two revolutions of the crankshaft. Timing chains are more durable, but timing belts are cheaper to replace and do not require lubrication. Sometimes they synchronize other parts as well.

;Lifters
;Crankshaft
:the initial rotating part in the car, turned entirely by the connecting rods of the piston, and constituting a staged, crooked shaft with &quot;pedals&quot; the connecting rods hook onto.

;Flywheel
:a plate or disk about a foot in diameter attached to the back of the crankshaft that because of its inertia (that is, its mass. That is, it's heavy) it smoothes out the normal cylinder combustion pulses, reducing vibration. On manual transmission, it is a heavy iron disk that doubles as part of the clutch. On automatic, it is a stamped steel plate that mounts the heavy torque converter.

;Throttle plate
:controls whether air enters engine. controlled by gas pedal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sentence structure and grammar==
===The simple sentence===
In a simple English sentence, such as 'John drank milk' the subject comes first, then the verb, then the object.  In Gaelic, however, the verb comes first, then the subject, then the object.  An example of a sentence would therefore be:

*dh'&amp;ograve;l Iain bainne
:John drank milk
:Iain /'iən/ John; dh'&amp;ograve;l /γəl/ drank; bainne /'banjə/ milk;

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
|word
|IPA pronunciation
|meaning
|-
|Iain 
|'iən
|John
|-
|dh' &amp;ograve;l
|γəl
|drank
|-
|dh' &amp;ograve;l Iain
|γəl 'iən
|Iain drank
|-
|bainne
|'banjə
|milk
|-
|}


Other examples of the same type of sentence construction would be the following:

*tha Anna fuar
:/ha 'anə fuər/
:Anna is cold
:tha /ha/ is; Anna /'anə/ Anna; fuar /fuər/ cold;

*dh'&amp;ograve;l i s&amp;ugrave;gh
:/γəl i su:/
:she drank juice
:i /i/ she; dh'&amp;ograve;l /γəl/ drank; s&amp;ugrave;gh /su:/ juice

*dh'&amp;ograve;l e t&amp;igrave;
:/γəl e ti:/
:he drank tea
:e /e/ he; dh'&amp;ograve;l /γəl/ drank; t&amp;igrave; /ti:/ tea

*chluich &amp;igrave; anns an taigh 
:/'xluix i 'awnsən təj/
:she played in the house
:&amp;igrave; /i/ she; chluich /'xluix/ played; anns an /'awnsən/ in the; taigh /təj/ house

When issuing a command, such as in the sentence 'eat your food!' or 'write me a story!' the word order in Gaelic is similar to the word order in English.  Some examples would be:

*ith do bhiadh! - 
:eat your food! 
:ith! - eat!; do - your, thy; bhiadh - food;
*&amp;ograve;l am bainne!
:drink the milk! 
:&amp;ograve;l! - drink!; am - the; bainne - milk;
*sgr&amp;igrave;obh sin!
:write that! 
:sgr&amp;igrave;obh! - write!; sin - that;
*sgr&amp;igrave;obh sgeul!
:write a story! 
:sgr&amp;igrave;obh! - write!; sgeul - a story;
*sgr&amp;igrave;obh mi sgeul!
:write me a story! 
:sgr&amp;igrave;obh! - write; mi - me; sgeul - a story;

===Articles===
In Gaelic, the definite article (i.e. the word for 'the') can take the form an, am, nan, a' or na.  For example:

*an leabhar
:the book 
:an - the; leabhar - book;

*am bainne
:the milk
:am - the; bainne - milk;

*na lamhan 
:the hands
:na - the; lamhan - hands;

*a' chaileag
:the girl
:a' - the; caileag - girl;

The word 'an' is used for many singular nouns unless they begin with the letters 'b', 'm' or 'p', in which case the word 'am' is often used.  The word 'na' tends to be used in the plural but note that 'plural' in Gaelic means three or more.

There is no indefinite article (i.e. there is no word for 'a') either in the singular or in the plural.  For example 'taigh' can mean 'house' or 'a house'.  This is not a problem, really, when we consider that in English the indefinite article is omitted in the plural without really causing any confusion.  For example 'houses' is the plural of 'house' or 'a house'.  Here are some examples:

*tha cathair anns an se&amp;ograve;mar
:there is a chair in the room 
:tha - is; cathair - a chair; anns an - in the; se&amp;ograve;mar - room;

*tha leabhar aig Iain
:John has a book, John is in possession of a book 
:tha - is; leabhar - a book; aig - at; Iain - John;

===Adjectives===

Adjectives usually come after nouns.  For instance 'leabhar m&amp;ograve;r' means 'large book' or 'a large book' (leabhar - book; m&amp;ograve;r - large).

Where a word is, for grammatical purposes, feminine, the adjective is modified at the beginning, often by placing an 'h' after the first letter of the adjective.  For instance:

*balach m&amp;ograve;r
:a big boy
:balach - boy; m&amp;ograve;r - big;

*nighean mh&amp;ograve;r
:a big girl
:nighean - girl; mh&amp;ograve;r - big;

This addition of the letter 'h' immediately after the first letter tends to happen to adjectives beginning with the letters 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'm', 'p', 's' or 't'

===The verb 'to be'===

*tha Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th
:James is tired (i.e. present tense)

*bha Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th 
:James was tired (i.e. past tense)

*bidh Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th 
:James will be tired (i.e. future tense)

*chan eil Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th
:James is not tired (i.e. present tense, negative)

*cha robh Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th
:James was not tired (i.e. past tense, negative)

*cha bhi Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th
:James will not be tired (i.e. future tense, negative)

*am bheil Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th?
:is James tired? (i.e. present tense, question)

*an robh Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th?
:was James tired? (i.e. past tense, question)

*am bidh Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th?
:will James be tired? (i.e. future tense, question)

*nach eil Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th?
:is James not tired? (i.e. present tense, negative question)

*nach robh Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th?
:was James not tired? (i.e. past tense, negative question)

*nach bi Seumas sg&amp;igrave;th?
:will James not be tired? (i.e. future tense, negative question)

*tha Seumas a' cluich
:James is playing (i.e. present tense)

*bha Seumas a' cluich 
:James was playing (i.e. past tense)

*bidh Seumas a' cluich 
:James will be playing (i.e. future tense)

*Is e Seumas an lighiche
:It is James that is the physician (i.e. present tense)

*Bu e Seumas an lighiche
:It is James that was the physician (i.e. past tense)

===Expressing 'to have'===

There is no actual verb which translates as 'to have'.  To say that a person has something we say that the something is 'at' the person.  For instance, to say that John has a cup we say literally that 'a cup is at John'.  For example

*tha cupan aig Iain 
:John has a cup (literally 'a cup is at John')

*tha taigh aig Anna 
:Anne has a house (literally 'a house is at Anne')

*chuir Anna sios an cupan aig Iain
:Anna put down the cup belonging to Iain (literally 'Anna put down the cup at Iain')

*cha robh cupan aig Iain
:Iain did not have a cup (literally 'a cup was not at Iain')

===Expressing 'to own'===

There is no actual verb which translates as 'to own'.  To say that a person owns something we say that the something is 'with' the person.  For instance, to say that John owns a house we say literally that 'a house is with John'.  For example

*tha taigh le Iain
:John owns a house (literally 'a house is with John')

*tha ball-coise le Anna
:Anne owns a football (literally 'a football is with Anne')

===Forming the present, past and future tense in regular verbs===

The verb &quot;cuir&quot; is an
example of a regular verb.  The word &quot;cuir&quot; is the verb in the imperative mood, so &quot;cuir!&quot; means &quot;put!&quot;.
&quot;cuir sios sin!&quot; means &quot;put that down!&quot; (&quot;sios&quot; = &quot;down&quot;, &quot;sin&quot; = &quot;that&quot;). To form the present tense
we might say &quot;tha X a' cuir&quot; which literally means &quot;X is a-putting&quot; (&quot;tha&quot; = &quot;is&quot;, &quot;a' cuir&quot; = &quot;putting&quot; or &quot;a-putting&quot;).
To form the past tense (for verbs starting with &quot;c&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;m, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;s&quot; or &quot;t&quot;) we add the letter
&quot;h&quot; after the first letter.  To fom the future tense we add &quot;idh&quot; or &quot;aidh&quot; to the end of the word.  Here are some
examples:-

*tha Anna a' cuir bainne anns an copan 
:Anna is putting milk in the cup

*chuir Anna bainne anns an copan
:Anna put (did put) milk in the cup

*cuiridh Anna bainne anns an copan
:Anna will put milk in the cup

      <comment>/* Tiugainn! */ trying to make the IPA pronunciations more accurate</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Tiugainn!==

Even if you don't know much Gaelic it can be easy, with a little perseverance, to get into the habit of using a little Gaelic with your
children, or with friends who are likewise learning Gaelic and willing to speak a little Gaelic with you.  If you are not in the habit of speaking Gaelic it can feel a little strange at first to speak with your children in Gaelic but with time this strange feeling becomes lessened, and eventually it comes naturally.  Speaking to your children in a second language (like Gaelic) is good brain-training both for you and for your children.

One of the easiest words to start with is the word &quot;tiugainn&quot; [IPA 'tʃukeɳ] which means &quot;come&quot; or &quot;come on&quot;. 
You could also say &quot;tiugainn leam&quot; which means &quot;come with me&quot;.  The word &quot;leam&quot; literally means &quot;with me&quot;
(it's a prepositional pronoun).  &quot;Trobhad&quot; ['troət] is another useful word, which means &quot;come!&quot;.  For example &quot;Trobhad an seo&quot; ['troət ən ʃɒ] means &quot;Come here&quot;.

The word &quot;curamach&quot; ['kurəmax] means &quot;careful&quot; and &quot;bidh curamach&quot; [bi 'kurəmax] means &quot;be careful&quot;, a useful phrase to say to children in many situations.  You can also say &quot;bidh faiceallach&quot; which literally means &quot;be watchful&quot;.  The phrase &quot;na bidh gorach&quot; [na bi 'gorax] means &quot;don't be silly&quot; and &quot;bidh modhail&quot; [bi 'moəl] means &quot;behave&quot;.

A good word to introduce to very young children is &quot;bainne&quot; ['banjə], which means &quot;milk&quot;.  For instance, you might say to a baby or child &quot;am bheil thu ag iarraidh bainne?&quot; which literally means &quot;are you desiring some milk?&quot;, or &quot;am bheil thu ag iarraidh sugh?&quot; which means &quot;are you desiring some juice?&quot;.  To a child you might say something like &quot;am bheil thu ag iarraidh tuilleadh bainne?&quot; which literally means &quot;are you desiring more milk?&quot;, or you might say &quot;am bheil thu ag iarraigh tuilleadh sugh ubhail?&quot;, which means &quot;are you desiring more apple juice?&quot;.

|-
| Comparator || [[Image:Op-Amp Comparator.svg|200px]] || Compares two voltages and switches its output to indicate which voltage is larger. 
*&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \left\{\begin{matrix} V_{\text{S+}} &amp; V_1 &gt; V_2 \\ V_{\text{S-}} &amp; V_1 &lt; V_2 \end{matrix}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; is the supply voltage and the opamp is powered by &lt;math&gt;+V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt;.)
|-
| Inverting amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] || An inverting amplifier uses negative feedback to invert and [[amplifier|amplify]] a voltage. The R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; resistor allows some of the output signal to be returned to the input.  Since the output is 180° out of phase, this  amount is effectively subtracted from the input, thereby reducing the input into the operational amplifier.  This reduces the overall gain of the amplifier and is dubbed negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Electronics Theory, Delton T. Horn, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994, p.342-343.&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_{\text{in}}} V_{\text{in}}\!\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = R_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a [[virtual ground]])
* A third resistor, of value &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} \| R_{\text{in}} \triangleq R_{\text{f}} R_{\text{in}} / (R_{\text{f}} + R_{\text{in}}) &lt;/math&gt;, added between the non-inverting input and ground, while not necessary, minimizes errors due to input bias currents.&lt;ref&gt;Malmstadt, Enke and Crouch, Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1981, ISBN 0-8053-6917-1, Chapter 5. pp 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gain of the amplifier is determined by the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  That is:

&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Non-inverting amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] ||

Amplifies a voltage (multiplies by a constant greater than 1)

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \left( 1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Input impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} \approx \infin&lt;/math&gt; 
** The input impedance is ''at least'' the impedance between non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs, which is typically 1 MΩ to 10 TΩ, plus the impedance of the path from the inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) input to ground (i.e., &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;).
** Because negative feedback ensures that the non-inverting and inverting inputs match, the input impedance is actually '''much higher.'''
* Although this circuit has a large input impedance, it suffers from error of input bias current.
** The non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs draw small leakage currents into the operational amplifier.
** These input currents generate voltages that act like unmodeled input offsets. These unmodeled effects can lead to noise on the output (e.g., offsets or drift).
** Assuming that the two leaking currents are '''matched,''' their effect can be mitigated by ensuring the DC impedance looking '''out''' of each input is the same.
*** The voltage produced by each bias current is equal to the product of the bias current with the equivalent DC impedance looking out of each input. Making those impedances equal makes the offset voltage at each input equal, and so the non-zero bias currents will have no impact on the '''difference''' between the two inputs.
*** A resistor of value
***:&lt;math&gt;R_1 \| R_2 \triangleq \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{ R_1 R_2 }{ R_1 + R_2 },\,&lt;/math&gt;
**:which is the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input will ensure the impedances looking '''out''' of each input will be matched.
*** The matched bias currents will then generate matched offset voltages, and their effect will be hidden to the operational amplifier (which acts on the difference between its inputs) so long as the [[common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]] is good.
** Very often, the input currents are ''not'' matched.
*** Most operational amplifiers provide some method of balancing the two input currents (e.g., by way of an external [[potentiometer]]).
*** Alternatively, an external offset can be added to the operational amplifier input to nullify the effect.
*** Another solution is to insert a variable resistor between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input. The resistance can be tuned until the offset voltages at each input are matched.
*** Operational amplifiers with [[MOSFET]]-based input stages have input currents that are so small that they often can be neglected.

| Differential amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Differential Amplifier.svg|300px]] || The circuit shown is used for finding the [[subtraction|difference]] of two voltages each multiplied by some constant (determined by the resistors). 

''The name &quot;differential amplifier&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;[[#Differentiator|differentiator]]&quot;, also shown on this page.''

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ \left( R_{\text{f}} + R_1 \right) R_{\text{g}} }{\left( R_{\text{g}} + R_2 \right) R_1} V_2 - \frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} V_1 &lt;/math&gt;

* Differential &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (between the two input pins) = &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt; (Note: this is approximate)

For common-mode rejection, anything done to one input must be done to the other.  The addition of a compensation capacitor in parallel with Rf, for instance, must be balanced by an equivalent capacitor in parallel with Rg.

''The &quot;[[#Instrumentation amplifier|instrumentation amplifier]]&quot;, which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high [[input impedance]].''

Whenever &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} = R_{\text{g}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the differential gain is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = A (V_{\text{2}} - V_{\text{1}})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;A \triangleq \frac{ R_{\text{f}} }{ R_1 }&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_\mathrm{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; the differential gain is A = 1 and the circuit acts as a differential follower:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} =  V_2 - V_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Voltage follower || [[Image:Op-Amp Unity-Gain Buffer.svg|200px]] || Used as a [[buffer amplifier]] to eliminate loading effects (e.g., connecting a device with a high [[source impedance]] to a device with a low [[input impedance]]). 

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; (realistically, the differential input impedance of the op-amp itself, 1 MΩ to 1 TΩ)

Due to the strong (i.e., [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] gain) feedback and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor [[phase margin|stability margin]]s. Consequently, the system may be [[BIBO stability|unstable]] when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a [[frequency compensation|lag compensation]] network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer [[data sheet]] for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.

|Summing amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Summing Amplifier.svg|left|200px]] || A summing amplifer sums several (weighted) voltages:

* When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2 = \cdots = R_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}}&lt;/math&gt; independent

|Inverting integrator || [[Image:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|300px|]] || [[Integral|Integrates]] the (inverted) signal over time

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -\int_0^t \frac{ V_{\text{in}} }{RC} \, \operatorname{d}t + V_{\text{initial}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; is the output voltage of the integrator at time ''t'' = 0.)

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex pole|pole]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain.
* There are several potential problems with this circuit.
** It is usually assumed that the input &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has zero DC component (i.e., has a zero average value). Otherwise, unless the capacitor is periodically discharged, the output will drift outside of the operational amplifier's operating range.
** Even when &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has no offset, the leakage or bias currents into the operational amplifier inputs can add an unexpected offset voltage to &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; that causes the output to drift. Balancing input currents '''and''' replacing the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) short-circuit to ground with a resistor with resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can reduce the severity of this problem.
** Because this circuit provides no DC feedback (i.e., the capacitor appears like an open circuit to signals with &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the offset of the output may not agree with expectations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; may be out of the designer's control with the present circuit). 
: Many of these problems can be made less severe by adding a ''large'' resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with the feedback capacitor. At significantly high frequencies, this resistor will have negligible effect. However, at low frequencies where there are drift and offset problems, the resistor provides the necessary feedback to hold the output steady at the correct value. In effect, this resistor reduces the DC gain of the &quot;integrator&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; it goes from infinite to some finite value &lt;math&gt;R_F/R&lt;/math&gt;.

|Inverting differentiator || [[Image:Op-Amp Differentiating Amplifier.svg|300px]] || [[Derivative|Differentiates]] the (inverted) signal over time.

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[High-pass filter|high-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex zero|zero]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain. The high pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier can lead to unstable behavior when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop.  For this reason the system function would be re-formulated to use integrators.

| Schmitt trigger || A [[bistable multivibrator]] implemented as a [[comparator]] with [[hysteresis]].[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]] || In this configuration, the input voltage is applied through the resistor &lt;math&gt;{R_1}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be the source internal resistance) to the non-inverting input and the inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is non-inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier.

[[File:Op-Amp Inverting Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]]

Alternatively, the input source and the [[electrical ground|ground]] may be swapped. Now the input voltage is applied directly to the inverting input and the non-inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a configuration is used in the [[#Relaxation_oscillator|relaxation oscillator]] shown below.
|-
|Relaxation oscillator || [[File:Op-Amp Relaxation Oscillator.svg|300px]] || By using an [[RC network]] to add slow [[negative feedback]] to the inverting [[#Schmitt_trigger|Schmitt trigger]], a [[relaxation oscillator]] is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to [[oscillate]] in an endless symmetric [[square wave]] (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an [[astable multivibrator]]).
|-
|Inductance gyrator || [[Image:Op-Amp Gyrator.svg|300px]] || Simulates an [[inductor]] (i.e., provides [[inductance]] without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.

This circuit is unsuitable for applications relying on the [[back EMF]] property of an inductor as this will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op-amp.
|-
|Zero level detector | Voltage divider reference

* Zener sets reference voltage.
* Acts as a comparator with one input tied to ground.
* When input is at zero, op-amp output is zero (assuming split supplies.)

|Negative impedance converter (NIC) || [[Image:Op-Amp Negative Impedance Converter.svg|300px]] ||

Creates a [[resistor]] having a negative value for any signal generator

* In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\text{in}} = -R_3 \frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the components &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].

|Wien bridge oscillator || [[File:Wien bridge classic osc.svg|300px]] || Produces a very low distortion [[sine wave]]. Uses negative temperature compensation in the form of a light bulb or diode.
|-
|Precision rectifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Precision Rectifier.svg|250px|]] || The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across the forward biased diode in the circuit of a passive rectifier is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (''super'') [[diode]] with V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V. 

The circuit has speed limitations at high frequency because of the slow negative feedback and due to the low slew rate of many non-ideal op-amps.
|-
|Logarithmic output || [[Image:Op-Amp Logarithmic Amplifier.svg|300px]] || * The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{T}} \ln \left( \frac{v_{\text{in}}}{I_{\text{S}} \, R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current'' and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''thermal voltage''.

* If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{in}}}{R} = I_{\text{R}} = I_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where  &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt; is the current through the diode. As known, [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|the relationship between the current and the voltage]] for a [[diode]] is:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} = I_{\text{S}} \left( e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}} - 1 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

:This, when the voltage is greater than zero, can be approximated by:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Putting these two formulae together and considering that the output voltage is the negative of the voltage across the diode (&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt;), the relationship is proven. 

Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects.

when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The output voltage is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -R I_{\text{D}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

I.   Introduction

II.  Accounting Basics

III. Journals, Ledgers, Financial Statements


I. Introduction

I don't have a PhD in Business, but I am a CPA with thirty years of experience.  By contributing to this free e-book, I hope to grow in my own understanding of business that I may one day somehow attain a semblance of what a PhD knows.

Accounting.  Perhaps you have heard this word associated with very difficult study.  Accounting doesn't have to be difficult.  Accounting conceptually is very simple as long as you get the 100,000 foot view of what accounting is trying to accomplish first.

What is accounting?  First a formal definition and then I will share with you my definition.

Formal Definition: Accounting is the practice and body of knowledge concerned primarily with (1) methods for recording transactions, (2) keeping financial records, (3) performing internal audits, (4) reporting and analyzing financial information to the management, and (5) advising on taxation matters. It is a systematic process of identifying, recording, measuring, classifying, verifying, summarizing, interpreting and communicating financial information. It reveals profit or loss for a given period, and the value and nature of a firm's assets, liabilities and owners' equity. Accounting provides information on the (1) resources available to a firm, (2) the means employed to finance those resources, and (3) the results achieved through their use.

My informal definition: Accounting is the systematic recording, reporting, and analysis of financial transactions of a business. The person in charge of accounting is known as an accountant, and this individual is typically required to follow a set of rules and regulations, such as the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or the International Financial Reporting Standards. Accounting allows a company to analyze the financial performance of the business, and look at statistics such as net profit.

And boiling it down even simpler: Accounting is the recording of financial, property, and money transactions.

The first problem with the study of Accounting can be seen within these three definitions.  The body of accounting knowledge is similar to knowledge that only a secret society has.  Instead of secret handshakes, secret agendas, and secret meetings, the knowledge of accounting cloaks itself from most people through the sheer volume of information, extensive use of language that is not used by the common person, 
rules that are not readily apparent as to why they exist, and a cadre of individuals who would like to keep you ignorant so you will pay them handsomely for their knowledge.  

As an example of this, when reading the first definition of accounting, people tend to get lost after reading the first sentence.  Why is that?  Well its partly ego and partly, it is the accountant's nature to get everything exactly right and be as succinctly comprehensive as possible (trying to state everything important while they are on the subject).  This not only pertains to financial statements reflecting the companies financial information, but words to communicate how that financial information came about.

Accounting is definitely in need of a more simple makeover in introducing it to people.  Accountants need to learn to start with very simple ideas first when educating others about their field and then the more exact understanding of particulars will be easily apparent.  The first formal definition above was the first words of a textbook in beginning the study of accounting.  This will be my task to try to make accounting much easier so that you can learn to love the educational process.

Now, while the scope of this information I present will not make it immediately easy to journal the entries for a lessee in calculating the present value of a lease or understanding the passive activity loss rules outlined in the Internal Revenue Code, IT WILL make the basic concepts that are needed later to understand the complicated parts of accounting very easy.  Accounting is 80% the ability to conceptualize numerical transactions (taking the 100,000 foot view) and 20% memory.  Most of the specifics in accounting can be looked up when you are trying to solve accounting problems, although the more you memorize these specifics the faster your work will go, but it's not absolutely required to record accurately your money and property transactions.

Accounting basically asks and seeks to answer four questions of an organization (group) about their transactions.
1.  What does the group immediately control?
2.  Who besides the group owns what is controlled?
3.  How much does the group itself own?
4.  Where did all of this come from?

That's it.  The stuff that the group in question controls is called Assets.  When your friend lets you borrow $100 upon your promise to pay them back, you have $100 in cash (an Asset), but your friend still has some claim to that $100 based on your promise to pay them back (your debt called a Liability).  How you account (record the transaction in some books) for that $100 finding its way into your wallet will highlight that your friend still has some claim on you . . . that you are Liable to him.

Instead of describing this example verbally however as I just did, Accounting describes this situation primarily numerically.

So for example, you now have a business.  Your buddy has just lent you $100 to get you started in your business.

You need to record the fact that you now have $100 and that you owe your bud $100.  Enter now the Balance Sheet.

Your books (your balance sheet) to record this transaction, should look like this:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Talk: Graphic Design/Graphics ==

Although the content of this information is interesting and correct, I believe the writer is referring primarily to Computer Graphic Design here; it is not clear to me.  There is so much more to Graphic Design/Graphics than just computer images as I found out on the very first day of my college Graphic Design class.  Although most people are educated and can figure this out for himself/herself, I believe Wikipedia is a website to educate its readers no matter what the age, IQ or nationality.  Perhaps the author can edit this a bit to be more specific on this for the readers' benefit.  The visual aspect of Graphic Design is everything no matter what the medium, whether it be in color or black and white.  Good Info...I for one would like to read more as I am a newbie on this topic.[[Special:Contributions/72.69.40.128|72.69.40.128]] ([[User talk:72.69.40.128|discuss]]) 22:44, 7 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Labs ==

=== Lab 1: Architectural Styles (30 min) ===
For this lab you may want to work in pairs.  Consider the following architecural styles.  Use the internet or books, to find for each one of them one or two good example applications.
*Client–server model (2-tier)
*Three-tier model (An architecture with Presentation, Business Logic and Database tiers)
*Database-centric architecture 
*Distributed computing
*Event-driven architecture
*Monolithic application
*Peer-to-peer 
*Pipes and filters
*Service-oriented architecture
*Shared nothing architecture
*Software componentry 

=== Lab 2: GoF Design Patterns and StarUML (15 min) ===
Start StarUML and take a look at the ’Apply Pattern’ feature of StarUML:  Create a new empty class diagram.  Right-click in the white space, and select ’Apply Pattern’.  There in the dialog that appears select ’Pattern Repository’ then ’GoF’ and then take the ’Factory Method’.  Click next a couple of times, and you should get the class diagram for the Factory Pattern.

=== Lab 3: Feeling like a Software Architect (30 min) ===

=== Lab 4: Dynamic GUI Creator (30 min) ===
An interesting example of the Factory Method pattern is the dynamic loading of Swing classes at runtime. This could be used to build GUIs completely dynamically during runtime. This would be interesting for very large projects, when several 100 user interfaces need to be created. This could be used to generate GUI’s ’on the fly’.

=== Lab 4: Anti-Patterns with SourceMonitor (30 min) ===
Pick a Java and a Cpp project.  Install (or copy) SourceMonitor.  The program is pretty self-explanatory.  Make sure you get the following reports:
* Overall report for the project, write down the numbers you get and comare them with your neighbors (who hopefully does a different project)
* Right-click on the Baseline report and create reports for
** Checkpoint Metrics Summary
** Method Metrics
** Checkpoint Metrics Kiviat Graph
* Then double-click on the Baseline report, which will give you a report for every file.  Use it to find the files/classes with
** The most/fewest statements
** The most/fewest methods per class (which Anti-pattern is this?)
** Max depth (what does this mean?)
** Maximum complexity
* Right-click on the file with the most statements and find
** Display File Metrics Details
** Display Method Metrics

      <comment>Question about solutions to 2. and 3.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Questions about solutions to 2. and 3. ==

Since I'm a complete beginner in Haskell, I'll leave here these two questions:

1) Isn't there a better way to define sequenceIO using foldl or foldr ?


2) Is the following paragraph correct? (to be placed after the solution to 3.)


Note the similarity between sequenceIO and mapIO. In fact, given sequenceIO as in 2., we could write mapIO as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
mapIO :: (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; IO [b]
mapIO f list = sequenceIO (map f list)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Although this gives the same result, it is a bit different from the first implementation. The first one is an IO action that when run, runs a list of IO actions (much like sequenceIO).

The second one will first evaluate an [IO b] (a list of IO actions), and then it can later be run as an IO action that runs each IO action in the list.

The second one lets the compiler/interpreter decide when it is the best time to evaluate each part of [IO b] (it won't run the IO b s out of order since sequenceIO won't allow that). However, this also means that this [IO b] list may be stored in memory for a long time, and each of your IO b objects could be huge. So in short: the second is better when memory is not an issue, and the first one is better otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Overall this looks like a great start of a book.  I was looking at this book/article with the
thought of using it to teach  my teen age son Perl.

I would think that the operators page would fit in better after the pages on variables.
It seems too early to be discussing dereferencing, especially since references haven't been
brought up.  I think this section is incomplete and would be confusing.</text>

In a new installation of Ubuntu, these packages could be missing and should be installed using apt-get or synaptic:
*zlib-1g-dev
*libnetpbm9-dev
*libxmu-dev
*libtext-format-perl
*csh
also, latex tools might be necessary to build the documentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Continuous improvement (composite reliability = 0.79) ==
=== Description ===

The authors identify improvement and innovation as two critical plant level capabilities. These capabilities are each conceptualized as a second-order factor and measured through a distinct bundle of routines. The following routines underlying improvement capabilities are identified: continuous improvement, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Process management|process management]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Leadership involvement in quality|leadership involvement in quality]]. The routines closely related to improvement capability are: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Search for new technologies|search for new technologies]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Cross-functional product design|cross-functional product design]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Processes and equipment development|processes and equipment development]]. The items to measure each routine were selected based on a review of the relevant literature. Items were included that have been used in prior studies. A panel of five academic researchers and managers with expertise in manufacturing operations reviewed each of the items.

=== Definition ===

Continuous improvement refers to sustained incremental improvements of existing products/processes.

=== Items ===

*We strive to continually improve all aspects of products and processes, rather than taking a static approach.
*We search for continued learning and improvement, after the installation of new equipment.
*Continuous improvement makes our performance a moving target, which is difficult for competitors to attack.
*We believe that improvement of a process is never complete; there is always room for more incremental improvement.
*Our organization is not a static entity, but engages in dynamically changing itself to better serve its customers.

=== Comments ===

Given that a 7-point Likert scale was used (&quot;4&quot; indicating &quot;neutral&quot;), the mean value (5.49) is quite high. Therefore, the wording might be changed (e.g., &quot;We always believe&quot; rather than &quot;We believe&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Basic Math Terminology=
==The Decimal System==
The '''[[wikipedia:decimal|decimal]]''' system, sometimes referred to as '''base 10''', contains a total of ten identifiers called '''digits'''.  The decimal system is widely used because humans generally have ten fingers on which to count.  For now, we will disregard other [[wikipedia:Numeral system|number systems]] for the sake of simplicity with the understanding that the decimal system is not unique.

The ten digits of the decimal system, arranged from lowest to greatest, are:

*[[wikipedia:0 (number)|0]] (zero)
*[[wikipedia:1 (number)|1]] (one)
*[[wikipedia:2 (number)|2]] (two)
*[[wikipedia:3 (number)|3]] (three)
*[[wikipedia:4 (number)|4]] (four)
*[[wikipedia:5 (number)|5]] (five)
*[[wikipedia:6 (number)|6]] (six)
*[[wikipedia:7 (number)|7]] (seven)
*[[wikipedia:8 (number)|8]] (eight)
*[[wikipedia:9 (number)|9]] (nine)

The decimal system uses '''[[wikipedia:positional notation|positional notation]]''' to represent numbers larger than 9.  This means that a digit's position in relation to other digits affects its meaning.  Digits in the furthest right position represent the number of ones being counted, while digits in the second position from the right represent the number of tens.  Digits in the third position from the right represent the number of hundreds, and digits in the fourth position from the right represent the number of thousands.  This pattern can continue [[wikipedia:infinity|forever]]; for more information, see [[wikipedia:orders of magnitude|orders of magnitude]].

For example, the number 535,254 means 5 hundreds of thousands, 3 tens of thousands, 5 thousands, 2 hundreds, 5 tens, and 4 ones.  We would say this number as &quot;five hundred thirty-five thousand two hundred fifty-four&quot;.

==The Basic Sets of Numerals==
'''Counting numbers''' are the numbers we use every day to count things.  Mathematicians sometimes refer to this set of numbers as the '''Natural Numbers'''.

:&lt;math&gt;1,2,3,4...\ &lt;/math&gt;

'''Whole numbers''' include all the counting numbers and zero.

:&lt;math&gt;0,1,2,3,4...\ &lt;/math&gt;

==Rounding Whole Numbers==

'''Rounding''' is the process of finding the closest number to a specific value. You round a number up or down based on the last digit you are interested in. 

:&lt;math&gt;{{down}\atop\overbrace{0,1,2,3,4,}} {{up}\atop\overbrace{5,6,7,8,9}}&lt;/math&gt;


For example, rounding the number 245 to the nearest tens place would round ''up'' to 250, while the number 324 rounded to the nearest tens place would be rounded ''down'' to 320.

Following the same logic, one could round to the nearest whole number. For example, 1.5 (pronounced as &quot;one point five&quot; or &quot;one and a half&quot;) would be rounded up to 2, and 2.1 would be rounded down to 2.

==Adding Whole Numbers==
First, arrange the numbers in columns.  For example, &lt;math&gt;134+937&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
134\\
+\underline{937}\\
\underline{\ \quad}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Add the first column (starting on the right)

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
134\\
+\underline{937}\\
\underline{\quad1}\\
1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note the 10's digit put under the next column.
Now add the next column and the number underneath:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
134\\
+\underline{937}\\
\underline{\ \ 71}\\
1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Finish it off with the other columns:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
134\\
+\underline{937}\\
\underline{1071}\\
1\ 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So the answer to 134 + 937 is 1071

==Subtracting Whole numbers==
To subtract numbers think of a basket of oranges. If you have ten oranges in a basket and you remove eight oranges
you are left with two oranges. For example:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
10\\
\underline{-8}\\
2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If you have ten oranges in a basket and you remove all ten then you will no longer have any oranges so you are left with
zero oranges. For example:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
10\\
\underline{-10}\\
0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

To subtract large numbers use this method:

1. Arrange the number that is being subtracted from on top of the number being subtracted from it(ex. 2594-1673)

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{2 5 9 4 } \\
\underline{-1 6 7 3 }\\
\underline{\qquad}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Subtract each column starting from the right and going to the left
&lt;pre&gt;
 2 5 9 4
-1 6 7 3
________
     2 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. If you encounter a number that can't be subtracted without becoming negative,&quot;borrow&quot; subtract(if possible) 1 from the next digit over and add 10 to the digit that can't be subtracted(if not possible continue to borrow from the next digit).

&lt;pre&gt;
 1 15
 X X 9 4
-1 6 7 3
________
   9 2 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
4. continue until done

note: that 921+1673=2594.

==Multiplying Whole Numbers==
===Single number times Single number producing a Single number===

Take the first number as &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt;.
Take the second number as &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt;.
Repeatedly add &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; times.

:&lt;math&gt; n_1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; n_2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (n_1)\times(n_2)= 2 \times 3 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 &lt;/math&gt;

==Dividing Whole Numbers==
'''Dividing''' whole numbers is the process of determining how many times one number, called the ''dividend'', contains another number, called the ''divisor''.

:&lt;math&gt;12 \div 3&lt;/math&gt;

In this example, 12 is the dividend and 3 is the divisor. Performing a division gives a ''quotient''.

:&lt;math&gt;8 \div 4 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, 4 goes into 8 twice; therefore, the quotient would be 2.

What happens when the dividend cannot be evenly split by the divisor? This leftover quantity is called the ''remainder''. It's usually separated from the main part of the answer by a lowercase letter “r”.

:&lt;math&gt;13 \div 5 = 2\ \mbox{r}\ 3&lt;/math&gt;

Divisions are often represented as fractions. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;68 \div 43 = \frac{68}{43}&lt;/math&gt;

Some tips:

Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be divided by 2.

Any number that ends in 0 or 5 can be divided by 5.

==Factoring Whole Numbers==

'''Factoring''' is the process of determining what prime numbers (numbers that cannot be divided by any number but 1 and itself; 2,3, and 5 are prime numbers) when multiplied will give a specific number. This process of factoring is very important in reducing fractions, which is covered in the Fractions chapter of this book. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;4 = 2 \times 2\ &lt;/math&gt;

Or a more complicated example:

:&lt;math&gt;180 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5\ &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction to Fractions =
When you divide (fractionate) something into parts, two or more, you have what is known as a '''common fraction'''. A common fraction is usually written as two numbers; a top number and a bottom number. Common fractions can also be expressed in words. The number that is on top is called the numerator, and the number on the bottom is called the denominator (the prefix 'de-' is Latin for reverse) or divisor. 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{numerator}{denominator}&lt;/math&gt;

These two numbers are always separated by a line, which is known as a fraction bar. This way of representing fractions is called display representation. Common fractions are, more often than not, simply known as fractions in everyday speech. 

The numerator in any given fraction tells you how many parts of something you have on hand. For example, if you were to slice a pizza for a party into six equal pieces, and you took two slices of pizza for yourself, you would have &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced two-sixths) of that pizza. Another way to look at it is by thinking in terms of equal parts; when that pizza was cut into six equal parts, each part was exactly &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (one-sixth) of the whole pizza. 

The denominator tells you how many parts are in a whole, in this case your pizza. Your pizza was cut into six equal parts, and therefore the entire pizza consists of six equal slices. So when you took two slices for yourself, only four slices of pizza remain, or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (four-sixths). 

Also keep in mind that numerator can never be zero. It makes no sense to have zero divided into parts. For instance, the fraction &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{0}{6}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to zero, because you can not have six slices of nothing. If the denominator is zero, then the fraction has no meaning or is considered undefined since it may depend upon the mathematical setting one is working on, for the purpose of this chapter, we will consider that it has no meaning. 

Another way of representing fractions is by using a diagonal line between the numerator and the denominator.

:&lt;math&gt;1/2\ &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the separator between the numerator and the denominator is called a ''slash'', a ''solidus'' or a ''virgule''. This method of representing fractions is called ''in-line representation'', meaning that the fraction is lined up with the rest of the text. You will often see in-line representations in texts where the author does not have any way to use display representation.

== Proper Fractions ==
The fraction in the pizza analogy we just used is known as a '''proper fraction'''. In a proper fraction, the numerator (top number) is always smaller than the denominator (bottom number). Thus, the value of a proper fraction is always less than one. Proper fractions are generally the kind you will encounter most often in mathematics.

== Improper Fractions ==
When the numerator of a fraction is greater than, or equal to the denominator, you have an '''improper fraction'''. For example, the fractions &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{3}, \tfrac{2}{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{6}{6}&lt;/math&gt; are all considered improper fractions. Improper fractions always have a value of one whole or more. So with &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{6}{6}&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator says you have 6 pieces, but 6 is also the number of the whole, so the value of this fraction is one whole. It is as if no one took a slice of pizza after you cut it. 

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, one whole of something is divided into three equal pieces, but on hand you have five pieces (you had two pizzas, each divided into three slices, and you ate one slice). This means you have two pieces extra, or two pieces greater than one whole. This concept may seem rather confusing and strange at first, but as you become better in math you will eventually put two and two together to the get the whole picture (okay, bad pun).

== Mixed Fractions ==
When a whole number is written next to a fraction, such as &lt;math&gt;2\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (two and one-third) you are seeing what is called a '''mixed fraction'''. A mixed fraction is understood as being the sum, or total, of both the whole number and fraction. The number two in &lt;math&gt;2\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; stands for two wholes - you also have a third more of something, which is the &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Simplifying Fractions ==
Sometimes in mathematics you will need to rewrite a fraction in smaller numbers, while also keeping the value of the fraction the same. This is known as simplifying, or ''reducing to lowest terms''. It should be mentioned that a fraction which is not reduced is not intrinsically incorrect, but it may be confusing for others reviewing your work. There are two ways to simplify fractions, and both will be useful anytime you work with fractions, so it is recommended you learn both methods. 

To reiterate, reducing fractions is essentially replacing your original fraction with another one of equal value, called an ''equivalent fraction''. Below are a few examples of equivalent fractions.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}, \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

When the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{8}&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to lowest terms, it then becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, because four pieces out of a total of eight is exactly one-half of all available pieces. A fraction is also in its lowest terms when both the numerator and denominator cannot be divided evenly by any number other than one. 

=== Division Method ===
To reduce a fraction to lowest terms, you must divide the numerator and denominator by the largest whole number that divides evenly into both. For example, to reduce the fraction &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{9}&lt;/math&gt; to lowest terms, divide the numerator ('''3''') and denominator ('''9''') by three. 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3 \div 3}{9 \div 3} = \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

If the largest whole number is not obvious, and many times it is not, divide the numerator and denominator by any number (except one) that divides evenly into each, and then repeat the process until the fraction is in lowest terms.

For clarity, below are a few examples of reducing fractions using this method.

'''Example'''

Reduce &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{12}{20}&lt;/math&gt; to lowest terms.

'''Solution'''

In this problem, the largest whole number is difficult to see, so we first divide the numerator and denominator by two, as shown:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{12 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{6}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Next divide by two again:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{6 \div 2}{10 \div 2} = \frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are no whole numbers left which can divide evenly into &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;, so the problem is finished. 

'''Answer'''

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{12}{20}&lt;/math&gt; reduced to lowest terms is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example'''

Reduce &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{18}{24}&lt;/math&gt; to lowest terms.

'''Solution'''

Divide the numerator and denominator by six, as shown:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{18 \div 6}{24 \div 6} = \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer'''

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{18}{24}&lt;/math&gt; reduced to lowest terms is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example'''

Reduce &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{112}{126}&lt;/math&gt; to lowest terms.

'''Solution'''

In this problem, the largest whole number is not immediately apparent, so we first divide the numerator and denominator by two, as shown:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{112 \div 2}{126 \div 2} = \frac{56}{63}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Next divide by seven:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{56 \div 7}{63 \div 7} = \frac{8}{9}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Answer'''

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{112}{126}&lt;/math&gt; reduced to lowest terms is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{8}{9}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Greatest Common Factor Method ===
The second method of simplifying fractions involves finding the ''greatest common factor'' between the numerator and the denominator. We do this by breaking up both the numerator and the denominator into their prime factors (greatest common factor = 2x2 = 4):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{12}{16}=\frac{2 \times 2 \times 3}{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{2\!\!\!/ \times 2\!\!\!/ \times 3}{2\!\!\!/ \times 2\!\!\!/ \times 2 \times 2} = \frac {3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

It is implied that any part is multiplied by one. If we divide 2s out of the factorized fraction, we are left with one 2 in the denominator.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1 \times 2\!\!\!/ \times 2\!\!\!/}{2 \times 2\!\!\!/ \times 2\!\!\!/} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

It is best to practice these skills of reducing fractions until you feel confident enough to do them on your own. Remember, practice makes perfect.

== Raising Fractions to Higher Terms ==
To raise a fraction to ''higher terms'' is to rewrite it in larger numbers while keeping the fraction equivalent to the original in value. This is, for all intents and purposes, the exact opposite of simplifying a fraction. 

'''Example'''

Convert &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5}&lt;/math&gt; to a fraction with denominator of 15.  
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5} = \frac{?}{15}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 1'''

Ask yourself “what number multiplied by 5 equals 15?” To find the answer simply divide 5 into 15. 
:&lt;math&gt;{15} \div {5} = 3&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 2'''

After dividing the two denominators, you must take the answer and multiply it by the numerator you already have. So in this case, we multiply 2 by 3 to find the missing numerator. 
:&lt;math&gt;{2} \times {3} = {6}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer'''

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{15}&lt;/math&gt;

== Changing Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers ==
Oftentimes you will encounter fractions in their improper form. While this may be useful in some instances, it is usually best to convert the fraction into simplest form, or mixed fraction.

To convert an improper fraction into a mixed fraction, divide the denominator into the numerator.

'''Example'''

Change &lt;math&gt;\frac{13}{2}&lt;/math&gt; into a mixed fraction.

'''Solution'''

Divide 13 by 2, use long division to obtain quotient and a remainder.  &lt;math&gt;{13} \div {2} = {6\ \mbox{r}\ 1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer'''

To form the proper fraction part of the answer, we use the divisor ('''2''') as the denominator, and the remainder ('''r1''') as the numerator. Finally, we take the answer to the division problem, in this case 6, and use that as the whole number.

Hence &lt;math&gt;\frac{13}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in mixed fraction form is &lt;math&gt;6\,\!\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Adding Fractions ==

=== Adding Fractions With The Same Denominator ===
In order to add fractions with the same denominator, you only need to add the numerators while keeping the original denominator for the sum.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{1+3}{5} = \frac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

Adding fractions with the same denominator is the rule but it begs the question why?  Why can’t (or shouldn't) I add both numerators and denominators?

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1+1}{4+4} = \frac{2}{8}&lt;/math&gt;

To make sense of this try taking a 12 inch ruler and drawing a 3 inch horizontal line (1/4 of a foot) and then on the end add another 3 inch line (1/4 of a foot).  What is the total length of the line?  It should be 6 inches (1/2 a foot) and not 2/8 of a foot (3 inches). In essence it seems we can only add like items and like items are terms that have the same denominator and we add them up by adding up numerators.

=== Adding Fractions With Different Denominators ===
When adding fractions that do not have the same denominator, you must make the denominators of all the terms the same. We do this by finding the ''least common multiple'' of the two denominators.

:Least common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20; therefore, make the denominators 20:
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1 \times 5}{4 \times 5} + \frac{2 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{5}{20} + \frac{8}{20}&lt;/math&gt;
:Now that the common denominators are the same, perform the usual addition: 
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5+8}{20} = \frac{13}{20}&lt;/math&gt;

== Subtracting Fractions ==

=== Subtracting Fractions With The Same Denominator ===
To subtract fractions sharing a denominator, take their numerators and subtract them in order of appearance. If the numerator's difference is zero, the whole difference will be zero, regardless of the denominator.
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{13} - \frac{2}{13} = \frac{6-2}{13} = \frac{4}{13}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Subtracting Fractions With Different Denominators ===
To subtract one fraction from another, you must again find the least common multiple of the two denominators.
:Least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12; therefore, make the denominator 12:
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3 \times 3}{4 \times 3} - \frac{1 \times 2}{6 \times 2} = \frac{9}{12} - \frac{2}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
:Now that the denominator is same, perform the usual subtraction.
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{9-2}{12} = \frac{7}{12}&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplying Fractions ==
Multiplying fractions is very easy. Simply multiply the numerators of the fractions to find the numerator of the answer. Then multiply the denominators of the fractions to find the denominator of the answer. In other words, it can be said “top times top equals top”, and “bottom times bottom equals bottom.” This rule is used to multiply both proper and improper fractions, and can be used to find the answer to more than two fractions in any given problem.

'''Example'''

Multiply &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 1'''

Multiply the numerators to find the numerator of the answer. &lt;math&gt; 1 \times 3 = 3&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 2'''

Multiply the denominators to find the denominator of the answer. &lt;math&gt; 2 \times 4 = 8 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer'''
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Make sure to reduce your answer if possible. 

=== Whole and Mixed Numbers ===
When you need to multiply a fraction by a whole number, you must first convert the whole number into a fraction. This, fortunately, is not as difficult as it may sound; just put the whole number over the number one. Then proceed to multiply as you would with any two fractions. An example is given below. 

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} \times {5} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{1} = \frac{15}{4} = 3\,\!\frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

If a problem contains one or more mixed numbers, you must first convert all mixed numbers into improper fractions, and multiply as before. Finally, convert any improper fraction back to a mixed number.

: &lt;math&gt;1\,\!\frac{1}{2} \times 2\,\!\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{9}{4} = \frac{27}{8} = 3\,\!\frac{3}{8}&lt;/math&gt;

== Dividing Fractions ==
To divide fractions, simply exchange the numerator and the denominator of the second term in the problem, then multiply the two fractions.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Invert the second fraction:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiply:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1 \times 4}{2 \times 3} = \frac{4}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

Always check to see if simplifying the resulting fraction can be done:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Decimals=
'''Decimals''' are basically fractions expressed without a denominator, rather replaced by a ''power of ten'', and then the decimal point is inserted into the numerator at a position corresponding to the power of ten of the denominator. It is usual to add a leading zero to the left of the decimal point when the number is less than one.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{10^1} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;

==Adding Decimal Numbers==
Add decimal numbers much the same way you would add integers.  Line up decimal points, and then proceed to add each column and carry at the top.  The decimal point in the answer should line up with all of the others.
Here is an example:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{12.3}\\
+\underline{24.2}\\
{36.5}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Subtracting Decimal Numbers==
Subtract as you would whole numbers, but remember to follow all the rules from addition of decimals.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{312.9}\\
-\underline{111.4}\\
{201.5}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Converting Fractions to Decimal Numbers==
To convert a fraction to a decimal number, divide the numerator by the denominator.
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} = 0.75&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{3} = 3.333333333333333...&lt;/math&gt;

==Repeating and Terminating Decimals==
A repeating decimal is a decimal that is infinite. For instance, the 3.33... in the second example above. The threes just keep repeating.

Instead of writing many 3's, you can draw a line above the number that is repeating.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{3} = {3.}\overline{3}&lt;/math&gt;

When there are two numbers repeating, such as .232323, you have to draw a line above the 2 and the 3. 

:&lt;math&gt;{0.}\overline{23}&lt;/math&gt;

A terminating decimal is a decimal that ends at one point and does not go on forever. ex. 1.25

==Multiplying Decimal Numbers==
'''Multiplying''' decimal numbers can be tricky at times, but most of the time, it is similar to multiplying any integers. Although there are easier methods of multiplying, this is one of the methods.

:You can make both decimal numbers have same multiple of a power of ten.
::&lt;math&gt;0.6 \times 0.75 = (60 \times 10^{-2}) \times (75 \times 10^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;

:Then multiply the first terms together, and the second terms.
::&lt;math&gt;(60 \times 75) \times (10^{-2} \times 10^{-2}) = 4500 \times (10^{-4})&lt;/math&gt;

:Then insert the decimal point into a corresponding power of ten.
::&lt;math&gt;4500 \times (10^{-4}) = 450 \times (10^{-3}) = 45 \times (10^{-2}) = 4.5 \times (10^{-1}) = .45 \times (10^{0}) = .45 \times (1) = .45 &lt;/math&gt;

==Dividing Decimal Numbers==
'''Dividing''' decimal numbers is similar to multiplying them.

:Make both decimal numbers have same multiple of a power of ten.
::&lt;math&gt;0.3 / 0.4 = (3 \times 10^{-1}) / (4 \times 10^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

:Then divide the first terms together, and the second terms.
::&lt;math&gt;(3 \times 10^{-1}) / (4 \times 10^{-1}) = (3/4) / 10^{0}&lt;/math&gt;

:Then insert the decimal point into a corresponding power of ten.
::&lt;math&gt;(3/4) / 10^{0} = 0.75 / 1 = 0.75\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, you can make the numbers integers (if the decimal is finite) and perform a simple division.

::&lt;math&gt;0.3 / 0.4 = (0.3 \times 10) / (0.4 \times 10) = 3/4 = 0.75&lt;/math&gt;

==Converting English Measurements==
Here are some conversions that you should know in the English system:

1 foot = 12 inches&lt;br&gt;
1 yard = 3 feet&lt;br&gt;
1 mile = 5280 feet&lt;br&gt;
1 gallon = 16 cups&lt;br&gt;
1 gallon = 4 quarts&lt;br&gt;

==The Metric System==
'''Metric system''' is based on the [[w:SI|SI]] (Système International d'Unités) units.

===Length=== 
:'''Length''' is measured in meters (m). There are 100 centimeters (cm) in 1 meter, and 10 millimeters (mm) in each centimeter. Therefore, there are 1000 millimeters in each meter. There are 1000 meters in each kilometer (km).

===Mass===
:'''Mass''' is measured in kilograms (kg). The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of one liter of pure water at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius and standard atmospheric pressure.

===Time===
:'''Time''' is measured in seconds (s). Second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the Cesium-133 atom at zero kelvins. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 3600 seconds in an hour (or 60 minutes), and 86,400 seconds in a day (or 24 hours, or 1,440 minutes). There are 1000 milliseconds in a second.

===Temperature===
:'''Temperature''' is measured in '''Kelvins''' or '''degrees Celsius''' (°C) in SI; the latter is used more frequently in general applications. The degree Celsius is a unit of temperature named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who first proposed a similar system in 1742. The Celsius temperature scale was designed so that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.

===Volume===
:'''Volume''' is measured cubic meter (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The volume of a solid object is a numerical value given to describe the three-dimensional concept of how much space it occupies. One-dimensional objects (such as lines) and two-dimensional objects (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space. Liter (L and l) is used commonly. 1000 L makes a cubic meter and 1 L is 1 dm³.

==Metric Length Measurement Conversions==
1 meter = 10 decimeters = 100 centimeters = 1000 millimeters&lt;br&gt;
1 decimeter = 10 centimeters = 100 millimeters&lt;br&gt;
1 centimeter = 10 millimeters&lt;br&gt;
1 kilometer = 1000 meters = 10,000 decimeters = 100,000 centimeters = 1,000,000 millimeters&lt;br&gt;
1 kilogram = 1000 grams = 1,000,000 milligrams&lt;br&gt;
1 gram = 1000 milligrams&lt;br&gt;

==Measure Metric Quantities==


----
==Converting English and Metric Measurements==
To convert between one measurement unit and another, requires a conversion factor.
For instance; 

1 inch = 25.4 mm

and so 12 inches = 12 x 25.4 = 304.8mm

The same conversion factor can also be used to convert mm to inches by using division. For example;

400mm = 400/25.4 = 15.75 inches (to 2 decimal places)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Length operator ==

The hash symbol can be used as a length operator for obtaining the length of a [[/string/]] or [[/table/]].

=== Length of a string ===

 print (#&quot;oranges&quot;)    -- 7

Note that in [[/lua/]], the [[/string library/]] provides a [[/string.len/]] function, which can also be used to determine the length of a string:

 print (string.len(&quot;oranges&quot;))    -- 7

=== Length of a table ===

For a regular array with numerical indices, the length operator returns the number of the last populated element. However, if the array contains a [[/nil/]] value, this may be interpreted as the end of the [[/array/]] by the length operator:

      <text xml:space="preserve">I changed these measurements from tablespoon to teaspoon after trying the two-pounder portion recipe. I cut the (original) spice dose nearly in half, using only 3 Tbsp seasoning salt and 1 Tbsp black pepper. The result was a seriously over salted and over peppered meat. I think the original poster may have simply been mistaken. 

I intend to try the recipe again with the measurements given in teaspoons and correct this page again if necessary.

==Original research==
Please see the section on [[WB:OR|original research in &quot;What is Wikibooks&quot;]] and [[Wikibooks:Original research]].  [[Leterithmetic]] may be treading into that sort of territory.  If so, then it would be better at [[v:|Wikiversity]] instead, where information does not have to be verifiable.  If you feel your intended approach will be appropriate, then do continue.  It's just something to keep in mind. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:32, 11 March 2011 (UTC)

==Possible book to work off of==
If you wanted a shorter title and could make use of the content, you might be interested in developing off of the existing [[Microsoft SQL Server]].  Given the extensive content you have planned people would probably want to make yours the main book anyway and merge the content later on.  Simply a suggestion.  I also fixed a few pages to comply with [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">4024 7-bit (÷128) ripple counter
The 4024 is a ripple counter so beware that glitches may occur in any logic gate systems connected to its outputs due to the slight delay before the later counter outputs respond to a clock pulse. 
The count advances as the clock input becomes low (on the falling-edge), this is indicated by the bar over the clock label. This is the usual clock behaviour of ripple counters and it means a counter output can directly drive the clock input of the next counter in a chain. 
Output Qn is the nth stage of the counter, representing 2n, for example Q4 is 24 = 16 (1/16 of clock frequency) and Q7 is 27 = 128 (1/128 of clock frequency). 
The reset input should be low for normal operation (counting). When high it resets the count to zero (all outputs low).

      <comment>charges of the same sign &quot;repel&quot; each other not &quot;attract as was written</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Electric charge occurs in two forms: positive and negative.  The general rule of charges is &quot;opposites attract, likes repel&quot; - in other words, charges of the same sign repel each other, while charges of unlike or opposite signs attract each other.  The SI unit for charge is the coulomb (C); 1 coulomb is the amount of electric charge transported by a steady current of one ampere (A) in one second (s).

How various materials act under the influence of electric forces is often linked to how easily electrons are dislodged from their constituent atoms/molecules and move through the material.  Materials which conduct electric charge well are called &quot;conductors&quot;. while those which are not are called &quot;insulators&quot;.  Metals are typically good conductors, while many non-metals are insulators.

An electron has an electric charge of -e, while a proton has an electric charge of +e, with &lt;math&gt; e = 1.602 * 10^{-19} C &lt;/math&gt; .

Electric charge in matter is generally quantized in multiples of ''e''.  The net charge before a given interaction is the same as the net charge after that interaction, so charge is conserved.

Coulomb's Law explains that the electric, or Coulomb, force exerted by a point charge q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on another point charge q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, separated from q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a distance of r&lt;sub&gt;1 2&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by &lt;math&gt;{F}_{12}= {1 \over 4\pi\varepsilon_0}{q_1 q_2 \over r^2_{12}}{\hat{r}}_{12} \ &lt;/math&gt; , in which &lt;math&gt; 1 \over 4\pi\varepsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt; sets the unit of charge.

The superposition principle - which states that for all linear systems, the net response at a given place and time caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses which would have been caused by each stimulus individually - applies when multiple charges are present.  The electric forces on a particular point charge q due to all other charges add together vectorially.  For continuous charge distributions, this addition is done by integration; the force of such a distribution on the point charge q depends on the particular charge distribution.

For charges distributed on a line, the force on the point charge q due to the distribution is &lt;math&gt;{F}= {q \over 4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int {\hat{r}'} { {\lambda (x) dx} \over {r'}^2 } \ &lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the one-dimensional charge density.

For charges distributed over a surface, the force on the point charge q due to the distribution is &lt;math&gt;{F}= {q \over 4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int_{surface} {\hat{r}'} { {\sigma (x) dx} \over {r'}^2 } \ &lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the two-dimensional charge density.

For charges distributed through a volume, the force on the point charge q due to the distribution is &lt;math&gt;{F}= {q \over 4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int_{volume} {\hat{r}'} { {\rho (x) dx} \over {r'}^2 } \ &lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the three-dimensional charge density.

Electric forces are generally much stronger than gravitational forces, except on the astronomical scale.  These forces are responsible for the stability of atoms, molecules, solids, and liquids.  Electrical interactions are also the cause of all chemical reactions and biological processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== for adding about production engineering as a branch of engineering on your website. ==

There is nothing about production engineering, so why i inform u that please add this branch on wikipedia or on wikibooks as like mechanical or other branches u have add. becouse here is a lot of student in this field and also a lot of engineer working as a production engineer, so i kindly request to u,please add this branch on your website. {{unsigned|210.212.13.69}}

:This is just as much your website as it is anyone else's.  If you want Production Engineering added to Wikibooks, '''''you''''' should [[Production Engineering|add it]].  You are the one with the interest, and presumably with some expertise on the topic.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 22:09, 11 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Distributions ==

The prerequisites vary from distribution to distribution, that's why I had created a separate page for them - not to make the installation procedure page too cumbersome. I think it makes more sense to keep the additional requirement separated by distribution on a new page (I hate wiki and I have no intention to start an &quot;editing war&quot;. I've had enough of that).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the aftermath of the Fukushima-Daiichi disaster, there is heightened concern with the Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant and the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
Due to Federal pre-emption, most of the decision making regarding Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant and SONGS are at the Federal level. This book focuses on California State regulatory agencies and public access thereof; a more comprehensive approach may be found at Wikibooks at [[Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant: The WikiBook]]

Environmental policy in California is primarily managed under the California Department of Natural Resources. The California Department of Energy supervises state energy policy and hence, interaction with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission with respect to Diablo Canyon and the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plants. Other agencies at state and county level also get in on the act, notably the California Public Utilities Commission which has a public hearing schedulted for June 2011. The California Coastal Commission implements the Coastal Act and supervises coastal development permits for properties adjacent to the coast.

[[File:Hydrogen explosion Fukushima Unit 1 cg visualization.png|thumb|390px|Fukushima I Unit 1 nuclear reactor before and after the hydrogen explosion.]]
Anyone living downwind of a nuclear power plant would do well to carefully consider the possible consequences. It is helpful to have a perspective based upon a realistic assessment of the history of nuclear energy incidents. Remember that the nuclear plant in the area you study - be it DCPP&lt; SONGS or the Northern California facility -  has its own specific issues in terms of engineering, geology and potential impact on the biosphere.

==Earthquake hazards==
Diablo is built proximal to multiple signifigant earthquake faults. It has undergone extensive retro-fitting, but the Fukushima issue has brought the public's attention back to the issue. The relicensing is being held up pending return of 3-D seismic studies which have been ordered.

==Public perception issues==
There was an uproar when it was discovered that certain blueprints had been misinterpreted, resulting in installation of some cooling systems in the wrong location and/or configuration. Also, there are reports that the valves for the emergency cooling system had been out of order for an extended time period. Moreover, some parties have been agitating on the safety issue (notably Mothers for Peace, Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility) and on environmental concerns (Sierra Club), resulting in a highly contentious public debate.

==Background on the nuclear safety issue==

By now, the most serious '''nuclear accident''' has been the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.  Other serious nuclear accidents include Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station|Fukushima I accident, Three Mile Island accident, the Windscale fire, Mayak accident, and the SL-1 accident. In the period to 2007, 63 major nuclear accidents have occurred at nuclear power plants. Twenty-nine of these have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and 71 percent of all nuclear accidents (45 out of 63) occurred in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. The Costs of Failing Infrastructure ''Energybiz'', September/October 2008, pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''Energy Policy'' 36 (2008), pp. 1802-1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fukushima raises public concernes==
On 11 March 2011, the Magnitude 9.0 devastating 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami took place in Japan. &lt;ref name=&quot;11plants&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/world/japan-earthquake-evacuations-ordered-as-fears-grow-of-radiation-leak-at-nuclear-plant/story-e6frfkyi-1226020473244 |title=Japan earthquake: Evacuations ordered as fears grow of radiation leak at nuclear plant; News.com.au |first= |last=|work= News | location = AU |year=2011|quote=According to the industry ministry, a total of 11 nuclear reactors automatically shut down at the Onagawa plant, the Fukushima No. 1 and No. 2 plants and the Tokai No. 2 plant after the strongest recorded earthquake in the country's history|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chernobyl disaster ==
The Chernobyl disaster was a major accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26, 1986, with an explosion at the plant and later radioactive contamination of the surrounding area. It is so far the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power. A plume of nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern Europe|Eastern and Western Europe, Scandinavia, the UK, Ireland and eastern North America. Large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were badly damaged, forcing the people in charge to have to evacuate and resettle more than 336,000 people. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus, according to official post-Soviet data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chernobyl.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web ||title=Geographical location and extent of radioactive contamination| publisher=Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation|url=http://www.chernobyl.info/index.php?navID=2}} (quoting the &quot;Committee on the Problems of the Consequences of the Catastrophe at the Chernobyl NPP: 15 Years after Chernobyl Disaster&quot;, Minsk, 2001, p. 5/6 ff., and the &quot;Chernobyl Interinform Agency, Kiev und&quot;, and &quot;Chernobyl Committee: MailTable of official data on the reactor accident&quot;) &lt;/ref&gt; 

The accident made many people worried about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry.  As a result, plans for more nuclear plants were put on hold and the Soviet government, who were not very open with its data, had to make public more of its data. The now-independent countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have had to spend a lot of money and time on decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl accident. Nobody knows how many people died because of this accident. This is because the Soviets covered up information, did not fully complete lists, and did not let doctors list &quot;radiation&quot; as the reason why some people died. Most of the expected long-term deaths, such as that from cancer, have not yet happened and it is hard to say that Chernobyl was the full reason for their deaths.

==Three Mile Island accident==
[[Image:3MileIsland.jpg|thumb|right|Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station consisted of two pressurized water reactors  each inside its own containment building and connected cooling towers. TMI-2 is in the background.]]

On March 28, 1979, the Unit 2[nuclear power plant on the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (TMI-2) in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania suffered a partial core nuclear meltdown.

The Three Mile Island accident was the worst accident in United States commercial nuclear power generating history, even though it led to no deaths or injuries to plant workers or members of the nearby community.&lt;ref name=FactSheet&gt;U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Fact Sheet on the Accident at Three Mile Island. Available at http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''accident''' unfolded over the course of five tense days, as a number of agencies at local, state and federal level tried to diagnose the problem and decide whether or not the on-going accident required a full emergency evacuation of the population. The full details of the accident were not discovered until much later. In the end, the reactor was brought under control. Although approximately 25,000 people lived within five miles of the island at the time of the accident,&lt;ref name=Kemeny&gt;President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, ''The need for change, the legacy of TMI : report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island'' (Washington, D.C.: The Commission, 1979). [Aka “Kemeny Commission report.”] Available at http://www.threemileisland.org/&lt;/ref&gt; no identifiable injuries due to radiation occurred, and a government report concluded that &quot;the projected number of excess fatal cancers due to the accident... is approximately one&quot;.  But the accident had serious [[economics|economic]] and public relations consequences, and the cleanup process was slow and costly. It also furthered a major decline in the public popularity of nuclear power, exemplifying for many the worst fears about nuclear technology and, until the Chernobyl disaster seven years later, it was considered the world's worst civilian nuclear accident.
[[File:Davis-Besse ReactorHeadInspection.jpg|thumb|Davis Besse Reactor Head Inspection.]]

==Davis-Besse==
Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station is a single reactor located on the southwest shore of Lake Erie near Oak Harbor, Ohio.  According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Davis-Besse has been the source of two of the top five most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States] since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web | author=Nuclear Regulatory Commission | date=2004-09-16 | title=Davis-Besse preliminary accident sequence precursor analysis | format=PDF | url=http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/vessel-head-degradation/news/2004/09-16-04-ml0426005320.pdf| accessdate=2006-06-14}} and {{cite_web | author=Nuclear Regulatory Commission | date=[[2004-09-20]] | title=NRC issues preliminary risk analysis of the combined safety issues at Davis-Besse | url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2004/04-117.html | accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SL-1 accident==
The SL-1, or Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One, was a United States Army experimental nuclear reactor which underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in January 1961, killing its three operators. The direct cause was the improper withdrawal by a maintenance team of a single reactor control rod. The event is the only reported fatal reactor accident in the United States.

==Windscale fire==
On October 10, 1957, the graphite core of a British nuclear reactor at Windscale, Cumbria, caught fire, releasing substantial amounts of radioactive contamination into the surrounding area. The event, known as the Windscale fire, was considered the world's worst nuclear accident until the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. 

The fire itself released an estimated 20,000 curies -(700 becquerel/terabecquerels) of radioactive material into the nearby countryside.  Of particular concern was the radioactive isotope iodine-131, which has a Half-life of only 8 days but is taken up by the human body and stored in the thyroid.  As a result, consumption of iodine-131 often leads to cancer of the thyroid.

No one was evacuated from the surrounding area, but there was concern that milk might be dangerously contaminated.  Milk from about 500km² of nearby countryside was destroyed (diluted a thousandfold and dumped in the Irish Sea) for about a month.

==Mayak accident==
Mayak is the name of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plants 150 km northwest of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Working conditions at Mayak resulted in severe health hazards and many accidents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/1999/so99/so99larin.html]&lt;/ref&gt; with a serious accident occurring in 1957.

The 1957 Kyshtym disaster occurred when the failure of the cooling system for a tank storing tens of thousands of tons of dissolved nuclear waste resulted in a non-nuclear explosion having a force estimated at about 75 tons of trinitrotoluene|TNT (310 joule|gigajoules), which released some 20 MCi (740 petabecquerels) of radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/projects/mandala/TED/ural.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at least 200 people died of radiation sickness, 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes, and 470,000 people were exposed to radiation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction: What is public policy?'''


Public policy as government action is generally the principled guide to action taken by the administrative or executive branches of the state with regard to a class of issues in a manner consistent with law and institutional customs. In general, the foundation is the pertinent national and subnational constitutional law and implementing legislation such as the US Federal code. Further substrates include both judicial interpretations and regulations which are generally authorized by legislation.

Dean G. Kilpatrick, Ph.D. states &quot;Public policy can be generally defined as a system of laws, regulatory measures, courses of action, and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/policy/definition.shtml/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Different forms of citizen participation'''

The various editors of Wikipedia's entry for Community Organizing &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/Community_Organizing &lt;/ref&gt; seem to take the point of view that community organizing is the superior form of engaging the state. Be that as it may, they distinguish several classes of participation which they distinguish from community organizing per se.

* Activism: According to Edward Chambers, community organizing is distinguishable from activism if activists engage in social protest without a coherent strategy for building power or for making specific social changes.

* Mobilizing: When people &quot;mobilize&quot; they get together to effect a specific social change, but have no long term plan. When the particular campaign that mobilized them is over, these groups dissolve and durable power is not built.

* Advocacy: Advocates generally speak for others who are unable to represent their own interest due to disability, inherent complexity of the venue such as courts and hospitals, or other factors. Community organizing emphasizes the virtue of trying to get those affected to speak for themselves.

* Social Movements: A broad Social movement often encompasses diverse collections of individual activists, local and national organizations, advocacy groups, multiple and often conflicting spokespersons, and more, held together by relatively common aims but not a common organizational structure. A community organizing group might be part of a “movement.” Movements generally dissolve when the motivating issue(s) are addressed, although organizations created during movements can continue and shift their focuses.

* Legal Action: Lawyers are often quite important to those engaged in social action. The problem comes when a social action strategy is designed primarily around a lawsuit. When lawyers take the center stage, it can push grassroots struggle into the background, short circuiting the development of collective power and capacity. There are examples where community organizing groups and legal strategies have worked together well, however, including the Williams v. California lawsuit over inequality in k-12 education.

Wikipedia also informs us that &quot;Saul Alinsky, based in Chicago, is credited with originating the term community organizer during this time period. Alinsky wrote Reveille for Radicals, published in 1946, and Rules for Radicals, published in 1971. With these books, Alinsky was the first person in America to codify key strategies and aims of community organizing. He also founded the first national community organizing training network, the Industrial Areas Foundation...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A vector is a two-element value that represents both magnitude and direction.  

Vectors are normally represented by the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;{v} = (v_x\, v_y)&lt;/math&gt; or, when dealing with three dimentions, the tuple &lt;math&gt;{v} = (v_x\, v_y\, v_z)&lt;/math&gt;.  When written in this fashion, they represent a quantity along a given axis.  

The following formulas are important with vectors:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\|\mathbf{v}\right\|=\sqrt{{v_x}^2+{v_y}^2+{v_z}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v_x = \left\|\mathbf{v}\right\| \cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v_y = \left\|\mathbf{v}\right\| \sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{v_y}{v_x})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Addition and subtraction ==

Addition is performed by adding the components of the vector.  For example, c = a + b is seen as:

: &lt;math&gt;{c} = (a_x + b_x  \, a_y + b_y)&lt;/math&gt;

With subtraction, invert the sign of the second vector's components.
: &lt;math&gt;{c} = (a_x - b_x  \, a_y - b_y)&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplication (Scalar) ==

The components of the vector are multiplied by the scalar:

: &lt;math&gt;s * {v} = (s*v_x \, s*v_y)&lt;/math&gt;


== Division ==

While some domains may permit division of vectors by vectors, such operations in physics are undefined.  It is only possible to divide a vector by a scalar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Section C: What are the myths of capitalist economics?'''

Within capitalism, economics plays an important ideological role. Economics has been used to construct a theory from which exploitation and oppression are excluded, by definition. We will attempt here to explain why capitalism is deeply exploitative. Elsewhere, in section B, we have indicated why capitalism is oppressive and will not repeat ourselves here.

In many ways economics plays the role within capitalism that religion played in the Middle Ages, namely to provide justification for the dominant social system and hierarchies. “The priest keeps you docile and subjected,” argued Malatesta, “telling you everything is God's will; the economist say it's the law of nature.” They “end up saying that no one is responsible for poverty, so there's no point rebelling against it.” [Fra Contadini, p. 21] Even worse, they usually argue that collective action by working class people is counterproductive and, like the priest, urge us to tolerate current oppression and exploitation with promises of a better future (in heaven for the priest, for the economist it is an unspecified “long run”). It would be no generalisation to state that if you want to find someone to rationalise and justify an obvious injustice or form of oppression then you should turn to an economist (preferably a “free market” one).

That is not the only similarity between the “science” of economics and religion. Like religion, its basis in science is usually lacking and its theories more based upon “leaps of faith” than empirical fact. Indeed, it is hard to find a “science” more unconcerned about empirical evidence or building realistic models than economics. Just looking at the assumptions made in “perfect competition” shows that (see section C.1 for details). This means that economics is immune to such trivialities as evidence and fact, although that does not stop economics being used to rationalise and justify certain of these facts (such as exploitation and inequality). A classic example is the various ways economists have sought to explain what anarchists and other socialists have tended to call “surplus value” (i.e. profits, interest and rent). Rather than seek to explain its origin by an empirical study of the society it exists in (capitalism), economists have preferred to invent “just-so” stories, little a-historic parables about a past which never existed is used to illustrate (and so defend) a present class system and its inequalities and injustices. The lessons of a fairy tale about a society that has never existed are used as a guide for one which does and, by some strange co-incidence, they happen to justify the existing class system and its distribution of income. Hence the love of Robinson Crusoe in economics.

Ironically, this favouring of theory (ideology would be a better term) is selective as their exposure as fundamentally flawed does not stop them being repeated. As we discuss in section C.2, the neoclassical theory of capital was proven to be incorrect by left-wing economists. This was admitted by their opponents: “The question that confronts us is not whether the Cambridge Criticism is theoretically valid. It is. Rather the question is an empirical or econometric one: is there sufficient substitutability within the system to establish neo-classical results?” Yet this did not stop this theory being taught to this day and the successful critique forgotten. Nor has econometrics successfully refuted the analysis, as capital specified in terms of money cannot reflect a theoretical substance (neo-classical “capital”) which could not exist in reality. However, that is unimportant for “[u]ntil the econometricians have the answer for us, placing reliance upon neo-classical economic theory is a matter of faith,” which, of course, he had [C. E. Ferguson, The Neo-classical Theory of Production and Distribution, p. 266 and p. xvii]

Little wonder that Joan Robinson, one of the left-wing economists who helped expose the bankruptcy of the neo-classical theory of capital, stated that economics was “back where it was, a branch of theology.” [Collected Economic Papers, Vol. 4, p. 127] It remains there more than thirty years later:

{{cquote|Economics is not a science. Many economists — particularly those who believe that decisions on whether to get married can be reduced to an equation — see the world as a complex organism that can be understood using the right differential calculus. Yet everything we know about economics suggests that it is a branch and not a particularly advanced one, of witchcraft.|||Larry Elliot and Dan Atkinson|The Age of Insecurity, p. 226}}

The weakness of economics is even acknowledged by some within the profession itself. According to Paul Ormerod, “orthodox economics is in many ways an empty box. Its understanding of the world is similar to that of the physical sciences in the Middle Ages. A few insights have been obtained which stand the test of time, but they are very few indeed, and the whole basis of conventional economics is deeply flawed.” Moreover, he notes the “overwhelming empirical evidence against the validity of its theories.” It is rare to see an economist be so honest. The majority of economists seem happy to go on with their theories, trying to squeeze life into the Procrustean bed of their models. And, like the priests of old, make it hard for non-academics to question their dogmas as “economics is often intimidating. Its practitioners . . . have erected around the discipline a barrier of jargon and mathematics which makes the subject difficult to penetrate for the non-initiated.” [The Death of Economics, p. ix, p. 67 and p. ix]

So in this section of our FAQ, we will try to get to the heart of modern capitalism, cutting through the ideological myths that supporters of the system have created around it. This will be a difficult task, as the divergence of the reality of capitalism and the economics that is used to explain (justify, more correctly) it is large. For example, the preferred model used in neo-classical economics is that of “perfect competition” which is based on a multitude of small firms producing homogenous products in a market which none of them are big enough to influence (i.e. have no market power). This theory was developed in the late 19th century when the real economy was marked by the rise of big business, a dominance which continues to this day. Nor can it be said that even small firms produce identical products — product differentiation and brand loyalty are key factors for any business. In other words, the model reflected (and still reflects) the exact opposite of reality.

In spite of the theoretical models of economics having little or no relation to reality, they are used to both explain and justify the current system. As for the former, the truly staggering aspect of economics for those who value the scientific method is the immunity of its doctrines to empirical refutation (and, in some cases, theoretical refutation). The latter is the key to not only understanding why economics is in such a bad state but also why it stays like that. While economists like to portray themselves as objective scientists, merely analysing the system, the development of their “science” has always been marked with apologetics, with rationalising the injustices of the existing system. This can be seen best in attempts by economists to show that Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of firms, capitalists and landlords all deserve their riches while workers should be grateful for what they get. As such, economics has never been value free simply because what it says affects people and society. This produces a market for economic ideology in which those economists who supply the demand will prosper. Thus we find many “fields of economics and economic policy where the responses of important economic professionals and the publicity given economic findings are correlated with the increased market demand for specific conclusions and a particular ideology.” [Edward S. Herman, “The Selling of Market Economics,” pp. 173-199, New Ways of Knowing, Marcus G. Raskin and Herbert J. Bernstein (eds.), p.192]

Even if we assume the impossible, namely that economists and their ideology can truly be objective in the face of market demand for their services, there is a root problem with capitalist economics. This is that it the specific social relations and classes produced by capitalism have become embedded into the theory. Thus, as an example, the concepts of the marginal productivity of land and capital are assumed to universal in spite the fact that neither makes any sense outside an economy where one class of people owns the means of life while another sells their labour to them. Thus in an artisan/peasant society or one based around co-operatives, there would be no need for such concepts for in such societies, the distinction between wages and profits has no meaning and, as a result, there is no income to the owners of machinery and land and no need to explain it in terms of the “marginal productivity” of either. Thus mainstream economics takes the class structure of capitalism as a natural, eternal, fact and builds up from there. Anarchists, like other socialists, stress the opposite, namely that capitalism is a specific historical phase and, consequently, there are no universal economic laws and if you change the system the laws of economics change. Unless you are a capitalist economist, of course, when the same laws apply no matter what.

In our discussion, it is important to remember that capitalist economics is not the same as the capitalist economy. The latter exists quite independently of the former (and, ironically, usually flourishes best when the policy makers ignore it). Dissident economist Steve Keen provides a telling analogy between economics and meteorology. Just as “the climate would exist even if there were no intellectual discipline of meteorology, the economy itself would exist whether or not the intellectual pursuit of economics existed.” Both share “a fundamental raison d'etre,” namely “that of attempting to understand a complex system.” However, there are differences. Like weather forecasters, “economists frequently get their forecasts of the economic future wrong. But in fact, though weather forecasts are sometimes incorrect, overall meteorologists have an enviable record of accurate prediction — whereas the economic record is tragically bad.” This means it is impossible to ignore economics (“to treat it and its practitioners as we these days treat astrologers”) as it is a social discipline and so what we “believe about economics therefore has an impact upon human society and the way we relate to one another.” Despite “the abysmal predictive record of their discipline,” economists “are forever recommending ways in which the institutional environment should be altered to make the economy work better.” By that they mean make the real economy more like their models, as “the hypothetical pure market performs better than the mixed economy in which we live.” [Debunking Economics, pp. 6-8] Whether this actually makes the world a better place is irrelevant (indeed, economics has been so developed as to make such questions irrelevant as what happens on the market is, by definition, for the best).

Here we expose the apologetics for what they are, expose the ideological role of economics as a means to justify, indeed ignore, exploitation and oppression. In the process of our discussion we will often expose the ideological apologetics that capitalist economics create to defend the status quo and the system of oppression and exploitation it produces. We will also attempt to show the deep flaws in the internal inconsistencies of mainstream economics. In addition, we will show how important reality is when evaluating the claims of economics.

That this needs to be done can be seen by comparing the promise of economics with its actual results when applied in reality. Mainstream economics argues that it is based on the idea of “utility” in consumption, i.e. the subjective pleasure of individuals. Thus production is, it is claimed, aimed at meeting the demands of consumers. Yet for a system supposedly based on maximising individual happiness (“utility”), capitalism produces a hell of a lot of unhappy people. Some radical economists have tried to indicate this and have created an all-embracing measure of well-being called the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). Their conclusions, as summarised by Elliot and Atkinson, are significant:

{{cquote|In the 1950s and 1960s the ISEW rose in tandem with per capita GDP. It was a time not just of rising incomes, but of greater social equity, low crime, full employment and expanding welfare states. But from the mid-1970s onwards the two measures started to move apart. GDP per head continued its inexorable rise, but the ISEW started to decline as a result of lengthening dole queues, social exclusion, the explosion in crime, habitat loss, environmental degradation and the growth of environment- and stress-related illness. By the start of the 1990s, the ISEW was almost back to the levels at which it started in the early 1950s.|||Larry Elliot and Dan Atkinson|Op. Cit., p. 248}}

So while capitalism continues to produce more and more goods and, presumably, maximises more and more individual utility, actual real people are being “irrational” and not realising they are, in fact, better off and happier. Ironically, when such unhappiness is pointed out most defenders of capitalism dismiss people's expressed woe's as irrelevant. Apparently some subjective evaluations are considered more important than others!

Given that the mid-1970s marked the start of neo-liberalism, the promotion of the market and the reduction of government interference in the economy, this is surely significant. After all, the “global economy of the early 21st century looks a lot more like the economic textbook ideal that did the world of the 1950s . . . All these changes have followed the advance of economists that the unfettered market is the best way to allocate resources, and that well-intentioned interventions which oppose market forces will actually do more harm than good.” As such, “[w]ith the market so much more in control of the global economy now than fifty years ago, then if economists are right, the world should be a manifestly better place: it should be growing faster, with more stability, and income should go to those who deserve it.” However, “[u]nfortunately, the world refuses to dance the expected tune. In particularly, the final ten years of the 20th century were marked, not by tranquil growth, but by crises.” [Steve Keen, Op. Cit., p. 2]

These problems and the general unhappiness with the way society is going is related to various factors, most of which are impossible to reflect in mainstream economic analysis. They flow from the fact that capitalism is a system marked by inequalities of wealth and power and so how it develops is based on them, not the subjective evaluations of atomised individuals that economics starts with. This in itself is enough to suggest that capitalist economics is deeply flawed and presents a distinctly flawed picture of capitalism and how it actually works.

Anarchists argue that this is unsurprising as economics, rather than being a science is, in fact, little more than an ideology whose main aim is to justify and rationalise the existing system. We agree with libertarian Marxist Paul Mattick's summation that economics is “actually no more than a sophisticated apology for the social and economic status quo” and hence the “growing discrepancy between [its] theories and reality.” [Economics, Politics and the Age of Inflation, p. vii] Anarchists, unsurprisingly, see capitalism as a fundamentally exploitative system rooted in inequalities of power and wealth dominated by hierarchical structures (capitalist firms). In the sections that follow, the exploitative nature of capitalism is explained in greater detail. We would like to point out that for anarchists, exploitation is not more important than domination. Anarchists are opposed to both equally and consider them to be two sides of the same coin. You cannot have domination without exploitation nor exploitation without domination. As Emma Goldman pointed out, under capitalism:

{{cquote|wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade . . . Nor is this the only crime . . . Still more fatal is the crime of turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron. Man is being robbed not merely of the products of his labour, but of the power of free initiative, of originality, and the interest in, or desire for, the things he is making.|||Red Emma Speaks|pp. 66-7}}

Needless to say, it would be impossible to discuss or refute every issue covered in a standard economics book or every school of economics. As economist Nicholas Kaldor notes, “[e]ach year new fashions sweep the `politico-economic complex' only to disappear again with equal suddenness . . . These sudden bursts of fashion are a sure sign of the `pre-scientific' stage [economics is in], where any crazy idea can get a hearing simply because nothing is known with sufficient confidence to rule it out.” [The Essential Kaldor, p. 377] We will have to concentrate on key issues like the flaws in mainstream economics, why capitalism is exploitative, the existence and role of economic power, the business cycle, unemployment and inequality.

Nor do we wish to suggest that all forms of economics are useless or equally bad. Our critique of capitalist economics does not suggest that no economist has contributed worthwhile and important work to social knowledge or our understanding of the economy. Far from it. As Bakunin put it, property “is a god” and has “its metaphysics. It is the science of the bourgeois economists. Like any metaphysics it is a sort of twilight, a compromise between truth and falsehood, with the latter benefiting from it. It seeks to give falsehood the appearance of truth and leads truth to falsehood.” [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 179] How far this is true varies form school to school, economist to economist. Some have a better understanding of certain aspects of capitalism than others. Some are more prone to apologetics than others. Some are aware of the problems of modern economics and “some of the most committed economists have concluded that, if economics is to become less of a religion and more of a science, then the foundations of economics should be torn down and replaced” (although, “left to [their] own devices”, economists “would continue to build an apparently grand edifice upon rotten foundations.”). [Keen, Op. Cit., p. 19]

As a rule of thumb, the more free market a particular economist or school of economics is, the more likely they will be prone to apologetics and unrealistic assumptions and models. Nor are we suggesting that if someone has made a positive contribution in one or more areas of economic analysis that their opinions on other subjects are correct or compatible with anarchist ideas. It is possible to present a correct analysis of capitalism or capitalist economics while, at the same time, being blind to the problems of Keynesian economics or the horrors of Stalinism. As such, our quoting of certain critical economists does not imply agreement with their political opinions or policy suggestions.

Then there is the issue of what do we mean by the term “capitalist economics”? Basically, any form of economic theory which seeks to rationalise and defend capitalism. This can go from the extreme of free market capitalist economics (such as the so-called “Austrian” school and Monetarists) to those who advocate state intervention to keep capitalism going (Keynesian economists). We will not be discussing those economists who advocate state capitalism. As a default, we will take “capitalist economics” to refer to the mainstream “neoclassical” school as this is the dominant form of the ideology and many of its key features are accepted by the others. This seems applicable, given that the current version of capitalism being promoted is neo-liberalism where state intervention is minimised and, when it does happen, directed towards benefiting the ruling elite.

Lastly, one of the constant refrains of economists is the notion that the public is ignorant of economics. The implicit assumption behind this bemoaning of ignorance by economists is that the world should be run either by economists or on their recommendations. In section C.11 we present a case study of a nation, Chile, unlucky enough to have that fate subjected upon it. Unsurprisingly, this rule by economists could only be imposed as a result of a military coup and subsequent dictatorship. As would be expected, given the biases of economics, the wealthy did very well, workers less so (to put it mildly), in this experiment. Equally unsurprising, the system was proclaimed an economic miracle — before it promptly collapsed.

So this section of the FAQ is our modest contribution to making economists happier by making working class people less ignorant of their subject. As Joan Robinson put it:

{{cquote|In short, no economic theory gives us ready-made answers. Any theory that we follow blindly will lead us astray. To make good use of an economic theory, we must first sort out the relations of the propagandist and the scientific elements in it, then by checking with experience, see how far the scientific element appears convincing, and finally recombine it with our own political views. The purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers to economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists.”|||Contributions to Modern Economics|p. 75}}

Various systems have been proposed to stage oocyte growth. Such classifications take into account morphological features of the growing oocyte and its nucleus, oocyte size, and granulosa cell layer properties. The staging presented here is mainly descriptive, and is based on Lambert 1970 and Selman 1993. Classical staging terminology is given for comparison.&lt;br&gt;
For practical purposes, i.e. evaluation of effects of toxicants, a simplified classification, e.g. distinguishing between previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes, may be sufficient. Alternatively, histomorphometrical quantification of oocyte sizes (surface area, diameter) may be helpful to analyse toxicological effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;proliferating oogonia&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* multiplication of oogonia provides a continuous supply of cells to replace oogonia developing to oocytes
* small cells, cell diameters less than 10 µm; 
* cells lie in nests: pre-follicle phase of primary growth;
* threadlike chromosomes.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;primary oocytes - stage 1; first meiotic division - leptotene stage&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* part of the stock of oogonia develops into primary oocytes, which enter the first meiotic division
* meiosis starts with duplication of the chromosomes, yielding a tetraploid cell; the resulting sister chromatides remain attached to the centromere
* in the initial stage of the first meiotic division, the leptotene stage, chromosomes condense from their interphase conformation to produce thin, threadlike structures, seen randomly distributed throughout the whole nucleus; both ends of each chromosome  attach to the nuclear envelope: &quot;chromatin-nucleolus&quot; phase;
* cell diameters range from 10-20 µm;
* cells lie in nests: pre-follicle phase of primary growth.

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;primary oocytes - stage 1; first meiotic division - zygotene stage&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* the zygotene stage starts with the joining of homologous chromosomes (synapsis); the resulting complexes of chromosome pairs are known as bivalents or tetrads (two pairs of sister chromatids);
* this process shows as condensations in the nucleus: &quot;chromatin-nucleolus&quot; phase;
* cell diameters range from 10-20 µm;
* cells lie in nests: pre-follicle phase of primary growth.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;primary oocytes - stage 1; first meiotic division - zygotene stage&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* the chromosomes assemble at one pole of the nucleus, opposite to the nucleolus: &quot;chromatin-nucleolus&quot; phase;
* cell diameters range from 10-20 µm;
* cells lie in nests: pre-follicle phase of primary growth.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;primary oocytes - stage 1; first meiotic division - pachytene stage&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* in the pachytene stage, appearing recombination nodules mediate chromosomal exchange, resulting in nonsister chromatid crossovers (i.e. between chromatids each from the other of the paired chromosomes)
* the chromosomes attain a thickened aspect: &quot;chromatin-nucleolus phase&quot;;
* increase of size of the nucleus;
* cell diameters about 20 µm; 
* cells lie in nests: pre-follicle phase of primary growth.

* appearance of many small nucleoli throughout the nucleus;
* chromosomes spread out through the nucleus;
* increase of size of the nucleus;
* cell diameters about 20 µm;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;primary oocytes - stage 1; first meiotic division - diplotene stage&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* the diplotene stage is characterized by desynapsis (homologous chromosomes move away from each other); decondensed chromosomes engage in RNA synthesis for production of oocyte storage material;
* chromosomes have a slender appearance;
* nucleoli move to the periphery of the nucleus: &quot;perinucleolus&quot; stage;
* increase of size of the nucleus, which is further referred to as &quot;germinal vesicle&quot;;
* increase of cell size, cell diameters &gt; 20 µm;
* increasing amount of cytoplasm, which becomes basophilic;
* appearance of accompanying follicle cells: follicle phase of primary growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hallo!
Welkom op de wiki van Borasol!

'''Wie zijn wij?'''

Wij zijn het team Borasol, bestaande uit studenten uit de 2e fase van de bachelor 'Industriële wetenschappen' optie elektromechanica aan de hogeschool GroepT te Leuven.


'''Wat doen wij?'''

Wij zijn van plan een klein wagentje te bouwen dat aangedreven wordt door zonne-energie. 
Informatie over de gebruikte materialen en technieken, kan je hier vinden. 

Zo kan je hier ook meer informatie vinden over wat zonne-energie precies is en waarom dit zo belangrijk kan zijn voor de mens.


'''Zonne-energie, wat is dat?'''

De zon is een van de vele miljarden sterren die het heelal rijk is. Als gevolg van kernfusie, wordt er ongelooflijk veel energie de ruimte ingestuurd.
Een (klein) deel van deze energie komt richting aarde en zorgt er eigenlijk voor dat de aarde leefbaar is. 
Deze energie, in de vorm van licht en straling, kan gebruikt worden om hier op aarde elektriciteit op te wekken.
Deze elektriciteit kan dan onmiddellijk gebruikt worden om onze elektrische apparaten te doen werken.
Zo zijn er twee manieren om elektriciteit op te wekken: via zonnecollector (gebruikmakend van de thermische energie) of via fotovoltaïsche cellen (gebruikmakend van straling).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== &lt;u&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/u&gt; ===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse Abu Ghraib Prison] was an American detention center located outside of Baghdad, Iraq.  It held over 15,000 prisoners and due to poor record keeping may have housed even more.  These prisoners were categorized as common criminals, security detainees, and a few “high-value” leaders in the insurgency&lt;ref name=&quot;The New Yorker, 2004&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/10/040510fa_fact], The New Yorker, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Of these prisoners, the Taguba Report stated that over 60% were civilian security detainees that should have been released quickly once classified as non-threatening, but this process was extremely inefficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taguba Report&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/iraq/2004/prison_abuse_report.pdf], Taguba Report.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the military police which guarded the prison was undermanned and undertrained in correct protocols for handling prisoners. 
[[File:Abu Ghraib cell block.jpg|thumb|Abu Ghraib prison]]

Through October to December of 2003, “sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses” occurred at Abu Ghraib according to the [http://www.npr.org/iraq/2004/prison_abuse_report.pdf Taguba Report]&lt;ref name=&quot;Taguba Report&quot; /&gt;.  The torture enacted by the military police involved sodomizing detainees, terrorizing and threatening them with military dogs, physically abuse and emotional abuse through sexual humiliation that was extremely disrespectful to their culture. 

Pictures of this abuse was leaked to the media outlets in 2004 and the horrors of Abu Ghraib were exposed in articles in the New Yorker, TV news specials, and even led to the creation of multiple documentaries ([http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896866/ Standard Operating Procedure], [http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/ghosts-of-abu-ghraib/index.html The Ghosts of Abu Ghraib]).

=== &lt;u&gt;Joesph Darby&lt;/u&gt; ===
==== Background ====
Sergeant Joseph Darby was a military police officer (MP) who worked at Abu Ghraib prison in 2003-2004. He was the first person to report the abuse of prisoners and inhumane activities that were taking place within the walls of the infamous prison. Some of the people he reported were from areas near his hometown in rural Maryland, and had known him since basic training. His actions sparked the Criminal Investigation Division's (CID) investigation of the crimes that were committed at Abu Ghraib. After coming home from Iraq, Darby is celebrated nationally and respected within the military community, but his actions were not well received by the people in his hometown.

==== A Startling Discovery ====
After working at Abu Ghraib prison for several months, Darby wanted to send some photos to his wife, Bernadette. He asked his friend, prison guard Charles Graner, who enjoyed photography, if he had any pictures of the area. Graner replied that he did, and he handed Darby two discs. When Darby put the discs in his computer, he was shocked at the content of the photos. He found deeply disturbing images of the torturous acts that were taking place during the night shift at Abu Ghraib.

As an MP, Darby did not have regular interaction with the detainees at Abu Ghraib. Upon seeing the horrifying pictures from Graner, he noticed that many of the US military personnel who appeared to be carrying out the torture were also MPs, and some of them were in his battalion. This means that they should not have been in contact with detainees at all, much less tormenting and humiliating them. Darby knew what he had to do. 

==== Stepping Forward ====

Darby knew that he had to report what he had seen. In an interview, he said &quot;I've always had a moral sense of right and wrong, and I knew... friend or not, it had to stop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;60 Minutes Interview, 2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/07/60minutes/main2238188.shtml]60 Minutes, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because the people he was turning in were his friends, he wanted to remain anonymous. He created a disc of the photos and submitted them to a CID officer in person, and the officer promised to protect Darby's anonymity.

==== Repercussions ====

Although Darby’s identity was kept secret until the suspects were removed from duty at the prison, it was leaked to the media shortly afterward. When his name was reported, Darby was very worried for his personal safety. He was surprised to discover that his decision was respected within the military because he handled the situation appropriately. Despite the acceptance from the Army, he was estranged by the residents of his hometown of Cumberland, Maryland. He even received threats to his life and the lives of his family members because he was seen as a traitor for reporting members of his own battalion. Upon returning to the United States, Darby was relocated to an unknown Army base for his own protection. He was honorably discharged from the Army, and he and his family were protected by armed military guards at all times for over six months. Despite everything that Darby and his family have had to endure as a result of reporting the abuse at Abu Ghraib, Darby maintains that if given the option, he would report the abuse again. He knew that illegal activities were taking place in the prison, and it was his duty as an MP to report such activities.

=== &lt;u&gt;Samuel Provance&lt;/u&gt; ===
==== Background ====
Army Sergeant Samuel Provance was a military intelliegence analyst assigned to Abu Ghraib in September 2003.  Though Provance did not turn in his close friends as Darby did, his actions shed light on the hostility a whistleblower endures.  During the Criminal Investigation Division's investigation, he was the sole active duty soldier to freely cooperate concerning the question of detainee abuse.  He received written orders to no longer discuss the circumstances of Abu Ghraib.  However, he directly disobeyed these orders and gave interviews with several medias.  Because of this break of silence, Provance was demoted, his security clearance suspended, and he was threatened with a possible ten years in military prison if he demanded a court martial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congressional Hearing, 2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/021406provance.pdf], Congressional Hearing, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cryptome.sabotage.org/provance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stepping Forward ====
As a whistleblower, he did not focus on the evidence surrounding the abuse or the military police that carried such abominable actions out.  Unlike Darby and Rumsfeld, he did not blame these actions on “a few bad apples.”&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8012036.stm]BBC News, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Throughout investigations, inquiries, and interviews, the military police mentioned following orders and encouragement from military intelligence officers.  High ranking officials visited the compound during the time the abuse took place and Provance argued that they had to have been aware of some type of misconduct.  Provance expressed the idea of a cover-up.  The military police were certainly in the wrong, but high ranking officers, contractors, and an overall systematic failure of protocol were responsible for knowingly allowing or ordering the abuse at Abu Ghraib.  The military intelligence officers’ roles were repressed, not only in the available photographs, but in those sentenced.  Lieutenant Colonel Jordan was the highest ranking officer to be put on trial.  Eventually of the original 12 counts, he was convicted of only one and issued a reprimand.  Retired Army Colonel Janis Karpinski agreed with Provance indicating higher officials and their issued memorandums as the area where true responsibility rested and stated, &quot;That is what we have been saying from the very beginning, that, wait a minute, why are you inside pointing the finger at me, why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here? There's a bigger story here.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN, 2009&quot;&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-22/us/us.torture.karpinski_1_abu-ghraib-memos-janis-karpinski?_s=PM:US]CNN, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;


In an interview with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, Provance explained,
“You know, there were so many different moving pieces and very important and very powerful people monitoring what was going on. I mean, most people think that what happened at Abu Ghraib was just a handful of soldiers, you know, out in the middle of nowhere, some remote outpost, when in reality it was the premier hub of human intelligence, you know, being watched by the highest powers that be. I mean, even before I had gotten there, Donald Rumsfeld had visited there, Paul Wolfowitz, other representatives for other people in our government, as well as our own, you know, Army powers that be, such as General Ricardo Sanchez and General Fast. And there was brass all over the place on the prison itself. I mean, there was more first sergeants and commanders than you could shake a stick at. 

You know, that’s why I know—and even what was going on, I mean, even the cooks knew thing that were going on. Even the mechanics knew the things that were going on. And that’s why, even to this day, I’m just completely amazed that there’s been nobody else that, you know, has had their conscience bother them to come forward and say, look, you know, this is what was really going on, and that, you know, it wasn’t just these MPs and that these MPs were really doing what they were told.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Democracy Now!, 2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/25/broadcast_exclusive_abu_ghraib_whistleblower_samuel]Democracy Now!, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethical Responsibility ====

When entrenched in a culture that adheres to deep sense of camaraderie, coupled with the consequences of his exposure, why was Samuel Provance the only officer to come forward with information?  One of the ethical guideposts that he used and remembered came from a Holocaust survivor, “Thou shalt not be a victim. Thou shalt not be a perpetrator. Above all, thou shalt not be a bystander.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Harpers, 2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/09/hbc-90001255]Harpers, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  
To this statement, he responded, “After what had happened at Abu Ghraib, I was haunted by this thought. I felt I owed a duty to those who were suffering abuse, and just as much to my fellow soldiers who were trapped, suffering and degraded by the implementation of these new policies. That duty was to speak, no matter the consequences that I might suffer. I decided to do so.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Congressional Hearing, 2006&quot; /&gt;
Yet, even though regarded as a courageous hero for standing up to injustice by Congressmen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Congressional Hearing, 2006&quot; /&gt;
citizens,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lewrockwell.com/kwiatkowski/kwiatkowski77.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations &lt;ref name=&quot;Harpers, 2007&quot; /&gt;, he has suffered as a whistleblower.  He lost his wife, his job, and the Army, which he still believes in and claims “Well, on a personal level, obviously, I would say it’s not worth it, you know, but this is bigger than me.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Democracy Now!, 2008&quot; /&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Whistleblower's Professionalism in the Military&lt;/u&gt; ===

These are two cases of two men who recognized their ethical responsibility to step forward.  They placed the gain of strangers above themselves and their fellow American soldiers.  Yet, the societal reactions to their actions varied.  Joe Darby was shunned by his hometown for turning in his friends, but respected and protected by the military.  Provance was viewed as a traitor to the Army and his career stunted.  Both men are heroes in the overall public eye, but their lives were transformed by their choice to reveal the truth.  And while these two situations occurred in the midst of a military environment, other cases in this wiki book including [[Professionalism/Peter_Buxtun_and_the_Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study|Peter Buxtun and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study]], [[Professionalism/Mark_Klein_and_Room_641A|Mark Klein and Room 641A]], and [[Professionalism/Frederic_Whitehurst_and_the_FBI|Frederic Whitehurst and the FBI]] involve different work-constructed cultures.
Because anonymity was not maintained for Darby or Provance, they had to suffer higher consequences than they would have otherwise. This gives rise to the question of whether or not it is possible to be an anonymous whistleblower, and if guaranteed anonymity would increase the number of people who are willing to speak out in the face of wrongdoing. While both of these men are regarded by the general American public as heroes for trying to end the torture at Abu Ghraib, their lives have certainly undergone permanent changes as a result of their actions. No matter what the situation or professional environment, there is always a price associated with blowing the proverbial whistle, and no one knows that better than Joseph Darby and Samuel Provance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:DNA Agarose Gel Electrophor.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Digital printout of an agarose gel electrophoresis of ''cat''-insert plasmid DNA]]
[[Image:Gel electrophoresis apparatus.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Gel electrophoresis apparatus]]
In simple terms Electrophoresis is a procedure which enables the sorting of molecules based on size and charge. Using an electric field, molecules (such as DNA) can be made to move through a gel made of agar. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric current is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.[citation needed]
The term &quot;gel&quot; in this instance refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a crosslinked polymer whose composition and porosity is chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating proteins or small nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotides) the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of acrylamide and a cross-linker, producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred bases), the preferred matrix is purified agarose. In both cases, the gel forms a solid, yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a neurotoxin and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. Agarose is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrate without cross links resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.[citation needed]
&quot;Electrophoresis&quot; refers to the electromotive force (EMF) that is used to move the molecules through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge to mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform, toward the anode if negatively charged or toward the cathode if positively charged.

In the case of nucleic acids, the direction of migration, from negative to positive electrodes, is due to the naturally-occurring negative charge carried by their sugar-phosphate backbone.
Double-stranded DNA fragments naturally behave as long rods, so their migration through the gel is relative to their size or, for cyclic fragments, their radius of gyration. Single-stranded DNA or RNA tend to fold up into molecules with complex shapes and migrate through the gel in a complicated manner based on their tertiary structure. Therefore, agents that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, such as sodium hydroxide or formamide, are used to denature the nucleic acids and cause them to behave as long rods again.
Gel electrophoresis of large DNA or RNA is usually done by agarose gel electrophoresis. See the &quot;Chain termination method&quot; page for an example of a polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Characterization through ligand interaction of nucleic acids or fragments may be performed by mobility shift affinity electrophoresis.
Electrophoresis of RNA samples can be used to check for genomic DNA contamination and also for RNA degradation. RNA from eukaryotic organisms shows distinct bands of 28s and 18s rRNA, the 28s band being approximately twice as intense as the 18s band. Degraded RNA has less sharpely defined bands, has a smeared appearance, and intensity ratio is less than 2:1.

The DNA to be separated can be prepared in several ways before separation by electrophoresis. In the case of large DNA molecules, the DNA is frequently cut into smaller fragments using a DNA restriction endonuclease (or called restriction enzyme). In other instances, such as PCR amplified samples, enzymes present in the sample that might affect the separation of the molecules are removed through various means before analysis. Once the DNA is properly prepared, the samples of the DNA solution are placed in the wells of the gel and a voltage is applied across the gel for a specified amount of time.

The DNA fragments of different lengths are visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for DNA, such as ethidium bromide. The gel shows bands corresponding to different DNA molecules populations with different molecular weight. Fragment size is usually reported in &quot;nucleotides&quot;, &quot;base pairs&quot; or &quot;kb&quot; (for thousands of base pairs) depending upon whether single- or double-stranded DNA has been separated. Fragment size determination is typically done by comparison to commercially available DNA markers containing linear DNA fragments of known length.

The types of gel most commonly used for DNA electrophoresis are agarose (for relatively long DNA molecules) and polyacrylamide (for high resolution of short DNA molecules, for example in DNA sequencing). Gels have conventionally been run in a &quot;slab&quot; format such as that shown in the figure, but capillary electrophoresis has become important for applications such as high-throughput DNA sequencing. Electrophoresis techniques used in the assessment of DNA damage include alkaline gel electrophoresis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with a specialized gel analysis software. Capillary electrophoresis results are typically displayed in a trace view called an electropherogram.

==Visualization of DNA by ethidium bromide (EtBr) and otherdyes==

The most common dye used to make DNA or RNA bands visible for agarose gel electrophoresis is ethidium bromide, usually abbreviated as EtBr. It fluoresces under UV light when intercalated into DNA (or RNA). By running DNA through an EtBr-treated gel and visualizing it with UV light, any band containing more than ~20 ng DNA becomes distinctly visible. EtBr is a known mutagen, and safer alternatives are available.
Even short exposure of nucleic acids to UV light causes significant damage to the sample. UV damage to the sample will reduce the efficiency of subsequent manipulation of the sample, such as ligation and cloning. If the DNA is to be used after separation on the agarose gel, it is best to avoid exposure to UV light by using a blue light excitation source such as the Xcitablue UV to blue light conversion screen from Bio-Rad or Dark Reader from Clare Chemicals. A blue excitable stain is required, such as one of the SYBR Green or GelGreen stains.
Blue light is also better for visualization since it is safer than UV (eye-protection is not such a critical requirement) and passes through transparent plastic and glass. This means that the staining will be brighter even if the excitation light goes through glass or plastic gel platforms.
SYBR Green I is another dsDNA stain, produced by Invitrogen. It is more expensive, but 25 times more sensitive, and possibly safer than EtBr, though there is no data addressing its mutagenicity or toxicity in humans.
SYBR Safe is a variant of SYBR Green that has been shown to have low enough levels of mutagenicity and toxicity to be deemed nonhazardous waste under U.S. Federal regulations. It has similar sensitivity levels to EtBr, but, like SYBR Green, is significantly more expensive. In countries where safe disposal of hazardous waste is mandatory, the costs of EtBr disposal can easily outstrip the initial price difference, however.
Since EtBr stained DNA is not visible in natural light, scientists mix DNA with negatively charged loading buffers before adding the mixture to the gel. Loading buffers are useful because they are visible in natural light (as opposed to UV light for EtBr stained DNA), and they co-sediment with DNA (meaning they move at the same speed as DNA of a certain length). Xylene cyanol and Bromophenol blue are common dyes found in loading buffers; they run about the same speed as DNA fragments that are 5000 bp and 300 bp in length respectively, but the precise position varies with percentage of the gel. Other less frequently used progress markers are Cresol Red and Orange G which run at about 125 bp and 50 bp, respectively.
Visualization can also be achieved by transferring DNA to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by exposure to a hybridization probe. This process is termed Southern blotting.
==Running buffer==
There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis. The most common being: '''Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE)''', '''Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE)''' and lithium borate (LB). TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3 % agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).
==How to analyze the gel==
After electrophoresis the gel is illuminated with an [[ultraviolet]] lamp (usually by placing it on a light box, while using protective gear to limit exposure to ultraviolet radiation) to view the DNA bands. The [[ethidium bromide]] [[fluorescence|fluoresces]] reddish-orange in the presence of DNA. The DNA band can also be cut out of the gel, and can then be dissolved to retrieve the purified DNA.
The gel can then be photographed usually with a digital or polaroid camera. Although the stained nucleic acid fluoresces reddish-orange, images are usually shown in black and white (see figures). 

Gel electrophoresis research often takes advantage of software-based image analysis tools, such as [[ImageJ]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Southern blot is a method routinely used in molecular biology for detection of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples. Southern blotting combines transfer of electrophoresis-separated DNA fragments to a filter membrane and subsequent fragment detection by probe hybridization. The method is named after its inventor, the British biologist Edwin Southern.

==Protocol==

Restriction endonucleases are used to cut high-molecular-weight DNA strands into smaller fragments.

The DNA fragments are then electrophoresed on an agarose gel to separate them by size.

If some of the DNA fragments are larger than 15 kb, then prior to blotting, the gel may be treated with an acid, such as dilute HCl, which depurinates the DNA fragments, breaking the DNA into smaller pieces, thus allowing more efficient transfer from the gel to membrane.

If alkaline transfer methods are used, the DNA gel is placed into an alkaline solution (typically containing sodium hydroxide) to denature the double-stranded DNA. The denaturation in an alkaline environment may improve binding of the negatively charged DNA to a positively charged membrane, separating it into single DNA strands for later hybridization to the probe (see below), and destroys any residual RNA that may still be present in the DNA. The choice of alkaline over neutral transfer methods, however, is often empirical and may result in equivalent results.

A sheet of nitrocellulose (or, alternatively, nylon) membrane is placed on top of (or below, depending on the direction of the transfer) the gel. Pressure is applied evenly to the gel (either using suction, or by placing a stack of paper towels and a weight on top of the membrane and gel), to ensure good and even contact between gel and membrane. If transferring by suction 20X SSC buffer is used to ensure a seal and prevent drying of the gel. Buffer transfer by capillary action from a region of high water potential to a region of low water potential (usually filter paper and paper tissues) is then used to move the DNA from the gel on to the membrane; ion exchange interactions bind the DNA to the membrane due to the negative charge of the DNA and positive charge of the membrane.

The membrane is then baked in a vacuum or regular oven at 80 °C for 2 hours (standard conditions; nitrocellulose or nylon membrane) or exposed to ultraviolet radiation (nylon membrane) to permanently attach the transferred DNA to the membrane.

The membrane is then exposed to a hybridization probe—a single DNA fragment with a specific sequence whose presence in the target DNA is to be determined. The probe DNA is labelled so that it can be detected, usually by incorporating radioactivity or tagging the molecule with a fluorescent or chromogenic dye. In some cases, the hybridization probe may be made from RNA, rather than DNA. To ensure the specificity of the binding of the probe to the sample DNA, most common hybridization methods use salmon or herring sperm DNA for blocking of the membrane surface and target DNA, deionized formamide, and detergents such as SDS to reduce non-specific binding of the probe.

After hybridization, excess probe is washed from the membrane (typically using SSC buffer), and the pattern of hybridization is visualized on X-ray film by autoradiography in the case of a radioactive or fluorescent probe, or by development of color on the membrane if a chromogenic detection method is used.

Hybridization of the probe to a specific DNA fragment on the filter membrane indicates that this fragment contains DNA sequence that is complementary to the probe.
The transfer step of the DNA from the electrophoresis gel to a membrane permits easy binding of the labeled hybridization probe to the size-fractionated DNA. It also allows for the fixation of the target-probe hybrids, required for analysis by autoradiography or other detection methods.
Southern blots performed with restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA may be used to determine the number of sequences (e.g., gene copies) in a genome. A probe that hybridizes only to a single DNA segment that has not been cut by the restriction enzyme will produce a single band on a Southern blot, whereas multiple bands will likely be observed when the probe hybridizes to several highly similar sequences (e.g., those that may be the result of sequence duplication). Modification of the hybridization conditions (for example, increasing the hybridization temperature or decreasing salt concentration) may be used to increase specificity and decrease hybridization of the probe to sequences that are less than 100% similar.
 A 20X SSC stock solution consists of 
 3 M sodium chloride and
 300 mM trisodium citrate 
 (adjusted to pH 7.0 with HCl).

      <comment>/* Sub-Group CA: Narrow frank, 30-31mm wide by 23-25mm tall, without dots at sides of “POSTE ITALIANE” (except for Types CA7-CA9) */ --~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Italy=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1927.
* Meter manufacturers in Italy: [[File:MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|12px]] Audion, EMS, Elsag Bailey, Francopost, Lirma, Olivetti,  OMT, Pegasus, Sima, Steiner (Primavera), Sysco, TAE

: At some point most of these companies ended their manufacturing of meters and became distributors of rebranded meters manufactured by Francotyp, Frama, and Neopost.  
&lt;p&gt;
* The stamps are grouped according to standard designs as follows:
:: A - With fasces in side panels
:: B - Blank in side panels
:: C - With leaf and branch design in side panels
:: D - With leaves in side panels
:: E - With non-representative ornaments in side panels
:: PO - Designs used only in Post Offices
:: PP - Designs used only for Parcel Post
:: PR - Designs used by licensed parcel carriers
:: PV - Public self-service machine stamps
&lt;p&gt;
[[File:Italy_stamps_with_greater_border.jpg|right|350px]]
* Many stamp types can be especially difficult to differentiate for two reasons. Some meter models were marketed under different nameplates despite being otherwise identical. Second, there was no standardization of basic features such as size of town mark, distance between the town mark and frank, and size/shape of the date and value figures. The result is that stamps from different meter models are often impossible to tell apart, and conversely, stamps of the same type can be highly variable from one machine to another. In some cases stamps from different models have been cataloged as a single type due to the difficulty of differentiation. Some of these stamps can be correctly identified if the impression includes a letter code for the meter model, but use of these codes was arbitrary and many stamps do not have it.
&lt;p&gt;
* The stamps, especially the early ones, are often found with a feature called the ''greater border''. This is usually a multi-line frame surrounding the frank and other elements of the impression. There are four general styles:
:: Simulated perforations around frank and slogan but not the town mark
:: Simulated perforations around frank, town mark and slogan (including or excluding the transaction counter at top)
:: Single or double straight line around frank, town mark and often the slogan (including or excluding the transaction counter)
:: Straight line around the town mark and slogan but not around the frank

* The following symbols are used to depict non-numeric characters in the value figures:
:: [[File:MeterCat 4-point star.jpg|12px]] : 4-point star
:: [[File:MeterCat 5-point asterisk.jpg|12px]] : 5-point asterisk with ends of arms thick
:: ★ : solid 5-point star, arms ending in point (can be thick or thin, with single point up or down)
:: ☆ : hollow 5-point star
:: [[File:MeterCat 5-point starburst.jpg|16px]] : 5-point starburst (sometimes appearing as a dot with five smaller dots around it)
:: [[File:MeterCat 6-point starburst h.jpg|16px]] : 6-point star with horizontal and diagonal arms
:: [[File:MeterCat 6-point starburst v.jpg|16px]] : 6-point star with vertical and diagonal arms
:: ✳ : 8-point starburst
:: ✠ : Maltese cross
:: ≋ : three stacked wavy lines
:: [[File:MeterCat solid diamond.jpg|16px]] : solid diamond (sometimes appears as large dot)
:: ◇ : hollow diamond
:: [[File:MeterCat slot head.jpg|16px]] : split solid circle (slotted screw head)
:: [[File:MeterCat delta.jpg|16px]] : delta or triangle
:: [[File:MeterCat block.jpg|10px]] : solid square
:: [[File:MeterCat box.jpg|10px]]  : hollow square
:: ✖ : bold 'x'
:: [[File:MeterCat negative X.jpg|16px]] : negative 'x'
:: [[File:MeterCat pentagon.jpg|20px]] : hollow pentagon
&lt;br&gt;
* From 1937 to 1944 most meter dates included the Fascist year (in Roman numerals) added at right. A few remained in use as late as 1952.
&lt;br&gt;
* Meters in Italy are capable of printing a directional slug that is usually found several centimeters below the town mark but also at other locations. Known slugs are:
:: ESPRESSO (express)
:: ESTRATTO CONTO (statement of account)
:: FATTURA COMM (commercial invoice)
:: MANOSCRITTI (manuscript)
:: MANOSCRITTI CON LETTERA DI ACCOMPAGNAMENTO (manuscript with accompanying letter)
:: RACCOMMANDATE (registered)
:: STAMPE or STAMPATI (printed matter)
:: VIA AEREA (by air)&lt;br&gt;
: This catalog lists slugs used with Post Office meters (Group PO) but not those found on regular meters.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: '''CB1. Sima''' (MV), 1948. 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: Large variations in size and style of value figures exist. See the chart above.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: Value figures are normally fairly large, 5½-7mm tall, but also short, 4-5mm. The taller figures can be angular or oval while the shorter figures are always oval.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: Two kinds of angular value figures are found. One is the classic angular figure commonly seen with early German Francotyp meters. The other is peculiar to Italy and is a blend of the sharply angular German style and a variable oval font. It is referred to below as &quot;IA&quot; (for Italian Angular).
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: Two kinds of oval value figures also exist. One is a large font with figures of variable thickness, and the other is smaller with lines of uniform thickness. These are both referred to as &quot;O&quot;.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: Spacing between the town mark and frank is also highly variable, 1mm to 38mm have been seen.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: The date figures are fairly consistent in size and style and nearly always have stops after D and M. 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: If present, the identification number prefix is “SE” or “SI”.

'''NOTE''': Francotyp meters were rebranded as '''Postitalia''' meters after World War Two. Other than the name change there are no differences between the machines. The stamps are indistinguishable unless they include an identification number with prefix, &quot;FT&quot; for Francotyp or &quot;P&quot; for Postalia. These prefixes are always followed by one or two lower case letters, i.e. FTc, FTee, Pa, etc.

'''NOTE''': See the NOTE following Type CB3. This applies also to CB3.1 except in one respect. Later Postitalia meters were fitted with date figures that are different from those used with Francotyp C and early Postitalia rebranded meters.

These later Postitalia dates are found both with stops and without. Those with stops are cataloged as Type CB3.2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Further Pure 2 (FP2) is a Further Mathematics module for the Edexcel Exam board. It expands upon the foundations of pure mathematics laid out in C1 through C4 and FP1 and then introduces several new techniques. FP2 cannot contribute to the Mathematics A-level, but it does contribute towards the Further Mathematics A-level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Electric Motor==
Electric Motor is an Electric Machine operating from the interaction of two Magnetic Fields Forces to produce circular motion
:[[File:Electric_motors_en.jpg|200px]]

==Construction==
:[[File:Electric_motor_cycle_3.png|200px]]
: [[Image:Simplified_electric_motor.png]]

Look at the diagram above. A  rectangular loop of wire is sitting inside a magnetic field. We can consider the current in the four sections of the loop and work out which way the force acts.
*On the left hand side of the loop the current is flowing ''into'' the page or screen. The magnetic field will be going from left to right so from Flemming's left hand rule the force will be downwards.
*On the back and front of the loops the current is parallel to the magnetic field so there is ''zero'' force.
*On the right hand side of the loop the current is coming ''out'' of the page or screen. The field is still going from left to right so the force will be upwards.

The net result of these different forces is that there will be a turning moment that makes the coil rotate by 90&amp;deg;. At that point the upwards and downwards forces will be acting along the same line and the coil will stop turning. Another way to think about it is to consider the loop as a tiny little one turn solenoid. The solenoid will have a little north pole and a little south pole and will therefore move until its north pole lines up with the south pole of the magnet on the right, and its south pole lines up with the north pole of  magnet on the left.

This is all very interesting but not much use as a motor. We want something that keeps turning all the time the current flows. They way this is achieved is by the use of the commutator - a circular metal ring that is split into two halves. The ends of the wire loop turn around inside the commutator. They are in electrical contact with it. One side of the commutator is connected to the positive output of a power pack or battery . the other half of the commutator is connected to the negative.

Let's look at what happens as the coil turns inside the commutator:
#The coil turns clockwise because of the forces on the two halves as explained above. 
#As the coil turns the wires slip around on the inside of the commutator.
#When the coil is in a vertical position there is no force on it, but its momentum carries it forward a little.
#The wires inside the commutator make contact with the other half of the ring. I.e. the wire that was in contact with the positive half of the commutator now touches the negative half and vice versa.
#This causes the current to flow the other way around the coil, which reverses the little solenoid magnet.
#The coil therefore tries to line itself up with the magnetic field by continuing to turn so that it ultimately points in the other direction. 
#Once the coil is vertical, and facing the other way, the wires touch their original halves of the commutator. and the whole cycle repeats over and over

'''Q7)'''A student sets up an electric motor and turns it on. The coil turns clockwise. List two ways she could reverse the direction.

==ElectroMagnetic Force==
The force depends on a number of things:
*How strong the magnetic field is.(B)
*How much current is flowing through the wire. (I)
*The angle formed between the wire and the direction of the magnetic field.(θ)
*The length of the wire, carrying the current, in the magnetic field.(l)

The force obeys the formula: F=lBISinθ

The first two points are pretty much obvious, so let's look at the third point in a little more detail. The magnetic field of a horseshoe magnet points pretty much in a straight line from the north pole to the south pole.  If the wire cuts this field at right angles the resulting force will be a maximum. If the wire runs parallel to the field, from the north the south pole or vice versa, the wire will still experience the motor effect. However, the net result of this force is along the wire, not perpendicular to it, thus the wire does not turn.

Having said that, at GCSE you only really need to think about situations where the field and the wire cut each other at right angles. The force is always at right angles to both the field and the current flowing in the wire. This means that if you draw the direction of the magnetic field and the wire on a piece of paper the force will be out of the plane of the paper pointing straight up or down {More about how you work out which way later).

[[Image:The motor effect.png]]

Look at the diagram above. For simplicity, only the two ends of the horseshoe magnet have been drawn. Also the power pack and connecting wires are not shown either. The magnetic field is going into the screen. The current is traveling from right to left. The black line represents the force, and therefore the direction that the wire moves.

*'''Q1)''' Name one way that the force on the wire could be increased.
*'''Q2)''' Name as many ways as you can to reduce the force on the wire.
*'''Q3)'''  Name two ways of reversing the force on the wire, so that it pushes the wire up rather than down.

==Fleming's Left Hand Rule== 


[[Image:Hand (motor effect).png]]

This rule allows you to work out which direction the force will point in. Arrange your left hand with your thumb, first finger, and second fingers all pointing at right angles to one another. 

*Point your &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; '''F&lt;/font&gt;'''irst finger in the direction of the magnetic &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;''' field'''&lt;/font&gt;.
*Point your '''Se&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;C&lt;/font&gt;ond''' finger in the direction of the &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; '''current'''&lt;/font&gt;.
*The &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt; '''Th'''&lt;/font&gt;umb will then give you the direction of the '''force''' (&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''thrust'''&lt;/font&gt;).

Remember you have to use your left hand for this! Although you may use your right hand so long as you swap the direction of current with the force

'''Q4)''' A student uses her right hand instead of her left. What effect will that have on the force she works out?

You will recall that a current carrying wire is surrounded by its own magnetic field. The diagram below shows the wire end on in a magnetic field of two magnets that are NS facing. The field due to the magnets is shown in blue, and the field due to the current in the wire is shown in black.

[[Image:Motor effect 1.png]]

Notice the direction of the two fields as shown by the arrows. On top of the wire the fields are both going in the same direction. They add up making an overall strong field. 

Underneath the wire, they go in opposite directions. They cancel each other out to some extent making an overall weaker field. The new field is shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:Motor effect 2.png]]

See how the field above the wire is stronger. The lines are closer together. Below the wire the field is weaker (due to partial canceling out) the field lines are further apart. The force pushes the wire downwards, away from the strong field into the weak field. It's as if the field lines try to repel each other. They don't like being squashed together and try to straighten out. They also act as if they are made of elastic bands, they don't like being stretched out of shape. (This is just a model of what's going on. The lines aren't real, they don't actually try to push each other away, but I find it a way of helping me understand what's going on. If it doesn't help you, don't use it)

*'''Q5)''' Use the idea of field lines not liking being squashed together to explain why two magnets with like poles facing each other repel.
*'''(Q6)''' Use the idea of field lines being made of elastic to explain why two magnets with opposite poles facing attract one another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Relay==
Relay is an Electromagnetic Switch that can open and close circuit through Electromagnetic Force
==Construction==
A '''relay''' is an [[electric]]ally operated [[switch]]. Many relays use an [[electromagnet]] to operate a switching mechanism mechanically, but other operating principles are also used. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a low-power signal (with complete electrical isolation between control and controlled circuits), or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal.  The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits, repeating the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitting it to another. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;Implicit Differentiation&lt;/center&gt;===
&lt;p&gt;When a functional relation between '''&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;''' and '''&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;''' cannot be readily solved for '''&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;''', the preceding rules may be applied directly to the implicit function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative will usually contain both '''&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;''' and '''&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;'''.  Thus the derivative of an algebraic function, defined by setting the polynomial of '''&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;''' and '''&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;''' to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

'''&lt;p&gt;Ex. 1&lt;/p&gt;'''
&lt;p&gt;Given the function &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^5+y^5-5xy+1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}\over\operatorname{d}x}(x^5+y^5-5xy+1)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;=5x^4+5y^4{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}-5y-5x{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In solving for &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}&lt;/math&gt; we must first factor the differentiation problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing this we get &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}(5y^4-5x)+(5x^4-5y)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we subtract the &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}&lt;/math&gt; to one side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus giving us&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;5x^4-5y=-{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}(-5x+5y^4)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am going to skip a step in solving this implicit differentiation problem.  I am going to skip the step where I divide the -1 over to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we divide the polynomial from the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x&lt;/math&gt; over to the other side. Giving us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{-5x^4+5y}{-5x+5y^4}\right)={\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we simplify and get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}=\left (\frac{x^4-y}{x-y^4}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'''&lt;p&gt;Other problems to work on&lt;/p&gt;'''
'''&lt;p&gt;Ex. 2&lt;/p&gt;'''
&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}&lt;/math&gt; given the function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;xy^2+x^2y=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'''&lt;p&gt;Ex. 3&lt;/p&gt;'''
&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}y\over\operatorname{d}x}&lt;/math&gt; given the function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x+y+(x-y)^2+(2x-3y)^3=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>works with a list of shapes, not just two shapes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Shape regions are created by performing boolean geometric [[/union/]], [[/intersection/]] and [[/subtraction/]] operations.

=== Creating a region from a list of shapes ===

The r command is used to create a region from a list of shapes. Note that the shapes must have been created in the database for the operations to work:

 # Create a region named region1.r that consists of a union
 # of the objects sph1.s and sph2.s
 r region1.r u sph1.s sph2.s

      <text xml:space="preserve">Radical feminism is a form of feminism that views systematic male privilege (known as patriarchy) as the foremost form of oppression, and as a wide-ranging problem at the root of society that requires appropriately radical (from latin ''radix'', root) solutions. Radical feminists do not see rape as a one-off occurrence but as a shockingly commonplace event manifesting the overall dominance of men over women. Radical feminists reject prostitution and pornography as turning women into mere objects for male pleasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ifeminism (meaning individualist feminism) is a form of feminism with influences from libertarianism, founded by Wendy McElroy. The ifeminist believes that feminism is about procuring liberty for the individual woman. For this reason, ifeminists reject stereotyping, victimization and restriction of women's choices. Ifeminists see the sex industry as fundamentally a liberating and healthy expression of women's sexuality, and consider feminist opposition to the sex industry repressive and against the true message of feminism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Removed problem 6 from &quot;Functions&quot; section==
I removed the following problem from the &quot;Functions&quot; section (old problem 6):

# Consider the following function 
#:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{2x^2+2x+1}{x^2-1} &lt;/math&gt;
## What is the domain?
## What is the range?
## Where is &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; continuous?

Subproblems 1 and 3 are simple enough, but I can't see any way to find the exact range without using calculus.  The range seems to be all real numbers except for a gap from about -1.5 to 0.5.  However, to find what the exact numbers are, it looks like you would have to find the local maximum and minimum in the vicinity of x=0.  The usual way to do that requires calculus, and since this section is a review of precalculus, we can't assume the reader has that knowledge.

== Some issues ==

I'm out of time to edit this page, but here are a few things I noticed.
* Problems 4-7 under the functions section ask about the continuity of the given function.  This topic isn't covered until Calculus/Limits, so it seems out of place here.
* I haven't analyzed it extensively, but problem 6 subproblem 2 under the functions section seems to have the same issue as I mentioned in an earlier topic on this discussion page.  I hate to remove problems just because I can't see how they are intended to be done, but if there is a consensus that this is not an appropriate exercise for this section, then I'd go ahead and remove it.
* The decomposition of functions section seems pointless as you could always choose g(x)=x, f(x)=h(x).  In any case, the decomposition will not be unique.

== Question 23's answer should be 8 to the 13 ninths power and not 2 to the 13 ninths power. ==

Question 23's answer should be 8 to the 13 ninths power and not 2 to the 13 ninths power.[[Special:Contributions/216.19.41.41|216.19.41.41]] ([[User talk:216.19.41.41|discuss]]) 21:34, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

: Your correct, aside from meaning sixths instead of ninths? But the 8 can be further reduced to a 2, adjusting the power, which I went ahead and changed in the solution. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:54, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

== In the pdf version, problem 9 of 6.7.1 is incorrect ==

The pdf has problem 9 of exercise 6.7.1 (page 45) defined as &quot;5&lt;x and x&lt;6&quot;. The answer key (page 407) later claims the solution to be &quot;(-,5)&quot;, but the correct answer looks like the one in the html version; &quot;(5,6)&quot;. Can someone run a new copy of the pdf to synchronize them?

== Answer 52. b. ==

I don't think the answer is correct as the question asks for both the domain and the range of x^2.
The domain is (-∞,+∞) and the range is always positive therefore [0,+∞).
The answer just gives the domain...

Also 53.b seems wrong, I think it is 5/2 not 1/4.

== Graphing exercises ==

I'm not a math guru, but shouldn't the solutions to the graphing exercises be in slope-intercept form? If not, perhaps they should at least specify what form they should be in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When we are making the cricket game we are allow the user to use their own die or a random number die built into the program.  We are now going to look how the random number feature works:

To start using random numbers are need to set up the randomize function.  This is a little like throwing a million dice in the air at once and storing all their results, we can then use these 'random' results in our program
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Randomize()
&lt;/source&gt;
The next thing we need to do is to allocate a number from one to six for the dice role.  Remember we have two dice, one for the bowler and once for the batter:
===Bowler===

===Batter===


===Assigning a random number===
To get a random number we use the Rnd() function (remember a function returns a value).  Unfortunately the Rnd() function returns a value between 0.000000 and 0.9999999.  So we need to convert this to a number between 1 and 6.

To do this, we can multiply the number by 6, this will give us values between 0.00000 and 5.99999. These are obviously not whole numbers so we need to round them off to be integers Using the Int() function.  Giving us a number between 0 and 5.  Still not perfect as we need something between 1 and 6.  
So we need to be a little smarter and add 1.  This will now give us a number between 1and 6. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
BowlDieResult = Int(Rnd() * 6) + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Western blot (alternatively, protein immunoblot) is a widely used analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in the given sample of tissue homogenate or extract. 

==Sample preparation==
Samples may be taken from whole tissue or from cell culture. In most cases, solid tissues are first broken down mechanically using a blender (for larger sample volumes), using a homogenizer (smaller volumes), or by sonication. Cells may also be broken open by one of the above mechanical methods. However, bacteria, virus or environmental samples can be the source of protein and thus Western blotting is not restricted to cellular studies only.
Assorted detergents, salts, and buffers may be employed to encourage lysis of cells and to solubilize proteins. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors are often added to prevent the digestion of the sample by its own enzymes. Tissue preparation is often done at cold temperatures to avoid protein denaturing and degradation.
A combination of biochemical and mechanical techniques – including various types of filtration and centrifugation – can be used to separate different cell compartments and organelles.
[[image:Western blot transfer.png|center]]
==Transfer of protein from gel to membrane==
In order to make the proteins accessible to antibody detection, they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The membrane is placed on top of the gel, and a stack of filter papers placed on top of that. The entire stack is placed in a buffer solution which moves up the paper by capillary action, bringing the proteins with it. Another method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting and uses an electric current to pull proteins from the gel into the PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. The protein move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel. As a result of this &quot;blotting&quot; process, the proteins are exposed on a thin surface layer for detection (see below). Both varieties of membrane are chosen for their non-specific protein binding properties (i.e. binds all proteins equally well). Protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions, as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein. Nitrocellulose membranes are cheaper than PVDF, but are far more fragile and do not stand up well to repeated probings.
The uniformity and overall effectiveness of transfer of protein from the gel to the membrane can be checked by staining the membrane with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Ponceau S dyes. Ponceau S is the more common of the two, due to Ponceau S's higher sensitivity and its water solubility makes it easier to subsequently destain and probe the membrane as described below.

==Detection of protein band==
During the detection process the membrane is &quot;probed&quot; for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which is linked to a reporter enzyme, which when exposed to an appropriate substrate drives a colourimetric reaction and produces a colour. For a variety of reasons, this traditionally takes place in a two-step process, although there are now one-step detection methods available for certain applications.

'''Primary antibody'''
[[image:Western Blot binding.png|center]]
Primary antibodies are generated when a host species or immune cell culture is exposed to the protein of interest (or a part thereof). Normally, this is part of the immune response, whereas here they are harvested and used as sensitive and specific detection tools that bind the protein directly.
After blocking, a dilute solution of primary antibody (generally between 0.5 and 5 micrograms/mL) is incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation. Typically, the solution is composed of buffered saline solution with a small percentage of detergent, and sometimes with powdered milk or BSA. The antibody solution and the membrane can be sealed and incubated together for anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight. It can also be incubated at different temperatures, with warmer temperatures being associated with more binding, both specific (to the target protein, the &quot;signal&quot;) and non-specific (&quot;noise&quot;).

'''Secondary antibody'''
After rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody, the membrane is exposed to another antibody, directed at a species-specific portion of the primary antibody. Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures); an anti-mouse secondary will bind to almost any mouse-sourced primary antibody, which allows some cost savings by allowing an entire lab to share a single source of mass-produced antibody, and provides far more consistent results. This is known as a secondary antibody, and due to its targeting properties, tends to be referred to as &quot;anti-mouse,&quot; &quot;anti-goat,&quot; etc. The secondary antibody is usually linked to biotin or to a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. This means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal.
Most commonly, a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary is used to cleave a chemiluminescent agent, and the reaction product produces luminescence in proportion to the amount of protein. A sensitive sheet of photographic film is placed against the membrane, and exposure to the light from the reaction creates an image of the antibodies bound to the blot. A cheaper but less sensitive approach utilizes a 4-chloronaphthol stain with 1% hydrogen peroxide; reaction of peroxide radicals with 4-chloronaphthol produces a dark brown stain that can be photographed without using specialized photographic film.

==Analysis of blot==
After the unbound probes are washed away, the Western blot is ready for detection of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest. In practical terms, not all Westerns reveal protein only at one band in a membrane. Size approximations are taken by comparing the stained bands to that of the marker or ladder loaded during electrophoresis. The process is repeated for a structural protein, such as actin or tubulin, that should not change between samples. The amount of target protein is indexed to the structural protein to control between groups. This practice ensures correction for the amount of total protein on the membrane in case of errors or incomplete transfers.

''Colorimetric detection''
The colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the Western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through densitometry (how intense the stain is) or spectrophotometry.

''Chemiluminescent detection''
Chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the Western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody. The light is then detected by photographic film, and more recently by CCD cameras which capture a digital image of the Western blot. The image is analysed by densitometry, which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density. Newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used.

''Fluorescent detection''
The fluorescently labeled probe is excited by light and the emission of the excitation is then detected by a photosensor such as CCD camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the Western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative Western blot analysis. Fluorescence is considered to be among the most sensitive detection methods for blotting analysis.

''Secondary probing''
One major difference between nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes relates to the ability of each to support &quot;stripping&quot; antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes. While there are well-established protocols available for stripping nitrocellulose membranes, the sturdier PVDF allows for easier stripping, and for more reuse before background noise limits experiments. Another difference is that, unlike nitrocellulose, PVDF must be soaked in 95% ethanol, isopropanol or methanol before use. PVDF membranes also tend to be thicker and more resistant to damage during use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biochemistry==
The word &quot;biochemistry&quot; was first proposed in 1903 by Carl Nerg, a German chemisubet.
Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes in living organisms. Biochemistry governs all living organisms and living processes.
Today the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms.

==Biomolecules==

The four main classes of molecules in biochemistry are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Many biological molecules are polymers: in this terminology, monomers are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules, which are known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a biological polymer, they undergo a process called dehydration synthesis.

AMINO ACID

''Amino acids'' are natural monomers that polymerize at ribosomes to form proteins. Nucleotides, monomers found in the cell nucleus, polymerize to form nucleic acids – DNA and RNA. Glucose monomers can polymerize to form starches, glycogen or cellulose; ''xylose'' monomers can polymerise to form xylan. In all these cases, a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl (-OH) group are lost to form H2O, and an oxygen atom links each monomer unit. Due to the formation of water as one of the products, these reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions.

== Conventions and nomenclature ==
[[Image:Beta-D-Glucose.svg|thumb|[[Glucose]]]]

=

=== Nucleic acids ===
The convention for a nucleic acid sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the polymer chain, where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biopolymer&amp;oldid=424420208&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sugars ===
 Sugar polymers can be linear or branched are typically joined with glycosidic bonds. However, the exact placement of the linkage can vary and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in α- and β-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. 

'''Lipids'''

Lipids are chiefly fatty acid esters, and are the basic building blocks of biological membranes. Another biological role is energy storage (e.g., triglycerides). Most lipids consist of a polar or hydrophilic head (typically glycerol) and one to three nonpolar or hydrophobic fatty acid tails, and therefore they are amphiphilic. Fatty acids consist of unbranched chains of carbon atoms that are connected by single bonds alone (saturated fatty acids) or by both single and double bonds (unsaturated fatty acids). The chains are usually 14-24 carbon groups long, but it is always an even number.
For lipids present in biological membranes, the hydrophilic head is from one of three classes:
Glycolipids, whose heads contain an oligosaccharide with 1-15 saccharide residues.
Phospholipids, whose heads contain a positively charged group that is linked to the tail by a negatively charged phosphate group.
Sterols, whose heads contain a planar steroid ring, for example, cholesterol.
Other lipids include prostaglandins and leukotrienes which are both 20-carbon fatty acyl units synthesized from arachidonic acid. They are also known as fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amino acids'''

Amino acids contain both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups. (In biochemistry, the term amino acid is used when referring to those amino acids in which the amino and carboxylate functionalities are attached to the same carbon, plus proline which is not actually an amino acid).
Amino acids are the building blocks of long polymer chains. With 2-10 amino acids such chains are called peptides, with 10-100 they are often called polypeptides, and longer chains are known as proteins. These protein structures have many structural and enzymatic roles in organisms.
There are twenty amino acids that are encoded by the standard genetic code, but there are more than 500 natural amino acids. When amino acids other than the set of twenty are observed in proteins, this is usually the result of modification after translation (protein synthesis). Only two amino acids other than the standard twenty are known to be incorporated into proteins during translation, in certain organisms:
Selenocysteine is incorporated into some proteins at a UGA codon, which is normally a stop codon.
Pyrrolysine is incorporated into some proteins at a UAG codon. For instance, in some methanogens in enzymes that are used to produce methane.
Besides those used in protein synthesis, other biologically important amino acids include carnitine (used in lipid transport within a cell), ornithine, GABA and taurine.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protein'''

The particular series of amino acids that form a protein is known as that protein's primary structure. This sequence is determined by the genetic makeup of the individual. Proteins have several, well-classified, elements of local structure formed by intermolecular attraction, this forms the secondary structure of protein. They are broadly divided in two, alpha helix and beta sheet, also called beta pleated sheets. Alpha helices are formed of coiling of protein due to attraction between amine group of one amino acid with carboxylic acid group of other. The coil contains about 3.6 amino acids per turn and the alkyl group of amino acid lie outside the plane of coil. Beta pleated sheets are formed by strong continuous hydrogen bond over the length of protein chain. Bonding may be parallel or antiparallel in nature. Structurally, natural silk is formed of beta pleated sheets. Usually, a protein is formed by action of both these structures in variable ratios. Coiling may also be random. The overall 3D structure of a protein is termed its tertiary structure. It is formed as result of various forces like hydrogen bonding, disulfide bridges, hydrophobic interactions, hydrophilic interactions, van der Waals force etc. When two or more different polypeptide chains cluster to form a protein, quaternary structure of protein is formed. Quaternary structure is a unique attribute of polymeric and heteromeric proteins like hemoglobin, which consists of two alpha and two beta peptide chains.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

Like carbohydrates, some proteins perform largely structural roles. For instance, movements of the proteins actin and myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules—they may be extremely selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is currently one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 1011 or more: a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, proteins are chains of amino acids. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom bound to four groups. One is an amino group, —NH2, and one is a carboxylic acid group, —COOH (although these exist as —NH3+ and —COO− under physiologic conditions). The third is a simple hydrogen atom. The fourth is commonly denoted &quot;—R&quot; and is different for each amino acid. There are twenty standard amino acids. Some of these have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter.

Amino acids can be joined together via a peptide bond. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide, and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than around thirty) are called peptides or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title proteins. As an example, the important blood serum protein albumin contains 585 amino acid residues.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The primary structure of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, &quot;alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…&quot;. Secondary structure is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an α-helix or into a sheet called a β-sheet; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin. Tertiary structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sickle-cell disease. Finally quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the small intestine, and then absorbed. They can then be joined together to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can only synthesize half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These are the essential amino acids, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.
If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-keto acid. Enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via transamination. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.&lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_biochemistry&amp;oldid=421973684&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free ammonia (NH3), existing as the ammonium ion (NH4+) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different strategies have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. Unicellular organisms, of course, simply release the ammonia into the environment. Similarly, bony fish can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the urea cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitamins'''
A vitamin is a compound that is generally not synthesized by a given organism but is nonetheless vital to its survival or health (for example coenzymes). These compounds must be absorbed, or eaten, but typically only in trace quantities. When originally proposed by Casimir Funk, a Polish biochemist, he believed them to all be basic and therefore named them vital amines. The &quot;l&quot; was later dropped to form the word vitamines.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomolecule&amp;oldid=420100572&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[w:en:VisSim|VisSim]]''' is a visual block diagram language for simulation of dynamical systems and model based design of embedded systems. It is developed by Visual Solutions of Westford, Massachusetts.

VisSim is most often used to write [[Embedded Systems|embedded applications]]. Based on diagrams, the language has a different look and feel to traditional text-based programming languages based on the English language. For this reason, a VisSim manual comprises many pictures, rather than textual paragraphs.

VisSim contains a large library of mathematical formulas, as well as built-in support for many popular chip technologies.
VisSim is an extensible language, giving the user great flexibility to extend it, in the sense of adding routines to a library. It can also import &quot;.m&quot; files from [[MATLAB Programming|MATLAB]].

==Analysis==
Assume that the transistor is ideal.
:&lt;math&gt;V_B = V_i \frac {R_2} {R_2 + R_1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_E = V_B - 0.7 = V_B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_E = \frac {V_E} {R_4} = \frac {V_B} {R_4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_C = I_E&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = I_C R_4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i (1 -  \frac {R_3} {R_4} \frac {R_2}{R_2 + R_1})&lt;/math&gt;


When &lt;math&gt;R_2 &gt;&gt; R_1&lt;/math&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. The equation above is reduced to
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i (1 -  \frac {R_3} {R_4})&lt;/math&gt;

: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 , &lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i &lt;/math&gt;
: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , &lt;math&gt;V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 2R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , &lt;math&gt;V_C = - V_i &lt;/math&gt;
: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (n+1)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , &lt;math&gt;V_C = - n V_i &lt;/math&gt;



When &lt;math&gt;R_3 = R_4&lt;/math&gt;. The equation above is reduced to
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i (1 -   \frac {R_2}{R_2 + R_1})&lt;/math&gt;

When R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0  or R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, 
: &lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i &lt;/math&gt; . Transistor operates like a closed switch

When R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; . Transistor operates like an opened switch

''With the right biased voltage at the base, the transistor can be operated like a mechanical switch.''

== Overview ==

'''Griselda Marchbanks''' is the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority, the board of independent examiners who examine fifth year Hogwarts students taking their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs (Ordinary Wizarding Levels)]].  Marchbanks looks very old and short, and is a little deaf.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Marchbanks arrives at Hogwarts together with the small group of other examiners to test the fifth years (including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]) for their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL exams]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] claims that his family's friendship with her will give him an edge on the exams. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] disputes this, saying that Professor Marchbanks is a friend of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|Neville's grandmother]] and has never mentioned the Malfoys.  He describes Marchbanks as &quot;a bit like Gran&quot;.  

Marchbanks claims that she has examined [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] personally when he did his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWTs]]. This makes her older than Dumbledore, who is already of an advanced age; but another examiner, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Tofty|Professor Tofty]], is described as older still.

Marchbanks tests Draco on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] OWL examinations.  She oversees the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]] practical exam together with Professor Tofty.

Tofty arrives at Hogwarts as part of the group of examiners to test the fifth years (including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]) on their OWL exams. It is mentioned that he looks older even than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griselda Marchbanks|Griselda Marchbanks]], who claims to have examined [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT exam]].

Professor Tofty examines Harry in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] practical examinations. He supervises their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]] practical exam, [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Order_of_the_Phoenix/Chapter_31|during which]] the students see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] sacked.

In biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail (chain), which is either saturated or unsaturated. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a chain of an even number of carbon atoms, from four to 28. Fatty acids are usually derived from triglycerides or phospholipids. When they are not attached to other molecules, they are known as &quot;free&quot; fatty acids. Fatty acids are important sources of fuel because their metabolism yield large quantities of ATP. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. The brain cannot use fatty acids as a source of fuel; it relies on glucose or on ketone bodies.

==Nomenclature of fatty acids==
[[File:Fatty acid numbering.png|thumb|upright=2|Numbering of carbon atoms]]

Several different systems of nomenclature are used for fatty acids. The following table describes the most common systems.
{{Clear}}
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!System
!Example
!Explanation
|-
!Trivial nomenclature
|Palmitoleic acid
|'''Trivial names''' (or '''common names''') are non-systematic historical names, which are the most frequent naming system used in literature. Most common fatty acids have trivial names in addition to their ''systematic names'' (see below). These names frequently do not follow any pattern, but they are concise and often unambiguous.
|-
!Systematic nomenclature
|Oleic acid|(9Z)-octadecenoic acid
|'''Systematic names''' (or '''IUPAC names''') derive from the standard ''IUPAC Rules for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry'', published in 1979,&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclature-1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |author=Rigaudy, J. |coauthors=Klesney, S.P. |publisher=Pergamon |year=1979 |isbn=0080223699 |oclc=5008199}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a recommendation published specifically for lipids in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclature-1977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=1977 |title=The Nomenclature of Lipids. Recommendations, 1976 |work=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=11–21 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1977.tb11778.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1977.tb11778.x |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counting begins from the carboxylic acid end. Double bonds are labelled with ''cis-trans isomerism''-/''trans''- notation or ''E''-/''Z''- notation, where appropriate. This notation is generally more verbose than common nomenclature, but has the advantage of being more technically clear and descriptive.
|-
!Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; nomenclature
|[[Linoleic acid|''cis'',''cis''-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;,Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; octadecadienoic acid]]
|In '''Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;''' (or '''delta-''x''''') '''nomenclature''', each double bond is indicated by Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the double bond is located on the ''x''th carbon–carbon bond, counting from the carboxylic acid end. Each double bond is preceded by a ''[[cis-trans isomerism|cis]]''- or ''[[cis-trans isomerism|trans]]''- prefix, indicating the conformation of the molecule around the bond. For example, [[linoleic acid]] is designated &quot;cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; octadecadienoic acid&quot;.  This nomenclature has the advantage of being less verbose than systematic nomenclature, but is no more technically clear or descriptive.
|-
!''n''−''x'' nomenclature
|[[Omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]]
|'''''n''−''x''''' ('''''n'' minus ''x'''''; also '''ω−''x''''' or '''omega-''x''''') '''nomenclature''' both provides names for individual compounds and classifies them by their likely biosynthetic properties in animals. A double bond is located on the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; carbon–carbon bond, counting from the terminal [[methyl]] carbon (designated as ''n'' or ω) toward the [[carbonyl]] carbon. For example, [[alpha-linolenic acid|α-Linolenic acid]] is classified as a [[omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]] or [[omega-3]] fatty acid, and so it is likely to share a biosynthetic pathway with other compounds of this type. The ω−''x'', omega-''x'', or &quot;omega&quot; notation is common in popular nutritional literature, but [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] has deprecated it in favor of ''n''−''x'' notation in technical documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclature-1979&quot; /&gt; The most commonly researched fatty acid biosynthetic pathways are [[omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|''n''−6]], which are hypothesized{{By whom|date=November 2010}} to increase or decrease{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} inflammation.
|-
!Lipid numbers
|18:3&lt;br /&gt;[[Gamma-linolenic acid|18:3,&amp;nbsp;''n''−6]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Alpha-linolenic acid|18:3,&amp;nbsp;cis,cis,cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;,Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;,Δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
|'''Lipid numbers''' take the form ''C'':''D'', where ''C'' is the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid and ''D'' is the number of double bonds in the fatty acid. This notation can be ambiguous, as some different fatty acids can have the same numbers. Consequently, when ambiguity exists this notation is usually paired with either a Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; or ''n''−''x'' term.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclature-1979&quot; /&gt;
|}

==Types of fatty acids==
[[Image:rasyslami.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Three dimensional representations of several fatty acids]]
Fatty acids can be saturated and unsaturated, depending on [[double bond]]s. They differ in length as well.

===Long and short fatty acids===
In addition to saturation, fatty acids have different lengths, often categorized as short, medium, or long.
*Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six [[carbons]].
*Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6–12.&lt;ref name=e-medicine&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/946755-overview Medscape: Free CME, Medical News, Full-text Journal Articles &amp; More]&lt;/ref&gt; carbons, which can form [[medium-chain triglycerides]].
*Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails longer than 12 carbons.&lt;ref name=lipidworld&gt;Christopher Beermann1, J Jelinek1, T Reinecker2, A Hauenschild2, G Boehm1, and H-U Klör2, &quot;[http://lipidworld.com/content/2/1/10 Short term effects of dietary medium-chain fatty acids and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on the fat metabolism of healthy volunteers]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Very-Long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with [[aliphatic]] tails longer than 22 [[carbons]]

===Unsaturated fatty acids===
[[Image:Isomers of oleic acid.png|thumb|300px|right|Comparison of the ''trans'' isomer (top) [[Elaidic acid]] and the ''cis''-isomer [[oleic acid]].]]

Unsaturated fatty acids resemble saturated fatty acids, except that the chain has one or more [[double-bond]]s between carbon atoms. The two carbon atoms in the chain that are bound next to either side of the double bond can occur in a [[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis'' or ''trans'']]  configuration.

; ''cis'' : A ''cis'' configuration means that adjacent hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond.  The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of the ''cis'' isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid.  The more double bonds the chain has in the ''cis'' configuration, the less flexibility it has.  When a chain has many ''cis'' bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations.  For example, [[oleic acid]], with one double bond, has a &quot;kink&quot; in it, whereas [[linoleic acid]], with two double bonds, has a more pronounced bend.  [[Alpha-linolenic acid]], with three double bonds, favors a hooked shape. The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer, or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore could affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat.
; ''trans'' : A ''trans'' configuration, by contrast, means that the next two hydrogen atoms are bound to ''opposite'' sides of the double bond.  As a result, they do not cause the chain to bend much, and their shape is similar to straight saturated fatty acids.

In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, each double bond has three ''n'' carbon atoms after it, for some n, and all are cis bonds.  Most fatty acids in the ''trans'' configuration ([[trans fat]]s) are not found in nature and are the result of human processing (e.g., [[hydrogenation]]).

The differences in geometry between the various types of unsaturated fatty acids, as well as between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, play an important role in biological processes, and in the construction of biological structures (such as cell membranes).

====Essential fatty acids====

Fatty acids that are required by the body but cannot be made in sufficient quantity from other substrates, therefore must be obtained from food and are called essential fatty acids. Mammals lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbon 9 and 10, hence ω-6 linoleic acid (18:2,9,12), abbreviated LA, and the ω-3 linolenic acid (18:3,9,12,15), abbreviated ALA, are essential for man in the diet. In humans, arachidonic acid (20:4,5,8,11,14) can be synthesized from LA by desaturation and chain elongation (though some carnivores like cats cannot do this, and require arachadonate in the diet). In addition, the human body can make some long-chain ω-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) from the ω-3 ALA.
Between 1930 and 1950, arachidonic acid and linolenic acid were termed 'essential' because each was more or less able to meet the growth requirements of rats given fat-free diets. Further research has shown that human metabolism requires both ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids. To some extent, any ω-3 and any ω-6 can relieve the worst symptoms of fatty acid deficiency for its class. Particular fatty acids are still needed at critical life stages (e.g. lactation) and in some disease states. In nonscientific writing, common usage is that the term essential fatty acid comprises all the ω-3 or -6 fatty acids. Conjugated fatty acids like calendic acid are not normally considered essential. Authoritative sources include the whole families, without qualification.
Traditionally speaking the LC-PUFA are not essential. See (Cunnane 2003) for a discussion of the current status of the term 'essential'. Because the LC-PUFA are sometimes required, they may be considered &quot;conditionally essential&quot;, or not essential to healthy adults.
A 2005 study has shown evidence that the ω-6 fat gamma-linolenic acid, GLA has been shown to inhibit the breast cancer promoting gene of Her2/neu.
Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils, which are &quot;essential&quot; in the sense of being a concentrated essence&lt;REf&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essential_fatty_acid&amp;oldid=422687249&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Nomenclature and terminology===
&lt;/div&gt;
Fatty acids are straight chain hydrocarbons possessing a [[carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] (COOH) group at one end. The carbon next to the carboxylate is known as α, the next carbon β, and so forth. Since biological fatty acids can be of different lengths, the last position is labelled as a &quot;ω&quot;, the last letter in the [[Greek alphabet]]. Since the physiological properties of unsaturated fatty acids largely depend on the position of the first unsaturation relative to the end position and not the carboxylate, the position is signified by (ω minus n).   For example, the term [[omega-3 fatty acids|ω-3]] signifies that the first double bond exists as the third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end (ω) of the carbon chain . The number of carbons and the number of double bonds is also listed.  
ω-3 18:4 ([[stearidonic acid]]) or 18:4 ω-3 or 18:4 n−3 indicates an 18-carbon chain with 4 double bonds, and with the first double bond in the third position from the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Double bonds are [[geometric isomerism|''cis'']] and separated by a single methylene (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) group unless otherwise noted. So in free fatty acid form, the chemical structure of stearidonic acid is&lt;REf&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essential_fatty_acid&amp;oldid=422687249&lt;/ref&gt;:
[[Image:Fatty acid numbering.png|500px|nonre of stearidonic acid showing physiological (red) and chemical (blue) numbering conventions.]]

===Examples===

The essential fatty acids start with the '''short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (SC-PUFA)''':
*[[omega-3 fatty acid|ω-3 fatty acid]]s: 
**[[alpha-linolenic acid|α-Linolenic acid]] or ALA (18:3)
*[[Omega-6 fatty acid|ω-6 fatty acids]]: 
**[[Linoleic acid]] or LA (18:2)
These two fatty acids cannot be [[Biosynthesis|synthesised]] by humans, as humans lack the [[desaturase]] [[enzymes]] required for their production.

They form the starting point for the creation of longer and more desaturated fatty acids, which are also referred to as '''long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA)''':
*omega-3 fatty acid(ω-3 fatty acids): 
**eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (20:5)
**docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (22:6) 
*Omega-6 fatty acid|ω-6 fatty acids: 
**gamma-linolenic acid or GLA (18:3)
**dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid or DGLA (20:3)
**arachidonic acid or AA (20:4) 

[[Omega-9 fatty acid|ω-9 fatty acids]] are not essential in humans, because humans generally possess all the enzymes required for their synthesis.

===Saturated fatty acids===
Saturated fatty acids are long-chain carboxylic acids that usually have between 12 and 24 carbon atoms and have no double bonds. Thus, saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen (since double bonds reduce the number of hydrogens on each carbon). Because saturated fatty acids have only single bonds, each carbon atom within the chain has 2 hydrogen atoms (except for the omega carbon at the end that has 3 hydrogens).

==Synthesis of fatty acid==
In humans, fatty acids are predominantly formed in the liver and lactating mammary glands, and, to a lesser extent, the adipose tissue. Most acetyl-CoA is formed from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase in the mitochondria. Acetyl-CoA produced in the mitochondria is condensed with oxaloacetate by citrate synthase to form citrate, which is then transported into the cytosol and broken down to yield acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by ATP citrate lyase. Oxaloacetate in the cytosol is reduced to malate by cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase, and malate is transported back into the mitochondria to participate in the Citric acid cycle.

===Fatty acid synthase (FAS)===
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a multi-enzyme that plays a key role in fatty acid synthesis. It is not a single enzyme but a whole enzymatic system composed of 272 kDa multifunctional polypeptide, in which substrates are handed from one functional domain to the next.

There are two principal classes of fatty acid synthases.

''Type I systems'' utilise a single large, multifunctional polypeptide and are common to both mammals and fungi (although the structural arrangement of fungal and mammalian synthases differ). A Type I fatty acid synthase system is also found in the CMN group of bacteria (corynebacteria, mycobacteria, and nocardia). In these bacteria, the FAS I system produces palmititic acid, and cooperates with the FAS II system to produce a greater diversity of lipid products.

''Type II'' is found in archaeabacterial and eubacterial, and is characterized by the use of discrete, monofunctional enzymes for fatty acid synthesis. Inhibitors of this pathway (FASII) are being investigated as possible antibiotics.
The mechanism of FAS I and FAS II elongation and reduction is the same, as the domains of the FAS II enzymes are largely homologous to their domain counterparts in FAS I multienzyme polypeptides. However, the differences in the organization of the enzymes - integrated in FAS I, discrete in FAS II - gives rise to many important biochemical differences.
The evolutionary history of fatty acid synthases are very much intertwined with that of polyketide synthases (PKS). Polyketide synthases use a similar mechanism and homologous domains to produce secondary metabolite lipids. Furthermore, polyketide synthases also exhibit a Type I and Type II organization. FAS I in animals is thought to have arisen through modification of PKS I in fungi, whereas FAS I in fungi and the CMN group of bacteria seem to have arisen separately through the fusion of FAS II genes&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatty_acid_synthase&amp;oldid=416140503&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Structure of Fatty acid synthase (FAS)===
Mammalian FAS consists of two identical multifunctional polypeptides, in which three catalytic domains in the N-terminal section (-ketoacyl synthase (KS), malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT), and dehydrase (DH)), are separated by a core region of 600 residues from four [[C-terminal]] domains (enoyl reductase (ER), -ketoacyl reductase (KR), acyl carrier protein (ACP) and thioesterase (TE)).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11248039&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chirala SS, Jayakumar A, Gu ZW, Wakil SJ | title = Human fatty acid synthase: role of interdomain in the formation of catalytically active synthase dimer | journal = Proc.

The conventional model for organization of FAS (see the 'head-to-tail' model on the right) is largely based on the observations that the bifunctional reagent 1,3-dibromopropanone (DBP) is able to crosslink the active site cysteine thiol of the KS domain in one FAS monomer with the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of the ACP domain in the other monomer.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6112225&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stoops JK, Wakil SJ | title = Animal fatty acid synthetase.

The above observations seemed incompatible with the classical 'head-to-tail' model for FAS organization, and an alternative model has been proposed, predicting that the KS and MAT domains of both monomers lie closer to the center of the FAS dimer, where they can access the ACP of either subunit (see figure on the top right).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15711565&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Asturias FJ, Chadick JZ, Cheung IK, Stark H, Witkowski A, Joshi AK, Smith S | title = Structure and molecular organization of mammalian fatty acid synthase | journal = Nat.

==Types of lipids==

'''Fatty acyls'''

Fatty acyls, a generic term for describing fatty acids, their conjugates and derivatives, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four to 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen and sulfur. Where a double bond exists, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's molecular configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is more pronounced the more double bonds there are in a chain. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.
Examples of biologically important fatty acids are the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, which include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Glycerolipids'''
Glycerolipids are composed mainly of mono-, di- and tri-substituted glycerols, the most well-known being the fatty acid esters of glycerol (triacylglycerols), also known as triglycerides. In these compounds, the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are each esterified, usually by different fatty acids. Because they function as a food store, these lipids comprise the bulk of storage fat in animal tissues. The hydrolysis of the ester bonds of triacylglycerols and the release of glycerol and fatty acids from adipose tissue is called fat mobilization.
Additional subclasses of glycerolipids are represented by glycosylglycerols, which are characterized by the presence of one or more sugar residues attached to glycerol via a glycosidic linkage. Examples of structures in this category are the digalactosyldiacylglycerols found in plant membranes and seminolipid from mammalian sperm cells&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Glycerophospholipids===
Glycerophospholipids, also referred to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based on the nature of the polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term glycerophospholipid signifies any derivative of sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid that contains at least one O-acyl, or O-alkyl, or O-alk-1'-enyl residue attached to the glycerol moiety and a polar head made of a nitrogenous base, a glycerol or an inositol unit.
It contains a glycerol core with fatty acids. They can be the same or different subunits of fatty acids.
Carbon 1 (tail, apolar) contains a fatty acid, typically saturated
Carbon 2 (tail, apolar) contains a fatty acid, typically unsaturated and in the cis conformation, thus appearing &quot;bent&quot;
Carbon 3 (head, polar) contains a phosphate group or an alcohol attached to a phosphate group

'''Nomenclature and stereochemistry'''
In general, glycerophospholipids use a &quot;sn&quot; notation, which stands for [[Stereochemistry|stereochemical]] numbering. When the letters &quot;sn&quot; appear in the nomenclature, by convention the [[hydroxyl group]] of the second carbon of glycerol (sn-2) is on the left on a [[Fischer projection]]. The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being sn-1 the carbon at the top and sn-3 the one at the bottom.

The advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial conformation (R or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.

For example sn-glycero-3-[[phosphoric acid]] and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.

Lecithin and cephalin are more common than the others in most human membranes, but cardiolipin is quite common in the inner membranes of mitochondria.


Phosphatidylethanolamine
Examples of glycerophospholipids found in biological membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to serving as a primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of, or are themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, one or both of these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.

===Sphingolipids===
Sphingolipids are a complex family of compounds that share a common structural feature, a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized de novo from the amino acid serine and a long-chain fatty acyl CoA, then converted into ceramides, phosphosphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and other compounds. The major sphingoid base of mammals is commonly referred to as sphingosine. Ceramides (N-acyl-sphingoid bases) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide-linked fatty acid. The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono-unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms.
The major phosphosphingolipids of mammals are sphingomyelins (ceramide phosphocholines), whereas insects contain mainly ceramide phosphoethanolamines and fungi have phytoceramide phosphoinositols and mannose-containing headgroups. The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of molecules composed of one or more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base. Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as cerebrosides and gangliosides&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sphingolipid&amp;oldid=422417411&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Types of Sphingolipids'''

* Ceramide is the fundamental structural unit common to all sphingolipids. They consist simply of a fatty acid chain attached through an [[amide]] linkage to sphingosine. 

There are three main types of sphingolipids, differing in their head groups: 
* Sphingomyelins have a [[phosphocholine]] or [[phosphoethanolamine]] molecule with an [[ester|ester linkage]] to the 1-hydroxy group of a ceramide. 
'''Sphingomyelin''' ('''SPH''', sfing-goh-'''mahy'''-uh-lin) is a type of sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of [[phosphorylcholine]] and ceramide.  In humans, SPH represents ~85% of all sphingolipids.
* Glycosphingolipids, which differ in the substituents on their head group (see image). Glycosphingolipids are ceramides with one or more [[sugar]] residues joined in a β-[[glycosidic]] linkage at the 1-hydroxyl position&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sphingolipid&amp;oldid=422417411&lt;/ref&gt;.
** Cerebrosides have a single [[glucose]] or [[galactose]] at the 1-hydroxy position.
*** Sulfatides are sulfated cerebrosides.
* Gangliosides have at least three sugars, one of which must be [[sialic acid]].

Sterol lipids
Sterol lipids, such as cholesterol and its derivatives, are an important component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prenol lipids
Prenol lipids are synthesized from the 5-carbon precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, diphosphates, etc.) are formed by the successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these terpene units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, as well as the ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated, whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

Saccharolipids


Structure of the saccharolipid Kdo2-Lipid A. Glucosamine residues in blue, Kdo residues in red, acyl chains in black and phosphate groups in green.
Saccharolipids describe compounds in which fatty acids are linked directly to a sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the Lipid A component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipid A molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized with as many as seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in ''E. coli'' is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

Polyketides
Polyketides are synthesized by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise a large number of secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, and/or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Galactolipids and Sulfolipids===
'''Galactolipids''' are a type of glycolipid whose sugar group is galactose. They're different from glycosphingolipids in that they do not have nitrogen in their composition.
They are the main part of plant membrane lipids where they substitute phospholipids to conserve phosphate for other essential processes. These chloroplast membranes contain a high quantity of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG).
They probably also assume a direct role in photosynthesis, as they have been found in the X-ray structures of photosynthetic complexes.
The galactolipid galactocerebroside (GalC) and its sulfated derivative sulfatide is also in abundance present (together with a small group of proteins) in myelin, the membrane around the axons in the nervous system of vertebrates.

'''Sulfolipids''' are a class of lipids which possess a sulfur-containing functional group. One of the most common consituents of sulfolipids is sulfoquinovose, which is acylated to form sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols. In plants, sulfolipids are important intermediates in the sulfur cycle.
{{quotation|What is Sulfoquinovose?
Sulfoquinovose, also known as 6-sulfoquinovose and 6-deoxy-6-sulfo-D-glucopyranose is a monosaccharide sugar that is found as a building block in the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG). Sulfoquinovose is a sulfonic acid derivative of glucose, the sulfonic acid group is introduced into the sugar by the enzyme UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase (SQD1).}}

==Lipoprotein==
A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both proteins and lipids water-bound to the proteins. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the high density (HDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins which enable fats to be carried in the blood stream, the transmembrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins.
===Classification===
====Classification of lipoproteins acoording to their density====
Lipoproteins may be classified as follows, listed from larger and less dense to smaller and denser. Lipoproteins are larger and less dense, if they consist of more fat than of protein. They are classified on the basis of electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation.

Chylomicrons carry triglycerides (fat) from the intestines to the liver, skeletal muscle, and to adipose tissue.

Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) carry (newly synthesised) triacylglycerol from the liver to adipose tissue.

Intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood.

Low density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. LDLs are sometimes referred to as the &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; lipoprotein.

High density lipoproteins (HDL) collect cholesterol from the body's tissues, and bring it back to the liver. HDLs are sometimes referred to as the &quot;good cholesterol&quot; lipoprotein.

====Alpha and beta====
It is also possible to classify lipoproteins as &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot;, according to the classification of proteins in serum protein electrophoresis. This terminology is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as Abetalipoproteinemia.

Lipoprotein(a)

How to lower: aerobic exercise, niacin, aspirin, guggulipid.

===WAX===
Waxes are organic compounds that characteristically consist of a long alkyl chains. Natural waxes are typically esters of fatty acids and long chain alcohols. Synthetic waxes are long-chain hydrocarbons lacking functional groups.

'''Types of waxe'''

''Plant and animal waxes''
Waxes are biosynthesized by many plants or animals. They typically consist of several components, including wax esters, wax acids, wax alcohols, and hydrocarbons. Wax esters are typically derived from a variety of carboxylic acids and a variety of fatty alcohols. The composition depends not only on species, but also on geographic location of the organism. Because they are mixtures, naturally produced waxes are softer and melt at lower temperatures than the pure components.
''Animal waxes''
The best known animal wax is beeswax, but other insects secrete waxes. A major component of beeswax is the ester myricyl palmitate substance which is used in constructing their honeycombs. Its melting point is 62-65 °C. Spermaceti occurs in large amounts in the head oil of the sperm whale. One of its main constituents is cetyl palmitate, another ester of a fatty acid and a fatty alcohol. Lanolin is a wax obtained from wool, consisting of esters of sterols&lt;REF&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wax&amp;oldid=423902940&lt;/ref&gt;.
eg.Beeswax - produced by honey bees

Chinese wax - produced by the scale insect Ceroplastes ceriferus

Earwax - found in the human ear.

Lanolin (wool wax) - from the sebaceous glands of sheep

Shellac wax - from the lac insect Kerria lacca

Spermaceti - from the head cavities and blubber of the sperm whale

''Plant waxes''
Especially in warm climates, plants secrete waxes as a way to control evaporation and hydration.[2] From the commercial perspective, the most important wax is Carnauba wax, a hard wax obtained from the Brazilian palm. Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, it has many applications. Other more specialized vegetable waxes include candelilla wax, ouricury wax, sugarcane wax, retamo wax, jojoba oil. The epicuticular waxes of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, diols, ketones, aldehydes.

'''Petroleum derived waxes'''

Although most natural waxes are esters, paraffin waxes are hydrocarbons, mixtures of alkanes usually in a homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum. They are refined by vacuum distillation. Paraffin waxes are mixtures of saturated of n- and isoalkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. Millions of tons of paraffin waxes are produced annually. They are used in adhesives, in foods (such as chewing gum and cheese wrapping), in cosmetics, and as coatings.

''Montan wax''
Montan wax is a fossilized wax extracted from coal and lignite. It is very hard, reflecting the high concentration of saturated fatty acids and alcohols, not esters that characterize softer waxes. Although dark brown and smelly, they can be purified and bleached to give commercially useful products.

''Polyethylene and related derivatives''
Some waxes are obtained by cracking polyethylene at 400 °C. The products have the formula (CH2)nH2, where n ranges between about 50 and 100. As of 1995, about 200 million kilograms/y were consumed&lt;REF&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wax&amp;oldid=423902940&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''HOW LIPID DROPLETS ARE ANALOGOUS TO LIPOPROTEINS'''

There are common structural features that lipid droplets and plasma lipoproteins both share. Also neutral lipid cores encased in polar lipid monolayers are found in both lipid droplets and plasma lipoproteins. Another common thing these two both have is their decoration with specific surface proteins which often compose of amphipathic α-helices. However, lipid droplets (with diameters of 100nm up to 100 microns) are found to be generally larger than lipoproteins (diameters ranging from less than 20nm to approximatedly 500nm)
Although both lipid droplets and lipoproteins are formed via the linkage to neutral lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, they function differently in the sense of physiology: lipids are primarily stored in lipid droplets while they are distributed in the body by lipoproteins. Also, a few cell types such as enterocytes, hepatocytes and yolk sac endodermal cells) express the required proteins (like the microsomal TG transfer protein and apolipoprotein B) for lipoprotein assembly, while most cells create lipid droplets. Therefore, there may be an evolution of lipoproteins by adapting lipid droplets to secretion.
It is mostly unknown how cells can regulate the storage in lipid droplets versus secretion on lipoproteins. Only after secretory cells exceed the capacity to assemble and secrete lipoproteins, lipids in lipid droplets may be stored in these secretory cells. Alternatively, it is possible that when a storage threshold is achieved secretion may be activated. It is also possible that the lipid droplet pool of TG may be directed toward lipoprotein formation by some specific lipid droplet proteins. It is thought that secretion of TG via lipoproteins involves their hydrolysis not only at lipid droplets but also at resynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum.

'''REMOVAL OF LIPID DROPLET PROTEINS'''
Due to their analogy, it is quite similar in the mechanisms to remove lipid droplet proteins as well as those to remove membrane proteins. In lyposomes there is a degradation of endocytosed membrane proteins or autophagic vesicles. Proteasomes can also degrade the endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins ( it is called endoplasmic reticulum – associated degradation). Lipid droplet proteins may be degraded by these both mechanisms. Lipid droplets are brought to autophagosomes before the modification of some Lipid droplet proteins by ubiquitin for proteasomal degradation can occur. Additionally, proteasome components are identified as required for normal Lipid droplet morphology by a nonbiased screen.
It was recently identified how lipid droplets and proteasomal degradation are linked molecularly. Among lipid droplets proteins, ubiquitin E2 ligase (Ube2g2) is bound to the ancient ubiquitouos protein 1(Aup1) which is located either directly on lipid droplets or in the endoplasmic reticulum. The ubiquitin E3 ligase (spartin/SPG20) localizes to lipid droplets, and the lipid droplets accumulation is led by its depletion or overexpression. Then it is implied from these findings that lipid droplet – associated proteins are degraded by a specific machinery but the details of this remain unknown.
It is likely that some endoplasmic reticulum – associated degradation substrate may localize to lipid droplets but at least it is not required for endoplasmic reticulum – associated degradation to have lipid droplets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Water is a chemical substance with the chemical formula H2O. Its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds. Water is a liquid at ambient conditions, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice, and gaseous state (water vapor or steam).
Water is widely distributed on Earth as freshwater and salt water in the oceans. The Earth is often referred to as the &quot;blue planet&quot; because when viewed from space it appears blue. This blue color is caused by reflection from the oceans which cover roughly 70% of the area of the Earth.
The oceanic crust is young, thin and dense, with none of the rocks within it dating from any older than the breakup of Pangaea. Because water is much denser than any gas, this means that water will flow into the &quot;depressions&quot; formed as a result of the high density of oceanic crust. (On a planet like Venus, with no water, the depressions appear to form a vast plain above which rise plateaux). Since the low density rocks of the continental crust contain large quantities of easily eroded salts of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, salt has, over billions of years, accumulated in the oceans as a result of evaporation returning the fresh water to land as rain and snow.
As a result, the vast bulk of the water on Earth is regarded as saline or salt water, with an average salinity of 35‰ (or 3.5%, roughly equivalent to 35 grams of salts in 1kg of seawater), though this varies slightly according to the amount of runoff received from surrounding land. In all, oceanic water, saline water from marginal seas, and water from saline closed lakes amounts to over 98% of the water on Earth, though no closed lake stores a globally significant amount of water. Renewable saline groundwater is believed to total at least 100 km³ globally, but is seldom considered except when evaluating water quality in arid regions.
The remainder of the Earth's water constitutes the planet's fresh water resource. Typically, fresh water is defined as water with a salinity of less than 1 percent that of the oceans - i.e. below around 0.35‰. Water with a salinity between this level and 1‰ is typically referred to as marginal water because it is marginal for many uses by humans and animals.
The planet's fresh water is also very unevenly distributed. Although in warm periods such as the Mesozoic and Paleogene when there were no glaciers anywhere on the planet all fresh water was found in rivers and streams, today the distribution is approximately as follows:
Ice caps and glaciers - 68.7%, of which
Antarctic ice cap - 90%, 9700 years renewal interval
Greenland ice cap - 9%
Other glaciers - &lt;1%, 1600 years renewal interval
Groundwater - 30.1%, 1400 year renewal interval
Surface water - 0.3%, of which
Freshwater lakes - 87%, 17 years renewal interval
Swamps - 11%
Rivers - 2%, 16 days renewal interval
Ground ice and permafrost - 0.86%
Atmosphere 0.04%
Of these sources, only river water is generally valuable. Most water in lakes is in very inhospitable regions such as glacial lakes of Canada. Lake Baikal and Lake Khövsgöl, both protected from Quaternary glaciation by aridity, have equivalent amounts of water, and the latter has been used in Mongolia as a source of drinking water.. Although the total volume of groundwater is known to be much greater than that of river runoff, a large proportion of this groundwater is saline and should therefore be classified with the saline water above. There is also a lot of fossil groundwater in arid regions that has never been renewed for thousands of years; this must not be seen as renewable water.
However, fresh groundwater is of great value, especially in arid countries such as India. Its distribution is broadly similar to that of surface river water, but it is easier to store in hot and dry climates because groundwater storages are much more shielded from evaporation than are dams. In countries such as Yemen, groundwater from erratic rainfall during the rainy season is the major source of irrigation water.
Because groundwater recharge is much more difficult to accurately measure than surface runoff, groundwater is not generally used in areas where even fairly limited levels of surface water are available. Even today, estimates of total groundwater recharge vary greatly for the same region depending on what source is used, and cases where fossil groundwater is exploited beyond the recharge rate (including the Ogallala Aquifer) are very frequent and almost always not seriously considered when they were first developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water_distribution_on_Earth&amp;oldid=422307996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of water==
Water appears in nature in all three common states of matter and may take many different forms on Earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky; seawater and icebergs in the polar oceans; glaciers and rivers in the mountains; and the liquid in aquifers in the ground.
At high temperatures and pressures, such as in the interior of giant planets, it is argued that water exists as ionic water in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and at even higher pressures as superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.
The major chemical and physical properties of water are:
Water is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure. It is tasteless and odorless. The intrinsic color of water and ice is a very slight blue hue, although both appear colorless in small quantities. Water vapor is essentially invisible as a gas.
Water is transparent in the visible electromagnetic spectrum. Thus aquatic plants can live in water because sunlight can reach them. Ultra-violet and infrared light is strongly absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water&amp;oldid=424911919M&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms, it carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. As a result, water is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment. Water also can form an unusually large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (four) for a molecule of its size. These factors lead to strong attractive forces between molecules of water, giving rise to water's high surface tension and capillary forces. The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity. This property is relied upon by all vascular plants, such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water&amp;oldid=424911919M&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is a good solvent and is often referred to as the universal solvent. Substances that dissolve in water, e.g., salts, sugars, acids, alkalis, and some gases – especially oxygen, carbon dioxide (carbonation) are known as hydrophilic (water-loving) substances, while those that do not mix well with water (e.g., fats and oils), are known as hydrophobic (water-fearing) substances.

'''All the major components in cells (proteins, DNA and polysaccharides) are also dissolved in water.'''

Pure water has a low electrical conductivity, but this increases significantly with the dissolution of a small amount of ionic material such as sodium chloride.

The boiling point of water (and all other liquids) is dependent on the barometric pressure. For example, on the top of Mt. Everest water boils at 68 °C (154 °F), compared to 100 °C (212 °F) at sea level. Conversely, water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid.

Water has the second highest molar specific heat capacity of any known substance, after ammonia, as well as a high heat of vaporization (40.65 kJ·mol−1), both of which are a result of the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules. These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth's climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature.

The maximum density of water occurs at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F). It has the anomalous property of becoming less dense, not more, when it is cooled down to its solid form, ice. It expands to occupy 9% greater volume in this solid state, which accounts for the fact of ice floating on liquid water.
Its Density is 1,000 kg/m3 liquid (4 °C), and weighs 62.4 lb/ft.3 (917 kg/m3, solid). It weighs 8.3454 lb/gal. (US, liquid) 


ADR label for transporting goods dangerously reactive with water

Water is miscible with many liquids, such as ethanol, in all proportions, forming a single homogeneous liquid. On the other hand, water and most oils are immiscible usually forming layers according to increasing density from the top. As a gas, water vapor is completely miscible with air.

Water forms an azeotrope with many other solvents.

Water can be split by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen.
As an oxide of hydrogen, water is formed when hydrogen or hydrogen-containing compounds burn or react with oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds. Water is not a fuel, it is an end-product of the combustion of hydrogen. The energy required to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis or any other means is greater than the energy that can be collected when the hydrogen and oxygen recombine.
Elements which are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water, forming hydroxides. Being a flammable gas, the hydrogen given off is dangerous and the reaction of water with the more electropositive of these elements may be violently explosive.

Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration).

Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as hydroxide ion (OH−) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water&amp;oldid=424911919M&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen bonding in water==
[[Image:Hex ice.GIF|thumb|right|Crystal structure of hexagonal ice. Gray dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds]]
[[Image:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Model of hydrogen bonds between molecules of [[water]]]]

The most ubiquitous, and perhaps simplest, example of a hydrogen bond is found between water molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case of liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.
Liquid water's high boiling point is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form relative to its low molecular mass. Owing to the difficulty of breaking these bonds, water has a very high boiling point, melting point, and viscosity compared to otherwise similar liquids not conjoined by hydrogen bonds. Water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of bonds of a water molecule is up to four. For example, hydrogen fluoride—which has three lone pairs on the F atom but only one H atom—can form only two bonds; (ammonia has the opposite problem: three hydrogen atoms but only one lone pair).
H-F...H-F...H-F
The exact number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule of liquid water fluctuates with time and depends on the temperature. From TIP4P liquid water simulations at 25 °C, it was estimated that each water molecule participates in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds. At 100 °C, this number decreases to 3.24 due to the increased molecular motion and decreased density, while at 0 °C, the average number of hydrogen bonds increases to 3.69. A more recent study found a much smaller number of hydrogen bonds: 2.357 at 25 °C. The differences may be due to the use of a different method for defining and counting the hydrogen bonds.
Where the bond strengths are more equivalent, one might instead find the atoms of two interacting water molecules partitioned into two polyatomic ions of opposite charge, specifically hydroxide (OH−) and hydronium (H3O+). (Hydronium ions are also known as 'hydroxonium' ions.)
H-O− H3O+
Indeed, in pure water under conditions of standard temperature and pressure, this latter formulation is applicable only rarely; on average about one in every 5.5 × 108 molecules gives up a proton to another water molecule, in accordance with the value of the dissociation constant for water under such conditions. It is a crucial part of the uniqueness of water.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hydrogen_bond&amp;oldid=424341258&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong acids and bases==

Strong acids and bases are those that, for practical purposes, completely dissociated (ionize) in water. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a good example of a strong acid.

A commonly encountered problem is to calculate the pH of a solution of a given concentration of a strong acid. Normally, the concentration of the acid will be very high compared to the baseline concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in pure water, which is 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; molar. Under these conditions, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion concentration is very nearly that of the acid concentration, and the pH is calculated simply by taking the negative logarithm of that value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lower|first=Stephen K.|title=Chem1 Virtual Textbook, Acid-base Equilibria and Calculations|pages=12ff|url=http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/pdf/c1xacid2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, for a 0.01M solution of HCl, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration can be taken as 0.01M, and the pH is −log(0.01). That is, pH = 2.

For very weak concentrations, i.e. concentrations around 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;M or less, the baseline concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in pure water becomes significant, and must be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=Chris|title=pH calculation of a very small concentration of a strong acid.|url=http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of solution is as follows. At equilibrium, any aqueous solution must satisfy the dissociation equilibrium equation for water&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+][OH^-] = K_w = 10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt;

Another constraint is that the ''nominal concentration'' of the acid must be preserved. The nominal concentration is designated C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, and is equivalent to the amount of acid that is initially added to the reaction. This is known as the [[Mass balance|mass balance equation]], and can be written,

:&lt;math&gt;C_a = [HA] + [A^-]&lt;/math&gt;

Where &quot;HA&quot; refers to the protonated form of the acid, and &quot;A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; to the conjugate base anion.

Note that for a given reaction, C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is constant. This equation is merely saying that the molecules of acid can either be protonated or ionized, but that the total number will stay the same.

For a strong acid which is completely dissociated, [A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] &gt;&gt; [HA], and the [HA] term can be dropped:

:&lt;math&gt;C_a = [A^-]&lt;/math&gt;

Another relationship that must be satisfied is known as the ''electroneutrality principle'', or the ''charge balance equation'', and is the statement that the total charge of the solution must be zero. So the sum of all the negative ion charges must equal the sum of the positive ion charges. This can be written,

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+] = [A^-] + [OH^-]&lt;/math&gt;

For a strong acid, one can use C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in place of [A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;], and eliminate [OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] from this equation by substituting the value derived from the equilibrium equation for water, [OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] = K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; / [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+] = C_a + \frac{K_w}{[H^+]}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into the form of a [[quadratic equation]],

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+]^2 - C_a[H^+] - K_w = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Which is readily solved for [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

For example, to find the pH of a solution of 5×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;M of HCl, first note that this concentration is small compared to the baseline concentration of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] in water (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;). So the quadratic equation derived above should be used.

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+]^2 - 5 \times 10^{-8} [H^+] - 10^{-14} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+] = 1.28 \times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;pH = 6.89&lt;/math&gt;

===Weak acids and weak bases===

The problem in this case would be to determine the pH of a solution of a specific concentration of an acid, when that acid's pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; or K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (acid dissociation constant) is given.

In this case, the acid is not completely dissociated, but the degree of dissociation is given by the equilibrium equation for that acid:

:&lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt;

The ''mass balance'' and ''charge balance'' equations can be applied here as well, but in the case of a weak acid, the acid is not completely dissociated, and thus the assumption [A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] &gt;&gt; [HA] is not valid. Therefore the mass balance equation is

:&lt;math&gt;C_a = [HA] + [A^-]&lt;/math&gt;

Unless the acid is very weak, or the concentration is very dilute, it it reasonable to assume that the concentration of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is much greater than the concentration of [OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]. This assumption simplifies the calculation and can be verified after the result is found. Note that this is equivalent to the assumption that the pH value is lower than about 6. With this assumption, the charge balance equation is

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+] = [A^-]&lt;/math&gt;

There are three equations with three unknowns ([H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], [A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;], and [HA]), which need to be solved for [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]. The mass balance equation allows to solve for [HA] in terms of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]:

:&lt;math&gt;[HA] = C_a - [A^-] = C_a - [H^+]&lt;/math&gt;

And then plug these into the equilibrium equation for the acid

:&lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[H^+]^2}{C_a - [H^+]}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearrange this to put it in the form of a quadratic equation,

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+]^2 + K_a[H^+] - K_a C_a = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[ICE table]] allows to evaluate the differences in concentrations before and after the reaction – basically, it is a mnemonic device for implementing the mass balance and charge balance equations for a given reaction, by accounting for the movements of the acid molecules and the charges. The equation derived by using the ICE table is the same as the quadratic equation given above&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;.

For example, consider a problem of finding the pH of a 0.01M solution of benzoic acid, given that, for this acid, K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.19).

The equilibrium equation for this reaction is

:&lt;math&gt;6.5 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt;

One can neglect the [OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] concentration, hoping that the final answer will by pH &lt; 6. Then [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;], and the equilibrium equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;6.5 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{[H^+]^2}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass balance equation is

:&lt;math&gt;0.01M = [HA] + [A^-] = [HA] + [H^+]&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for [HA] yields

:&lt;math&gt;[HA] = 0.01M - [H^+]&lt;/math&gt;

and plugging that into the equilbrium equation, results in the quadratic equation

:&lt;math&gt;6.5 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{[H^+]^2}{0.01 - [H^+]}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+]^2 + 6.5 \times 10^{-5}[H^+] - 6.5 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.01 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives the answer

:&lt;math&gt;[H^+] = 7.74 \times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;pH = -\log [H^+] = 3.11&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the assumption that pH &lt; 6 was valid, and the [OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] concentration might well be ignored.

The carboxylate group can lose a proton and donate it to a water molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, leaving behind an acetate anion CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO- and creating a hydronium cation H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;. This is an equilibrium reaction, so the reverse process can also take place.|[[Acetic acid]], a [[weak acid]], donates a proton (hydrogen ion, highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the acetate ion and the hydronium ion.

==Acid dissociation constant and ''pKa''==
An '''acid dissociation constant''', ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, (also known as '''acidity constant''', or '''acid-ionization constant''') is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid-base reactions. The equilibrium can be written symbolically as:
:HA = A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,
where HA is a generic acid that dissociates by splitting into A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, known as the conjugate base of the acid, and the hydrogen ion or proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which, in the case of aqueous solutions, exists as a solvated hydronium ion. In the example shown in the figure, HA represents acetic acid, and A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; the acetate ion. The chemical species HA, A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are said to be in equilibrium when their concentrations do not change with the passing of time. The dissociation constant is usually written as a quotient of the equilibrium concentrations (in mol/L), denoted by [HA], [A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] and [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]:
:&lt;math alt=&quot;K_a equals the equilibrium concentration of the deprotonated form A-, times the equilibrium concentration of H+, all divided by the equilibrium concentration of the acid AH.&quot; &gt;K_{\mathrm a} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [H^+]}{[HA]}}&lt;/math&gt;
Due to the many orders of magnitude spanned by ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values, a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the acid dissociation constant is more commonly used in practice. p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, which is equal to −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, may also be (incorrectly) referred to as an acid dissociation constant:

In the case of multiple pK values they are designated by indices: pK1, pK2, pK3 and so on. For amino acids, the pK1 constant refers to its carboxyl (-COOH) group, pK2 refers to its amino (-NH3) group and the pK3 is the pK value of its side chain.

:&lt;math&gt;\ pK_{\mathrm a} = - \log_{10}K_{\mathrm a}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H_3 B \rightleftharpoons\ H ^ + + H_2 B ^ - \qquad K_1 = {[H ^ +] \cdot [H_2 B ^ -] \over [H_3 B]} \qquad pK_1 = - log  K_1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H_2 B ^ - \rightleftharpoons\ H ^ + + H B ^ {-2} \qquad K_2 = {[H ^ +] \cdot [H B ^{-2}] \over [H_2 B^ -]} \qquad pK_2 = - log  K_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H B  ^{-2} \rightleftharpoons\ H ^ + +  B ^{-3} \qquad K_3 = {[H ^ +] \cdot [ B ^ {-3}] \over [H B ^ {-2}]} \qquad pK_3 = - log  K_3 &lt;/math&gt;

According to '''Arrhenius's''' original definition, an acid is a substance that dissociates in aqueous solution, releasing the hydrogen ion H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (a proton):&lt;ref name=Miessler&gt;

:HA = A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is known as a [[dissociation constant]]. The liberated proton combines with a water molecule to give a [[hydronium ion|hydronium (or oxonium) ion]] H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and so Arrhenius later proposed that the dissociation should be written as an [[acid–base reaction]]:
:HA + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

The acid loses a proton, leaving a conjugate base; the proton is transferred to the base, creating a conjugate acid. For aqueous solutions of an acid HA, the base is water; the conjugate base is A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion.

The designation of an acid or base as &quot;conjugate&quot; depends on the context. The conjugate acid BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of a base B dissociates according to
:BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = B + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
which is the reverse of the equilibrium
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (acid) + B (base) = OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (conjugate base) + BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (conjugate acid).
The hydroxide ion OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, a well known base, is here acting as the conjugate base of the acid water. Acids and bases are thus regarded simply as donors and acceptors of protons respectively.

A broader definition of acid dissociation includes hydrolysis, in which protons are produced by the splitting of water molecules. For example, boric acid (B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) acts as a weak acid, even though it is not a proton donor, because of the hydrolysis equilibrium
:B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
Similarly, [[hydrolysis#Hydrolysis of metal aqua ions|metal ion hydrolysis]] causes ions such as &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;[Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to behave as weak acids:&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;

===Henderson–Hasselbalch equation===
Lawrence Joseph Henderson wrote an equation, in 1908, describing the use of carbonic acid as a buffer solution. Karl Albert Hasselbalch later re-expressed that formula in logarithmic terms, resulting in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation . Hasselbalch was using the formula to study metabolic acidosis.

The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is derived from the acid dissociation constant equation by the following steps&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henderson%E2%80%93Hasselbalch_equation&amp;oldid=420194921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. Henderson (1 May 1908). &quot;Concerning the relationship between the strength of acids and their capacity to preserve neutrality&quot; (Abstract). Am. J. Physiol. 21 (4): 173–179.&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;K_\textrm{a} = \frac{[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{A}^-]} {[\textrm{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}K_\textrm{a} = \log_{10} \left ( \frac{[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{A}^-]}{[\textrm{HA}]} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}K_\textrm{a} = \log_{10}[\textrm{H}^+] + \log_{10} \left ( \frac{[\textrm{A}^-]}{[\textrm{HA}]} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\textrm{p}K_\textrm{a} = -\textrm{pH} + \log_{10} \left ( \frac{[\textrm{A}^-]}{[\textrm{HA}]} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{pH} = \textrm{p}K_\textrm{a} + \log_{10} \left ( \frac{[\textrm{A}^-]}{[\textrm{HA}]} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{pH} = \textrm{pK}_{a}-\log \left ( \frac{[\textrm{HA}]}{[\textrm{A}^-]} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio &lt;math&gt;[A^-]/[HA]&lt;/math&gt; is unitless, and as such, other ratios with other units may be used. For example, the mole ratio of the components, &lt;math&gt;n_{A^-}/n_{HA}&lt;/math&gt; or the fractional concentrations &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A^-}/\alpha_{HA}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{A^-}+\alpha_{HA}=1&lt;/math&gt; will yield the same answer. Sometimes these other units are more convenient to use.

==pKa and gibbs free energy==
An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction, so for an acid dissociation constant
:Δ''G''&lt;sup&gt;[[File:StrikeO.png]]&lt;/sup&gt; = −''RT'' ln ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.
''R'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''T'' is the [[kelvin|absolute temperature]]. Note that p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;= −log ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and 2.303 ≈ [[natural logarithm|ln]] 10. At 25&amp;nbsp;°C Δ''G''&lt;sup&gt;[[File:StrikeO.png]]&lt;/sup&gt; in kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 5.708 p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (1 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000 [[Joule]]s per [[Mole (unit)|mole]]). Free energy is made up of an [[enthalpy]] term and an [[entropy]] term.&lt;ref name=Goldmine/&gt;
:Δ''G''&lt;sup&gt;[[File:StrikeO.png]]&lt;/sup&gt; = Δ''H''&lt;sup&gt;[[File:StrikeO.png]]&lt;/sup&gt; − ''T''Δ''S''&lt;sup&gt;[[File:StrikeO.png]]&lt;/sup&gt;
The standard enthalpy change can be determined by [[calorimetry]] or by using the [[van 't Hoff equation]], though the calorimetric method is preferable. When both the standard enthalpy change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and Δ''H''&lt;sup&gt;[[File:StrikeO.png]]&lt;/sup&gt;. The data were critically selected and refer to 25&amp;nbsp;°C and zero ionic strength, in water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldmine&quot;&gt;

==Buffers==
Buffer solutions achieve their resistance to pH change because of the presence of an equilibrium between the acid HA and its conjugate base A-.
HA = H+ + A-
When some strong acid is added to an equilibrium mixture of the weak acid and its conjugate base, the equilibrium is shifted to the left, in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle. Because of this, the hydrogen ion concentration increases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of strong acid added. Similarly, if strong alkali is added to the mixture the hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of alkali added.
The effect is illustrated by the simulated titration of a weak acid with pKa = 4.7. The relative concentration of undissociated acid is shown in blue and of its conjugate base in red. The pH changes relatively slowly in the buffer region, pH = pKa ± 1, centered at pH = 4.7 where [HA] = [A-], but once the acid is more than 95% deprotonated the pH rises much more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buffer_solution&amp;oldid=422587570&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffer solutions are necessary to keep the correct pH for enzymes in many organisms to work. Many enzymes work only under very precise conditions; if the pH moves outside of a narrow range, the enzymes slow or stop working and can denature, thus permanently disabling their catalytic activity. A buffer of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3−) is present in blood plasma, to maintain a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.
Industrially, buffer solutions are used in fermentation processes and in setting the correct conditions for dyes used in colouring fabrics. They are also used in chemical analysis and calibration of pH meters.
The majority of biological samples that are used in research are made in buffers, especially phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buffer_solution&amp;oldid=422587570&lt;/ref&gt;

==What is pH?==
The concept of p[H] was first introduced by Danish chemist Søren Peder Lauritz Sørensen at the Carlsberg Laboratory in 1909 and revised to the modern pH in 1924 after it became apparent that electromotive force in cells depends on activity rather than concentration of hydrogen ions. In the first papers, the notation had the H as a subscript to the lowercase p, like so: pH.
It is unknown what the exact definition of 'p' in pH is. A common definition often used in schools is &quot;percentage&quot;. However some references suggest the p stands for “Power”, others refer to the German word “Potenz” (meaning power in German), still others refer to “potential”. Jens Norby published a paper in 2000 arguing that p is a constant and stands for “negative logarithm”; H then stands for Hydrogen. According to the Carlsberg Foundation pH stands for &quot;power of hydrogen&quot;. Other suggestions that have surfaced over the years are that the p stands for puissance (also meaning power, but, then, the Carlsberg Laboratory was French-speaking) or that pH stands for the Latin terms pondus Hydrogenii or potentia hydrogenii. It is also suggested that Sørensen used the letters p and q (commonly paired letters in mathematics) simply to label the test solution (p) and the reference solution (q)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:PH Scale.svg|thumb|right|Some typical pH values]]
&lt;!-- [[File:PH scale 2.png|thumb|right|Another visual representation of the pH scale.]] --&gt;
Pure (neutral) water has a pH around 7 at 25 °C (77 °F); this value varies with temperature. When an acid is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7 (if at {{convert|25|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}}). When a base, or alkali, is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7 (if at 25 °C (77 °F)). A solution of a strong acid, such as [[hydrochloric acid]], at concentration 1&amp;nbsp;mol&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as [[sodium hydroxide]], at concentration 1&amp;nbsp;mol&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;.

Because the glass electrode (and other ion selective electrodes) responds to activity, the electrode should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below.

An approximate measure of pH may be obtained by using a pH indicator. A pH indicator is a substance that changes color around a particular pH value. It is a weak acid or [[weak base]] and the color change occurs around 1 pH unit either side of its [[acid dissociation constant]], or p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, value. For example, the naturally occurring indicator litmus is red in acidic solutions (pH&lt;7 at 25 °C (77 °F)) and blue in alkaline (pH&gt;7 at 25 °C (77 °F)) solutions. Universal indicator consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is simple paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;

A solution whose pH is 7 (at 25 °C (77 °F)) is said to be neutral, that is, it is neither acidic nor basic. Water is subject to a self-ionization process.
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
The dissociation constant, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, has a value of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt;, so, in neutral solution of a salt, both the hydrogen ion concentration and [[hydroxide ion]] concentration are about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; mol&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.
The pH of pure water decreases with increasing temperatures. For example, the pH of pure water at 50 °C is 6.55. Note, however, that water that has been exposed to air is mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which is then slowly converted into [[carbonic acid]], which dissociates to liberate hydrogen ions:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;nbsp;= H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
===Mathematical definition===
pH is defined as a negative decimal [[logarithm]] of the [[hydrogen ion]] activity in a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04524.html|title=pH|work=IUPAC Goldbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pH} = - \log_{10}(a_{\textrm{H}^+}) = \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{a_{\textrm{H}^+}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of [[hydrogen ion]]s in units of Mol/L (molar concentration). Activity has a sense of concentration, however activity is always less than the concentration and is defined as a concentration (Mol/L) of an ion multiplied by activity coefficient. The activity coefficient for diluted solutions is a real number between 0 and 1 (for concentrated solutions may be greater than 1) and it depends on many parameters of a solution, such as nature of ion, ion force, temperature, etc. For a strong electrolyte, activity of an ion approaches its concentration in diluted solutions. Activity can be measured experimentally by means of an ion-selective electrode that responds, according to the [[Nernst equation]], to hydrogen ion activity. pH is commonly measured by means of a [[glass electrode]] connected to a milli-voltmeter with very high input impedance, which measures the potential difference, or [[electromotive force]], ''E'', between an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity and a reference electrode, such as a [[Saturated calomel electrode|calomel electrode]] or a [[silver chloride electrode]]. Quite often, glass electrode is combined with the reference electrode and a temperature sensor in one body. The glass electrode can be described (to 95–99.9% accuracy) by the Nernst equation&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; E = E^0 + \frac{RT}{nF} \ln(a_{\textrm{H}^+}); \qquad \mathrm{pH} = \frac{E^0-E}{2.303 RT/F}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is a measured potential , ''E''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the standard electrode potential, that is, the electrode potential for the standard state in which the activity is one. ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s, ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]], and ''n'' is the number of electrons transferred (ion charge), one in this instance. The electrode potential, ''E'', is proportional to the logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity.

This definition, by itself, is wholly impractical, because the hydrogen ion activity is the product of the [[concentration]] and an [[activity coefficient]]. To get proper results, the electrode must be [[calibrate]]d using standard solutions of known activity.

The [[operational definition]] of pH is officially defined by International Standard [[ISO 31-8]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Quantities and units – Part 8: Physical chemistry and molecular physics, Annex C (normative): pH. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; For a solution X, first measure the electromotive force ''E''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[galvanic cell]]
:reference electrode|concentrated solution of KCl || solution X|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|Pt
and then also measure the electromotive force ''E''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; of a galvanic cell that differs from the above one only by the replacement of the solution X of unknown pH, pH(X), by a solution S of a known standard pH, pH(S). The pH of X is then

:&lt;math&gt; \text{pH(X)} - \text{pH(S)} = \frac{E_\text{S} - E_\text{X} }{2.303RT/F}&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the pH of solution X and the pH of the standard solution depends only on the difference between two measured potentials. Thus, pH is obtained from a potential measured with an electrode calibrated against one or more pH standards; a [[pH meter]] setting is adjusted such that the meter reading for a solution of a standard is equal to the value pH(S). Values pH(S) for a range of standard solutions S, along with further details, are given in the [[IUPAC]] recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac198557030531|last1=Covington|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1985/pdf/5703x0531.pdf|first1=A. K.|last2=Bates|first2=R. G.|last3=Durst|first3=R. A. |title=Definitions of pH scales, standard reference values, measurement of pH, and related terminology|journal=Pure Appl. Chem. |year=1985|volume=57|pages=531–542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard solutions are often described as standard buffer solution. In practice, it is better to use two or more standard buffers to allow for small deviations from Nernst-law ideality in real electrodes.
Note that, because the temperature occurs in the defining equations, the pH of a solution is temperature-dependent.

Measurement of extremely low pH values, such as some very acidic mine waters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordstrom|first1=Darrell Kirk|last2=Alpers|first2=Charles N.|last3=Ptacek|first3=Carol J.|last4=Blowes|first4=David W.|title=Negative pH and Extremely Acidic Mine Waters from Iron Mountain, California|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=34|pages=254|year=2000|doi=10.1021/es990646v}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires special procedures. Calibration of the electrode in such cases can be done with standard solutions of concentrated sulfuric acid, whose pH values can be calculated with using [[Pitzer parameter]]s to calculate activity coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zemaitis|first=J.F.|coauthors=Clark, D.M; Rafal, M; Scrivner, N.C.|title=Handbook of Aqueous Electrolyte Thermodynamics: Theory &amp; Application|publisher=Wiley|year=1986|isbn=0816903506|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

pH is an example of an [[acidity function]]. Hydrogen ion concentrations can be measured in non-aqueous solvents, but this leads, in effect, to a different acidity function, because the standard state for a non-aqueous solvent is different from the standard state for water. [[Superacid]]s are a class of non-aqueous acids for which the [[Hammett acidity function]], ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;

===p[H]===
This was the original definition of Sørensen, which was superseded in favour of pH in 1924. However, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly, if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way to do this, which has been used extensively, is to titrate a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkali in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkali are known, it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a [[Gran plot#Electrode calibration|Gran plot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/ed042p375| last=Rossotti| first=F.J.C.| coauthors=Rossotti, H.|year=1965|title=Potentiometric titrations using Gran plots: A textbook omission|journal=J. Chem. Ed.|volume=42|pages=375–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calibration yieds a value for the standard electrode potential, ''E''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and a slope factor, ''f'', so that the Nernst equation in the form
:&lt;math&gt;E = E^0 + f\frac{RT}{nF} \log_e[\mbox{H}^+]&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to derive hydrogen ion concentrations from experimental measurements of ''E''. The slope factor is usually slightly less than one. A slope factor of less than 0.95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly. The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during the titration. As it is constant, its value can be set to one by defining the [[standard state]] as being the solution containing the background electrolyte. Thus, the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PH&amp;oldid=424276341&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between p[H] and pH is quite small. It has been stated Section 13.23, &quot;Determination of pH&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that pH = p[H] + 0.04. It is common practice to use the term &quot;pH&quot; for both types of measurement.

===pOH===

pOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, or [[alkalinity]]. pOH is not measured independently, but is derived from pH. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by

:[OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; /[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[self-ionisation of water|self-ionisation]] constant of water. Taking [[cologarithm]]s

:pOH = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; − pH.

So, at room temperature pOH ≈ 14 − pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of [[Alkali soils|soil alkalinity]].

[[File:Symptoms of acidosis.svg|thumb|left|General symptoms of [[acidosis]],resulting from decrease in body pH.]]
The pH of different cellular compartments, [[body fluid]]s, and organs is usually tightly regulated in a process called [[acid-base homeostasis]].

The pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.365. This value is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine.

[[Dental plaque|Plaque]] can create a local acidic environment that can result in [[tooth decay]] by demineralisation.

[[Enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s have an optimum pH range and can become inactivated or [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] outside this range.

The most common disorder in acid-base homeostasis is [[acidosis]], which means an acid overload in the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35.

In the blood, pH can be estimated from known [[base excess]] (be) and [[bicarbonate]] concentration (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by the following equation:&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;[http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~spon/picu/calc/basecalc.htm Medical Calculators &gt; Calculated Bicarbonate &amp; Base Excess] teven Pon, MD, Weill Medical College of Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{pH} = \frac{be - 0.93\mathrm{HCO_3} + 124}{13.77}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Runaway is the basis for teaching a dog to leave its handler in order to get a reward. A helper &quot;runs away&quot; with favorite toy or food and entices the dog to leave its handler. Once the dog gets to the helper, the dog is praised and rewarded. What constitutes a reward for the dog must be interpreted by those working with the dog. The reward is most often food, play, praise, or a combination of these. Runaways usually start with a helper familiar to the dog, and are short. As the dog learns this behavior the runaways get longer and unfamiliar people can act as helpers. There are two basic methods for training a dog to search for other people, but both start with a runaway.

A search normally follows this sequence:
# Handler gives search command,
# Dog finds subject, 
# Dog returns to handler,  
# Dog indicates find to handler,  
# Handler gives a &quot;show-me-where&quot; command,  
# Dog leads handler to subject. 
 
Dog training requires small steps, and to teach all these steps is a very difficult task. This is where the two methods of training are different. Forward chaining teaches the steps in the order they will actually take place. It requires teaching step one, then having to teach step two and so on. After the first step is learned, the handler must add a new behavior, while at the same time weaning an anticipated reward. 
Back-chaining is a method that keeps the reward in the same place (with the joining of the subject and searcher).   The back-chaining method is taught in a sequence that is the reverse of how the actual search would sequence.

Back-chaining
# Have fun with handler, subject, dog and lure, all together; the dog learns that if everyone is together, there is a big reward. 
# Have subject run away with lure. Dog wants to follow. Queue dog do a pre-learned alert behavior. This can either be a bark, a bump, a tug on a toy, etc. When dog does alert behavior dog is given refind command and allowed to run to subject and play (just what she wanted to do. She gets her reward.) When this two step sequence is solid with no queuing move to step 3. 
# Leave dog with subject. Subject should provide just enough play anticipation that the dog stays with the subject until the handler stops 5-10 seconds away. Subject ceases any activity and ignores dog. Dog wants to play, but subject is unresponsive. Dog then goes to handler, a natural behavior. Handler is unresponsive until dog executes alert behavior, then handler gives refind command. The return to handler and the alert may need to be queued at first, but handler should queue as little as possible. Dog now gets to do what she wanted, run to the subject and reward. The added steps take a little longer, but the dog KNOWS what to expect next, and KNOWS the fun is coming. Reduce the queues to zero before moving to step 4. 
# Have subject run away with lure. Dog wants to follow. Same as step 1, so far. When dog gets to subject there is no play - subject is unresponsive, but the dog has seen this before and knows a solution for the problem. Dog goes and alerts handler, sequence is followed thru to reward 4-3-2-1. 
# GRADUALLY increase the difficulty of the process. Stop and go back if some part of the process is weakening. 
What the dog has learned is that a reward comes only at the end of a set of behaviors. 

If the dog is conditioned in this way the dog learns to associate the sequence and the smell of people with its own happiness.

== Good work at [[Calculus]]==
Just thought I should say I thought you were doing good work at calculus, and to keep it up.  I am one of the other people interested, generally speaking, in the math texts around here.  If you run into any points where you have a question about anything feel free to drop a line on my talk page.  I have spent enough time wrestling with the LaTeX implementation here that I might know a trick or two.  Hope fun.

Convenient and predictable list formatting is one of the many advantages of using LaTeX. Users of WYSIWYG word processors can sometimes be frustrated by the software's attempts to determine when they intend lists to begin and end. As a mark-up language, LaTeX gives more control over the structure and content of lists.

== List Structures ==

Lists often appear in documents, especially academic, as their purpose is often to present information in a clear and concise fashion. List structures in LaTeX are simply environments which essentially come in three flavors: {{LaTeX/Environment|itemize}}, {{LaTeX/Environment|enumerate}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|description}}.

All lists follow the basic format:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{list_type}

  \item The first item
  \item The second item
  \item The third etc \ldots

\end{list_type}
}}

All three of these types of lists can have multiple paragraphs per item: just type the additional paragraphs in the normal way, with a blank line between each. So long as they are still contained within the enclosing environment, they will automatically be indented to follow underneath their item.

=== &lt;tt&gt;Itemize&lt;/tt&gt; ===

This environment is for your standard bulleted list of items.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{itemize}
  \item The first item
  \item The second item
  \item The third etc \ldots
\end{itemize}
|render=
[[Image:itemize.svg]]
}}

=== &lt;tt&gt;Enumerate&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The enumerate environment is for ordered lists, where by default, each item is numbered sequentially.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first item
  \item The second item
  \item The third etc \ldots
\end{enumerate}
|render=
[[Image:enum.svg]]
}}

=== &lt;tt&gt;Description&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The description environment is slightly different. You can specify the item label by passing it as an optional argument (although optional, it would look odd if you didn't include it!). Ideal for a series of definitions, such as a glossary.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{description}
  \item[First] The first item
  \item[Second] The second item
  \item[Third] The third etc \ldots
\end{description}
|render=
[[Image:desc.svg]]
}}

Sometimes you want a description where the text begins on a new line. This cannot easily be done with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}}. The trick is to use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hfill&lt;!----&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=noline&lt;/ref&gt;. 

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{description}
  \item[First] \hfill \\
  The first item
  \item[Second] \hfill \\
  The second item
  \item[Third] \hfill \\
  The third etc \ldots
\end{description}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX desc-newline.svg]]
}}

== Nested lists ==

LaTeX will happily allow you to insert a list environment into an existing one (up to a depth of four&amp;mdash;if you need more than four, use the {{LaTeX/Package|easylist}} package). Simply begin the appropriate environment at the desired point within the current list. Latex will sort out the layout and any numbering for you.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Nested item 1
    \item Nested item 2
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The second item
  \item The third etc \ldots
\end{enumerate}
|render=
[[Image:nested.svg]]
}}

== Customizing lists ==

Customizing LaTeX is outside the beginners' domain. While not necessarily difficult in itself, because beginners are already overwhelmed with the array of commands and environments, moving on to more advanced topics runs the risk of confusion.

However, since the tutorial aims at being complete, we shall still include a brief guide on customizing lists. Feel free to skip!

Note that in the following when {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} is used it must appear after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document}&lt;!----&gt;}} instruction so the changes made are taken into account. This is needed for both enumerated and itemized lists.

Also beware of the spaces in the label definitions. It is a common error!

===Line spacing===
As you may have noticed, in standard LaTeX document classes, the vertical spacing between items, and above and below the lists as a whole, is more than between paragraphs: it may look odd if the descriptions are too short.

==== Using packages ====

If you want tightly-packed lists, use the {{LaTeX/Package|mdwlist}} package (included in the {{LaTeX/Package|mdwtools}} bundle), which provides compact, &quot;starred&quot; versions of the previous environments, i.e. {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=itemize*&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=enumerate*&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=description*&lt;!----&gt;}}. They work exactly in the same way, but the output is more compact. Other packages providing compacted lists are {{LaTeX/Package|paralist}} and {{LaTeX/Package|enumitem}}.

Alternatively, use the {{LaTeX/Parameter|memoir}} class and with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tightlists&lt;!----&gt;}}.

==== Customizing manually ====

Inside lists you can redefine some length/dimension variables of LaTeX, for example using:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
  \item first item
  \item second item
\end{itemize}
}}

Alternatively, to create a unified look in your document you can redefine the enumerate environment:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\let\oldenumerate\enumerate
\renewcommand{\enumerate}{
  \oldenumerate
  \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
}
}}

Another approach is to redefine the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\item&lt;!----&gt;}} command globally.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newlength{\wideitemsep}
\setlength{\wideitemsep}{.5\itemsep}
\addtolength{\wideitemsep}{-7pt}
\let\olditem\item
\renewcommand{\item}{\setlength{\itemsep}{\wideitemsep}\olditem}
}}

=== Customizing enumerated lists ===

==== Using packages ====

The thing people want to change most often with Enumerated lists are the counters.  A quick solution to this problem is provided by the {{LaTeX/Package|enumerate}} package of David Carlisle&lt;ref name=&quot;carlisle:99&quot;&gt;[http://mirrors.fe.up.pt/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/required/tools/enumerate.pdf]The enumerate package, David Carlisle 1999&lt;/ref&gt;, or the more sophisticated package {{LaTeX/Package|enumitem}} by Javier Bezos&lt;ref name=&quot;bezos:11&quot;&gt;[http://mirrors.fe.up.pt/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/enumitem/enumitem.pdf]The enumitem package, Javier Bezos 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.  When using {{LaTeX/Package|enumerate}}, it is possible to specify the ''style'' of the numbering: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{enumerate}[style]&lt;!----&gt;}}.

The options ''A'', ''a'', ''I'', ''i'' and ''1'' define the style and are self-explanatory, anything else is treated as text. To use any of the style tokens as text they can be enclosed in braces, e.g. {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={A}&lt;!----&gt;}} will give a literal A. &lt;ref ftp://tug.ctan.org/ctan/macros/latex/required/tools/enumerate.pdf&gt; CTAN documentation for {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=enumerate&lt;!----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes you may want to place some short text in front of the enumeration for example: &quot;Exercise 1, Exercise 2, Execise 3, ...&quot;. This is possible with the {{LaTeX/Package|enumitem}} package:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries Exercise \arabic*:]
  \item 5 + 7 = 12
  \item 9 + 1 = 10
  \item 2 * 2 = 4
\end{enumerate}
|render=
[[File:Enumerate.png|thumbnail|Enumeration with text]]
}}

''\bfseries'' makes it bold, ''Exercise'' is the text and ''\arabic*'' inserts the counter followed by a ''colon (:)'' which is treated as text again.

==== Manually ====

To go any further and do it yourself instead, a brief introduction to LaTeX ''counters'' is required. You should check the [[LaTeX/Counters|dedicated chapter]] as we will not delve into the details for now.

There are four individual counters that are associated with itemized lists, each one represents the four possible levels of nesting, which are called:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
enumi
enumii
enumiii
enumiv
}}

The counter is incremented by {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\item&lt;!----&gt;}} before it is printed. For example to reset {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=enumi&lt;!----&gt;}} use:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
  \item fifth element
\end{enumerate}
|render=
5. fifth element
}}

The command responsible for formatting the various levels of nesting are
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\labelenumi
\labelenumii
\labelenumiii
\labelenumiv
}}

Example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\Roman{enumi})}
\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{\Roman{enumi}.~\alph{enumii}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

This simply redefines the appearance of the label, which is fine, providing that you do not intend to cross-reference to a specific item within the list, in which case the reference will be printed in the original format. This issue does not arise if you redefine the counter printer:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\Roman{enumi}&lt;!----&gt;}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
\renewcommand{\theenumii}{\alph{enumii}&lt;!----&gt;}
\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{\theenumi.~\theenumii&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

=== Customizing itemized lists ===

Itemized lists are not as complex as they do not need to count. Therefore, to customize, you simply change the labels. It can be done manually for each entry with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\item[new symbol]&lt;!----&gt;}}, eg {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\item[$\star$]&lt;!----&gt;}}. 

The itemize labels are accessed via {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\labelitemi&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\labelitemii&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\labelitemiii&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\labelitemiv&lt;!----&gt;}}, for the four respective levels.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\textgreater}
}}

The above example would set the labels for the first level to a greater than (&gt;) symbol. Of course, the text symbols available in Latex are not very exciting. Why not use one of the ZapfDingbat symbols, as described in the [[#Other_symbols|Symbols]] section.
Or use a mathematical symbol:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\star$}
}}

Itemized list with tightly set items, that is with no vertical space between two consecutive items, can be created as follows.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}%
  \setlength{\parskip}{0cm}%
  \item Item opening the list
  \item Item tightly following
\end{itemize}
}}

== Inline lists ==
Inline lists can be achieved as follows.

===With package  {{LaTeX/Package|paralist}} ===
The {{LaTeX/Package|paralist}} package provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=inparaenum&lt;!----&gt;}} environment (with an optional formatting specification in square brackets):

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{paralist}
% ...

\begin{document}

Inline lists, which are
sequential in nature, just like enumerated
lists, but are
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item formatted within their paragraph;
\item usually labelled with letters; and 
\item usually have the final item prefixed with
`and' or `or',
\end{inparaenum} like this example.
...
|render=
[[Image:Latex example paralist.svg|400px]]
}}

To change the styles of the counter, tokens A, a, I, i, and 1 can be used in the optional argument to produce the counter with one of the styles {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Alph&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\alph&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Roman&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\roman&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\arabic&lt;!----&gt;}}. For example:
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]&lt;!----&gt;}}
produces the labels (i), (ii), (iii) ...


===With package {{LaTeX/Package|enumitem}} ===
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage[inline]{enumitem}
% ...

\begin{document}

Inline lists, which are
sequential in nature, just like enumerated
lists, but are
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\alph*\upshape)]
\item formatted within their paragraph;
\item usually labelled with letters; and 
\item usually have the final item prefixed with
`and' or `or',
\end{enumerate*} like this example.
...
|render=
[[File:Latex example enumitem inline list.svg|400px]]
}}

Package {{LaTeX/Package|shortlst}} also provides inline lists.

== Easylist package ==
The {{LaTeX/Package|easylist}} package &lt;ref ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/easylist/easylist-doc.pdf&gt;easylist documentation&lt;/ref&gt; allows you to create list using a more convenient syntax and with infinite nested levels.
It is also very customizable.

Load the package with the control character as optional argument:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[ampersand]{easylist}
}}

The {{LaTeX/Environment|easylist}} environment will default to enumerations.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{easylist}
&amp; Main item~:
&amp;&amp; Sub item.
&amp;&amp; Another sub item.
\end{easylist}
}}

It features predefined styles which you can set as optional argument.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
% ...
\end{easylist}
}}

Available styles:
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|tractatus}}
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|checklist}} - All items have empty check boxes next to them
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|booktoc}} - Approximately the format used by the table of contents of the book class
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|articletoc}} - Approximately the format used by the table of contents of the article class
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|enumerate}} - The default
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|itemize}}

You can customize lists with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ListProperties(...)&lt;!----&gt;}} command and revert back the customization with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newlist{}&lt;!----&gt;}}. Yes, that's parentheses for {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ListProperties&lt;!----&gt;}} parameters.

The {{LaTeX/Parameter|Style}} parameter sets the style of counters and text, the {{LaTeX/Parameter|Style*}} parameter sets the sytle of counters, and the {{LaTeX/Parameter|Style**}} parameter sets the style of text. The parameter {{LaTeX/Parameter|Numbers}} determines the way that the numbers are displayed and the possible values are {{LaTeX/Parameter|r}} or {{LaTeX/Parameter|R}} (for lower and upper case Roman numerals), {{LaTeX/Parameter|l}} or {{LaTeX/Parameter|L}} (for lower and upper case letters), {{LaTeX/Parameter|a}} (for Arabic numbers, the default), and {{LaTeX/Parameter|z}} (for Zapf's Dingbats).

The {{LaTeX/Parameter|FinalMark}} parameter sets the punctuation of the final counter (Ex: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=FinalMark3={)}}}) while {{LaTeX/Parameter|FinalSpace}} sets the amount of space between the item and the item's text. The {{LaTeX/Parameter|Margin}} parameter sets the distance from the left margin (Ex: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=FinalSpace2=1cm}}). The {{LaTeX/Parameter|Progressive}} parameter sets the distance from the left margin of all items in proportion to their level.

The {{LaTeX/Parameter|Hide = n}} parameter prevents the first {{LaTeX/Parameter|n}} counters from appearing in all levels. If there is a number after a parameter (Ex: {{LaTeX/Parameter|Style3*}}) then this numbers indicates the level that it will affect (Ex: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=Style3=\color{red}}}).

Example of custom enumerate:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{easylist}[enumerate]
\ListProperties(Style2*=,Numbers=a,Numbers1=R,FinalMark={)})
&amp; Main item~:
&amp;&amp; Sub item.
&amp;&amp; Another sub item.
\end{easylist}
}}

Note that we put the {{LaTeX/Parameter|FinalMark}} argument between {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={}&lt;!----&gt;}} to avoid LaTeX understanding it as the end of the properties list.
Now we change the default properties to print a custom itemize:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{amssymb}
\ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=3ex, Style*=-- ,
Style2*=$\bullet$ ,Style3*=$\circ$ ,Style4*=\tiny$\blacksquare$ )
% ...

\begin{easylist}
&amp; Blah
&amp; Blah
&amp;&amp; Blah
&amp;&amp;&amp; Blah
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; Blah
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; Blah
\end{easylist}
|render=
– Blah&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; Blah&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; Blah&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; Blah&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; – Blah
}}

Spaces in {{LaTeX/Parameter|Style}} parameters are important. The {{LaTeX/Parameter|Style*}} parameter acts as a default value and {{LaTeX/Environment|easylist}} will use a medium dash for level 1, 5 and onward. 

You can also define custom styles using LaTeX macros:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand\myitemize{\ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=3ex, Style*=$\star$ )}
\newcommand\myenumerate{\ListProperties(Space=2\baselineskip)}

% ...
\begin{easylist} \myitemize
&amp; Blah
\end{easylist}
}}

Important note: {{LaTeX/Package|easylist}} has some drawbacks.
First if you need to put an easylist inside an environment using the same control character as the one specified for easylist, you may get an error.
To circumvent it, use the following commands provided by easylist:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\Activate
\begin{easylist}
&amp; ...
\end{easylist}
\Deactivate
}}

Besides using {{LaTeX/Environment|easylist}} along with figures may cause some trouble to the layout and the indentation.
LaTeX lists do not have this problem.

To use easylist with Beamer, each frame that uses easylist must be marked as fragile:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    ...
    \begin{easylist}[itemize]
        ...
    \end{easylist}
    ...
\end{frame}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;Chain Rule&lt;/center&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;When differentiating a square root function or a quantity raised to a power the chain rule is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;(ax^n+b)^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the chain rule we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(n)(x^{n-1})(ax^n+b)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we did was take the power of the quantity and moved it out front.  From there we took the derivative of the inside and then multiplied our previous steps by the quantity with n-1 for the power of the quantity.&lt;/p&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 1'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=(2x+4)^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to differentiate this properly we must use the chain rule.  First thing we do is take the power number and derive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;3(2x+4)^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we take the derivative of the inside&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;3(2)(2x+4)^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we have to do now is some minor simplification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x)=6(2x+4)^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(2x+4)^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''&lt;center&gt;Other examples to work on&lt;/center&gt;'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 2'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4x^5+x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that a square root is just something raised to the one half power&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 3'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;2(x^3+x^2)^5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 4'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;2x(x^2+1)^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Hint''': You will have to use the product rule as well as the chain rule&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An alternate way of completing a chain rule is considering the problem as a composite function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In this instance you consider simply taking the derivative of the outside multiplied by the derivative of the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chain Rule becomes very useful when dealing with a function to a power, or a square root of a function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The following proof outlines this idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; PROOF &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Let  &lt;math&gt; h(x) = f(g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that &lt;math&gt; x = c &lt;/math&gt; and that as &lt;math&gt; g(x)\rightarrow g(c) &lt;/math&gt; ,that &lt;math&gt; x \rightarrow c &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h'(c) = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} \frac {f(g(x)) - f(g(c)) }{x - c} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} [ \frac {f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)} * \frac {g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}] &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g(x) \ne g(c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; = [\lim_{x\rightarrow c} \frac {f(g(x)) - f(g(c))}{g(x) - g(c)}][\lim_{x\rightarrow c} \frac {g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; = f'(g(c))g'(c){\square}. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In order to find the derivative, you can take that proof into consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You can use any method you deem viable to find the derivative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An example of this method is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h(x) = (3x - 1)^2. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Let &lt;math&gt; g(x) = 3x - 1 &lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^2. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; According to chain rule, &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 2x. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the problem, &lt;math&gt; g(x) &lt;/math&gt; is inside of &lt;math&gt; f(x). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, then &lt;math&gt; f'(g(x)) = 2g(x). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But because of the chain rule, we must also multiply by &lt;math&gt; g'(x). &lt;/math&gt; Thus giving us, &lt;math&gt; 2g(x)g'(x) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see that,  &lt;math&gt; g'(x) = 3. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So if we put this all together we get, &lt;math&gt; h'(x) = 2(3x - 1)(3) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = 6(3x - 1). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You may have noticed that in some cases, a chain rule may be multiplied out to create a simple power rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For the previous example, if you multiply the power out, you are left with a simpler equation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In some cases, chain rule is easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h(x) = (3x - 1)^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h(x) = (3x - 1)(3x - 1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h(x) = 9x^2 - 6x + 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = 18x - 6 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = 6(3x - 1). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Another reason the chain rule becomes very effective is when you are dealing with trigonometric functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the derivative of &lt;math&gt; f(x) = sin(2x) &lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt; f'(x)= cos(2x) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Instead, by applying chain rule,&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 2cos(2x). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This shows that chain rule is useful whenever a trigonometric function is applied to a function other than x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sometimes, you may need to apply chain rule more than once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here is an example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; f(x) = sin^3(3x) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 3sin^2(3x)cos(3x)(3)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 9sin^2(3x)cos(3x). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, first chain rule was applied to find the derivative of the outside, which was the power on the sine function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Next, the derivative of the sine function itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The last part was finding the derivative of the inside of the sine function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This method required the chain rule twice. Other problems may require more uses of the chain rule. &lt;/p&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Eddie Carmichael''''' is a Ravenclaw student one year older than Harry.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL exams]] approach, many students are trying to earn some easy money from selling items touted as being able to give some advantage in the exams. These substances are against the rules at Hogwarts, and are often actually dangerous drugs &amp;ndash; one student was offering &quot;powdered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] claw&quot; for sale, which on inspection turned out to be dried [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Doxy|doxy]] droppings.  Eddie offers Baruffio's Brain Elixir, a supposed brain stimulant.  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] were just about to buy some from him when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] (acting as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]]) confiscates all of it and pours it down the toilet.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

We have no idea what Baruffio's Brain Elixir may be, but it is almost certainly ineffective, probably water with some magical herbs mixed in at random to give it some sort of color and flavour to justify the price (12 Galleons a pint) Eddie is asking. A reader with a good memory may recognize the name, though, as in Harry's first year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] had cautioned his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] class to ''&quot;never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.&quot;''

      <comment>FIRST - ANSWER: WHAT IS THIS?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Came here based on google groups thread.

At the first sentence ... I'm turned off.

All too typically, this article is starting off describing the nature of the beast.

FIRST: ANSWER THE QUESTION - WHAT IS &lt;THIS&gt;.

Then you can go on as you are.

If I've come across this page by accident, or by googling and want to know what tiddlywiki is, this article's opening is not the way for me to find out.</text>

==Harmony==
The tonality of the song is either C major or D minor and F major, not as it is written in a few musical scores. The range of notes is the same as C major. But the harmonic center of the song is the D-minor chord. Such melodies are said to be in so-called &quot;Dorian scale&quot;. This is a church key. So named because there are many old hymns in this key. But there are some folk songs (eg the Irish folk music) and modern pieces (eg, Mad World by Michael Andrews) still using this mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Code Discussion==
When you first run your code you will probably find that everything appears to work.  Don't be deceived, try and load the top scores.  It probably won't work; we need to get the top scores file in the correct location, so that when we select the load the option from the menu it actually loads the file:

===Correct Load Location===
Inside the &lt;code&gt;LoadTopScores()&lt;/code&gt; sub routine you'll find the line that is giving you trouble
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
FileOpen(1, &quot;HiScores.txt&quot;, OpenMode.Input)
&lt;/source&gt;
All this line is doing is trying to find the HiScores.txt file inside the folder where your code is running.  On Windows machines this will be:
 ConsoleApplication1\bin\Debug
You can fix this by copying the HiScores.txt file into here. Or alternatively you can copy the file into the root of your project, in this case being the poorly named project:
 ConsoleApplication1
We then need to make the line we looked at above point to this file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
FileOpen(1, &quot;../../HiScores.txt&quot;, OpenMode.Input)
&lt;/source&gt;
The ../../ means to take the Debug folder where the code is running, and to look two folders up to find the HiScores.txt file:
*If the code is running in ConsoleApplication1\bin\Debug
* &quot;../../HiScores.txt&quot; will find the file in ConsoleApplication1\

==Potential Questions==
This list is by no means a list of the questions you will be asked in the exam, but by solving these problems you should get to understand the code a little better.

===Validating the LoadTopScores(TopScores)===
You might be worried about people accidentally overwriting the top scores from the main menu.  Imagine that you have just played the game for an hour and you accidentally click on option 3 on the main menu, you'd overwrite all your scores!  How could we validate the entry of the load game to make sure that this didn't happen:

===The option menu===
Add a new option to the menu to:

=== Reset the top scores ===
An option that appears to be missing, is the ability for the user to reset the top scores that are currently stored in the TopScores array. We need to add an option (option 5) to the menu so that users can manually reset the top scores.  Make sure that you get all the menu option checks to allow for the new menu option number.

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
1. Inside the &lt;code&gt;DisplayMenu()&lt;/code&gt; sub routine add the following to allow people to select the number 5
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;4.  Display top scores&quot;)
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;5.  Reset top scores&quot;)'added option 5
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;9.  Quit&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
2. Inside the &lt;code&gt;GetMenuChoice()&lt;/code&gt; function make sure that option choice 5 does not bring up an error by making the following change:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        If OptionChosen &lt; 1 Or (OptionChosen &gt; 4 And OptionChosen &lt;&gt; 9) Then
&lt;/source&gt;
Update this to:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        If OptionChosen &lt; 1 Or (OptionChosen &gt; 5 And OptionChosen &lt;&gt; 9) Then
&lt;/source&gt;
3. Update the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; sub routine by making sure that option 5 does not bring up an error
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        Loop Until (OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 4) Or OptionSelected = 9
&lt;/source&gt;
Update this to:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        Loop Until (OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 5) Or OptionSelected = 9
&lt;/source&gt;
4. Finally we need to add the code to run when a person selects option 5
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
            If OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 4 Then
                Select Case OptionSelected
                    Case 1 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, True, TopScores)
                    Case 2 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, False, TopScores)
                    Case 3 : LoadTopScores(TopScores)
                    Case 4 : DisplayTopScores(TopScores)
                End Select
            End If
&lt;/source&gt;
Make the following changes
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
            If OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 5 Then 'change!
                Select Case OptionSelected
                    Case 1 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, True, TopScores)
                    Case 2 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, False, TopScores)
                    Case 3 : LoadTopScores(TopScores)
                    Case 4 : DisplayTopScores(TopScores)
                    Case 5 : ResetTopScores(TopScores) 'addition!
                End Select
            End If
&lt;/source&gt;

===Starting the game===
====Making sure each player has a different name====
When you start the game the following scenario could occur:
 What is player one's name? Aubrey
 What is player two's name? Aubrey
This means that you wouldn't know who was who, which Aubrey is which? It would be far better if we forced the users to have different names.  To do this you are going to need a loop to check that the second name is different from the first name:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Console.Write(&quot;What is player one's name? &quot;)
PlayerOneName = GetValidPlayerName()
Console.Write(&quot;What is player two's name? &quot;)
Do 
    PlayerTwoName = GetValidPlayerName()
    If PlayerOneName = PlayerTwoName Then
        Console.Write(&quot;Name is in use already. Please enter new one &quot;)
    End If
Loop Until PlayerTwoName &lt;&gt; PlayerOneName
&lt;/source&gt;
The above would allow: Ryan and ryan

If you don't want the check to be case sensitive, we are going to check that the capitalised versions of both names are not the same by using the &lt;code&gt;UCase(&quot;String&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; function.  In this case &lt;code&gt;UCase(&quot;String&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; would equal &lt;code&gt;&quot;STRING&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Console.Write(&quot;What is player one's name? &quot;)
PlayerOneName = GetValidPlayerName()
Console.Write(&quot;What is player two's name? &quot;)
Do
    PlayerTwoName = GetValidPlayerName()
    If UCase(PlayerOneName) = UCase(PlayerTwoName) Then
        Console.Write(&quot;Name is in use already. Please enter new one &quot;)
    End If
Loop Until UCase(PlayerTwoName) &lt;&gt; Ucase(PlayerOneName)
&lt;/source&gt;
The above would not allow: Ryan and ryan
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

=== Save current top scores to the CSV file ===
A glaring omission from the code is the ability to save the current top scores back to the CSV file.  You might well be asked to implement this.  Let's first take a look at the code that reads the data from the file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Sub LoadTopScores(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)
        Dim Count As Integer
        Dim Count2 As Integer
        Dim LineFromFile As String
        Dim ValuesOnLine(2) As String
        FileOpen(1, &quot;../../HiScores.txt&quot;, OpenMode.Input)
        For Count = 1 To MaxSize
            ValuesOnLine(1) = &quot;&quot;
            ValuesOnLine(2) = &quot;&quot;
            LineFromFile = LineInput(1)
            Count2 = 0
            Do
                ValuesOnLine(1) = ValuesOnLine(1) + LineFromFile(Count2)
                Count2 = Count2 + 1
            Loop Until LineFromFile(Count2) = &quot;,&quot;
            Count2 = Count2 + 1
            Do
                ValuesOnLine(2) = ValuesOnLine(2) + LineFromFile(Count2)
                Count2 = Count2 + 1
            Loop Until Count2 = LineFromFile.Length
            TopScores(Count).Name = ValuesOnLine(1)
            TopScores(Count).Score = CInt(ValuesOnLine(2))
        Next
        FileClose(1)
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
There are three important things that you need to gain from this.

1. this line opens the file in read only mode and allocates it to file variable '''1''', we need another mode that writes to the file
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
FileOpen(1, &quot;../../HiScores.txt&quot;, OpenMode.Input)
&lt;/source&gt;

2. This code reads a line from the file and saves it into the LineFromFile string.  Notice the '''1''' is referring to the file variable.  This line is inside a loop that loops from on the variable Count, why is this?
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
LineFromFile = LineInput(1)
&lt;/source&gt;
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The code for the loop is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For Count = 1 To MaxSize
...
LineFromFile = LineInput(1)
...
Next
&lt;/source&gt;
This cycles through 1 to 4, meaning that the code reads all four lines of the text file.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

3. Finally we have some house keeping, where we need to close the file to make sure we free up resources
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
FileClose(1)
&lt;/source&gt;

Using these ideas we need to create a sub routine to save the files.  Let's get some pseudo code together:

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Pseudo Code of Save Data to File}}
sub savefiles(TopScores())
#open the text file for writing
#loop through 1 to 4 with count
##write TopScores(count) to the text file in a CSV format
#close the file
end sub
{{Robox/Close}}

But what real code can we use to do the above?

1. open file for writing, use Output instead of Input
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
FileOpen(1, &quot;../../HiScores.txt&quot;, OpenMode.Output)
&lt;/source&gt;
2. Print a line to a file instead of reading from it. Remember you will need a loop to write all 4 lines
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
PrintLine(1, &quot;...&quot;) 'write a line to file 1.  Make sure the line you write is in CSV format
&lt;/source&gt;
When you are writing to the file, remember that each line you are writing must have this format:
 &lt;name&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;score&gt;
 Norman,76
And you will get this data from the TopScore() parameter that you are passing to the sub routine

3. Closing the file is the same as before
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
FileClose(1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Try the code out yourself and see if you can get it to work:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Sub SaveTopScores(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)
        Dim Count As Integer

        FileOpen(1, &quot;../../HiScores.txt&quot;, OpenMode.Output)

        For Count = 1 To MaxSize
            PrintLine(1, TopScores(Count).Name &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; TopScores(Count).Score)
        Next

        FileClose(1)
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also achieve this by using a [[../../Programming#Reading.2FWriting_Files|stream writer]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Imports System.IO ' you might need this to use StreamWriter

    Sub SaveTopScores(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)
        Dim filewriter As StreamWriter
        Dim filename As String

        filename = &quot;../../HighScores.txt&quot;
        filewriter = New StreamWriter(filename)

        For Count = 1 To MaxSize
            filewriter.WriteLine(TopScores(Count).Name &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; TopScores(Count).Score)
        Next

        filewriter.Close()
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

===CSV file===
* add more fields to the CSV file when saving
* number of balls survived
** average score per ball

===Displaying scores===
You might be asked to display results in different ways, there are several potential questions, be ready for them all.
====Find the highest score====
To do this we need to add a new sub routine, let's call it DisplayHighestScore, and we'll need to pass it the TopScore data structure:

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Pseudo Code of displaying a top score}}
sub displaytopscore(TopScores())
#create a pointer to the topscore: hiscore
#set hiscore = 1 so that it points to the first element in TopScores
#go through each of the TopScores
##if topscores value is bigger than value being pointed to by hiscores
##then set hiscores to point to new top score
#print out the TopScores(hiscore)
end sub
{{Robox/Close}}
Try to code this solution yourself:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Sub DisplayHighestScore(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)
        Dim HighestRec As Integer 'stores the location of the highest record
        Dim Count as Integer = 1
        HighestRec = 1 'set the top score to the first person
        For Count = 1 To MaxSize
            'if subsequent people have higher scores, place them as top score
            If TopScores(Count).Score &gt; TopScores(HighestRec).Score Then
                HighestRec = Count
            End If
        Next
        Console.Writeline(&quot;Top Score: &quot; &amp; TopScores(HighestRec).Name &amp; &quot; : &quot; &amp; TopScores(HighestRec).Score)
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we have written the code to find out the top score we also need to adjust the code so that the program can call it, by using a menu option, the option 5.  See the code above on Resetting Top Scores to do this

Draw a trace table for the following:
 Michael, 45
 Dave, 78
 Gerald, 23
 Colin, 75
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | Count
! rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | HiScore
! colspan=&quot;8&quot; | TopScores
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 1 || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 2 || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 3 || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 4 
|-
! name || score || name || score || name || score || name || score
|-
| 1 || 1 || Michael || 45 || Dave || 78 || Gerald || 23 || Colin || 75
|-
| 2 || 2 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| 3 || 2 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| 4 || 2 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||  
|}

The output should be:
 Top Score: Dave : 78
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

What about these people:
 Michelle, 67
 Davina, 54
 Geraldine, 13
 Coleen, 67
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;

! colspan=&quot;8&quot; | TopScores
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 1 || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 2 || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 3 || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 4 
|-
! name || score || name || score || name || score || name || score

|-
| 4 || 1 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||  
|}

The output should be:
 Top Score: Michelle : 67
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

====Find the lowest score====
To do this we need to add a new sub routine, let's call it DisplayLowestScore, and we'll need to pass it the TopScore data structure:

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Pseudo Code of displaying a top score}}
sub displaylowestscore(TopScores())
#create a pointer to the topscore: hiscore
#set hiscore = 1 so that it points to the first element in TopScores
#go through each of the TopScores
##if topscores value is smaller than value being pointed to by hiscores
##then set hiscores to point to new lowest score
#print out the TopScores(hiscore)
end sub
{{Robox/Close}}
Try to code this solution yourself:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Sub DisplayLowestScore(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)
        Dim LowestRec As Integer 'stores the location of the highest record
        Dim Count as Integer = 1
        LowestRec = 1 'set the top score to the first person
        For Count = 1 To MaxSize
            'if subsequent people have higher scores, place them as top score
            If TopScores(Count).Score &lt; TopScores(LowestRec).Score Then
                LowestRec = Count
            End If
        Next
        Console.Writeline(&quot;Lowest Score: &quot; &amp; TopScores(LowestRec).Name &amp; &quot; : &quot; &amp; TopScores(LowestRec).Score)
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
Now we have written the code to find out the top score we also need to adjust the code so that the program can call it, by using a menu option, the option 5.  See the code above on Resetting Top Scores to do this

Draw a trace table for the following:
 Michael, 45
 Dave, 78
 Gerald, 23
 Colin, 45
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The output should be:
 Lowest Score: Gerald : 23
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

What about these people:
 Michelle, 67
 Davina, 13
 Geraldine, 54
 Coleen, 67
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The output should be:
 Lowest Score: Davina : 13
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

===Printing out all the scores in order===
You might be asked to print out all the high scores in order.  That means we need to order the items.  We can do this in two ways:
=====Bubble Sort=====
They could well ask you to perform a full sort on the high score table.  A bubble sort is a potential solution to doing this.  Take a look at the following pseudo code to perform a [[../../Problem_Solving#Bubble_Sort|bubble sort]].  You need to make your own version of this to sort all the data:

&lt;code&gt;
 '''procedure''' bubbleSort( A ''':''' list of sortable items )
   '''do'''
     swapped = false
     '''for each''' i '''in''' 1 '''to''' length(A) - 1 '''inclusive do:'''
       '''if''' A[i-1] &gt; A[i] '''then'''
         swap( A[i-1], A[i] )
         swapped = true
       '''end if'''
     '''end for'''
   '''while''' swapped
 '''end procedure'''
&lt;/code&gt;

Create a sub routine called bubbleSort.  It should have the following features:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| *TopScores passed as a Parameter, should you use byRef or byVal?
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
If you want to re-order the TopScores array you'll have to talk to the array directly by using ByRef. ByVal will only make a copy of the array so any changes made to re-order it will be lost when the subroutine finishes.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
*reorder the TopScores array
**look at the pseudo code above
**remember you are dealing with an array of records
*prints out the sorted array using: Console.Writeline(Count &amp; &quot;: &quot; &amp; TopScores(Count).Name &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; TopScores(Count).Name)
*called from menu item 5.

{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub bubbleSort(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)
  dim swapped as boolean
  dim temp as TTopScore
  'sort the elements
  Do
    Swapped = False
    For Count = 1 to MaxSize - 1
      If TopScores(Count).score &lt; TopScores(Count + 1).score Then
        temp.Name = TopScores(Count).Name
        temp.Score = TopScores(Count).Score
        TopScores(Count) = TopScores(Count + 1)
        TopScores(Count + 1).Name = temp.Name
        TopScores(Count + 1).Score = temp.Score
        Swapped = True
      End If
    Next
  Loop While Swapped = True
  
  'Print out the elements
  For Count = 1 to MaxSize
    Console.Writeline(Count &amp; &quot;: &quot; &amp; TopScores(Count).Name &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; TopScores(Count).Score)
  Next
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
Now we have written the code to order the scores we also need to adjust the code so that the program can call it, by using a menu option, the option 5.  See the code above on Resetting Top Scores to do this

|-
| False || 2 || 4 || || || || || || || || || || 
|-
| False || 3 || 4 || || || || || || || || || || 
|}

The output should be:
 1: Dave 78
 2: Colin 75
 3: Michael 45
 4: Gerald 23
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

=====Hard Coded=====
====List the number of balls survived ====
To do this we are going to need to implement a counting variable to keep track of the number of balls survived by each person and print this out when they are out:
 You are out.  Your final score was: 176
 You survived 34 balls
As this variable is a whole number we are going to use an integer to store it:

{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
A quick way to solve this is by adding the following as a local variable to the &lt;code&gt;PlayDiceGame&lt;/code&gt; procedure.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim BallsSurvived As Integer = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
We then need to make sure number BallsSurvived is set to 0 for each new batter.  At the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;PlayDiceGame&lt;/code&gt; procedure
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For PlayerNo = 1 To 2 ' give each player a turn
  CurrentPlayerScore = 0 'reset the score
  BallsSurvived = 0 'reset the number of balls survived
&lt;/source&gt;
One successfully surviving each ball we want to increase the number of balls survived 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Console.WriteLine()
  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press the Enter key to continue&quot;)
  Console.ReadLine()
  If PlayerOut = False Then
    BallsSurvived = BallsSurvived + 1
  End If
Loop Until PlayerOut '=true
&lt;/source&gt;
Finally we want to boast how many balls they survived 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
 Loop Until PlayerOut '=true
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;You are out.  Your final score was: &quot; &amp; CurrentPlayerScore)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;You survived &quot; &amp; BallsSurvived  &amp;&quot; balls&quot;)
 Console.WriteLine()
&lt;/source&gt;

We know the number fo runs through: &lt;code&gt;CurrentPlayerScore&lt;/code&gt; and we know the number of balls survived through: &lt;code&gt;BallsSurvived&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;You are out.  Your final score was: &quot; &amp; CurrentPlayerScore)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;You survived &quot; &amp; BallsSurvived  &amp;&quot; balls&quot;)

====Keeping track of sixes and fours====
You might be asked to put some code in place to keep track of how many sixes and fours were scored by each side.  Once each person has finished batting the score of that person should be displayed alongside the numbers of 4s and 6s:
 You are out.  Your final score was: 176
 You got: 2 sixes and 9 fours.
You can solve this in several ways so don't be worried if you have a different solution to the one below:

{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
A quick way to solve this is by adding the following as global variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Dim numofsixes As Integer
    Dim numoffours As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;
We then need to make sure they are set to 0 for each new batter.  At the beginning of the 
&lt;code&gt;PlayDiceGame&lt;/code&gt; procedure
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For PlayerNo = 1 To 2 ' give each player a turn
  CurrentPlayerScore = 0 'reset the score
  numofsixes = 0
  numoffours = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
We then need to catch each time that they score a four or a six. Remember that the a 3 on the die means four runs are scored, a 4 means six runs.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   If BowlDieResult &gt;= 1 And BowlDieResult &lt;= 4 Then
       RunsScored = CalculateRunsScored(BowlDieResult)
        If BowlDieResult = 4 Then
            numofsixes = numofsixes + 1
        End If
        If BowlDieResult = 3 Then
            numoffours = numoffours + 1
        End If
&lt;/source&gt;
Finally we need to display the score when they are finally out: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Loop Until PlayerOut '=true
Console.WriteLine(&quot;You are out.  Your final score was: &quot; &amp; CurrentPlayerScore)
Console.WriteLine(&quot;You got:&quot; &amp; numoffours &amp; &quot; fours and &quot; &amp; numofsixes &amp; &quot; sixes.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
----
Alternatively you could add the information on fours and sixes to the record definition:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Structure TTopScore
        Dim Name As String
        Dim Score As Integer
        Dim sixes As Integer '##
        Dim fours As Integer '##
    End Structure
&lt;/source&gt;
but the coding is a little more complex.  Give it a go if you're feeling brave.

===Changing the number of scores in stored in TopScores===

We'll need to adjust some things here
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Adjust the MAXSIZE to equal 5

We'll also need to add an extra set of values to the HiScores.txt file. As it will produce an error when loading them for the first time, as it will try to load a line that doesn't exist.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

===Adding a new way to be out===
Add a new way to be out: &quot;Run out&quot;.
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
To do this we are going to have to add another option to our appeal dice, making it 5 sided.
We are then going to have to build a new case for case 5 which will say &quot;Run out&quot;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

===Drawn games===
* put a routine in to handle what happens when a game is drawn

This isn't too hard...

     If PlayerOneScore = PlayerTwoScore Then
         Console.WriteLine(&quot;You have drawn!&quot;)
     End If

Handling how drawn scores update the high score list if there is only one current high score is less than the two drawn scores is much trickier! 

Monty,1  is the current lowest score.. so if both players score 2 runs and draw the game what scores should be recorded.

The program currently will record the high score for player one.... then when the routine checks it returns that player two doesn't have a high score (i.e. a score that is higher than any of the scores held in the topscores array). This is because the playerOne score has already been recorded.
There are only four possible solutions:
# Neither score is recorded
# Both scores are recorded, adding an extra record (element) to the array
# Concatenate both player names and assign the playerName field of the Topscores array of records
# Have only one score recorded BUT... select which of the players Names is added
:*Randomly
:*Using a prompt to allow the user to decide

===Playing the game===
* Randomise who goes first
====Manual dice validation====
If you play the game with real dice and you type in a string of letters instead of a number the program will crash. We need to '''catch''' this error  and fix it. By now you should be familiar with the Try Catch code
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Try
    something that might go wrong
Catch ex As Exception
    do something to fix or flag up the problem
End Try
&lt;/source&gt;
What line in the &lt;code&gt;RollBowlDie&lt;/code&gt; function is the problem occurring at?  There are two other areas that need fixing, where are they?
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Try
    BowlDieResult = Console.ReadLine 'line that causes the problem
Catch ex As Exception
    BowlDieResult = 0 'set the result to an acceptable error number so they don't score any points for this misbowl
End Try
&lt;/source&gt;

This is also a problem with the &lt;code&gt;RollAppealDie&lt;/code&gt; function
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Try
    AppealDieResult = Console.ReadLine 'line that causes the problem
Catch ex As Exception
    AppealDieResult = 0 'set the result to an acceptable error number so they don't score any points for this appeal
End Try
&lt;/source&gt;

This is also a problem with the &lt;code&gt;GetMenuChoice&lt;/code&gt; function
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Try
    OptionChosen = Console.ReadLine 'line that causes the problem
Catch ex As Exception
    OptionChosen = 0 'set the result to an acceptable error number so you don't accidentally launch any functions
End Try
&lt;/source&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
They might ask you to keep looping until with an error message until the user inputs a correct answer, to do this you'll need a loop:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim validation As Boolean = False
Do
  Try
   BowlDieResult = Console.ReadLine
   validation = True
  Catch
   Console.WriteLine(&quot;Invalid answer. Try again.&quot;)
  End Try
Loop Until validation = True

&lt;/source&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

{{BookCat}}

===Only one entry per person===
If the player's name is already in the TopScores array then update the value rather than adding someone more than once.

===The useless: DisplayCurrentPlayerNewScore ===
This subroutine isn't used (isn't called anywhere). They might ask you to call this function from the PlayDiceGame sub, or elsewhere in the code.

This code has one parameter: CurrentPlayerScore As Integer
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub DisplayCurrentPlayerNewScore(ByVal CurrentPlayerScore CurrentPlayerScore As Integer)
&lt;/source&gt;

Where might we use it?  Where is there similar functionality already?  Take a look at the PlayDiceGame code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  CurrentPlayerScore = CurrentPlayerScore + RunsScored
  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Your new score is: &quot; &amp; CurrentPlayerScore) 'this line performs the same function
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

So we could easily replace this line with the a call to the code above:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  CurrentPlayerScore = CurrentPlayerScore + RunsScored
  DisplayCurrentPlayerNewScore(CurrentPlayerScore) 'this line replaces the previous one
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

They might also ask you to do add a little to the complexity of the DisplayCurrentPlayerNewScore sub routine.  For example, make it so that each score displayed looks like:
 ###############
 #Current Score#
 ###############
 #    45       #
 ###############
Try and implement this

===Set limit on the number of balls===
In the current skeleton program, the players are permitted to carry on playing the game as long as the appeal dice is not greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, we may be asked to set a constraint on the maximum number of balls available for each player. 
In the following program code, I will demonstrate how the aforementioned problem can be tackled. The limit is typed in each time the game is played, making it possible for the players to set the limit in the way they want.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Function BallLimit() As Integer
        Dim NumberOfBalls As Integer = 0
        Console.Write(&quot;Do you want the game to have a limit on the number of balls?(Y/N) &quot;)
        Dim Choice As Char = Console.ReadLine
        If Choice = &quot;Y&quot; Then
            Do
                Console.WriteLine()
                Console.Write(&quot;Enter the maximum number of balls: &quot;)
                NumberOfBalls = Console.ReadLine
            Loop Until NumberOfBalls &gt; 0
        ElseIf Choice = &quot;N&quot; Then
            NumberOfBalls = 0
        End If
        BallLimit = NumberOfBalls
    End Function
&lt;/source&gt;
I create a function call BallLimit
The limit is represented by the variable NumberOfBalls
Firstly, the player is asked whether he wants to set a limit or not. If the answer is &quot;Y&quot;, he will have to enter the limit, which must be greater than 0 (it is not realistic to have no balls). Otherwise, the limit is set to 0
The value of the variable is copied to the integer BallLimit, which is then returned to the subroutine PlayDiceGame as you will see

The following code is written in the PlayDiceGame subroutine
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim x As Integer
Dim NumberOfBalls As Integer
NumberOfBalls = BallLimit()
&lt;/source&gt;
2 new variables are declared. The variable NumberOfBalls will take the value returned by the function BallLimit as stated above
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For PlayerNo = 1 To 2
            x = 0
            CurrentPlayerScore = 0
            PlayerOut = False
            Console.WriteLine()
            If PlayerNo = 1 Then
                Console.WriteLine(PlayerOneName &amp; &quot; is batting&quot;)
            Else
                Console.WriteLine(PlayerTwoName &amp; &quot; is batting&quot;)
            End If
&lt;/source&gt;
Each time a new player starts the game, the value of x is set to 0
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
 Do
                x = x + 1
                BowlDieResult = RollBowlDie(VirtualDiceGame)
                If BowlDieResult &gt;= 1 And BowlDieResult &lt;= 4 Then

&lt;/source&gt;
Each time the Do loop is excuted the value of x is incremented by 1. We must also change the condition of the Do loop as follow:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
            Loop Until x = NumberOfBalls or PlayerOut
&lt;/source&gt;
So how does this actually work?

If the player set a limit on the number of balls, say 10, the number is passed to the variable NumberOfBalls in the PlayDiceGame subroutine. Each time the player rolls the bowl dice, one ball is deemed to be lost. That's why the x is incremented by 1 each time. It is used to keep track of the number of balls that have been used so far. Therefore, when the value of x reaches 10, the loop will stop because the player runs out of balls. The player may be out before the limit is reached. In this case, the condition PlayerOut is executed.

If the player did not set a limit, the number 0 is passed to the variable NumberOfBalls in the PlayDiceGame subroutine. The value of x when it enters the first Do loop is x = 0 + 1 = 1. It will keep increasing thereafter and so x is always greater than 1. In other words, the condition x = NumberOfBalls will NEVER be satisfied in this case. PlayerOut is the only condition that may work. Therefore, there is no limit on the number of balls

== Linear Search ==
You need to implement a linear search:
 Please insert the name you are looking for: Kenny
to tell you either:
 Kenny scored 5.
or:
 We couldn't find a user named Kenny. Try again.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub LinearSearch(ByRef TopScores() As TTopScore)

Dim nameSought As String
Dim found As Boolean
Dim position As Integer

Do
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter the name you'd like to search for: &quot;)
    nameSought = Console.ReadLine()
    found = False
    position = 1

    Do         
        If TopScores(position).Name = nameSought Then
            found = True
        Else
            position = position + 1
        End If
    Loop Until position &gt; MaxSize Or found = True

    If found &lt;&gt; True Then
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;We couldn't find a user named &quot; &amp; nameSought &amp; &quot;. Try again.&quot;)
    Else
        Console.WriteLine(TopScores(position).Name &amp; &quot; scored &quot; &amp; TopScores(position).Score &amp; &quot;.&quot;)
    End If
Loop While found &lt;&gt; True 'loops back to re-entering a name if found = false.

End Sub

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ElectroMagnet/Coil of several Turns==
When a coil of several turns is connected with Electric source, Magnetic Field exist and has the same form as Magnetic Field of Natural Magnet. Current conducting Coil of several turns generates Electromagnetic Field of expanding Elliptical lines. 
: [[File:VFPt_cylindrical_magnet_thumb.svg|200px]]

==ElectroMagnet's Characteristics==
===Magnetic Poles===
The polarities of the electric source form a Magnetic Poles . The Positive Terminal correspond to North Pole and Negative Terminal correspond to South Pole . 
===Magnetic Field===
Magnetic Field is made up from Expanding Magnetic Field Lines running from North Pole to South Pole . The Magnetic Field Strength is directly proportional to Current in the coil and the inductance of the coil and can be calculated by mathematical formula
: B = L I

Where
: I is Current measured in Ampere
: L is Inductance measured in Henri

===Magnetic Field Force===
The Magnetic Field Force is directly proportional to Magnetic Filed Strenght and the length of the Magnetic Field Line and can be calculated by mathematical formula
: F = B l

===Magnetic Voltage Induction ===
Magnetic Voltage Induction on a Coil
: &lt;math&gt;B = L I&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dB}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} +  I \frac{dL}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} + 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dB}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

''Change of Magnetic Field strenght is proportional to Inductance of the coil and change in Current flow through the coil''


Magnetic Voltage Induction on a Coil's Turn
: &lt;math&gt;\phi = N B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt} = N \frac{dB}{dt} +  B \frac{dN}{dt} = N \frac{d\phi}{dt} + 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt} = N \frac{d\phi}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
''Change of Magnetic Flux strenght is proportional to Inductance of the turns and change in Magnetic Flux through the coil''

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;General Definitions of Inverse Trig Functions&lt;/center&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;Ordinary trigonometric functions yield a value after inputting an angle(1). Inverse trignometric functions yield an angle after inputting a value(2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\theta)=x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin (x)=\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen above, the notation for the inverse of a trigonometric function is to simply put the letters '''arc''' in front of the function name. Sometimes, just an '''a''' is used: '''a'''sin.  It may also be represented by a superscripted -1 over the function. For example, sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inverse functions exist for all 6 trigonometric functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motion Force==
Motion Force is a force used to set an object in motion

==Force's Formula==
Force to make an object move is calculated by
:; &lt;math&gt;F = m a &lt;/math&gt;
:; &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{v}{t} &lt;/math&gt;
:; &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{p}{t} &lt;/math&gt;


For any motion of speed v(t) caused by a force
: ''&lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{dv(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Photo Electric Effect==
Photo Electric Effect is a physical effect observed when there is a Photonic Light shine on object has the capability to release Free Electron into the environment . ie the effect of Light generates Electricity
: [[File:Photoelectric_effect.svg|200px]]
==Analysis==
Energy of Photonic Light 
: E = hf

Maximum Energy absorb by object
: E = hfo

Energy of Free Electron
: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;

From above
: &lt;math&gt;hf = h f_o + \frac{1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;hf - h f_o = \frac{1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;

In order to release a free electron the velocity of electron has to be greater than 0 . This only happens at
: f &gt; fo

and therefore
: &lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{m} (f - f_o)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
Only Photonic Lights of energy hf that has frequency greater than the fresh hold frequency of the material are capable of generate Electricity. Photonic Lights that has capability of generating Electricity includes Visible Light, UV, X, Gamma.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Relativity==
According to Newton Mass of any moving object remains the same regardless of speed travel . According to Einstein any moving object has Mass changes with speed travel

==Relativity Theory==
===Change in Mass relate to speed travels===
Speed of light is alsway constant , v = C . When matter moves at speed of light, matter no longer has mass . Observed fron Plank in experiment with Black Body Radiation
: &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;v = C&lt;/math&gt;

All matter moves at speed less than speed of light has a mass of m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;m = m_o&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;v &lt; C&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore for any matter moving at speed less than speed of light but not equal to the speed of light
: &lt;math&gt;m = m_o (1 + \frac{v}{C})&lt;/math&gt;

===Wave length of a Momentum===
Any momentum travels at speed of light C carries quantum energy &lt;math&gt;E = h \frac{C}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; will have a wavelength
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{C} \frac{1}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be easily proved
: &lt;math&gt;pC = h \frac{C}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{C} \frac{1}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

== Ingredients ==
* 1 whole large [[Cookbook:rabbit|rabbit]] (c. 2 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]])
* 2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:oil|oil]] (sunflower)
* 1 [[Cookbook:clove|clove]] [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* 300 [[Cookbook:g|g]] white [[Cookbook:potatoes|potatoes]] (peeled)
* 1 small [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]] (peeled and chopped)
* 800 [[Cookbook:g|g]] canned [[Cookbook:Tomato|crushed tomatoes]] or canned '[[Cookbook:Pelati|Pelati]]'
* 200 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] [[Cookbook:Red Wine|Red Wine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 2 or 3 [[Cookbook:bay leaf|Mediterranean bay leaf]] 
* [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco]] sauce, fresh ground [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]] and [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste
* 100 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:pea|peas]] (canned)
* 1/2 tsp mixed spice

== Procedure ==

===Garlic Fry the Rabbit Meat===

#Cut up the rabbit at the joints. Cut the rib section into 3 or 4 pieces, and divide the legs at all the joints. Split the head of the rabbit in half. The whole animal should be cut into about 10 or 12 pieces so they are large and chunky, but small enough that they can be easily manipulated with large [[Cookbook:Utensil|spoon]]. Remove and keep internal organs apart.
#[[Cookbook:Dice|Dice]] the garlic very finely. Heat the oil in a large [[Cookbook:frying pan|frying pan]]. Heat some of the garlic in the oil. Add some rabbit pieces and cook through.
#Remove cooked meat from the pan and place in a large container. Cook the rest of the meat in the same way in batches, adding some garlic with every batch. The meat should be well cooked (so that it can be eaten) but not very brown.
#Finally fry the internal organs whole in the same oil, until well cooked. Take some of the smaller pieces of meat without bone and add them to the organs. Keep these apart from the main meat.

===Prepare the Stew===

#Cut the potatoes into large irregular chunks, slightly smaller than the pieces of meat.
#In a [[Cookbook:Stock pot|stock pot]], place the fried rabbit, the potatoes, the chopped carrot, the tomato pulp, wine, sugar and laurel leaves. Add salt, pepper, mixed spice and Tabasco carefully. Cover and [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] on a [[Cookbook:low flame|low flame]] for 4 hours. Stir occasionally during the first hour.
#Once done, add the peas, and cook until tender (about 10 minutes).

==Notes==

The best stew is slow cooked on the smallest flame for as long as possible. Using a higher flame you can reduce cooking time to 2 hours, but this is not a dish that should be rushed. If you have the time you can even cook it for 6 hours on a camping type flame for an even richer taste.

==Serving==
The typical Maltese rabbit stew is served in a few different ways depending on the situation, family tradition and locality. One way is to simply serve a plate of stew with [[Cookbook:Maltese bread|Maltese bread]] for dipping in the sauce. 
Sometimes the internal organs and some small bits of boneless meat are served without any garnish a small plate with salt and pepper and fresh sour-dough bread as a special treat for children as they wait for this time consuming dish to be prepared.
A full '[[mt:Fenkata|Fenkata]]', Maltese word meaning 'Rabbit based dinner party' could be as follow:
# Start with Maltese galletti, Gbejniet, Zalzett, bigilla, and the internal organs of the rabbit as [[Cookbook:entrée|entrées]].
# For second plate serve [[Cookbook:Spaghetti|Spaghetti]] (typically slightly overcooked in Maltese cuisine) with a covering of sauce from the stew.
# Serve the rabbit meat and potatoes (with little sauce) as main course, always accompanied by bread, and a strong red wine.
# Serve Maltese style [[Cookbook:Trifle|Trifle]] or [[Cookbook:Traditional Maltese Ice Cream|Traditional Maltese Ice Cream]] (also called Gelat tan-Nanna) for [[Cookbook:dessert|dessert]].
# Round off with [[Cookbook:peanut|peanuts]] in the shell and [[Bartending/Alcohol/Anise_liqueur#Anisette|Anisette]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Of notable interest in the East European theatre after WWII is the Polish playwright Sławomir Mrożek (1930-?) and his family saga, &quot;Tango&quot; (1964).

[[File:Slawomir Mrozek.JPG|thumb|Slawomir Mrozek presented a young man resentful at his father for his liberal views, 2006]]

==&quot;Tango&quot;==

&quot;Tango&quot;. Time: 1960s. Place: Poland.

[[File:Tango dance 01.jpg|thumb|Tango dance maneuver]]

Arthur is angry at seeing his great-uncle, Eugene, play cards instead of writing his memoirs. To punish him, he places a bird-cage over his head. He also commands his grandmother, Eugenia, to lie inside a coffin with lit candles beside it. Arthur next scolds his father, Stomil, for walking about with his pajama bottom improperly buttoned up, but he ignores him. The father reminds him it is thanks to his generation that he is so free, but Arthur regrets such freedom, &quot;in this brothel where nothing works because everyone can do whatever he pleases&quot;. But to Stomil, &quot;every man is entitled to his own kind of happiness&quot;. Arthur continues to speak of this theme to Eugene. &quot;Don't you realize that, precisely because everything is possible, nothing is possible anymore?&quot; he asks. The loss of tradition and convention have made revolt impossible. Considering himself an artist, Stomil presents to the family a puppet-play on Adam and Eve. After a few exchanges, the lights go out and a gun-shot is heard, with the result that he is the only one amused. Arthur challenges his father by announcing that a supposed friend of the family, Eddie, sleeps with his wife, Eleanor. But after Stomil proposes to shoot him, Arthur discovers his father playing cards with both. Having failed to do anything with his father, Arthur next attempts to turn the clock back by convincing Ala to marry him. She hesitates but finally accepts. He asks for Eugenia's blessing, but she hesitates. When her brother, Eugene, glad of this turn of events, threatens to shoot her unless she does, she finally yields. On the wedding day, there is a newly discovered order in the household, though Stomil remains doubtful. &quot;Formalism will never free you from chaos,&quot; he prophesies to Eugene.  Eleanor is also glad of this turn of events, still enthusiastic about Eddie acting as both her servant and her lover. But at the last moment, Arthur no longer wants to go through with the ceremony, empty of any meaning, still looking for an idea to build an entire life on. A sick Eugenia enters the coffin a second time, but this time to die. This gives Arthur the idea that death is the best idea of all. He begins by condemning Eugene to death and is about to enforce it when Eddie strikes him from behind and kills him. In view of the family's weakness to decide on anything, it is now Eddie's turn to command. To celebrate the coming of a new family order based on the old, he dances a tango with Eugene.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In animals, when there is an oversupply of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triacylglycerol. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triacylglycerol, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triacylglycerols that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.

The synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is introduced into the fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid as well as the triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.
Triacylglycerol synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl-CoAs are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerol.

Terpenes and isoprenoids, including the carotenoids, are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol&lt;Ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipid&amp;oldid=424764580&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biosynthesis of lipids==
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|right|600px|Human [[steroidogenesis]], showing testosterone near bottom.]]
Steroid biosynthesis is an anabolic metabolic pathway that produces steroids from simple precursors. This pathway is carried out in different ways in animals than in many other organisms, making the pathway a common target for antibiotics and other anti-infective drugs. In addition, steroid metabolism in humans is the target of cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins.
It starts in the mevalonate pathway in humans, with Acetyl-CoA as building blocks, which form DMAPP and IPP. In following steps, DMAPP and IPP form lanosterol, the first steroid. Further modification belongs to the succeeding steroidogenesis.
Steroidogenesis is the biological process by which steroids are generated from cholesterol and transformed into other steroids. The pathways of steroidogenesis differ between different species, but the pathways of human steroidogenesis are shown in the figure.
Products of steroidogenesis include:
androgens
testosterone
estrogens and progesterone
corticoids
cortisol
aldosterone

'''Biosynthesis of testosterone'''
Like other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from cholesterol (see figure to the right). The first step in the biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the sidechain of cholesterol by CYP11A, a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3-β-HSD to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C-17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.
The largest amounts of testosterone (&gt;95%) are produced by the testes in men. It is also synthesized in far smaller quantities in women by the thecal cells of the ovaries, by the placenta, as well as by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex in both sexes. In the testes, testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells. The male generative glands also contain Sertoli cells which require testosterone for spermatogenesis. Like most hormones, testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood where much of it is transported bound to a specific plasma protein, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Testosterone&amp;oldid=425129619&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Anabolic steroids and its misuse''' Anabolic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate bone growth and appetite, induce male puberty, and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and AIDS. Anabolic steroids also produce increases in muscle mass and physical strength, and are consequently used in sport and bodybuilding to enhance strength or physique. The known side effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased Low density lipoprotein and decreased High density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.
AAS user in sports began in October 1954, John Ziegler, a doctor who treated American athletes, went to Vienna with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physicist who, over &quot;a few drinks&quot;, repeatedly asked &quot;What are you giving your boys?&quot; When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone.
Returning to America, Ziegler tried weak doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce but there were side-effects. Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone, (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the US in 1958 by Ciba.
The results were impressive—so impressive that lifters began taking ever more. Steroids spread to other sports where bulk mattered. Paul Lowe, a former running back with the San Diego Chargers American football team, told a California legislative committee on drug abuse in 1970: &quot;We had to take them [steroids] at lunchtime. He [an official] would put them on a little saucer and prescribed them for us to take them and if not he would suggest there might be a fine.&quot;
Olympic statistics show the weight of shot putters grew 14 per cent between 1956 and 1972, whereas steeplechasers grew 7.6 per cent. The gold medallist pentathlete Mary Peters said: &quot;A medical research team in the United States attempted to set up extensive research into the effects of steroids on weightlifters and throwers, only to discover that there were so few who weren't taking them that they couldn't establish any worthwhile comparisons.&quot;
In 1984, Jay Silvester, a former four-time Olympian and 1972 silver medalist in the discus who was then with the physical education department of Brigham Young University in the U.S., questioned competitors at that year's Olympics. The range of steroid use he found ranged from 10 mg a day to 100 mg&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolic_steroid&amp;oldid=425234650&lt;/ref&gt;.
{{quotation|A famous case of illicit AAS use in a competition was Canadian Ben Johnson's victory in the 100 m at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He subsequently failed the drug test when stanozolol was found in his urine. He later admitted to using the steroid as well as Dianabol, Testosterone Cypionate, Furazabol, and human growth hormone amongst other things. Johnson was therefore stripped of his gold medal as well as recognition of what had been a world-record performance. Carl Lewis was then promoted one place to take the Olympic gold title. Lewis had also run under the current world record time and was therefore recognized as the new record holder, however, in 2003, Dr. Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to Sports Illustrated which revealed that some 100 American athletes who failed drug tests and should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics were nevertheless cleared to compete. Among those athletes was Carl Lewis. Lewis then broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had tested positive for banned substances but claiming he was just one of &quot;hundreds&quot; of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has now acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the Seoul games two months later.
Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. &quot;For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there's absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete. You have to believe governing bodies are doing what they are supposed to do. And it is obvious they did not&quot;, said former American sprinter and 1984 Olympic champion, Evelyn Ashford.}}
'''Biosynthesis of cortisol'''

Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. (The name cortisol is derived from cortex.) While the adrenal cortex also produces aldosterone (in the zona glomerulosa) and some sex hormones (in the zona reticularis), cortisol is its main secretion. The medulla of the adrenal gland lies under the cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation.
The synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); ACTH production is in turn stimulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the STAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory) protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC (side chain cleavage enzyme).

===Cholestrol Synthesis===
All animal cells manufacture cholesterol with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 20–25% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs. Synthesis within the body starts with one molecule of acetyl CoA and one molecule of acetoacetyl-CoA, which are dehydrated to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA). This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. This step is the regulated, rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for the statin drugs (HMG-CoA reductase competitive inhibitors).
Mevalonate is then converted to 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate in three reactions that require ATP. This molecule is decarboxylated to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which is a key metabolite for various biological reactions. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum. Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol. Finally, lanosterol is then converted to cholesterol.
Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cholesterol&amp;oldid=425127311&lt;/ref&gt;.

Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP-cleavage-activating protein) and Insig1. When cholesterol levels fall, Insig-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, allowing the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus, where SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 and -2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low. The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to bind to the SRE (sterol regulatory element), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The former scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol. A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.
Cholesterol synthesis can be turned off when cholesterol levels are high, as well. HMG CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain functions to sense signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteosome. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cholesterol&amp;oldid=425127311&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Biosynthesis of isoprenoids or terpenoids===
[[Image:Sterol synthesis.svg|thumb|right|350px|Simplified version of the steroid synthesis pathway with the terpenoid intermediates [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP), [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP), [[geranyl pyrophosphate]] (GPP), and [[squalene]] shown. Some intermediates are omitted for clarity.]]


There are two metabolic pathways of creating terpenoids:

Mevalonic acid pathway
Many organisms manufacture terpenoids through the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the pathway that also produces cholesterol. The reactions take place in the cytosol. The pathway was discovered in the 1950s.

MEP/DOXP pathway
The 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP pathway), also known as [non-mevalonate pathway] or mevalonic acid-independent pathway, takes place in the plastids of plants and apicomplexan protozoa, as well as in many bacteria. It was discovered in the late 1980s.
Pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are converted by DOXP synthase (Dxs) to 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, and by DOXP reductase (Dxr, IspC) to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP). The subsequent three reaction steps catalyzed by 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (YgbP, IspD), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (YchB, IspE), and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (YgbB, IspF) mediate the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEcPP). Finally, MEcPP is converted to (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMB-PP) by HMB-PP synthase (GcpE, IspG), and HMB-PP is converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by HMB-PP reductase (LytB, IspH).
IPP and DMAPP are the end-products in either pathway, and are the precursors of isoprene, monoterpenoids (10-carbon), diterpenoids (20-carbon), carotenoids (40-carbon), chlorophylls, and plastoquinone-9 (45-carbon). Synthesis of all higher terpenoids proceeds via formation of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP).
Although both pathways, MVA and MEP, are mutually exclusive in most organisms, interactions between them have been reported in plants and few bacteria species.

&lt;/TABLE&gt;
The classical [mevalonate pathway or [[HMG-CoA reductase]] pathway  is an important cellular metabolic pathway present in all higher eukaryotes and many bacteria. It is important for the production of IPP and DMAPP that serve as the basis for the biosynthesis of molecules used in processes as diverse as protein [[prenylation]], [[cell membrane]] maintenance, [[hormones]], [[lipid anchored protein|protein anchoring]] and [[glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]].

In contrast to the classical [[mevalonate pathway]] of isoprenoid biosynthesis, [[plant]]s and [[apicomplexa]]n [[protozoa]] such as [[malaria]] parasites have the ability to produce their [[isoprenoids]] ([[terpenoids]]) using an alternative pathway, the '''non-mevalonate pathway''', which takes place in their [[plastid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lichtenthaler H |title=The 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants |journal=Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol |volume=50 |issue= |pages=47–65 |year=1999 |pmid=15012203 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.50.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most [[bacteria]] including important pathogens such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' synthesize IPP and DMAPP via the non-mevalonate pathway.

[[Image:Non-mevalonate pathway.svg|600px|center]]

==Biosynthesis Eicosanoids==

Two families of [[enzymes]] catalyze fatty acid oxygenation to produce the eicosanoids:
* [[Cyclooxygenase]], or COX, generates the [[prostanoids]].
* [[Lipoxygenase]], or LOX, in several forms. 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) generates the [[leukotrienes]].

Eicosanoids are not stored within cells, but are [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] as required.
They derive from the fatty acids that make up the [[cell membrane]] and [[Nuclear envelope|nuclear membrane]].

Eicosanoid biosynthesis begins when cell is activated by mechanical trauma, cytokines, growth factors or other stimuli.
(The stimulus may even be an eicosanoid from a neighboring cell; the pathways are complex.)  This triggers the release of a [[phospholipase]] at the [[cell membrane]].
The phospholipase travels to the [[nuclear membrane]].
There, the phospholipase catalyzes ester [[hydrolysis]] of phospholipid (by [[Phospholipase A2|A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) or diacylglycerol (by [[phospholipase C]]).
This frees a 20-carbon [[essential fatty acid]].  This hydrolysis appears to be the [[rate-determining step]] for eicosanoid formation.

The fatty acids may be released by any of several phospholipases.
Of these, type IV cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the key actor, as cells lacking cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are generally devoid of eicosanoid synthesis.  The phospholipase
cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is specific for phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at the [[Phospholipase A2|SN2]] position.
Interestingly, cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may also release the lysophospholipid that becomes [[platelet-activating factor]].&lt;ref name=University&gt;{{cite web

===Peroxidation and reactive oxygen species===
Next, the free fatty acid is oxygenated along any of several pathways; see the ''Pathways'' table.  The eicosanoid pathways (''via'' [[lipoxygenase]] or [[Cyclooxygenase|COX]]) add [[Oxygen|molecular oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Although the fatty acid is [[Symmetry|symmetric]], the resulting eicosanoids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]; the oxidation proceeds with high [[stereospecificity]].

The oxidation of lipids is hazardous to cells, particularly when close to the nucleus.
There are elaborate mechanisms to prevent unwanted oxidation.
COX, the lipoxygenases and the phospholipases are tightly controlled&amp;mdash;there are at least eight proteins activated to coordinate generation of leukotrienes.
Several of these exist in multiple [[isoforms]].&lt;ref name=Soberman&gt;{{cite journal

Oxidation by either COX or lipoxygenase releases [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) and the initial products in eicosanoid generation are themselves highly reactive [[peroxide]]s.

The oxidation in eicosanoid generation is compartmentalized; this limits the peroxides' damage.
The enzymes which are biosynthetic for eicosanoids (e.g. [[transferase|glutathione-S-transferases]], epoxide [[hydrolase]]s and [[carrier protein]]s) belong to families whose functions are largely involved with cellular detoxification.
This suggests that eicosanoid signaling may have evolved from the detoxification of ROS.

The cell must realize some benefit from generating lipid hydroperoxides close-by its nucleus.

=== Biosynthesis of Prostanoid ===
[[Cyclooxygenase]] (''COX'')  catalyzes the conversion of the free essential fatty acids to prostanoids by a two-step process.  
In the first step, two molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are added as two peroxide linkages and a 5-member carbon ring is forged near the middle of the fatty acid chain.  This forms the short-lived, unstable intermediate Prostaglandin G (PGG).  
One of the peroxide linkages sheds a single oxygen, forming PGH.  ''(See diagrams and more detail at [[Cyclooxygenase]]).''  
All other prostanoids originate from PGH (as PGH&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, PGH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or PGH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). 

Figure 1 shows how PGH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (derived from [[Arachidonic acid]])  is converted:
* By [[PGE synthetase]] into PGE (which in turn is converted into PGF)
* By [[PGD synthetase]] into PGD
* By [[Prostacyclin synthase]] into [[prostacyclin]] (PGI2)
* By [[Thromboxane synthase]] into [[thromboxane]]s


[[File:Prostaglandin F1.pdf|thumb|Prostaglandin F1]]

[[File:Prostaglandin E1.pdf|thumb|Prostaglandin E1]]


The three classes of prostanoids have distinctive rings in the center of the molecule.  They differ in their structures.  The PGH compounds (parents to all the rest) have a 5-carbon ring, bridged by two oxygens (a [[peroxide]].)   The derived prostaglandins contain a single, unsaturated 5-carbon ring.  In prostacyclins, this ring is conjoined to another oxygen-containing ring.  In thromboxanes the ring becomes a 6-member ring with one oxygen.

Production of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in bacterial and viral infections appear to be stimulated by certain cytokines, e.g., [[interleukin-1]].&lt;ref name=University &gt;{{cite web

  &lt;/ref&gt;

===Leukotrienes pathway===

Leukotrienes are synthesized in the cell from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. The catalytic mechanism involves the insertion of an oxygen moiety at a specific position in the arachidonic acid backbone.
The lipoxygenase pathway is active in leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils. When such cells are activated, arachidonic acid is liberated from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, and donated by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) to 5-lipoxygenase.
5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) uses FLAP to convert arachidonic acid into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which spontaneously reduces to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). The enzyme 5-LO acts again on 5-HETE to convert it into leukotriene A4 (LTA4), an unstable epoxide.
In cells equipped with LTA4 hydrolase, such as neutrophils and monocytes, LTA4 is converted to the dihydroxy acid leukotriene LTB4, which is a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils acting at BLT1 and BLT2 receptors on the plasma membrane of these cells.
In cells that express LTC4 synthase, such as mast cells and eosinophils, LTA4 is conjugated with the tripeptide glutathione to form the first of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes, LTC4. Outside the cell, LTC4 can be converted by ubiquitous enzymes to form successively LTD4 and LTE4, which retain biological activity.
The cysteinyl-leukotrienes act at their cell-surface receptors CysLT1 and CysLT2 on target cells to contract bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, to increase permeability of small blood vessels, to enhance secretion of mucus in the airway and gut, and to recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation.
Both LTB4 and the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are partly degraded in local tissues, and ultimately become inactive metabolites in the liver.
{{quotation|'''Cyclooxygenase (COX)'''
COX converts arachidonic acid (AA, an ω-6 PUFA) to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of the series-2 prostanoids. The enzyme contains two active sites: a heme with peroxidase activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2, and a cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2). The reaction proceeds through H atom abstraction from arachidonic acid by a tyrosine radical generated by the peroxidase active site. Two O2 molecules then react with the arachidonic acid radical, yielding PGG2.
At present, three COX isoenzymes are known: COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3. COX-3 is a splice variant of COX-1, which retains intron one and has a frameshift mutation; thus some prefer the name COX-1b or COX-1 variant (COX-1v).[3]
Different tissues express varying levels of COX-1 and COX-2. Although both enzymes act basically in the same fashion, selective inhibition can make a difference in terms of side-effects. COX-1 is considered a constitutive enzyme, being found in most mammalian cells. COX-2, on the other hand, is undetectable in most normal tissues. It is an inducible enzyme, becoming abundant in activated macrophages and other cells at sites of inflammation. More recently, it has been shown to be upregulated in various carcinomas and to have a central role in tumorigenesis.
Both COX-1 and -2 (also known as PGHS-1 and -2) also oxygenate two other essential fatty acids – DGLA (ω-6) and EPA (ω-3) – to give the series-1 and series-3 prostanoids, which are less inflammatory than those of series-2. DGLA and EPA are competitive inhibitors with AA for the COX pathways. This inhibition is a major mode of action in the way that dietary sources of DGLA and EPA (e.g., borage, fish oil) reduce inflammation.The use of anabolic steroids is now banned by all major sporting bodies, including the ATP, WTA, ITF, International Olympic Committee, FIFA, UEFA, all major professional golf tours, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the European Athletic Association, WWE and the NFL. However drug testing can be wildly inconsistent and, in some instances, has gone unenforced.}}

==Bile acid and its synthesis==
Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the ''bile of mammals''. Bile salts are bile acids compounded with a cation, usually sodium. In humans, the salts of taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid (derivatives of cholic acid) represent approximately eighty percent of all bile salts. The two major bile acids are cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids, glycine and taurine conjugates, and 7-alpha-dehydroxylated derivatives (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) are all found in human intestinal bile. An increase in bile flow is exhibited with an increased secretion of bile acids. The main function of bile acid is to facilitate the formation of micelles, which promotes processing of dietary fat.

Bile acids are made in the liver by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. They are conjugated with taurine or the amino acid glycine, or with a sulfate or a glucuronide, and are then stored in the gallbladder, which concentrates the salts by removing the water. In humans, the [[rate limiting step]] is the addition of a hydroxyl group on position 7 of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme [[CYP7A1|cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase]]. Upon eating a meal, the contents of the gallbladder are secreted into the [[intestine]], where bile acids serve the purpose of emulsifying dietary fats.  Bile acids serve other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate catabolites from the liver, emulsifying lipids and fat soluble vitamins in the intestine to form micelles that can be transported via the lacteal system, and aiding in the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract. 

''Bile acid'' refers to the protonated (-COOH) form. ''Bile salt'' refers to the deprotonated or ionized (-COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) form. Conjugated bile acids are more efficient at emulsifying fats because at intestinal pH, they are more ionized than unconjugated bile acids.&lt;ref&gt;'Essentials of Medical Biochemistry, Lieberman, Marks and Smith, eds, p432, 2007'&lt;/ref&gt;  

Synthesis of bile acids is a major route of cholesterol metabolism in most species other than humans. The body produces about 800 mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis. In total about 20-30 grams of bile acids are secreted into the [[intestine]] daily. About 90% of excreted bile acids are reabsorbed by [[active transport]] in the [[ileum]] and recycled in what is referred to as the [[enterohepatic circulation]] which moves the bile salts from the intestinal system back to the liver and the gallbladder. This allows a low rate of daily synthesis, but high secretion to the digestive system. Bile is also used to break down fat globules into tiny droplets. Bile from slaughtered animals can be used in the preparation of soap.

==Lipids in membrane==
[[File:Space-Filling Model Sphingomyelin and Cholesterol.jpg|thumb|300px|Space-filling models of sphingomyelin (a) and cholesterol (b).]]
'''Phospholipids''' 
Phospholipids and glycolipids consist of two long, nonpolar ([[hydrophobic]]) [[hydrocarbon chain]]s linked to a [[hydrophilic]] head group. 

The heads of phospholipids are &lt;span style=&quot;color: red; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;phosphorylated&lt;/span&gt; and they consist of either:
:*&lt;span style=&quot;color: green; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Glycerol&lt;/span&gt; (and hence the name '''phosphoglycerides''' given to this group of lipids).
:*&lt;span style=&quot;color: CornflowerBlue; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sphingosine&lt;/span&gt; (with only one member - [[sphingomyelin]]).

'''Glycolipids'''
The heads of glycolipids contain a [[sphingosine]] with &lt;span style=&quot;color: Goldenrod; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;one or several sugar units&lt;/span&gt; attached to it. The hydrophobic chains belong either to:
:*two [[fatty acid]]s - in the case of the phosphoglycerides.
:*one FA and the hydrocarbon tail of [[sphingosine]] - in the case of sphingomyelin and the glycolipids.

'''Fatty acids'''
The fatty acids in phospho- and glycolipids usually contain an even number of [[carbon]] atoms, typically between 14 and 24. The 16- and 18-carbon FAs are the most common ones. FAs may be saturated or unsaturated, with the configuration of the [[double bond]]s nearly always ''cis''. The length and the degree of [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturation]] of FAs chains have a profound effect on membranes' [[fluidity]].

'''Phosphoglycerides'''
In phosphoglycerides, the hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-2 of glycerol are esterified to the carboxyl groups of the FAs. The C-3 hydroxyl group is esterified to phosphoric acid. The resulting compound, called [[phosphatidate]], is the simplest [[phosphoglycerate]]. Only small amounts of phosphatidate are present in membranes. However, it is a key intermediate in the [[biosynthesis]] of the other phosphoglycerides.

'''Sphingosine''' 
Sphingosine is an amino alcohol that contains a long, [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] hydrocarbon chain. In sphingomyelin and glycolipids, the amino group of sphingosine is linked to FAs by an [[amide]] bond. In sphingomyelin the primary [[hydroxyl]] group of sphingosine is esterified to phosphoryl [[choline]]. In glycolipids, the sugar component is attached to this group. The simplest glycolipid is [[cerebroside]], in which there is only one sugar residue, either [[glucose|Glc]] or [[galactose|Gal]]. More complex glycolipids, such as [[ganglioside]]s, contain a branched chain of as many as seven sugar residues.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Sphingosine is synthesized from palmitoyl CoA and serine in a condensation required to yield [[dehydrosphingosine]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Image:Sphingosine synthesis corrected.png||900px|Sphingosine synthesis]] 

Dehydrosphingosine is then reduced by [[NADPH]] to [[dihydrosphingosine]] (sphinganine), and finally oxidized by [[FAD]] to sphingosine.

There is no direct route of synthesis from [[sphinganine]] to sphingosine; it has to be acylated first to [[dihydroceramide]], which is then dehydrogenated to ceramide. Sphingosine is formed via degradation of sphingolipid in the lysosome.

'''Cholesterol'''

[[Cholesterol]] occurs naturally in [[eukaryote]] [[cell membranes]] where it is bio-synthesised from [[mevalonate]] via a squalene cyclisation of [[terpenoids]]. It associated preferentially with [[sphingolipids]] (see diagram) in cholesterol-rich [[lipid rafts]] areas of the membranes in eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;

===Archaeal membranes===

Archaeal membranes are made of molecules that differ strongly from those in other life forms, showing that archaea are related only distantly to bacteria and eukaryotes.&lt;ref name=Koga/&gt; In all organisms [[cell membrane]]s are made of molecules known as [[phospholipid]]s. These molecules possess both a [[chemical polarity|polar]] part that dissolves in water (the [[phosphate]] &quot;head&quot;), and a &quot;greasy&quot; non-polar part that does not (the lipid tail). These dissimilar parts are connected by a [[glycerol]] moiety. In water, phospholipids cluster, with the heads facing the water and the tails facing away from it. The major structure in cell membranes is a double layer of these phospholipids, which is called a [[lipid bilayer]]&lt;Ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Archaea&amp;oldid=423838280&lt;/ref&gt;.

These phospholipids are unusual in four ways:

* Bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-[[ester]] [[lipid]]s, whereas archaea have membranes composed of glycerol-[[ether lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{

In ester lipids this is an [[ester|ester bond]], whereas in ether lipids this is an [[ether|ether bond]]. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very [[acid]]ic or [[alkaline]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{

* The [[stereochemistry]] of the glycerol moiety is the reverse of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called the right-handed and left-handed forms; in chemistry these are called ''[[enantiomer]]s''. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, a right-handed glycerol molecule generally cannot be used or made by [[enzyme]]s adapted for the left-handed form. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, suggesting an early split from the other two domains.&lt;ref name=Koga&gt;{{

==Terpene biosynthesis== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Otto Wallach]] --&gt;
[[Image:Isoprene structure.png|thumb|right|100px|Isoprene]]
[[Image:Mevalonate_pathway.png|thumb|400px|right|Mevalonate pathway]]
Terpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of [[isoprene]], which has the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.  The basic molecular formulae of terpenes are multiples of that, (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; where n is the number of linked isoprene units. This is called the '''isoprene rule''' or the ''C5 rule''. The isoprene units may be linked together &quot;head to tail&quot; to form linear chains or they may be arranged to form rings. One can consider the isoprene unit as one of nature's common building blocks.

Isoprene itself does not undergo the building process, but rather activated forms, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP or also isopentenyl diphosphate) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP or also dimethylallyl diphosphate), are the components in the biosynthetic pathway.  IPP is formed from [[acetyl-CoA]] via the intermediacy of mevalonic acid in the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]]. An alternative, totally unrelated biosynthesis pathway of IPP is known in some bacterial groups and the plastids of plants, the so-called MEP(2-Methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate)-pathway, which is initiated from C5-sugars. In both pathways, IPP is isomerized to DMAPP by the enzyme isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase.

As chains of isoprene units are built up, the resulting terpenes are classified sequentially by size as hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes,  diterpenes, sesterterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes&lt;Ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terpene&amp;oldid=425141133&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Mevalonate pathway and Statins===

The '''mevalonate pathway''' or '''HMG-CoA reductase  pathway''' or '''mevalonate-dependent (MAD) route''' or '''isoprenoid pathway''', is an important [[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[metabolic pathway]] present in all higher eukaryotes and many bacteria. It is important for the production of [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP) and [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP), which serve as the basis for the biosynthesis of molecules used in processes as diverse as [[terpenoid]] synthesis, protein [[prenylation]], [[cell membrane]] maintenance, hormones, [[lipid anchored protein|protein anchoring]], and [[glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]]. It is also a part of steroid biosynthesis&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mevalonate_pathway&amp;oldid=404974883&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several key enzymes can be activated through DNA transcription al regulation on activation of SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and -2). This intracellular sensor detects low cholesterol levels and stimulates endogenous production by the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, as well as increasing lipoprotein uptake by up-regulating the [[LDL receptor|LDL-receptor]]. Regulation of this pathway is also achieved by controlling the rate of translation of the mRNA, degradation of reductase and phosphorylation.

[[Image:HMG-CoA reductase pathway.png|thumb|right|400px|The HMG-CoA reductase pathway, which is blocked by statins via inhibiting the rate limiting enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]].]]
In 1971, Akira Endo, a Japanese biochemist working for the drug company Sankyo, began the search for a cholesterol-lowering drug. Research had already shown that cholesterol is mostly manufactured by the body in the liver, using an enzyme known as HMG-CoA reductase. Endo and his team reasoned that certain microorganisms may produce inhibitors of the enzyme to defend themselves against other organisms, as mevalonate is a precursor of many substances required by organisms for the maintenance of their cell wall (ergosterol) or cytoskeleton (isoprenoids). The first agent they identified was mevastatin (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum.
Journalist John Simons writes in Fortune magazine that word of the discovery spread quickly through the medical community, as did rumors linking the statin to tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death in laboratory dogs. Several drug companies were put off by these reports, but P. Roy Vagelos, the chief scientist and later CEO of Merck &amp; Co, showed an interest, and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975. By 1978, Merck had isolated lovastatin (mevinolin, MK803) from the fungus Aspergillus terreus, first marketed in 1987 as Mevacor.
A link between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease, known as the lipid hypothesis, had already been suggested. Cholesterol is the main constituent of atheroma, the fatty lumps in the wall of arteries that occur in atherosclerosis and, when ruptured, cause the vast majority of heart attacks. Treatment consisted mainly of dietary measures such as a low-fat diet, and poorly tolerated medicines such as clofibrate, cholestyramine and nicotinic acid. Cholesterol researcher Daniel Steinberg writes that while the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial of 1984 demonstrated that cholesterol lowering could significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and angina, physicians, including cardiologists, remained largely unconvinced.
To market statins effectively, Merck had to convince the public about the dangers of high cholesterol, and doctors that statins were safe and would extend lives. As a result of public campaigns, people became familiar with their cholesterol numbers and the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, and rival pharmaceutical companies began producing their own statins, such as pravastatin (Pravachol), manufactured by Sankyo and Bristol-Myers Squibb. In April 1994, the results of a Merck-sponsored study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study or &quot;4S&quot;, were announced. Researchers tested simvastatin, later sold by Merck as Zocor, on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease. After five years, the study concluded that patients saw a 35-percent reduction in their cholesterol, and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42 percent. In 1995, Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US$1 billion. Endo was awarded the 2006 Japan Prize, and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008.
Statins act by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the first committed enzyme of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. Because statins are similar to HMG-CoA on a molecular level they take the place of HMG-CoA in the enzyme and reduce the rate by which it is able to produce mevalonate, the next molecule in the cascade that eventually produces cholesterol, as well as a number of other compounds. This ultimately reduces cholesterol via several mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Statin&amp;oldid=425079417&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Mode of action of Statins===
''Inhibiting cholesterol synthesis''
By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statins block the pathway for synthesizing cholesterol in the liver. This is significant because most circulating cholesterol comes from internal manufacture rather than the diet. When the liver can no longer produce cholesterol, levels of cholesterol in the blood will fall. Cholesterol synthesis appears to occur mostly at night, so statins with short half-lives are usually taken at night to maximize their effect. Studies have shown greater LDL and total cholesterol reductions in the short-acting simvastatin taken at night rather than the morning, but have shown no difference in the long-acting atorvastatin.

''Increasing LDL uptake''
Liver cells sense the reduced levels of liver cholesterol and seek to compensate by synthesizing LDL receptors to draw cholesterol out of the circulation. This is accomplished via protease enzymes that cleave a protein called &quot;membrane-bound sterol regulatory element binding protein&quot;, which migrates to the nucleus and causes increased production of various other proteins and enzymes, including the LDL receptor. The LDL receptor then relocates to the liver cell membrane and binds to passing LDL and VLDL particles (the &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; linked to disease). LDL and VLDL are drawn out of circulation into the liver where the cholesterol is reprocessed into bile salts. These are excreted, and subsequently recycled mostly by an internal bile salt circulation.

''Other effects''
Statins exhibit action beyond lipid-lowering activity in the prevention of atherosclerosis. The ASTEROID trial showed direct ultrasound evidence of atheroma regression during statin therapy. Researchers hypothesize that statins prevent cardiovascular disease via four proposed mechanisms (all subjects of a large body of biomedical research):
Improve endothelial function,
Modulate inflammatory responses,
Maintain plaque stability,
Prevent thrombus formation,
Statins may even benefit those without high cholesterol. In 2008 the JUPITER study showed fewer stroke, heart attacks, and surgeries even for patients who had no history of high cholesterol or heart disease, but only elevated C-reactive protein levels. There were also 20% fewer deaths (mainly from reduction in cancer deaths) though deaths from cardiovascular causes were not reduced

''Adverse effect of statin''
The most common adverse side effects are raised liver enzymes and muscle problems. In randomized clinical trials, reported adverse effects are low; but they are &quot;higher in studies of real world use&quot;, and more varied. In randomized trials statins increased the risk of an adverse effect by 39% compared to placebo (odds ratios 1.4); two-thirds of these were myalgia or raised liver enzymes with serious adverse effects similar to placebo. However, reliance on clinical trials can be misleading indications of real-world adverse effects – for example, the statin cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market in 2001 due to cases of rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), although rhabdomyolysis did not occur in a meta-analysis of cerivastatin clinical trials. Other possible adverse effects include cognitive loss, neuropathy, pancreatic and hepatic dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction.
Some patients on statin therapy report myalgias, muscle cramps,] or, less frequently, gastrointestinal or other symptoms. Liver enzyme derangements may also occur, typically in about 0.5%, are also seen at similar rates with placebo use and repeated enzyme testing, and generally return to normal either without discontinuance over time or after briefly discontinuing the drug. Multiple other side-effects occur rarely; typically also at similar rates with only placebo in the large statin safety/efficacy trials. Two randomized clinical trials found cognitive issues while two did not; recurrence upon reintroduction suggests that these are causally related to statins in some individuals. A Danish case-control study published in 2002 suggested a relation between long term statin use and increased risk of nerve damage or polyneuropathy but suggested this side effect is &quot;rare, but it does occur&quot;; other researchers have pointed to studies of the effectiveness of statins in trials involving 50,000 people which have not shown nerve damage as a significant side effect&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Statin&amp;oldid=425079417&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{quotation|'''Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)''':
[[Prokaryotes]] and [[plants]] have multi-subunit ACCs composed of several polypeptides encoded by distinct genes. Biotin carboxylase (BC) activity, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and carboxyl transferase (CT) activity are each contained on a different subunit. The stoichiometry of these subunits in the ACC [[holoenzyme]] differs amongst organisms. [[Humans]] and most [[eukaryotes]] have evolved an ACC with CT and BC catalytic domains and biotin carboxyl carrier domains on a single polypeptide. ACC functional regions, starting from the [[N-terminus]] to [[C-terminus]] are the biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin binding (BB), carboxyltransferase (CT), and ATP-binding (AB). AB lies within BC. [[Biotin]] is covalently attached through an amide bond to the long [[side chain]] of a lysine reside in BB. As BB is between BC and CT regions, biotin can be easily translocate to both of the active sites where it is required.

In mammals where two isoforms of ACC are expressed, the main structural difference between these isoforms is the extended ACC2 N-terminus containing a mitochondria targeting sequence.

In the context of the [[active site]], the reaction proceeds with extensive interaction of the residues Glu296 and positively charged Arg338 and Arg292 with the substrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19213731&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chou CY, Yu LP, Tong L |title=Crystal structure of biotin carboxylase in complex with substrates and implications for its catalytic mechanism |journal=J.

Bicarbonate is deprotonated by Glu296, although in solution, this proton transfer is unlikely as the [[pKa]] of [[bicarbonate]] is 10.3.  The [[enzyme]] apparently manipulates [[Acid dissociation constant|pKas]] to facilitate the deprotonation of bicarbonate.  The pKa of [[bicarbonate]] is decreased by its interaction with positively charged side chains of Arg338 and Arg292.  Furthermore, Glu296 interacts with the side chain of Glu211, an interaction that has been shown to cause an increase in the apparent pKa. Following deprotonation of bicarbonate, the oxygen of the bicarbonate acts as a [[nucleophile]] and attacks the gamma phosphate on ATP.  The carboxyphosphate intermediate quickly decomposes to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;. The PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; deprotonates biotin, creating an enolate, stabilized by Arg338, that subsequently attacks [[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]  resulting in the production of carboxybiotin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19213731&quot;/&gt; The carboxybiotin translocates to the carboxytransferase (CT) active site, where the carboxyl group is transferred to acetyl-CoA.  In contrast to the BC domain, little is known about the reaction mechanism of CT.  A proposed mechanism is the release of [[carbon dioxide]] from biotin, which subsequently abstracts a proton from the methyl group from acetyl CoA carboxylase.  The resulting [[enolate]] attacks CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form malonyl CoA. In a competing mechanism, [[proton]] abstraction is concerted with the attack of acetyl CoA.The function of ACAC is to regulate the metabolism of fatty acids. When the enzyme is active, the product, malonyl-CoA is produced which is a building block for new fatty acids and can inhibit the transfer of the fatty acyl group from acyl CoA to carnitine with carnitine acyltransferase, which inhibits the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria.
In mammals, two main isoforms of ACC are expressed, ACC1 and ACC2, which differ in both tissue distribution and function. ACC1 is found in the cytoplasm of all cells but is enriched in lipogenic tissue, such as adipose tissue and lactating mammary glands, where fatty acid synthesis is important. In oxidative tissues, such as the skeletal muscle and the heart, the ratio of ACC2 expressed is higher. ACC1 and ACC2 are both highly expressed in the liver where both fatty acid oxidation and synthesis is important. The differences in tissue distribution indicate that ACC1 maintains regulation of fatty acid synthesis whereas ACC2 mainly regulates fatty acid oxidation.}}

===Non-mevalonate pathway or MEP/DOXP pathway===
The classical mevalonate pathway or HMG-CoA reductase pathway  is an important cellular metabolic pathway present in all higher eukaryotes and many bacteria. It is important for the production of IPP and DMAPP that serve as the basis for the biosynthesis of molecules used in processes as diverse as protein [[prenylation]], [[cell membrane]] maintenance, hormones, [[lipid anchored protein|protein anchoring]] and [[glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]].

In contrast to the classical mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, plants and apicomplexan [[protozoa]] such as [[malaria]] parasites have the ability to produce their [[isoprenoids]] ([[terpenoids]]) using an alternative pathway, the '''non-mevalonate pathway''', which takes place in their [[plastid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lichtenthaler H |title=The 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants |journal=Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol |volume=50 |issue= |pages=47–65 |year=1999 |pmid=15012203 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.50.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most [[bacteria]] including important pathogens such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' synthesize IPP and DMAPP via the non-mevalonate pathway.

''Fosmidomycin is an antibiotic that specifically inhibits DXP reductoisomerase, a key enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. It is a structural analogue of 2-C-methyl-D-erythrose 4-phosphate. It inhibits the E. coli enzyme with a KI value of 38 nM (4), MTB at 80 nM, and the Francisella enzyme at 99 nM.
The discovery of the non-mevalonate pathway in malaria parasites has indicated the use of fosmidomycin and other such inhibitors as antimalarial drugs. Indeed, fosmidomycin has been tested in combination treatment with clindamycin for treatment of malaria with favorable results. It has been shown that an increase in copy number of the target enzyme (DXP reductoisomerase) correlates with in vitro fosmidomycin resistance in the lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sound Wave==
Sound wave is a Longitudinal Wave. When Sound Wave travels through air it will create expanding or shrinking column of airs called Rarefraction and RareExpansion. 
: Sound Wave |  ||  |  ||

==Sound Wave Characteristics==
# Sound does not exist in vacuum . 
# Sound wave requires medium of matter to spread itself . Sound wave travels through any medium Solid , Liquid , Gas 
# The speed of Sound wave varies with Pressure and Temperature of the medium . Sound wave travels at a speed v = λ f . At Standard Pressure &amp; Temperature in air the speed is calculated equal to v = 333 m/s
# Sound Wave that is audible to human ear is in the frequency range 20Hz - 20KHz .

==Sound's Effects==
When Sound wave travel through a medium if there is a blocking object that has a height greater than the wavelength of sound wave . Sound wave will suffer from the following effects
===Reflection===
: Sound wave being reflected back to the medium it comes from and can create interference with other wave in the medium
: [[File:Ray_Diagram_2.PNG|200px]]

===Refraction===
: Only part of Sound wave is passing through . Sound does not reach its destination
: [[File:Ray_Diagram.PNG|200px]]

===Diffraction===
: Wave travels through narrow opens 
: [[File:Two-Slit_Diffraction.png|200px]]

===Interference===
: When two sound waves travel toward each other will interfere either Constructively or Destructively to produce different sound interferences like [[Noise]], [[Echoe]], [[Intermittent]], [[/No sound/]]

==Applications==
===Tele Communication===
In Tele Communication, in order to carry Sound wave over a long distance sound wave must be mixed with a high frequency carrier wave in a process called Modulation . 

In Radio Communication, There are 3 modulations methods are used in mixing Sound wave and Carrier wave namely [[AM - Amplitude Modulation]], [[FM - Frequency Modulation]], [[PM - Phase Modulation]]. 

In analog electronics , AM and FM is widely used . In digital electronic, PM is used

: [[File:Onde_electromagnetique.svg|400px]]
Electromagnetic Wave is a wave compose of two waves An Electric Wave perpendicular to a Magnetic Wave travels in one direction . ElectroMagnetic Wave is observed in 
# [[/Electric Radiation/]] or [[/Black Body Radiation/]]
# [[/EletroMagnetic Radiation/]]
# [[/Nucleus Decays Radiation/]]

==Electromagnetic Waves Characteristics ==
EM waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties
: [[Frequency]] , f 
: [[Wavelength]] , λ 
: [[Energy photon]]  , E 

* Speed
: Electromagnetic Radiation travels at a speed equal to the speed of light in a vacuum C ≈ 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s .

* Wavelength
:Since all Electromagnetic Radiation travels at a speed of light , If the frequency of Electromagnetic Radiation is known then the wavelength can be calculated 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{C}{f}&lt;/math&gt;

* Energy
The energy of all Electromagnetic Radiation is quantized calculated by Plank's Formula 
: &lt;math&gt;E = h f = h nfo = \frac{h C}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:c = 299792458 m/s , speed of light in vacuum     
:h = 6.62606896 Js , Planck's constant

==Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum==
: [[File:EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg]]

Electromagnetic spectrum of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object. The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below frequencies used for modern radio to gamma radiation at the short-wavelength end, covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an [[atom]]. The long wavelength limit is the size of the [[universe]] itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the [[Planck length]], although in principle the spectrum is [[infinity|infinite]] and [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]]. 

The Frequency Range of Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum include frequencies of

===Classifications of Electromagnetic Waves===
[[File:Light_spectrum.svg]]

== Electromagnetic radiation and Matter ==
Electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter in different ways in different parts of the spectrum. The types of interaction can be so different that it seems to be justified to refer to different types of radiation. At the same time, there is a continuum containing all these &quot;different kinds&quot; of electromagnetic radiation. Thus we refer to a spectrum, but divide it up based on the different interactions with matter.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Region of the spectrum 
! Main interactions with matter
|-
|Radio 
|Collective oscillation of charge carriers in bulk material ([[plasma oscillation]]). An example would be the oscillation of the electrons in an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. 
|-
|Microwave through far infrared
|Plasma oscillation, molecular rotation  
|-
|Near infrared 
|Molecular vibration, plasma oscillation (in metals only)
|-
|Visible
|Molecular electron excitation (including pigment molecules found in the human retina), plasma oscillations (in metals only)
|-
|Ultraviolet
|Excitation of molecular and atomic valence electrons, including ejection of the electrons ([[photoelectric effect]])
|-
|X-rays
|Excitation and ejection of core atomic electrons, Compton scattering (for low atomic numbers)
|-
|Gamma rays
|Energetic ejection of core electrons in heavy elements, Compton scattering (for all atomic numbers), excitation of atomic nuclei, including dissociation of nuclei
|-
|High energy gamma rays
|Creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. At very high energies a single photon can create a shower of high energy particles and antiparticles upon interaction with matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shouldn't L'Hôpital's rule go in application of differentiation header since if this was being used to learn Calculus you wouldn't know what a derivative is yet.  If this book however is meant as a reference book I understand the placement.

:: Done --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]])

==Proofs==
I added the proof of the 0/0 case.  I looked at the proof of the &lt;math&gt;\infty/\infty&lt;/math&gt; case, and it seems considerably more complicated.  I'm not sure if I should have added the proof of just one case, but I'll leave it here for now and see how it goes.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 18:12, 22 May 2011 (UTC)

==Removed alternate proof==
I removed the following alternate &quot;proof&quot; of L'Hôpital's rule for the 0/0 case:

{{quotation|Let&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are continuous and differentiable at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{f(a)=g(a)=0}&lt;/math&gt;. Then&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)}{g(a+h)}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}{\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}}&lt;/math&gt; . By first principle of differentiation &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}{\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}&lt;/math&gt;}}

I think the argument suffers from multiple issues, but here is a specific counter-example to show that the proof does not hold up.  Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=g(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are continuous and differentiable everywhere and &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  The limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)}{g(a+h)}&lt;/math&gt;
exists and is equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  However,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}{\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}}=\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}&lt;/math&gt;
is not defined because the denominator is 0.

Of course the real problem is that what is shown is not L'Hôpital's rule at all since it never mentions a limit that involves &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 19:32, 27 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Carlo Goldoni.jpg|thumb|Carlo Goldoni revitalized the commedia dell'arte in the 18th century. Portrait by Alessandro Longhi (1733–1813)]]

The most important comic dramatist of early 18th century Italian theatre is Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793), for &quot;I due gemelli veneziani&quot; (The two Venetian twins, 1745), &quot;Il servitore di due padroni&quot; (The servant of two masters, 1746), and &quot;La putta onorata&quot; (The honorable maiden, 1749).

The most notable figure in tragic works of the period is Francesco Scipione Maffei (1675–1755), principally for &quot;Merope&quot; (1714), based on Greek mythology. Even more so than Corneille and Racine, Scipione draws a model close to Greek tragedies, especially in the use of the chorus as well as a continuous flow of action uninterrupted by changes in scenery.

==&quot;The two Venetian twins&quot;==

&quot;The two Venetian twins&quot;. Time: 1740s. Place: Verona, Italy.

[[File:Johann joachim kaendler, famiglia di arlecchino, meissen, 1740-1744 ca..JPG|thumb|Arlecchino needs glasses to distinguish between the twins. Meissen figurine, 1740-1744]]

Zanetto is engaged to be married to Rosaura, daughter to Balanzoni, but his abrupt manner offends her. Zanetto's twin brother, Tonino, is engaged to Beatrice. As she walks in the company of Tonino friend's, Florindo, a quarrelsome youth, Florio, liking her looks, challenges him to a sword-fight, but he is defended by Tonino, who beats Florio off. Though rescued by his friend, Florindo pretends he has not seen Beatrice, because he would like to marry her himself. Seeking vengeance on Tonino, Lelio attacks Zanetto by mistake, but is defended by Florindo, who also mistakes him Tonino. In addition to Zanetto, Rosaura is loved by Pancrazio, who advises Zanetto not to marry, citing the inherent dangers of that condition, which the credulous Zanetto accepts. Meanwhile, Zanetto's servant, Arlecchino, mistakes Tonino for his master, handing over jewels and money that belong to him. Balanzoni, also mistaking him for Zanetto, invites him inside his house to see his daughter, which astounds Tonino, considering him as no less than a pander to his daughter, but nevertheless is tempted by her charms, as she by his. Seeing this, Pancrazio, also mistaking him for his brother, is saddened he did not follow his advice against marriage. While Tonino entrusts Pancrazio with the jewels, Zanetto accuses Arlecchino of robbing him. Their contention is interrupted by Beatrice, who mistakes Zanetto for Tonino, confused as to why her lover seems to ignore her. Florindo and Lelio quarrel again, each wishing to escort Beatrice, spotted at last by Tonino, who carries her away. Pancrazio has the jewels appraised by an expert, who confirms their high value and gives him a substance to make them shine more brightly, warning him it is a violent poison. When Zanetto sees Pancrazio with his jewels, he accuses him of robbery, to the latter's astonishment. An officer intervenes to confiscate the jewels at the chancery. Scared for the loss of his reputation and confused at to why he denied giving him the jewels, Pancrazio encourages Tonino to defend him. Tonino points to Arlecchino as the man who gave him the treasure and throws the money at the servant's feet. Zanetto returns to Rosaura, expressing all his love of her, to the astonishment of Beatrice, who again mistakes him for her lover, with the result that both women becomes incensed at his faithlessness. As Zanetto leaves, his brother arrives, the theme of both women's continued accusations. To rid himself of his rival, Pancrazio poisons the still credulous Zanetto, who, led to believe he is consuming a love-filter, dies forthwith. While Zanetto's corpse is carried inside an inn, Tonino enters, to everyone's astonishment. &quot;He's half-dead and half-alive!&quot; exclaims Arlecchino. Tonino discovers his brother dead, as well as Rosaura's true identity, not Balanzoni's daughter as she thought, but his sister. Desperate to prove his innocence concerning Zanetto's death, Pancrazio voluntarily drinks the potion and dies. Tonino re-affirms his intention to marry Beatrice, while Rosaura accepts Florindo as her husband.

[[File:Pantalone - commedia dell'arte.JPG |thumb|Pantalone suffers from the foibles of servants. Late 18th century figurine]]

Pantalone had promised Federico his daughter's hand in marriage, but after learning of his death, agrees to marry Clarice to Silvio. He then learns that Federico is alive. In reality, he is dead after all, but his shape is assumed by his sister, Beatrice, disguised as her dead brother in quest of Florindo, her lover but also the man who murdered him. To supplement his meager income, Arlecchino, servant to Beatrice but unaware she is a woman, agrees to serve a second master, Florindo, without knowing who he is. He conveys letters for both masters but mixes them up, by means of which Florindo learns of Beatrice's presence in Venice. To finalize a financial transaction with Beatrice, Pantalone gives Arlecchino 100 ducats, but he gives them to the wrong master, Florindo. Taking pity on Clarice's sorrow, Beatrice reveals her true identity to her. Angry at Pantalone for taking back his promise to marry Clarice, Silvio threatens him with his sword, but the old man is defended by Beatrice. She humiliates Silvio by besting him in the sword-fight. In the aftermath, Silvio blames Clarice for consorting with Beatrice and shows indifference to her threat of suicide. Arlecchino succeeds at last in giving the 100 ducats in the right hands and, famished for a good while, of eating, though between mouthfuls he must serve food to both of his masters at the same time, in some confusion, serving soup after meat to one and splitting the meatball order to both. When Beatrice discovers her servant has opened one of her letters, she beats him, after which Florindo beats him as well for letting himself be beaten by a stranger. In spite of these beatings, Arlecchino stoically and dutifully airs out Florindo's clothing, but mixes up their contents. As a result, Florindo is led to believe Beatrice has died and Beatrice is led to believe Florindo has died. Despairing, both rush outside simultaneously with knives to cut their throats, but then joyfully recognize each other, so that Clarice may marry Silvio.

[[File:SpinaPutta.jpg|thumb|The honorable maiden Bettina struggles to stay honorable. Played by Maria Grazia Spina, 1986]]

Ottavio, marquis of Ripa Verde, intends to seduce Bettina, ward of Pantalone, a merchant, by acquiring her services as a servant. He learns that she is in love with Pasqualino, son of Menego, his gondelier. Pasqualino asks Bettina's sister, Catte, for her hand in marriage. She says &quot;perhaps&quot;, but to her sister she points out the interest in accepting the marquis' love. Instead Bettina informs Pantalone of her love of Pasqualino, but he considers that a poor match, insinuating he prefers having her as his own wife. She recoils. She also recoils when Ottavio drops by to offer earrings, money, and a dowry to marry Pasqualino. She even refuses to drink coffee with him and is scolded for it by Arlecchino, Catte's husband. To counter this, Ottavio engages Pasqualino in his service as a secretary so that he can marry Bettina and have them live in his house. When Pasqualino asks Pantalone for her hand, he refuses. The marquis commands his secretary to marry her despite the old man's views and hires Lelio, a self-styled vagabond and son of Pantalone brought up for many years at Livorno, to strike his father (whom he does not recognize) four blows with a stick. Lelio accepts but desists after finding out who he is. When Pasqualino comes to take Bettina away as his wife, she informs him of the marquis' attempt to seduce her. He wants her to follow him to some other place, but she refuses. Menego interrupts their talk and sends his son away, then begins to woo the maiden for himself, but achieves less than nothing. Observing Pasqualino's tears, Catte helps him place a ring on her sister's finger in betrothal, but when Pantalone arrives, he jumps out the window to avoid him. Pantalone notices the turquoise on his ward's finger. Catte pretends that the ring is her husband's gift to her. &quot;He must have assassinated somebody, for he never works,&quot; comments Pantalone. Nevertheless, he pays Catte the price of the ring so that Bettina may keep it. He then recommends that they all go to his sister's house in case the marquis aims at abducting Bettina. They cross the marquis by chance in their gondolas, so that his men abduct Bettina and Catte, while Pantalone helplessly wails ashore. Lelio pretends not to know his own father and runs away. In the marquis' house, his wife, Beatrice, discovers Bettina before he can get to her and takes her away to the theatre. Meanwhile, Catte is lost at night in the streets of Venice until Lelio offers his arm to escort her, but he runs off again on seeing Pantalone who rails against his son while walking out ahead. By chance, Catte crosses Bettina and Beatrice on their way to the play and follows them. At the theatre, both masked, Beatrice makes Bettina change into her clothes and changes hers into Catte's to fool her husband on the lookout for Bettina. She has also sent away Catte but sent for Pasqualino. Ottavio and his men discover the two women, and, thinking she is Bettina, go off with Beatrice. Pasqualino thinks Bettina is the marquis' wife, who, as a modestly honorable maiden distrusting him, refuses to be escorted. Meanwhile, Menego defends Lelio from being arrested by the police at his father's request, while his wife, Pasqua, a nurse, defends him from being shipped away at sea by Pantalone. She reveals that Lelio is not his son, but theirs, whom she substituted in the place of Pasqualino, so that her son could enjoy Pantalone's riches. But Lelio prefers to live the life of his true father. Out of mischief, Beatrice locks Bettina in a dark room with Pasqualino, but as usual she comes off as the honorable maiden. Pantalone arrives to embrace Pasqualino as his son, now quite acceptable as Bettina's husband.

==&quot;Merope&quot;==

&quot;Merope&quot;. Time: Antiquity. Place: Stenyclaros, capital of Messenia.

&quot;Merope&quot; text at http://www.archive.org/details/meropetragedy00arno

Twenty years ago, the ruler of Messenia, Cresphontes, was murdered by his friend and present ruler, Polyphontes, who seeks to wed his widow, Merope, to forestall rumors of a possible revolt led by her exiled son, Aepytus. Despite Polyphontes' promise of declaring Aepytus heir to the throne, she refuses to marry him. Aepytus returns in secret while announcing to Polyphontes his death. Thinking Aepytus dead indeed, Merope's servant, Arcas, announces to her that the recently arrived stranger is her son's murderer. She picks up an axe and creeps towards Aepytus' sleeping figure. Thinking of her murdered son, she says: &quot;While the good sleep, the wicked watch and work, the workers have the day,&quot; then coming closer: &quot;There you lie now, my hapless child, stretched among briars and stones, the slow, black gore oozing through your soaked hunting-shirt, with limbs yet stark from the death-struggle, tight-clenched hands, and eyeballs staring for revenge in vain.&quot; But Arcas, now better informed, arrives in time to prevent her fatal error. Aepytus awakes and discloses his intention to kill Polyphontes. Although his mother considers at first the course too dangerous, principally because of the Dorian lords long having served Polyphontes, he dismisses her arguments: &quot;O honored father, hide in your grave as deep as you can, for here no succor comes, since what revenge can one expect from faithful subjects when your widow fails?&quot; At last, Aepytus, with the help of Merope's brother, Laias, convinces her of the necessity of murder. Polyphontes comes back to propose marriage to Merope a second time, but is denied again. While Polyphontes leads the sacrifice in honor of Aepytus' memory, the supposed dead man slays him in view of the people, who defend him and his uncle against the Dorian lords, so that Aepytus is declared the rightful ruler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Romantic Italian drama is capably represented by Alessandro Manzoni (1785-1873) with &quot;Adalgis&quot; (1822), based on the life of Adalgis (?-788), son of the king of Lombardy, at war with Charlemagne. A second tragedy, &quot;Il Conte di Carmagnola&quot; (The count of Carmagnola, 1819), is based on the life of Francesco Bussone, count of Carmagnola (ca 1382-1432) during the times of Francesco Foscari (1373-1457), doge of Venice.

[[File:Adelchis, son of Desiderius.jpg|thumb|Adalgis is dying, to his father's despair]]

Charlemagne, king of the Franks, repudiates his wife, Hermangard, daughter of Desiderius, king of Lombardy. Hermangard is received sadly back to her father and her brother, Adalgis, but prefers to retire in a monastery. Desiderius receives Charlemagne's message to take the ground King Pepin of the Franks once gave and hand it over to Pope Hadrian, for Charlemagne is a &quot;champion of God, called by God, it is to God he consecrates his arm, and it is with regret he would turn it against those who connive with iniquity,&quot; declares Albin, one of his military leaders. The Lombard kings refuse, but Charlemagne is unable to attack them efficiently. &quot;Nature itself prepared our enemy's camp,&quot; says Charlemagne, for, to his people, the Alps are &quot;a school of terror&quot;. Yet many Italians wish for Charlemagne's victory. Nevertheless, Charlemagne's son, Martino, finds a passage through these mountains. Another of Charlemagne's leaders, Ekhart, is ordered to follow a guide conducting the troops towards the Lombard camp. Once the Franks are rid of, Adalgis is confident to head towards Rome, &quot;to pile up ruins on ruins&quot;, but, thanks to their guide, the Franks surprise the Lombards by attacking them from an unsuspected direction, so that Desiderius is forced to flee to Pavia and Adalgis to Verona. Meanwhile, Hermangard learns that Hildegard is Charlemagne's new wife. She becomes delirious, thinks she sees Charlemagne before her, and encourages him to chase the new wife away. She dies raving. Fearing the emperor, the city of Pavia has treacherously opened her portal to him, so that Desiderius is dragged along as a captive. Giselbert, duke of Verona, announces to Adilgis that their army prefers to give up. But Adalgis is invited by the emperor of Greece to take shelter in Byzantium, and hopes by such means to convey some hope for his imprisoned father. Meanwhile, Desiderius begs Charlemagne not to attack Verona, but is refused. In the conflict, Adalgis is injured and carried dying to his father. He says that he should not regret the loss of his kingdom, for on this earth &quot;all that remains is either to do evil or be subject to it&quot;. Charlemagne promises to treat him honorably. &quot;I lie in chains to weep for you,&quot; says Desiderius.

&quot;The count of Carmagnola&quot; text at ?

[[File:FrancescoFoscariBastiani.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Francesco Foscari, doge of Venice, by Lazzaro Bastiani (1430–1512)]]

Francesco Foscari, doge of Venice, presents before the senate the choice of either accepting the terms of peace offered by Filippo, duke of Milan, or to declare war against him. The duke recently attempted to assassinate the count of Carmagnola, a mercenary soldier once favored by him. Carmagnola speaks against the overtures of peace, so is the doge. Otherwise, &quot;it would be the first time that the lion of St Mark languishes, sleeping at the sound of flattering words,&quot; he declares. Although Marino, one of the Council of Ten, is suspicious of the mercenary soldier as to his loyalty to the state, the senate votes to declare war against Milan with Carmagnola as head of their army. In the Milanese camp, opinions are divided as to whether they should fight on a field of battle chosen by Carmagnola or bide their time. Malatesti, head of the duke's army, decides to fight at the present moment with the troops at the height of their strength. &quot;Let us choose what promises glory the most,&quot; declares Malatesti. But Carmagnola is victorious. Against the advice of the senate, he refuses to pursue the defeated, liberating instead hundreds of prisoners. Angry at this, Marino challenges a senator, Marco, for being alone to defend Carmagnola. Marino wants Marco's promise on paper that he will not warn Carmagnola about his danger, who is to return to Venice at once and perhaps find clemency. Otherwise, he is condermned to death as a traitor. Despite grave misgivings, Marco signs the paper. &quot;Remind yourself you hold two lives in your hand,&quot; says Marino. Marco leaves to fight the Moors. Before the Council of Ten, the doge asks Carmagnola whether they should pursue the war. He answers positively, provided their general possesses complete power and is not interfered with. This answer supports their worst suspicions. He is arrested. A secret tribunal tries and condemns him to death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Late 19th century Italian theatre is represented by Italo Svevo (1861-1928) with &quot;Il ladro in casa&quot; (The thief inside the house, written 1886, published 1932), Giovanni Verga (1840-1922) with &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; (Rustic chilvalry, 1884), Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) with &quot;La città morta&quot; (The dead city, 1899), and Giuseppe Giacosa (1847-1906) with &quot;Come le foglie&quot; (Like the leaves, 1900).

&quot;The thief inside the house&quot; text at ?

Ignazio is about to marry Carla, whose dowry is to be paid by Carlo, who adopted her when she became an orphan. But Carlo's financial troubles force him to ask Ignazio for a delay, in exchange offering generous monthly payments in interest. Ignazio refuses. Carlo is so incensed that he suggests to Carla to forget him, but she does not want to. They marry. One day, Carla wishes to fire a female servant. Ignazio suspiciously opposes it. But when she confronts him a second time, he yields, having greater troubles on his mind: imminent bankruptcy unless he obtains a loan. Ignazio asks his Uncle Marco for one, but he refuses. He next asks Carlo, though lying about the reason for it, a jewel sale liable to make money for both of them. Carla is surprised at her husband's lie but keeps silent. The result is that Carlo never gets his money back. More financial troubles force Ignazio to plan escaping his creditors by leaving the city, but not with his wife, with her friend, Elena. Carlo learns that other people have borrowed from Ignazio, namely Elena's husband as well as Marco, based on his falsified signature. Moreover, Marco informs him that Ignazio and Carla have moved away no one knows where. Marco threatens to inform the police about the forgery, though Carlo disapproves. Carla is not with her husband, for her is on his own the better to hide himself. She admits to Carlo's wife she has kept silent about her husband's shady dealings, to Carlo's detriment, but despite all she would receive him back &quot;with joy&quot;. In desperate straits, Ignazio surreptiously enters Carlo's house in the hope of hiding there. Marco tells Carlo he has not gone through with his threat, but is worried about not knowing where he is. Elena is all the more so. She tells Carla Ignazio borrowed expensive jewels from her and she does not know where he is. Carla eventually discovers her husband inside the house, who proposes that they should leave the city together with some money he has managed to obtain. They are interrupted by Elena's return, frantic about her jewels. Carla understands the nature of their relation and leaves silently. Ignazio gives back her jewels. When Carlo enters, Carla can no longer restrain her resentment towards her husband, admitting her guilt in keeping silent all this time. Ignazio offers Carlo half his money as compensation for what he owes him. Carlo hesitates, but Carla takes the money for his sake. They next learn that Marco has gone through with his threat after all, as police officers enter the house. Ignazio escapes them by climbing through the roof, but, to the grief of all, slips and falls to his death.

Banna, a blind woman, takes pleasure in touching Bianca Maria's hair, letting it fall all over her. &quot;It is a torrent.&quot; she says. &quot;It covers you all over. It falls to the very ground. It covers me too. What floods! What floods! It has a perfume, it has a thousand perfumes. A torrent full of flowers! Ah, you are altogether beautiful, you have every gift. How could you renounce one who loved you? How could you remain in the shadow, you who are made to give joy? Some part of you slept in darkness which has awakened now. You know yourself now; is it not true? I have listened to your step, sometimes. You moved as if you followed in yourself a melody you knew. Ah, if I could tell you the word of happiness, Bianca Maria!&quot; Bianca Maria weeps at this. Anna pretends to her husband, Alessandro, that it is because she had been reading Sophocles' &quot;Antigone&quot;. Bianca Maria's brother, Leonardo, arrives with joyful news on the success of his excavations: &quot;The gold, the gold...the bodies... great heaps of gold...bodies all covered with gold,&quot; he exclaims. Alessandro also loves Bianca Maria. &quot;When I look at you, when I hear the rhythm of your breathing, I feel that there are other beautiful things to unveil, other good things to conquer, and that there are perhaps in the world things to be done, as delightful as the most beautiful dreams of poetry.&quot; he says. But when he takes her hands, she turns away from him. Anna arrives and asks to be kissed. Bianca Maria kisses her on the mouth. Alone with Alessandro, Leonardo reveals his excavations seemed to have poisoned him. Moreover, he is troubled about Bianca Maria. &quot;She has been the perfume of my life, the repose and the freshness, the counsel and the comfort, and the dream, and the poetry, and all,&quot; he says. Looking at &quot;her little naked feet held out to the heat&quot;, he is overcome with repugnance by a &quot;muddy thought&quot;. At this revelation, Alessandro staggers out, then comes back and touches his head. Alone with Leonardo, Anna grows disconselate. &quot;I no longer belong to the beautiful and cruel life, I am an obstacle in the way, a lifeless obstacle against which so much hope and force break and shatter,&quot; she says. How can her husband help loving Bianca Maria? Alone with Bianca Maria, Leonardo knows she loves Alessando. &quot;I vowed myself yours when we were left alone in the world; I will live in the future only for you. Tell me what we shall do. I am ready,&quot; she answers. They go out hurriedly, not answering Anna's call. When Alessandro asks his wife what she knows of Leonardo's horrible secret, she answers: &quot;Only silence is worthy of us.&quot; In despair of their future, Leonardo drowns his sister in a public fountain &quot;to save her soul from the horror about to seize on it&quot;,  after which he feels much better. &quot;I have become pure, quite pure,&quot; he affirms. As he and Alessandro lift the corpse, Anna calls out for her. They stand rigid with terror. She stoops over the corpse, touches it, and utters a piercing shriek as her sight is restored.

In the wake of financial ruin in Milan, Giovanni accepts a poor-paying offer of employment in Geneva from his nephew, Massimo. He will bring his wife, Giulia, and his two children from a previous marriage, Tommaso and Nennele, along with him. He is worried about his wife's state of mind in the crisis: &quot;She brought a lawyer into the house to persuade me to defraud my creditors,&quot; Giovanni informs Massimo. She has also sold items illegally. At the last minute, she attempted to go off without paying her dressmaker, but was caught in time. In Geneva, a listless Tommaso comments sarcastically about his step-mother's main occupation: painting landscapes, or &quot;maligning nature with her misguided paint-brush&quot;. To make ends meet, Nennele gives private English lessons in French. Massimo tries to encourage her, but not Tommaso, who quit a job offered by Massimo &quot;as foreman of a bunch of laborers boring holes in an ice-covered mountain&quot;. Having lost all his money at gambling, Tommaso asks Giulia for some. She yields him part his request, specifying: &quot;If you win, you must give me half.&quot; When offered a post as secretary to a sawmill owner, Tommaso at first refuses, but then accepts in view of his father's depressive spirits. Later, Giulia asks for the key to a drawer containing the household money, but Nennele, as a prudent household manager, refuses. Frustrated, Giulia appeals to her husband, who informs his daughter she is to be the household manager. Giulia has managed to sell two pictures, but this was achieved at the expense of her artist-friend, Helmer, who suspiciously invites her to his house. Nennele discovers that her step-mother has stolen her silver frame, but Tommaso declines to cooperate with her story, Giulia striding off vindicated. Frustrated about the poor manner in which the family has adapted to the dreary conditions, Nennele asks Massimo whether he feels rebellious. &quot;Do you rebel against leaves scattered in the wind?&quot; Massimo asks back. Though seemingly at work for weeks, Tommaso stayed for only a single day, Massimo discovers. &quot;I give myself up to the current,&quot; admits Tommaso. He owes a great deal of money to a woman and will pay her back by marrying her. Seeing Nennele disheartened at these events, Massimo asks her to marry him, but she refuses, convinced the offer originates from charity, not love. That night, Giovanni discovers Nennele about to go out and guesses she meant to commit suicide. As they talk, Giovanni seems to notice a man lurking in the shade of the hedge. Nennele sees him, too. &quot;He stayed,&quot; affirms Nennele, overjoyed. &quot;He stayed for me. He understood.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An important part of late 19th century Spanish drama must include José Echegaray (1832–1916), with &quot;El gran Galeoto&quot; (The great Galeoto, 1881) and &quot;Mariana&quot; (1891). Despite some borrowings from Ibsen's &quot;Ghosts&quot;, especially at the end, &quot;El hijo de Don Juan&quot; (Don Juan's son, 1892) is another worthy effort of his. A pastoral drama, &quot;Terra Baixa&quot; (1896) (Lowlands, also known as Martha of the Lowlands) is a Catalan-language play written by Àngel Guimerà.

Julian, a banker, owes much in his business advancement to Ernesto's father. &quot;Don Juan of Acedo risked for my family name and wealth, almost his life,&quot; he avers. In return, for the past year, Julian has housed and fed Ernesto at his expense. Because Ernesto feels guilty about this arrangement, Julian offers him a post as his secretary.  Julian's brother and sister-in-law, Severo and Mercedes, falsely suspect Ernesto of being the lover of Julian's wife, Teodora. Alone with her, Mercedes says their arrangement is viewed suspiciously by the common talk of society. Teodora is offended by this suggestion and sobs. Ernesto guesses the interfering couple has maligned him and so changes his mind about the secretary position, preferring instead to travel, but Julian refuses to consider it. &quot;I have not the habit of changing my mind or the plans I have matured because of a boy's caprice or a madman's folly,&quot; he pronounces,&quot;and I have still less intention of weakly subjecting my actions to the town's idle gossip.&quot; Yet Ernesto leaves him to live in a shabby apartment. Julian and Severo learn from Pepito, the latter's son, that because of Viscount Nebreda's innuendos, Ernesto struck him and provoked a duel. &quot;I mean to do what I ought and can, to avenge myself and save Don Juan of Acedo's son,&quot; says the outraged Julian. &quot;Observe: until today calumny was impalpable. There was no seizing its shape. I have now discovered it, and it has taken a human form. There it is at hand, in the person of a viscount.&quot; Later, Pepito asks Ernesto who is Galeoto, the title of Ernesto's play, referring to a character in Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. &quot;Galeoto was the go-between for the queen and Launcelot and in all loves the third may be truthfully nicknamed Galeoto, above all when we wish to suggest an ugly word without shocking an audience,&quot; answers Ernesto. Hearing of his impending duel and his intention to depart to America, Teodora begs him to avoid the duel, for it is her husband's duty to defend her reputation. He disagrees. &quot;Every honorable man has the right to defend a lady,&quot; he says. On hearing a nearby noise, Teodora runs to hide in his bedroom. It is Julian carried inside by Severo and Pepito as a result of being wounded by the viscount's sword. Both wish to deposit him on Ernesto's bed, which he attempts to obstruct, but Severo pushes past him, so that Teodora is revealed to Julian as he faints. Seeking revenge for harming his friend, Ernesto clashes with the viscount and succeeds in killing him. When Mercedes informs Teodora of the viscount's death, she probes into her conscience regarding Ernesto, declaring she is sure he loves her. Alone with Ernesto, Teodora angrily turns him away, at which he pleads with her on his knees not to leave him in this way. When Severo discovers the two together, he guesses the worst about the nature of their relation, declaring to Ernesto: &quot;I can find no word or epithet adequate to the passion of contempt I would express, so I must be content to call you a blackguard. Leave this house at once.&quot; But hearing him insult Teodora, Ernesto refuses to go. Instead, he forces him to kneel to her. A dying Julian enters, forcing the guiltless Ernesto down on his own knees. &quot;Bad friend, bad son!&quot; he cries and strikes him on the face, then totters out to his death. Still incensed and indignant, Severo orders Teodora out of the house, so that Ernesto claims her as his: &quot;She is mine.&quot; he declares. &quot;The world has so desired it, and its decision I accept; it has driven her to my arms.&quot; The great Galeoto has won: public opinion has driven the lovers in each other's arms.

The rich widow Mariana has two suitors, Pablo, a general, and Daniel, a rich man's son. To both she offers a flower from her bosom. She invites Daniel to escort her to a ball, but he cannot, as his father may be dying. He asks her not to invite Pablo in his place. She refuses. &quot;Lead us to victory, my dear general,&quot; she commands. &quot;And where is the victory?&quot; asks Pablo. &quot;And does a general ask that?&quot; answers Mariana defiantly, &quot;Where someone may be conquered.&quot; Eager to help his friend, Daniel, Joaquin speaks favorably of him and requests her to declare herself one way or another. &quot;Why?&quot; she asks. &quot;If he is happy at my side, if he is happy in his suffering, and I am happy in making him suffer, why should we be separated?&quot; Despite her ambivalence, Daniel is still unwilling to leave her. She says she is that way as a result of her mother running away from her father for the sake of a lover named Alvarado. &quot;I feel no love, I feel no tenderness, and I don't want to feel them.&quot; He accepts to continue in this way, but at least let her not love another; otherwise, he promises to kill both her and him. When Mariana discovers that Daniel is Alvarado's son, she promptly decides to marry Pablo. On the evening of their marriage night, Mariana pretends to suffer from a headache. Daniel surprises her alone, proposing to take her away. She refuses. Having heard some noise, Pablo enters with a pistol. He shoots to death Mariana and invites Daniel outside for a duel, but he refuses. &quot;There was only one life that was worth combating for and that lies there.&quot; concludes Daniel. &quot;What does such lives as ours matter? Adieu. No! I shall be with you soon, Mariana, I shall be with you soon.&quot;

Don Juan had led a riotous life, full of drinkings and adulteries, but he is confident his son, Lazarus, a writer, will make up for his lost life with a brilliant career. Juan's cronies are set to go off again, including Timoteo, father of Carmen, Lazarus' intended. &quot;You gay young dog,&quot; Timoteo cries out to Juan, &quot;lead us on to glory and to pleasure.&quot; Meanwhile, Carmen and Dolores, Juan's wife, are worried over Lazarus' failing health. He is often nervous and unable to concentrate while struggling and sweating over a book by Kant. Dolores consults Dr Bermudez about the condition of her son. Thinking the case concerns his cousin, the doctor blurts out his diagnosis: the first stages of syphilitic dementia transmitted to him by his father's frequent orgies. After finding out the truth of the matter, the doctor clumsily denies the certainty of his diagnosis, but Lazarus feels it to be true. He asks him when the disease will strike, but the doctor only answers him in a vague way. When Timoteo arrives to give away his daughter's hand, Lazarus refuses. Turning to his father, he says: &quot;You gave me life, but that 's not enough: give me more life, to live, to love, to be happy- give me life for my own Carmen- give me more life, or cursed be the life you gave me!&quot; then falls unconscious. Though his condition has fluctuated, Lazarus seems destined to die a miserable death. He no longer has any wish to speak to Carmen and calls for his father and mother. Raving, bitterly remembering childhood memories, he then rejects his father: &quot;No. I remember everything now; between the two, no; I was alone with my mother; you were not there. Go away, go away,&quot; he says. Remembering how his mother chose to send him away during his childhood, he also rejects her. At last, beginning to go blind, he calls out, to the horror of all three: &quot;The sun! The sun! I want the sun.&quot;

&quot;Lowlands&quot;. Time: 1890s. Place: Catalania, Spain. 

&quot;Lowlands&quot; text at http://archive.org/details/martalowlandste00gillgoog

Villagers in the lowlands have heard a rumor whereby the master of the town, Sebastian, has arranged a marriage between his ward, Martha, and Manelic, a goatherd living in the uplands. One of the villagers reveals in a low voice; &quot;They can't fool me. The master's been huntin' a husband for her for a long time, but he couldn't find one. They both wanted a man who would be like a dumb brute, more so than any of us-&quot; On his arrival, the villagers smile or laugh at Manelic's simplicity. &quot;Every night, without missin' one, I say my prayers; first a paternoster, and then another paternoster, which makes two paternosters,&quot; he specifies. &quot;The first for the souls of my father and mother, because they loved each other so; one is enough for both. And the other paternoster- do you know what it is for? Why, so the Lord would send me a good wife.&quot; Martha is not pleased to be the one, but yet submits to the powerful Sebastian. &quot;Why, that's what I want.&quot; he says. &quot;You don't know how glad I am to hear you say it. Do you think, if he pleased you, I'd let you marry him?&quot; The planned marriage was helped by another villager, Thomas, but after hearing that Martha has been the master's mistress since she was a child, he baulks at it, but yet Sebastian imposes his will, Manelic to become the new miller. He himself is to marry another and thereby annul his uncle's testament whereby he would get nothing. After the ceremony, Martha insists that her husband sleep in a separate room. When she discovers her husband loves her, she is aghast with surprise and horror, having thought he accepted her for money. Hearing about the bad relations existing between husband and wife, the villagers laugh. Because Manelic suspects the presence of a man skulking about his house and because his wife shows no sign of love, he wants to return to the uplands without her, considering this place &quot;a pit of misery&quot;. On learning this, Martha pleads to follow him and thereby escape from Sebastian's baleful influence, even goading him to stab her with a knife rather than abandon her. After doing so, he recoils from further violence and decides to take her with him after all, but Sebastian prevents it and removes him from his post. To encourage Manelic to come back to her, Martha reveals that Sebastian is the man he was worried about. As Marta is about to escape one night from the village, she is caught in time by Sebastian. She struggles. He catches her by the throat, at which point Manelic tears the door-curtain aside and stands peering in. He challenges Sebastian but, seeing him unarmed, throws his knife away. They fight. Manelic strangles him to death, then in front of the villagers points to the mountains. Martha nods absently. They run away, the people falling back to make room for them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|thumb|Henrik Ibsen wrote both verse dramas and realistic prose, 1870s]]

At the start of his career, Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) wrote Romantic dramas, whose most famous examples include &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1867) and &quot;Kongs-Emnerne&quot; (The pretenders to the crown, 1863), the latter based on the life of King Hakon (1217-1263). 

Henrik Hertz (1797-1870) wrote one of the main comedies of the period: &quot;Kong Renés Datter&quot; (King René's daughter, 1845), based on the life of Yolande, duchess of Lorraine (1428-1483). Adam Oehlenschläger (1779-1850) introduced romanticism to the Danish theatre with &quot;Hakon Jarl hin Rige&quot; (Earl Hakon the Mighty, 1808).

[[File:Henrik-Klausen-Peer-Gynt-1876.jpg|thumb|Peer Gynt runs into trouble wherever he goes. Played by Henrik Klausen, 1876]]

Although knowing him as an inveterate liar, Ase is at first mesmerized by the outrageous hunting stories told by her son, Peer, to justify his long absence, before noticing such events happened to someone else. Her complaints against her son are vehement to the point that a frustrated Peer lifts her on top of the millhouse and leaves her there for neighbors to find. Though uninvited, Peer joins a wedding party where he meets Solveig and is immediately smitten by her modest looks. The groom is unable to get his bride out of the garret where she is staying out of spite of the arranged marriage. Instead of helping the groom, Peer takes off with the bride. Instead of helping the bride, he abandons her on a mountain path after seducing her. To gain freedom, Peer takes to the mountains, where he meets the old man of the Douvre, who presides over a band of trolls. The old man explains to Peer the advantages of living a troll's life, but when he proposes marriage to his daughter, Peer runs off again. When he returns to his village, he finds his mother stripped of most of her possessions by the villagers, angry at her son's misdeeds. She is sick. Peer takes her in his arms, imagining the two of them off on a sleigh-ride to St Peter's gate, where she dies indeed. Over the course of several decades, Peer amasses a large fortune in the slave trade to the United States and the selling of idols in China. In Morocco, he is treated as a prophet by his servant girls, till one of them abandons him treacherously in the desert. His fortune takes an even more downward turn when he is mistakenly taken to a madhouse. Peer wants to get out from a place where, according to him, one cannot become one's self, but the director of the establishment points out that here one is all too much one's self. Peer escapes on a boat on its way to Norway, but it founders in a storm. To save his own life, Peer pushes down to his death a passenger clinging to a narrow piece of wreckage. Peer returns to his village almost in the same state as he left, where he is greeted by a smelter, servant of the great master. The smelter declares that Peer's life is over: he is to be melted away with the common run of humankind. Peer is astounded at this judgment. Has he not continuously acted as himself, different and apart from all others? The smelter does not agree, but Peer cannot find anyone, not even the devil, who is ready to attest that his life's actions merit any special outcome, until Solveig arrives, who has waited all these years only for his return. The smelter agrees to let him lay in her arms at least for a while.

[[File:HakonTheOldAndSkule-Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|Hakon &quot;The Old&quot; Hakonarson, King of Norway, and Skule Bårdsson. Illustration from Flateyjarbók, 1380s.]]

After Inga submitted to the ordeal of burning steel on her hands, swearing that Hakon was truly her son of the previous king, he is elected king of Norway. To conciliate the other pretenders to the crown, notably his uncle, Skule, presently a jarl and main intendant in the previous reign, Hakon agrees to send away his mother, marry Skule's daughter, Margrete, and allow Skule to hold the king's seal on all his letters. One day, Skule sends a letter to one of the king's enemies without his knowledge. Bishop Nikolas, main religious authority in the realm, discovers this and tries to foment hate between the two, so that he himself may attain greater power in their division. He specifies that despite the results of the ordeal, Hakon may still be a bastard, because many years ago he had advised a priest, Trond, to exchange the baby left to his charge by Inga for another. Meanwhile, Hakon also discovers Skule's treachery and takes away his power to control the seal. Nevertheless, he names him to a post of higher rank, as the first duke in Norway. Nikolas becomes very sick and on his death-couch informs Skule about a letter he received from Inga containing Trond's admission as to whether he exchanged the baby or not. To continue exerting power even after death, he maliciously asks Skule to burn his papers only to reveal afterwards that he just burned Trond's letter. Though wavering in uncertainty, Skule eventually revolts against Hakon and is named the second king in Norway. One day, Skule receives the visit of a woman he once abandoned many years ago, who, to his joy, reveals he has a son, Peter, whom she leaves with him as the eventual heir to the crown. After achieving one great victory against his foe, Skule is surrounded with fewer warriors in the town of Nidaros. To impress the legitimacy of his crown to the townsmen, he asks Peter to remove St. Olaf's shrine from a convent, but this move backfires, as they consider this a sacrilege, being against the friars' will. Skule is forced to escape with few men in a skiff and heads towards a monastery where Hakon's baby and heir to the throne is kept. On the way, Nikolas' ghost appears to encourage him, but instead, Skule is devastated on considering that he and Peter are acting as servants of the devil's will. At the convent, Peter begs him to kill Hakon's son, but losing confidence in himself, Skule admits that the grand thought of Norway's unification is not his but Hakon's. In despair, he convinces his son to submit to death at the hands of the men beside the rightful king.

[[File:Ambito francese - Iolanda d'Angiò, duchessa di Lorena e di Bar, contessa di Vaudémont.jpg|thumb|Painting of Yolande, duchess of Lorraine (1428-1483)]] 

During her childhood, Iolanthe, daughter of King René, became blind as a result of a fire in the house. Since then, she has been kept secluded and is even unaware of what sight is. To make peace with his rebellious subject, Count Antonio Vaudemont, the king has promised his daughter's hand in marriage to the count's son, Tristan. By chance, Tristan enters a garden where Iolanthe is sleeping. He removes an amulet from her breast, which awakes her, the amulet serving as a charm discovered by her tutor, Ebn Jahia, to control her sleep-time, so that servants may be prepared to minister to her. While Tristan's friend, Geoffrey, surveys the region for their safety, Tristan asks Iolanthe for a white rose. She gives him a red one instead. He discovers she is blind and does not know she is blind. Yet there is one thing she possesses. &quot;In you is such an inward radiance of soul that you have no need of what by the light we through the eye discern,&quot; he says. He calls her &quot;beautiful unknown&quot; and quickly declares his love of her. Iolanthe is charmed by his voice and manner. &quot;Your words are laden with a wondrous power,&quot; she says. &quot;Say, from what master did you learn the art to charm, by words, which yet are mysteries?&quot; Tristan must go but promises to return. Iolanthe's servant, Martha, is surprised to find her awake. King René and Ebn Jahia discover that a stranger has intruded into the garden and spoken to Iolanthe. Ebn Jahia tells the king now is the time to reveal to his daughter what sight is, for otherwise there is no hope she will ever be cured. Reluctantly, the king tries to, but is only partly successful. To his surprise, he receives word that Tristan has broken off the engagement, but then, Tristan and Geoffrey with their aides overpower the king's guards and re-enter the garden. Their wonder is great on discovering Tristan has already met Iolanthe, &quot;a beautiful maiden&quot;, in Tristan's eyes, &quot;whose praise not all Provence's troubadours could chant in measures equal to her worth&quot;. Ibn Jahia cures Iolanthe, but she lies in a fearful state, having regained her sight but wondering at everything she sees. Confident in the future, the king is overjoyed. &quot;Blessings on you both from God, whose wondrous works we all revere,&quot; he cries out.

==&quot;Earl Hakon the Mighty&quot;==

&quot;Earl Hakon the Mighty&quot;. Time: 10th century. Place: Norway.

&quot;Earl Hakon the Mighty&quot; text at http://www.archive.org/details/earlhakonmighty00oehlgoog

Hakon has reigned in Norway as an earl for 17 years, but he is worried about the intentions of Olaf Trygveson, who intends to become the country's legitimate king. In a sacred grove where pagan gods are worshiped, Hakon discovers the blacksmith's daughter, Gudrun, who says to him in banter: &quot;Do you refuse a kiss to Hakon, soon to be proud Norway's king, and shall he long solicit?&quot; But she manages to escape from his lustful arms. He asks Thorer, his right-hand man, to meet Olaf to discover his intentions and &quot;to seek a strife with him&quot;. Meanwhile, Bergthor, the blacksmith, hearing from Gudrun what happened at the grove, hides her in the cellar so that Hakon cannot get to her. Thorer speaks to Olaf about Hakon. &quot;A long time has he sat there; but, my lord, at last have Norway's peasants found it is disgraceful to be governed by an earl,&quot; he says,&quot;and Norway anxiously but awaits a bold and lawful king to overthrow Earl Hakon and to hurl him from his seat.&quot; This surprises Olaf and makes him change his plans. He now would be Norway's king, not only for personal power. &quot;To Christianize my country! Noble thought!&quot; he exclaims. While walking about in preparation for battle, Hakon's feather in his helmet is struck by an arrow, Einar's, intending to frighten the great earl. Hakon threatens and challenges him while pointing to a tree. &quot;There is a small dark spot upon the bark; now shoot, and if the arrow passes through the spot, and sticks firm in it, then will I believe your story,&quot; he says. Einar succeeds, so that Hakon takes him in his army. One of the earl's men, Stein, interrupts Gudrun's wedding party, because the earl wants her for himself. The bridegroom, Orm, with the help of friends and family members, succeed in defending her against Stein and his fellows, the peasants crying out: &quot;Earl Hakon dies!&quot; Thorer's thrall, Grib, reveals to Carlshoved and Jostein, two warriors, that Hakon plans to kill Olaf by stealth instead of fighting him in the field of battle. &quot;Here, in this very wood,&quot; he says, &quot;shall Olaf be enticed by Thorer Klake, greeted with show of friendship, and then murdered.&quot; They are horrified but pretend to promise constant loyalty towards the earl. As Olaf approaches, Carlshoved decries far off &quot;the crimson banner with the milk-white cross&quot;, Jostein explaining: &quot;The red betokens valiant hero's courage, the white the peace of Christianity.&quot; With a retinue of monks, Olaf raises the banner on high and plants it firmly in the ground, exclaiming: &quot;The tree shall spread its mighty branches wide over the fatherland and in its shade shall friendship, love, and piety reside.&quot; Jostein and Carlshoved immediately reveal Thorer's intention, but the danger is averted on learning that Grib has stabbed his master with a poisoned dagger. Olaf then approaches Hakon in disguise, offering him an ultimatum: &quot;Choose between two courses: still be earl of Hlade as before and do me homage, or else take flight, for when we meet again it will be the time for red and bleeding brows.&quot; The earl chooses to fight. In a skirmish, Hakon' son, Erland, is killed. To inveigle the gods in his favor, he stabs to death his other son, Erlin. On hearing this, Einar changes side. Hakon is unable to defeat Olaf, and must hide in the castle of Thyra, a woman he deserted and whose two brothers he killed. Still loving him, she accepts to hide him in a subterranean cave. &quot;The pallid ghost you see was once great Norway's mighty lord,&quot; Hakon says mournfully of himself. In the cavern and alone with his man, Karker, Hakon hears about Olaf's offer of a reward for his head. Wearied, he falls asleep, but yet is seen walking in his sleep, crying out to Karker: &quot;It is over now. Here is my dagger, plunge it in my heart.&quot; A frightened Karker answers: &quot;That will but make you angry should you wake.&quot; Yet at last Karker stabs him to death. Olaf is crowned, but, on hearing how treacherously Hakon was murdered, he orders Karker to be hanged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Among American melodramas of the late 19th century, akin to the boulevard theatre of France, James A. Herne (1839-1901) is notable for &quot;Margaret Fleming&quot; (1890) and &quot;Shore Acres&quot; (1893), Augustin Daly for &quot;Under the gaslight&quot; (1867), Steele MacKaye (1842-1894) for &quot;Hazel Kirke&quot; (1880), and Alice Emma Ives (1874-1930) and Jerome H. Eddy (1834-1918) for &quot;The village postmaster&quot; (1894).

&quot;Hazel Kirke&quot; resembles George Eliot's novel, &quot;The mill on the Floss&quot; in that in both works a miller's daughter is prevented from marrying the man she loves because of her father's financial situation.

&quot;Margaret Fleming&quot; text at ?

Called for a consultation during Lena's childbirth, Doctor Larkin discovers that the father of the illegitimate baby is Philip Fleming, who explains he suggested to the girl an abortion and offered to pay her way out of town, but she declined both. A contrite Philip opens a bank account to his wife, Margaret, for the sum of $5,000 and to his baby girl a further $20,000 when she comes of age. He also gives his puzzled wife the deed to the house and land. Still full of guilt, Philip tells Larkin he intends to confess to his wife in a few years, but the doctor does not recommend it, because Margaret suffers from glaucoma, which may lead to blindness should she suffer under a powerful emotion. The Flemings' nurse-maid, Maria, tells Margaret that her sister, Lena, is dying of childbirth and requests to see her. When Margaret arrives, Lena is already dead. A distraught Maria discovers the father's identity by means of Lena's letter addressed to her mistress and shows it to her. Maria then waves a gun and threatens to shoot Philip, but is disarmed by Margaret. Against the doctor's advice, Margaret sends a message to her husband to come over and see the baby boy, and, taking pity on his lack of nourishment, she gives him her breast to suck. A distressed Philip leaves for Boston for a week and throws himself into the river, but is picked up in time and nursed at a local hospital. Meanwhile, Margaret loses her sight. Philip returns and is stunned on discovering his wife's blindness. He asks her whether she can forgive him. Margaret says she can, but when he touches her, she draws back. &quot;The wife-heart has gone out of me,&quot; she admits. A despairing Philip proposes to move away, but Margaret convinces him to remain, confident that  the two will eventually work it out.

&quot;Under the gaslight&quot; text at http://www.archive.org/details/undergaslighttot00daly  

Ray is engaged to be married to Laura. One evening, they receive a visit from Byke, introduced as Laura's music teacher, who requests a meeting with her. To Ray's surprise, she accepts to see him. Though known to everyone as her cousin, Pearl, in love with Ray herself, reveals to him that Laura is not her cousin, but was picked up by her parents from the streets as a child thief. Ray is stunned, starts to write a letter to Laura, then hesitates, and says little. At a social ball, Mrs Van Dam notices letters dropped from Ray's overcoat pocket, including one, unsealed and addressed to Laura, which, out of curiosity, she reads aloud to her friends, revealing Laura's origins. Instead of advancing towards Laura, Ray joins his friends. Laura must now work for her living. She finds a job consisting of touching up photographs. When the remorseful Ray returns to say he still loves her, Laura retorts: &quot;I know how to construe the love which you deny in the face of society, to offer me behind its back.&quot; Yet she agrees to go with him and see Pearl and her mother again. While Ray goes out for a carriage, Byke enters, reveals he is her father, and forces her to come with him to a police court, where he pleads his case before a judge. He explains that Laura was taken from him by rich people and now he wants her back, as &quot;the prop of my declining days,&quot; he says. Though Laura resists, challenging him to describe her clothing when she was found, he passes the test. He and his woman-accomplice, Judas, plan to keep Laura and blackmail Pearl once she marries Ray, but their plan is upset when the latter convinces the police patrol to seize them on a pier when about to enter a boat. As the police officers close in, Judas pushes Laura into the water, but she is rescued by Ray. Near Shrewsbury among his friends at Courtland's cottage, Ray lies despondent. Despite having asked to marry Pearl and been accepted, he has not forgotten Laura, who wants him to forget her. Worried about being found out again by the blackmailers, Laura leaves the party to sleep at the signal shed of a train station, where Ray's messenger-friend, Snorkey, is captured by Byke, tied up, and laid across the tracks while she is locked inside. Snorkey has found out that Byke and Judas intend to rob at the cottage. She at last finds an axe and cuts the wooodwork of the shed as his neck tingles above the tracks because of the arriving train, saving him just in time. While Pearl sleeps on a divan, Byke steals bracelets and diamonds at her house. She wakes up and screams, at which point Ray and Laura, informed by Snorkey, enter running to intercept the thief. Snorkey takes hold of him. Yet Byke, undeterred, threatens to expose Pearl as Judas' substituted child. Because of this disclosure, Pearl releases Ray from his marriage vow. Byke rejoices when they release him but is prevented from any further attempt at blackmail on learning of Judas' death in a road accident.

&quot;Hazel Kirke&quot;. Time: 1880s. Place: Blackburn, Lancashire, England. 

&quot;Hazel Kirke&quot; text at http://www.archive.org/details/hazelkirkedomest00mack

Seven years ago, Dunstan Kirke, a miller, was saved from financial ruin by Squire Aaron Rodney. In return, Dunstan encouraged his 14-year-old daughter, Hazel, to plight her troth to him, which she did. Aaron paid for her education so that she may do him honor as the lady of Rodney Hall. One day, Dunstan saves Arthur Carringford from drowning near his mill. Unknown to everyone, Arthur is a lord. After his accident, he is nursed back to health by Hazel. To Aaron's grief, a romantic attachment develops between the two. While Hazel distributes flowers to Arthur and a friend, Aaron stares inside her basket and utters: &quot;Emblems of my hopes; nothing but leaves, dead and withered leaves.&quot; When Dunstan's wife, Mercy, discovers this attachment, she asks her to forget him, but Aaron, staggering towards a chair, interrupts them: &quot;I know that you love her- that she loves you! Nay, ye need not be afeer'd, lass: I'm not the man to rail at or curse ye-I shall only-&quot;. He is more coherent when confronting Arthur: &quot;I have written to your mother, Mr. Carringford, begging her to call you away from here- I know the pride o' your race, sir. Your mother will never consent to your marriage with Hazel, and I warn ye- if ye seek to dishonor her, there is no living power will prevent me from murdering ye.&quot; When Dunstan discovers that Hazel wants to marry Arthur instead of Aaron, he disavows her. Hazel marries Arthur in Scotland, or so they think before Arthur's servant discloses that the Scottish ceremony occurred on English ground and is thereby void. While Arthur attempts to set this matter right, his dying mother, Lady Danvers, discovering her son's illegal marriage, implores Hazel to forget Arthur. &quot;My husband had a ward (Lady Maud), whose fortune he wrongfully used and lost,&quot; she informs her. &quot;Upon his dying bed, he confessed this to me, and made me promise to hide his shame by marrying our only son to that ward.&quot; Feeling betrayed by Arthur, Hazel leaves abruptly. Lady Danvers dies. Because of his daughter's treachery, Dunstan is forced to abandon his mill to Aaron to pay for his debts. Worse news yet: he catches a fever in the midst of this unhappiness and after it goes away, he loses his sight. When Aaron beholds Hazel seeking to return to her parents, he shows that he still wants her. &quot;Keep the old promise- become my wife,&quot; he pleads. She accepts provided her father consents, but the resentful man does not. In despair, Hazel throws herself in the water but is rescued by Arthur. He later reveals his wish to do everything he can to make the marriage possible. &quot;Well, I ordered my solicitor to settle my estate and satisfy every claim of Lady Maud's against my grandfather if it took the last penny he had in the world,&quot; he reveals. Poor but at least together, Arthur and Hazel prepare to marry again, this time with Dunstan's consent, but this becomes unnecessary because the servant was mistaken as to where the marriage occurred and it is therefore legal after all.

&quot;The village postmaster&quot; text at http://archive.org/details/villagepostmaste00ives

[[File:Hon. Amos Kendall. Postmaster General - NARA - 528675.tif|thumb|A United States postmaster of the 1860s]]

The village postmaster, Seth, has nothing against John, the Methodist parson's son, as a son-in-law for his daughter, Miranda, except he has not proven himself and he aims higher for her. &quot;I've spent a sight eddicatin' thet girl, an' the man thet marries Mirandy Huggins hez got to be somebody. He's got to be a good clus communion Baptist, too,&quot; he concludes. In contrast, when asked by Ben, a lawyer, he shows no objection of his courting her. Ben specifies that a man should court one woman at a time and John has been seen with Mary, a seamstress. Ben also has been courting Mary, but, in view of his improved prospects, he tells her he wants to break off their relations. Mary answers bitterly and pleadingly: &quot;As fer the love that ken stand one side for money, it's a poor sort thet I wouldn't own to. It ain't the sort I had for you, Ben. Ye know that well.&quot; When John approaches Miranda, she shows no sign of being interested in him, thinking he loves Hattie, though their engagement was broken off. John is easily discouraged, all the more so in thinking Miranda loves Ben. At Seth's farmyard, John tries out an invention of his: a feeder to a threshing machine while Seth's sister, Samantha, is being courted by the shy sexton, Ebenezer. Out of mischief, Seth's young son, Tom, throws apples on his head in the midst of his difficulties, then does the same to his aunt, till, bearing too heavily on the tree-limb in his eagerness to listen, he loses his balance and hangs on dangling between the two. Samantha grabs him by the collar and walks him in the house, but the interruption is enough to discompose Ebenezer. To be rid of Mary, Ben pretends to want to marry her out of town and offers her money to travel. Overjoyed, she believes him and takes the money. When John mentions to Miranda news of Hattie's marriage, she is surprised at his cheerful voice, till, to her contentment, he explains he does not love her. Discouraged at his inability to get anywhere with Miranda, Ben tries to push John in the threshing machine, but is knocked down by him. John then leaves town for several months to perfect his invention. When he returns, Ben is about to marry Miranda, who has had no word from John throughout this period, the same as he. Aiming to avenge herself on her forsworn lover, Mary explains to John that while Seth was ill, Ben replaced him at the post-office, insinuating he may have intercepted their letters. When this is found to be true, Seth announces to John with Miranda consenting: &quot;Take her with my blessin'.&quot; .

      <text xml:space="preserve">Among Swedish playwrights, a prominent place is accorded to Lars Norén (1944-?), among whose plays is the drama &quot;Natten är dagens mor&quot; (Night is mother to the day, 1982). Stig Dagerman (1923-1954) should also be remembered for his play &quot;Den game av sanning&quot; (The truth game, 1949).

[[File:Lars noren.jpg|thumb|Lars Norén, 2007]]

==&quot;Night is mother to the day&quot;==  

&quot;Night is mother to the day&quot;. Time: . Place: Sweden.

[[File:Stig Dagerman ca 1950.jpg|thumb|Stig Dagerman described how deeply a son can resent his father's infidelities towards his mother. Dagerman with his wife Anita Björk, 1950s]]

==&quot;The truth game&quot;==  

&quot;The truth game&quot;. Time: 1940s. Place: Sweden. 

Knut's wife, Alma, has just died in a butcher's shop. Their son, Bengt, receives the news very badly. He accuses his father of being at least partly responsible for her death because of his frequent absences. Knut denies this, though admitting he had an adulterous relation. Knut's sisters, Alice and Frida, quarrel about who should obtain the best items among the dead woman's wardrobe. Bengt resents seeing his paternal aunts wear his mother's clothes. He tells Berit, his girl-friend, he sometimes follows his father to the cinema house, where his mistress, Gun, works as a cashier. Although unsure whether his mother knew about their adultery, he yet accuses Knut of indifference to her, once buying a dress that did not fit. Indeed, he once heard his mother say: &quot;It looks as if it were bought for someone else.&quot;  Irritated at these accusations, Knut divulges he has evidence that his wife had her own adulterous relation. After mentioning that Gun will come to their house the next day, Bengt threatens to affront her. &quot;I will remind myself she killed my mother,&quot; he says. In Gun's cabin, Bengt confronts his father one more time. &quot;We must not judge others, Bengt,&quot; Knut affirms, to which he answers: &quot;Yes, we must, we must judge crimes.&quot; Bengt wishes to speak to Gun alone, which Knut at first does not agree with, but then relents. Bengt tells Gun he would have liked to place her against the wall, except there are no more walls. Unafraid, Gun asks him whether he liked his mother. He admits that was not the case, being especially disgusted at the sight of her fat body. After she locks the cabin door, Bengt places his head on her knees. She strokes his hair. Bergit, unable to enter, is forced to turn away. Months later, she tells Bengt she knows about his relation with Gun but yet loves him still. On the anniversary of his mother's death, Bengt learns that his father and Gun have published their wedding banns. Knut gives Alma's possessions to his sisters as gifts. Although Bengt is unwilling to accept his father's gift, a watch, Gun ties it on his wrist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you very much for putting this certification guide together. I think I will find it very helpful.
In return I would like to provide corrections and or any items I noted via this discussion forum as I am too new as a user of the wiki system to feel comfortable editing the text directly.

First item noted:
1. The introduction lists that test 640-801 can be taken but Cisco's site indicates that test has been retired. Please note: http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le11/learning_retired_certification_exams_list.html.

To show more detaile use [[:File:LogisticMap_BifurcationDiagram.png|tips]] by [[:commons:User:PAR:|User:PAR]]:

&quot;The horizontal axis is the r parameter, the vertical axis is the x variable. The image was created by forming a 1601 x 1001 array representing increments of 0.001 in r and x. A starting value of x=0.25 was used, and the map was iterated 1000 times in order to stabilize the values of x. 100,000 x -values were then calculated for each value of r and for each x value, the corresponding (x,r) pixel in the image was incremented by one. All values in a column (corresponding to a particular value of r) were then multiplied by the number of non-zero pixels in that column, in order to even out the intensities. Values above 250,000 were set to 250,000, and then the entire image was normalized to 0-255. Finally, pixels for values of r below 3.57 were darkened to increase visibility.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Comedies are the key-note of early 19th century theatre in the USA, including &quot;Fashion&quot; (1845) by Anna Cora Mowatt and &quot;Self&quot; (1856) by Sidney Frances Bateman (1823-1881). Both comedies are social satires, the first one on the blind adherence to foreign manners and the second on the blind adherence to one's interest. Though appearing later in the century, the historic drama &quot;Beau Brummell&quot; (1890) by Clyde Fitch (1865-1909) reproduces a Romantic-type atmosphere more typical of its early part.  The play is based on a noted friend of the prince regent, later King George IV (1762-1830, reign: 1820-1830). The story reproduces some key aspects of Beau Brummell's life (1778-1840), though diverging at the end, since the prince never forgave Beau, who died in poverty.

&quot;Fashion&quot; text at http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fashion 

Once a milliner, now a gentlewoman, Mrs Tiffany, intent on being in fashion, receives all her visits on a single day of the week. Twinkle, a poet, recites his verses. However, a second guest, Augustus Fogg, seems uninterested in anything. Mrs Tiffany and her daughter, Seraphina, wish especially to impress Count Jolimaître. They also welcome her husband's wealthy and honest friend, Trueman, amused at seeing such a load of pretentious behaviors and her finery. &quot;I see you make it a point to carry half your husband's shop upon your back!&quot; he remarks to his hostess. Her servant girl, Millinette, is startled to discover the count in the house. Both pretend not to recognize each other. Trueman remarks that, though richer, Mr Tiffany seems unhappier. Moreover, he does not like the look of Snobson, his confidential clerk. Although it is thought that Seraphina will marry Jolimaître, he flirts with her friend and house-guest, Gertrude, in so crude a manner that Trueman hits him with a stick, which causes Mrs Tiffany to be &quot;abimé with terror&quot;. From another friend of the family, Prudence, Trueman receives the false news that Seraphina favors Twinkle, but is well informed that Gertrude favors Colonel Howard. From Prudence's behavior, he guesses accurately that she herself has her eye on his own person. Despite her husband's financial difficulties, Mrs Tiffany goes forward with her grand ball. Mr Tiffany agrees but, to her irritation, insists on inviting Snobson, he being &quot;in the power of this man&quot; and a convenient match for Seraphina, an idea his wife considers a &quot;fow pas (faux pas, &quot;bad move&quot;). When Snobson enters, she formally wishes him &quot;Bung jure (&quot;bonjour&quot;) and asks: &quot;Comment vow porth, Monsur Snobson? (bad French for &quot;How do you do?)&quot; She removes him out of the way so that her daughter can speak alone with the count, who proposes marriage, to which Seraphina consents, though startled to learn it must be kept secret for the moment. When alone together, Millinette confronts Jolimaître. &quot;Ah! trompeur! Vat for you fly from Paris?&quot; she asks. &quot;Vat for you leave me- and I love you so much? Ven you sick- you almost die- did I not stay by you- take care of you- and you have no else friend?&quot; Their conversation is overheard by Gertrude, who agrees in keeping silent on the matter. During the ball, Mrs Tiffany is offended to see Gertrude dance with the count. To keep Millinette away from him, Gertrude proposes that she station herself with bouquets for the female guests, which the lady of the house considers a &quot;recherchi idea&quot;, likely to be &quot;all the rage in the bow-monde!&quot; Fogg is also here, not indifferent to suppers. Prudence surveys Gertrude, to her eyes acting suspiciously, and tells Trueman what she has noticed. In the darkness of a corner, Gertrude imitates Millinette's voice, by which her suspicions in regard to the count are confirmed. Trueman and Howard are downhearted at Gertrude's apparent frivolity and Mrs Tiffany, highly scandalized, orders her out of the house. Yet, the next day, reflecting a moment and glancing at Gertrude's letter of explanation as to her behavior, Trueman becomes convinced that her only intent was to expose the count as a fraud, a conclusion the colonel also tardily arrives at. Prudence is distraught at having to inform Mrs Tiffany that Seraphina has eloped with Jolimaître, to Mr Tiffany's despair but his wife's content. Now that Howard is found worthy of Gertrude, a match sure to have been made without the involvement of money, Trueman reveals she is his grand-daughter and a rich heiress. But Mrs Tiffany's confidence is shaken by Millinette's revelation of the count's true identity. On hearing of the elopement, Hobson drunkenly interrupts to expose Mr Tiffany as a forger. To the surprise of all, Seraphina reappears, not quite married. &quot;The clergyman wasn't at home- I came back for my jewels- the count said nobility couldn't get on without them,&quot; she explains. Elated, Tiffany begs her to marry Snobson instead and then begs Trueman to give him the money needed to cover his forgeries. Trueman is ashamed of him. He wakes the drunk Snobson to inform him he is an accessory to the forgeries, at which he quickly disappears. The count is forced to admit he is an imposter. He agrees to marry Millinette and is hired by Trueman according to his true vocation: a cook.

&quot;Self&quot; text at ?

Clemanthe Apex has been overspending and is unable to pay debts amounting to $12,000. When she asks her husband for money, he declares: &quot;There, madam, that is the rock on which you split.&quot; He specifies he is on the brink of bankruptcy, an answer she considers only a pretext. Desperate to achieve her aim, she asks Mary, her stepdaughter, for the money, she having recently received $15,000 from a dead aunt. Mary refuses as well, knowing her father would not approve of the loan. Her father himself is truly in financial trouble and his pride does not permit him to ask a loan from his ex-partner, John Unit. &quot;By a succession of unexpected circumstances, I am straitened for money,&quot; he tells Mary. She does not hesitate to give him a cheque for $15,000. More bad news arrive for Clemanthe as her son, Charles, loses $5,000 in a gambling debt which must soon be paid. Clemanthe says she cannot. &quot;But, I tell you, you have brought me up badly, and the result will be disgrace to us both,&quot; he retorts. Clemanthe can only find one solution: forge his half-sister's $15,000 cheque. Charles nervously does so. Meanwhile, John hears about the $5,000 loss, but Mary begs him not to divulge it to her father. &quot;An idle population, consuming and not producing, can never be made to pay!&quot; exclaims John, but he reluctantly agrees. Though not needing it anymore, Apex discovers Mary's cheque has already been cashed and for safety asks her to give him the money. Suspecting that her signature has been forged by Charles, whom she chooses to protect, she declines. Incensed, Apex throws her out of the house, she forced to live in a cheap boarding-house with only one servant to attend her. On learning of Mary's troubles, John proposes she accuse Charles, but she refuses. Unwillingly, he lends her the money as an installment in advance of his will. On his 60th birthday, he discovers that he has made a &quot;fatal mistake in the ledger of life&quot;. &quot;The assets that benevolent actions towards our fellow beings leave in the shape of love, respect, and sympathy are the only ones worth having, the only things that pay,&quot; he concludes. On finding out his half-sister's disgraceful condition, Charles is stunned and, against his mother's wishes, reveals the forgery to his astonished father, but all is resolved when John arrives with the money.

[[File:BrummellEngrvFrmMiniature.jpg|thumb|Beau Brummell tried to have everything, including money and a high-profile social life, and lost it all. 19th century engraving from an original miniature]]

Because of an excessively stylish life-style, Beau Brummell is pursued by many creditors. To help his case, he orders his servant to write a letter to Oliver Vincent, a rich cloth merchant, concerning his daughter's hand in marriage. Beau's nephew, Reginald, enters to inform him that he loves a woman, but is interrupted before he can mention who. Beau next receives the visit of one of his most determined creditors, Abrahams, who finally desists after hearing that the prince regent is about to come over. Reginald has been pursuing Mariana, Oliver's daughter, with the help of a servant-intermediary, Kathleen, whom he is startled to find in his uncle's house. On his side, Beau has been conducting an amorous relation with Mrs. Horatia St. Aubyn. When Horatia asks him whether he received her last letter, he responds: &quot;And your ambrosial lock of hair.&quot; But he did so to another woman, at which she is at first offended and then laughs it off. When the prince regent enters, he is eager to flirt with Horatia. After his guests leave, Beau receives the visit of Oliver, whom he confuses with his new tailor. He is distracted by his supposed tailor's gait: &quot;Would you be so kind as not to wobble about in that way?&quot; he asks with irritation. Oliver is unable to understand his host's attitude, so that he finally declares: &quot;I came to accept your offer of marriage, but I've altered my intention.&quot; However, when he learns that the prince regent has invited Beau to supper, he looks pleadingly at him so that the two may dine together. &quot;Send my polite regrets to his royal highness and say I dine tonight with Mr. Oliver Vincent,&quot; announces Beau to his servant. At Carlton House, residence of the prince regent, Beau discovers that Oliver's behavior is unbecoming to the prince. To secure the gratitude of his future father-in-law, he covers Oliver's retreat with self-possession and a look of humorous appeal towards the prince. When alone with Oliver, Beau seeks an immediate reward with ready cash and is immediately accepted. He is then accosted by Lord Manly, a drunken fop who has discovered that one of the guests is cheating at cards. What should he do? &quot;Well, if he has cards up his sleeve, bet on him,&quot; answers Beau. When alone together, Horatia accuses Beau of presenting her to the prince as a pleasant way to be rid of her: &quot;You have puffed the prince with the conceit that he is driving you out of my affections against your will. Suppose he were to know the truth?&quot; Beau is unafraid. He is also quite cool at discovering Lord Manly drunkenly flirting with his intended, Mariana. He admits to her: &quot;At first it was your fortune which allured me, but now it is yourself.&quot; A little later, Beau overhears a conversion between the prince and Horatia in a dark corner, in which she declares that there is too great a difference in their rank for the present relation to continue. Oliver confuses the pair with Beau and his daughter. The prince exclaims to her: &quot;I swear I will marry you,&quot; at which Oliver rushes forward and declares: &quot;And so you shall.&quot; Once more, Beau interposes to protect Oliver but this time he insults the prince. At the Mall, St. James Park, Beau's servant informs him that two bailiffs are set to arrest him for debts. &quot;You must prevent them by telling them of my marriage to the daughter of Mr. Oliver Vincent,&quot; pleads Beau. Meanwhile, Oliver begs his daughter to accept Beau in view of the position he lost in defending him: &quot;With the money your dowry will bring him, he can pay off his creditors and defy the prince. Without it, he can do neither and is utterly ruined,&quot; he says. In love with Reginald, Mariana turns her head away and bites her lip in frustration. Intent on obtaining Beau, Horatia proposes an agreement with Mariana: &quot;If you will promise to relinquish Mr Brummel, I will make the prince promise not to cut him, as he has sworn to do publicly today,&quot; she says. Mariana is offended and refuses. When Beau asks for Mariana's hand in marriage, she accepts, out of gratitude for her father's sake. To get rid of the bailiffs and unconscious of Horatia's intentions, Beau declares to them: &quot;The prince will be here presently, and I will speak to him.&quot; The prince cuts Beau, who is publicly disgraced. He nevertheless holds off the bailiffs with the announcement of his upcoming marriage. But when Reginald confronts Mariana, they discover that Kathleen, faithful to Beau's prospects, failed to deliver each other's letters. When Beau discovers their mutual love, he releases her from her promise. Although Reginald protests in view of the threat from the bailiffs, Beau remains adamant. He is forced to retreat to Calais, out of the world's eye, but is finally saved by the recently crowned king, who forgives him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The basics of independence==

If you own land, have a government, and a constant population, you're classed as a nation according to international law. However, you are only recognized as an independent nation when enough current nations agree that you are. 

The closest nation is the biggest hurdle.  They'll probably think that since they have more, and bigger, weapons than you, that means they can own your island.

If you can get them to accept that it's sovereign, you've got a good chance of success. You might even get their help convincing the rest of the nations to leave your tiny little island nation alone. Treaties are usually mutually beneficial.

Note that nations don't like the idea of new nations sprouting up all over. Not only does it make world politics more confusing, it's not in their interest 
to recognize new nations, as a new nation would have equivalent rights to these existing nations.

== Avoid aggravating other countries ==
In case you decide to build your own island nation, a good idea is to make sure that your island is placed in international waters before you declare independence. Avoid attention from other countries as your country is probably defenseless against any military and will have only a small population to defend itself.

== Who Owns the Ocean? ==
The Zones:
*Internal Waters: These are any bodies of water that are above the low-tide mark, such as rivers and deep bays.  You can do anything here.  These are within your territory in all respects, and you can expel other countries' ships from here even if they do not pose a risk to you because anyone passing within these waters without express permission is trespassing.  (However, some countries have agreed to allow ships free passage through some rivers to allow landlocked countries access to the sea.)
*Territorial Sea: 12 nautical miles about your territory, you can do anything you want, most notably harvesting minerals and fishing.  Any other countries' ships can pass through without danger, as long as they do not threaten you in any respects.  You can regulate other countries' ships' activities here.  You can expel other countries' warships, but in peacetime that is usually considered unnecessary.
*Contiguous Zone: Another 12 miles past the border of the territorial sea, you can enforce your customs, immigration, and sanitation in this area.  You can also engage in ''Hot Pursuit,'' or chasing lawbreakers.
*Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): You can do any kind of fishing and mineral exploration here.  You are trusted to use it wisely.  This zone extends as far as 200 nautical miles, making exceptions for countries that are closer together.  All natural resources in this area are yours and yours only, unless agreements have been made to the contrary.
*The High Seas: This extends beyond the EEZ, and anyone can do anything here, unless it is prohibited by international law.  That is why merchant ships carry guns.  The mineral resources out here are for anyone that can extract them.

Note though, that there still exist international laws against piracy. Essentially, if you commit piracy, you can be attacked wherever you may be. Some countries may use this as an excuse to attack you without warning, claiming that your declaration of independence is an act of piracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Where to claim?==

Space is enormous, so you might ask, ''What should I claim?''  Well, there are a lot of places in space, and many of these are probably worth claiming, but a good place to start would be one of our own planets.  These are certainly worth claiming; the inner, rocky planets and the many dwarf planets have vast mineral resources and incredible landscapes, the gas giants have dozens of moons with these and are also valuable sources of hydrogen and helium, and the ice giants have all of these plus their impressive appearance.  But you can't claim ''all'' of the solar system; other nations are certain to go to war with you over that!  A better idea might be to claim a portion of the Moon, or of Mars or Venus, or a single moon of one of the gas or ice giants.

The Alliance of Extraterrestrial Micronations is an intermicronational organization that hopes to help coordinate extraterrestrial claims, and assist new micronations select land to claim.

===Warning: Several micronations already have outer space claims===
[[File:Flag of Aerica.svg|thumb|left|200px|The Aerican Empire claims several territories in outer space.]]
[[File:Flag of the Republic of Molossia.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Republic of Molossia claims a territory on Venus named &quot;Vesperia Venus Territory.&quot;]]
[[File:Zadoniaflag.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|The KIngdom of Zadonia has claimed the 4 moons of Jupiter.]]

But when you're claiming outer space, be careful.  Several micronations have already made claims on other planets.  For instance, the Republic of Molossia has claimed a territory, called ''Vesperia Venus Territory'', on Venus, and the Aerican Empire has made claims to two extraterrestrial territories, the Colony of Mars (720 acres of land on Mars), and Northern Plutopia (the northern hemisphere of Pluto). The Federated Republic of Xylvakye passed executive order #1 on October 24, 2012. This claims the planets Mercury, Northern Venus,  all remaining land on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Southern Plutopia. The Kingdom of Zadonia has claimed the 4 moons of Jupiter, Callipsto, Io, Ganymede, and Europa.

 If you claim any territory in these areas, it could lead to war.  Beware!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mexican theatre starts the 20th century with a strong rural drama in &quot;La venganza de la gleba&quot; (The vengeance of the rabble, 1905) by Federico Gamboa (1864-1939). Also of note is the drama &quot;En familia&quot; (In the family, 1905) by Florencio Sánchez (1875-1910), born in Uruguay but whose plays were first presented in Argentina.

==&quot;The vengeance of the rabble&quot;==

&quot;The vengeance of the rabble&quot;. Time: 1900s. Place: Mexico.

[[File:FlorencioSanchez.JPG|thumb|Florencio Sanchez wrote about the financial ravages brought about by gambling habits on a family]]

==&quot;In the family&quot;==   

&quot;In the family&quot;. Time: 1900s. Place: Buenos Aires, Argentina.

&quot;In the family&quot; text at ? 

The Ocuna family prepare to receive Damian, the eldest son, and his wife, Delfina for dinner. But his mother, Mercedes, worries that they do not have the money to pay for it. Eduardo, her younger son, is no help, specifying he does not like work and is determined to live unashamedly as their parasite. She hopes her husband, Jorge, will arrive with money: vain hope! &quot;I don't have a radish,&quot; he admits, having gambled it all away. She is forced to ask Damian to pay for his own dinner and exposes the true state of their finances. Damian admonishes his father for being so improvident. &quot;One takes a pick to work the earth,&quot; he urges, but he is unable to, preferring to gamble. In this desperate situation, Damian proposes to take charge of the entire family. He asks everyone to contribute except his father, but is not encouraged by what he sees. After asking his sister, Laura, to type a brochure for him, she admits she has not done it yet. He scolds her, to which she replies: &quot;Here's the couch-grass in the salad!&quot; and wanders negligently off. Delfina has lost her ring. Eduardo reveals that his younger brother, Tomas, pawned it, but it is retrieved by the mother. After spending the night out, Jorge returns back home. When Mercedes asks him where he was, he answers he does not know, but needs money. Without her knowing it, Damian asks his father to take out money from his bank account for a friend. Meanwhile, Laura has ordered an expensive dress for herself. Damian says he cannot pay for it, then changes his mind. On learning of the money transaction, Mercedes already weeps in fear that her husband has stolen it for gambling. All too true. Unable to pay, Damian says to his father he will call the police, at which Jorge leaves without a word. &quot;O, Delfina, I want to cry, to yell with pain,&quot; says Damian. &quot;Yes, cry, my poor Don Quixote!&quot; his wife replies consolingly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides. As first discovered by James D. Watson and Francis Crick, the structure of DNA of all species comprises two helical chains each coiled round the same axis, and each with a pitch of 34 Ångströms (3.4 nanometres) and a radius of 10 Ångströms (1.0 nanometres). According to another study, when measured in a particular solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26 Ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6 nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3 Å (0.33 nm) long. Although each individual repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions of nucleotides. For instance, the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, is approximately 220 million base pairs long.
In living organisms, DNA does not usually exist as a single molecule, but instead as a pair of molecules that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, in the shape of a double helix. The nucleotide repeats contain both the segment of the backbone of the molecule, which holds the chain together, and a base, which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix. A base linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. If multiple nucleotides are linked together, as in DNA, this polymer is called a polynucleotide.
The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are called the 5′ (five prime) and 3′ (three prime) ends, with the 5' end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3' end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA&amp;oldid=424928563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Andrew; Watson, James D. (2003). DNA: the secret of life. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 0-375-41546-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among the aromatic bases. In the aqueous environment of the cell, the conjugated π bonds of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule, minimizing their interaction with the solvation shell and therefore, the Gibbs free energy. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (abbreviated A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These four bases are attached to the sugar/phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate.
These bases are classified into two types; adenine and guanine are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds called purines, while cytosine and thymine are six-membered rings called pyrimidines. A fifth pyrimidine base, called uracil (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine. In addition to RNA and DNA, a large number of artificial nucleic acid analogues have also been created to study the proprieties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA&amp;oldid=424928563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Andrew; Watson, James D. (2003). DNA: the secret of life. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 0-375-41546-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA is a genetic material==
[[Image:Griffith experiment.svg|thumb|250px|right|Griffith's experiment discovering the &quot;transforming principle&quot; in pneumococcus bacteria.]]
===Griffith's experiment===
Griffith's experiment was conducted in 1928 by Frederick Griffith, one of the first experiments suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation.
Griffith used two strains of ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' bacteria which infect mice – a type III-S (smooth) and type II-R (rough) strain. The III-S strain covers itself with a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the host's immune system, resulting in the death of the host, while the II-R strain doesn't have that protective capsule and is defeated by the host's immune system. A German bacteriologist, Fred Neufeld, had discovered the three pneumococcal types (Types I, II, and III) and discovered the Quellung reaction to identify them in vitro. Until Griffith's experiment, bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable, from one generation to another.
In this experiment, bacteria from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither alone harmed the mice, the combination was able to kill its host. Griffith was also able to isolate both live II-R and live III-S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice. Griffith concluded that the type II-R had been &quot;transformed&quot; into the lethal III-S strain by a &quot;transforming principle&quot; that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.
Today, we know that the &quot;transforming principle&quot; Griffith observed was the DNA of the III-S strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the protective polysaccharide capsule. Equipped with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was verified in the experiments done by Avery, McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase.&lt;ref&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith's_experiment Griffith experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hershey Chase experiments===

Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase conducted  series of experiments  in 1952 by , confirming that DNA was the genetic material, which had first been demonstrated in the 1944 Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment. These experiments are known as '''Hershey Chase experiments'''. The existence of DNA was known to biologists since 1869, most of them assumed that proteins carried the information for inheritance that time.
Hershey and Chase conducted their experiments on the T2 phage. The phage consists of a protein shell containing its genetic material. The phage infects a bacterium by attaching to its outer membrane and injecting its genetic material and leaving its empty shell attached to the bacterium.

In their first set of experiments, Hershey and Chase labeled the DNA of phages with radioactive Phosphorus-32 (p32) (the element phosphorus is present in DNA but not present in any of the 20 amino acids which are component of proteins). They allowed the phages to infect E. coli, and through several elegant experiments were able to observe the transfer of P32 labeled phage DNA into the cytoplasm of the bacterium.
In their second set of experiments, they labeled the phages with radioactive Sulfur-35 (Sulfur is present in the amino acids cysteine and methionine, but not in DNA). Following infection of E. coli they then sheared the viral protein shells off of infected cells using a high-speed blender and separated the cells and viral coats by using a centrifuge. After separation, the radioactive S35 tracer was observed in the protein shells, but not in the infected bacteria, supporting the hypothesis that the genetic material which infects the bacteria was DNA and not protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey%E2%80%93Chase_experiment Hershey–Chase experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, A.D. and Chase, M. (1952) Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage. J Gen Physiol. 36:39–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his “discoveries concerning the genetic structure of viruses.”'''

Two helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found by tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not directly opposite each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, '''the major groove, is 22 Å''' wide and the other, the '''minor groove, is 12 Å wide'''. The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell, but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA&amp;oldid=427633053&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Base pairing Of DNA===
[[Image:DNA Overview.png|thumb|200px|Structure of DNA.]]
'''Chargaff's rules was given by Erwin Chargaff which state that DNA from any cell of all organisms should have a 1:1 ratio of pyrimidine and purine bases and, more specifically, that the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine.''' This pattern is found in both strands of the DNA. They were discovered by Austrian chemist Erwin Chargaff.

In molecular biology, two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA strands that are connected via hydrogen bonds are called a base pair (often abbreviated '''bp'''). In the canonical Watson-Crick DNA base pairing, Adenine (A) forms a base pair with Thymine (T) and Guanine (G) forms a base pair with Cytosine (C). '''In RNA, thymine is replaced by Uracil (U).''' Alternate hydrogen bonding patterns, such as the wobble base pair and Hoogsteen base pair, also occur—particularly in RNA—giving rise to complex and functional tertiary structures. &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair Base pair]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example'''

  5'CTCGTTTGCGCTCTATCG3'
  3'GAGCAAACGCGAGATAGC5'

====Purine base====
The German chemist Emil Fischer in 1884 gave the name 'purine' (purum uricum). He synthesized it for the first time in 1899 by uric acid  which had been isolated from kidney stones by Scheele in 1776. Beside from DNA and RNA, purines are also components in a number of other important biomolecules, such as ATP, GTP, cyclic AMP, NADH, and coenzyme A. Purine itself, has not been found in nature, but it can be produced by organic synthesis.'''A purine is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound, consisting of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring.''' 

'''Example:'''

[[Image:purines.gif]]

====Adenine====
Adenine is one of the two purine nucleobases (the other being guanine) used in forming nucleotides of the nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). In DNA, adenine binds to thymine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose. It forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine.

====Guanine====
Guanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. 

Guanine has two tautomeric forms, the major keto form and rare enol form. It binds to cytosine through three hydrogen bonds. In cytosine, the amino group acts as the hydrogen donor and the C-2 carbonyl and the N-3 amine as the hydrogen-bond acceptors. Guanine has a group at C-6 that acts as the hydrogen acceptor, while the group at N-1 and the amino group at C-2 act as the hydrogen donors.

===Pyrimidine base===
[[Image:Thymine chemical structure.png|thumb|right|107px|Chemical structure of thymine]]
[[File:Cytosine chemical structure.svg|thumb|left|100px|Cytosine with numbered components. Methylation occurs on carbon number 5.]]
[[Image:Uracil chemical structure.png|thumb|right|102px|Chemical structure of uracil]]

Pyrimidine is a ''heterocyclic'' aromatic organic compound similar to benzene and pyridine, containing two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3 of the six-member ring. It is isomeric with two other forms of diazine.Three nucleobases found in nucleic acids, '''cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U)''', are pyrimidine derivatives.

A pyrimidine has many properties in common with pyridine, as the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring increases the ring pi electrons become less energetic and electrophilic aromatic substitution gets more difficult while nucleophilic aromatic substitution gets easier. An example of the last reaction type is the displacement of the amino group in 2-aminopyrimidine by chlorine and its reverse. Reduction in resonance stabilization of pyrimidines may lead to addition and ring cleavage reactions rather than substitutions. One such manifestation is observed in the Dimroth rearrangement.
Compared to pyridine, N-alkylation and N-oxidation is more difficult, and pyrimidines are also less basic: The pKa value for protonated pyrimidine is '''1.23''' compared to '''5.30''' for pyridine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine Pyrimidine]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Pyrimidine also is found in meteorites, although scientists still do not know its origin.''' Pyrimidine also photolytically decomposes into Uracil under UV light.

[[Image:Cytosine chemical structure.png|thumb|left|101px|Chemical structure of cytosine]] 

====Cytosine==== 
Cytosine can be found as part of DNA, as part of RNA, or as a part of a nucleotide. As ''cytidine triphosphate (CTP)'', it can act as a co-factor to enzymes, and can transfer a phosphate to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP).The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine.
In DNA and RNA, '''cytosine is paired with guanine'''. However, it is inherently unstable, and can change into uracil (spontaneous deamination). This can lead to a point mutation if not repaired by the DNA repair enzymes such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA.

Cytosine can also be methylated into 5-methylcytosine by an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase or be methylated and hydroxylated to make 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution. The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Cytosine]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thymine====
Thymine (T, Thy) is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of DNA that are represented by the letters G–C–A–T. The others are adenine, guanine, and cytosine. Thymine is also known as 5-methyluracil, a pyrimidine nucleobase. As the name suggests, thymine may be derived by methylation of uracil at the 5th carbon. In RNA, thymine is replaced with uracil in most cases. In DNA, thymine(T) binds to adenine (A) via two hydrogen bonds, thus stabilizing the nucleic acid structures.



====Uracil==== 
Uracil found in RNA, it base-pairs with adenine and replaces thymine during DNA transcription. Methylation of uracil produces thymine. It turns into thymine to protect the DNA and to improve the efficiency of DNA replication. Uracil can base-pair with any of the bases, depending on how the molecule arranges itself on the helix, but readily pairs with adenine because the methyl group is repelled into a fixed position. Uracil pairs with adenine through hydrogen bonding. Uracil is the hydrogen bond acceptor and can form two hydrogen bonds. Uracil can also bind with a ribose sugar to form the ribonucleoside uridine. When a phosphate attaches to uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate is produced.

Nucleosides are glycosylamines consisting of a nucleobase (often referred to as simply base) bound to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar via a beta-glycosidic linkage. Examples of nucleosides include cytidine, uridine, adenosine, guanosine, thymidine and inosine.
Nucleosides can be phosphorylated by specific kinases in the cell on the sugar's primary alcohol group (-CH2-OH), producing nucleotides, which are the molecular building-blocks of DNA and RNA&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nucleoside&amp;oldid=419856059&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nucleosides can be produced by de novo synthesis pathways, in particular in the liver, but they are more abundantly supplied via ingestion and digestion of nucleic acids in the diet, whereby nucleotidases break down nucleotides (such as the thymine nucleotide) into nucleosides (such as thymidine) and phosphate. 

1. Adenosine is a nucleoside composed of a molecule of adenine attached to a ribose sugar molecule (ribofuranose) moiety via a β-N9-glycosidic bond.

2.Cytidine is a nucleoside molecule that is formed when cytosine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond. Cytidine is a component of RNA.

3.Guanosine is a purine nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). 

4.Thymidine (more precisely called deoxythymidine; can also be labelled deoxyribosylthymine, and thymine deoxyriboside) is a chemical compound, more precisely a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA.

If cytosine is attached to a deoxyribose ring, it is known as a deoxycytidine.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nucleoside&amp;oldid=419856059&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nucleotide===
[[Image:Nucleotides 1.svg|thumb|left|600px|Structural elements of the most common nucleotides]]
A nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase (nitrogenous base), a five-carbon sugar (either ribose or 2'-deoxyribose), and one to three phosphate groups. Together, the nucleobase and sugar comprise a nucleoside. The phosphate groups form bonds with either the 2, 3, or 5-carbon of the sugar, with the 5-carbon site most common. Cyclic nucleotides form when the phosphate group is bound to two of the sugar's hydroxyl groups. Ribonucleotides are nucleotides where the sugar is ribose, and deoxyribonucleotides contain the sugar deoxyribose. Nucleotides can contain either a purine or a pyrimidine base.
Nucleic acids are polymeric macromolecules made from nucleotide monomers. In DNA, the purine bases are adenine and guanine, while the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine. RNA uses uracil in place of thymine. Adenine always pairs with thymine by 2 hydrogen bonds, while guanine pairs with cytosine through 3 hydrogen bonds, each due to their unique structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nucleotide&amp;oldid=422383586&lt;/ref&gt;

A deoxyribonucleotide is the monomer, or single unit, of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. Each deoxyribonucleotide comprises three parts: a nitrogenous base, a deoxyribose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. The nitrogenous base is always bonded to the 1' carbon of the deoxyribose, which is distinguished from ribose by the presence of a proton on the 2' carbon rather than an -OH group. The phosphate groups bind to the 5' carbon of the sugar.
When deoxyribonucleotides polymerize to form DNA, the phosphate group from one nucleotide will bond to the 3' carbon on another nucleotide, forming a phosphodiester bond via dehydration synthesis. New nucleotides are always added to the 3' carbon of the last nucleotide, so synthesis always proceeds from 5' to 3'&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nucleotide&amp;oldid=422383586&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Phosphodiester bond'''

A phosphodiester bond is a group of strong covalent bonds between a phosphate group and two 5-carbon ring carbohydrates (pentoses) over two ester bonds. Phosphodiester bonds are central to most life on Earth, as they make up the backbone of the strands of DNA. In DNA and RNA, the phosphodiester bond is the linkage between the 3' carbon atom of one sugar molecule and the 5' carbon of another, deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.
The phosphate groups in the phosphodiester bond are negatively-charged. Because the phosphate groups have a pKa near 0, they are negatively-charged at pH 7. This repulsion forces the phosphates to take opposite sides of the DNA strands and is neutralized by proteins (histones), metal ions such as magnesium, and polyamines.
In order for the phosphodiester bond to be formed and the nucleotides to be joined, the tri-phosphate or di-phosphate forms of the nucleotide building blocks are broken apart to give off energy required to drive the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. When a single phosphate or two phosphates known as pyrophosphates break away and catalyze the reaction, the phosphodiester bond is formed.
Hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds can be catalyzed by the action of phosphodiesterases which play an important role in repairing DNA sequences.
In biological systems, the phosphodiester bond between two ribonucleotides can be broken by alkaline hydrolysis because of the free 2' hydroxyl group&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phosphodiester_bond&amp;oldid=407638927&lt;/ref&gt;.

After DNA has been separated and purified by standard biochemical techniques one has a sample in a jar much like in the figure at the top of this article.  Below are the main steps involved in generating structural information from X-ray diffraction studies of oriented DNA fibers that are drawn from the hydrated DNA sample with the help of molecular models of DNA that are combined with crystallographic and mathematical analysis of the X-ray patterns.

===Paracrystalline lattice models of B-DNA structures===

[[File:Silica.svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Silica]] glass is another example of a material which is organized into a paracrystalline lattice.]]

A paracrystalline lattice, or paracrystal, is a molecular or atomic lattice with significant amounts (e.g., larger than a few percent) of partial disordering of molecular arrangements. Limiting cases of the paracrystal model are nanostructures, such as [[glass]]es, [[liquid]]s, etc., that may possess only local ordering and no global order. A simple example of a paracrystalline lattice is shown in the following figure for a silica glass:

Liquid crystals also have paracrystalline rather than crystalline structures.

Highly hydrated B-DNA occurs naturally in living cells in such a paracrystalline state, which is a dynamic one in spite of the relatively rigid DNA double-helix stabilized by parallel hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide base-pairs in the two complementary, helical DNA chains (see figures). For simplicity most DNA molecular models omit both water and ions dynamically bound to B-DNA, and are thus less useful for understanding the dynamic behaviors of B-DNA ''in vivo''. The physical and mathematical analysis of X-ray&lt;ref&gt;Hosemann R., Bagchi R.N., ''Direct analysis of diffraction by matter'', North-Holland Publs., Amsterdam – New York, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baianu, I.C. |title=X-ray scattering by partially disordered membrane systems.|journal=Acta Cryst., |volume=A34 |issue=5 |pages=751–3|year=1978|doi=10.1107/S0567739478001540}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spectroscopic data for paracrystalline B-DNA is therefore much more complicated than that of crystalline, A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns. The paracrystal model is also important for DNA technological applications such as [[DNA nanotechnology]]. Novel techniques that combine X-ray diffraction of DNA with X-ray microscopy in hydrated living cells are now also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto Y, Shinohara K |title=Application of X-ray microscopy in analysis of living hydrated cells |journal=Anat.

==='''Forms of DNA'''===

'''A-DNA:''' A-DNA is one of the many possible double helical structures of DNA. A-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along with B- and Z-DNA. It is a right-handed double helix fairly similar to the more common and well-known B-DNA form, but with a shorter more compact helical structure. It appears likely that it occurs only in dehydrated samples of DNA, such as those used in crystallographic experiments, and possibly is also assumed by DNA-RNA hybrid helices and by regions of double-stranded RNA&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-DNA&amp;oldid=379025458&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''B-DNA'''The most common form of DNA is B-DNA. The DNA double helix is a spiral polymer of nucleic acids, held together by nucleotides which base pair together. In B-DNA, the most common double helical structure, the double helix is right-handed with about 10–10.5 nucleotides per turn. The double helix structure of DNA contains a major groove and minor groove, the major groove being wider than the minor groove. Given the difference in widths of the major groove and minor groove, many proteins which bind to DNA do so through the wider major groove.
The geometry of a base, or base pair step can be characterized by 6 coordinates: Shift, slide, rise, tilt, roll, and twist. These values precisely define the location and orientation in space of every base or base pair in a nucleic acid molecule relative to its predecessor along the axis of the helix. Together, they characterize the helical structure of the molecule. In regions of DNA or RNA where the &quot;normal&quot; structure is disrupted, the change in these values can be used to describe such disruption.
For each base pair, considered relative to its predecessor, there are the following base pair geometries to consider:

Shear: bases appear as though they have moved past one another on the xy-plane.

Stretch: two bases are stretched apart in the horizontal direction.

Stagger: bases have both moved past one another and stretched apart on the xy-plane.

Buckle: the ends of the bases that do not touch are inclined upwards towards the z-axis.

Propeller twist: rotation of one base with respect to the other in the same base pair.

Opening: bases touch at one side, but lean apart at the other side.

Shift: displacement along an axis in the base-pair plane perpendicular to the first, directed from the minor to the major groove.

Slide: displacement along an axis in the plane of the base pair directed from one strand to the other.

Rise: displacement along the helix axis.

Tilt: rotation around this axis.

vRoll: rotation around this axis.

Twist: rotation around the helix axis.

Rise and twist determine the handedness and pitch of the helix. The other coordinates, by contrast, can be zero. Slide and shift are typically small in B-DNA, but are substantial in A- and Z-DNA. Roll and tilt make successive base pairs less parallel, and are typically small. A diagram of these coordinates can be found in 3DNA website.
Note that &quot;tilt&quot; has often been used differently in the scientific literature, referring to the deviation of the first, inter-strand base-pair axis from perpendicularity to the helix axis. This corresponds to slide between a succession of base pairs, and in helix-based coordinates is properly termed &quot;inclination&quot;.

'''TA-DNA:''' TA-DNA is a form of DNA that is most closely related to A-DNA in terms of structure. The TA-DNA helix is right handed like A-DNA, and it The most noticeable difference between the two forms is that TA-DNA has a greater inclination of its base pairs at an angle of approximately 50 degrees with respect to the helix axis. Because of this, TA-DNA is sometimes described as tilted A-DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Rohs, Remo, Xiangshu Jin, Sean M. West, Rohit Joshi, Barry Honig, and Richard S. Mann. &quot;Origins of Specificity in Protein-DNA Recognition.&quot; Annual Reviews. N.p., 24 03 2010.

'''Z-DNA:''' Z-DNA is one of the many possible double helical structures of DNA. It is a left-handed double helical structure in which the double helix winds to the left in a zig-zag pattern (instead of to the right, like the more common B-DNA form). Z-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along with A- and B-DNA. Z-DNA is quite different from the right-handed forms. In fact, Z-DNA is often compared against B-DNA in order to illustrate the major differences. The Z-DNA helix is left-handed and has a structure that repeats every 2 base pairs. The major and minor grooves, unlike A- and B-DNA, show little difference in width. Formation of this structure is generally unfavourable, although certain conditions can promote it; such as alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence (especially poly(dGC)2), negative DNA supercoiling or high salt and some cations (all at physiological temperature, 37°C, and pH 7.3-7.4). Z-DNA can form a junction with B-DNA (called a &quot;B-to-Z junction box&quot;) in a structure which involves the extrusion of a base pair. The Z-DNA conformation has been difficult to study because it does not exist as a stable feature of the double helix. Instead, it is a transient structure that is occasionally induced by biological activity and then quickly disappears.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Z-DNA&amp;oldid=418927717&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang H, Yu H, Ren J, Qu X (2006). &quot;Reversible B/Z-DNA transition under the low salt condition and non-B-form polydApolydT selectivity by a cubane-like europium-L-aspartic acid complex&quot;.

'''Minor and Major Grooves of DNA:''' The minor and major grooves of DNA are characteristic of the type of DNA in which they are a part of. They are very important because they not only make up the characteristic structure of A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA, but their differences determine the interaction of these DNA with various proteins. The wideness, narrowness, deepness, shallowness, and the electrostatic potential found within these grooves all play an important role in determining how the DNA will react with certain proteins, with which proteins it will react, and whether or not certain parts will be likely to react at all.&lt;ref&gt;Rohs, Remo, Xiangshu Jin, Sean M.

'''Differences in the Relative Charges of A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA:''' For all forms of DNA the global structure has an overall negative charge and the overall electrostatic potential is negative. This is largely due to the phosphate groups of DNA which bear an overall negative charge due to the negatively charged oxygen atoms they have. However, DNA has both positive and negative charges covering its outer structure. The charge dispersion over the global structure of DNA varies between A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA.  A-DNA has mostly negative electrostatic potential throughout but concentrated mostly in the site of the major groove. It also has neutral electrostatic potential spread widely throughout the rest of its structure besides the major groove. Finally, A-DNA has sparse positive charges scattered along its surface. B-DNA has mostly negative electrostatic potential spread throughout its global exterior and concentrated mostly in major and minor grooves. It has some positively charged surface area scattered sparsely over its surface and mostly peppered within the wide major groove. Z-DNA has a negatively charged minor groove and the indistinct area where a major groove would normally be has slight positive charged places. Overall, the Z-DNA has a negative charge in all of its global structure. The structures of A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA have an overall negative charge.

==Coiling of DNA==
[[Image:Circular DNA Supercoiling.png|thumb|400px|right|Supercoiled structure of circular DNA molecules with low writhe. Note that the helical nature of the DNA duplex is omitted for clarity.]]
[[Image:Linear DNA Supercoiling.png|thumb|400px|right|Supercoiled structure of linear DNA molecules with constrained ends. Note that the helical nature of the DNA duplex is omitted for clarity.]]
DNA supercoiling is important for DNA packaging within all cells. Because the length of DNA can be thousands of times that of a cell, packaging this genetic material into the cell or nucleus (in eukaryotes) is a difficult feat. Supercoiling of DNA reduces the space and allows for a lot more DNA to be packaged. In prokaryotes, plectonemic supercoils are predominant, because of the circular chromosome and relatively small amount of genetic material. In eukaryotes, DNA supercoiling exists on many levels of both plectonemic and solenoidal supercoils, with the solenoidal supercoiling proving most effective in compacting the DNA. Solenoidal supercoiling is achieved with histones to form a 10nm fiber. This fiber is further coiled into a 30nm fiber, and further coiled upon itself numerous times more.
DNA packaging is greatly increased during nuclear division events such as mitosis or meiosis, where DNA must be compacted and segregated to daughter cells. Condensins and cohesins are Structural Maintenance of Chromosome proteins that aid in the condensation of sister chromatids and the linkage of the centromere in sister chromatids. These SMC proteins induce positive supercoils.
Supercoiling is also required for DNA/RNA synthesis. Because DNA must be unwound for DNA/RNA polymerase action, supercoils will result. The region ahead of the polymerase complex will be unwound; this stress is compensated with positive supercoils ahead of the complex. Behind the complex, DNA is rewound and there will be compensatory negative supercoils. It is important to note that topoisomerases such as DNA gyrase (Type II Topoisomerase) play a role in relieving some of the stress during DNA/RNA synthesis&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_supercoil&amp;oldid=417575151&lt;/ref&gt;.

NA supercoiling can be described numerically by changes in the '[[linking number]]' Lk. The linking number is the most descriptive property of supercoiled DNA. Lk&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of turns in the relaxed (B type) DNA plasmid/molecule, is determined by dividing the total base pairs of the molecule by the relaxed bp/turn which, depending on reference is 10.4-10.5. 
: &lt;math&gt;Lk_o=bp/10.4&lt;/math&gt;
Lk is merely the number of crosses a single strand makes across the other in a planar projection. The topology of the DNA is described by the equation below in which the linking number is equivalent to the sum of TW, which is the number of twists or turns of the double helix, and Wr which is the number of coils or 'writhes'. If there is a closed DNA molecule, the sum of TW and Wr, or the linking number, does not change. However, there may be complementary changes in TW and Wr without changing their sum. 
:&lt;math&gt;Lk=Tw+Wr&lt;/math&gt;
The change in the linking number, ΔLk, is the actual number of turns in the plasmid/molecule, Lk, minus the number of turns in the relaxed plasmid/molecule Lk&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta{Lk=Lk-Lk_o}&lt;/math&gt;
If the DNA is negatively supercoiled ΔLk &lt; 0. The negative supercoiling implies that the DNA is underwound.

A standard expression independent of the molecule size is the &quot;specific linking difference&quot; or &quot;superhelical density&quot; denoted σ. σ represents the number of turns added or removed relative to the total number of turns in the relaxed molecule/plasmid, indicating the level of supercoiling.
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\Delta{Lk/Lk_o}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_supercoil&amp;oldid=417575151&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gibbs free energy]] associated with the coiling is given by the equation below&lt;ref name=&quot;Vologodskii1979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vologodskii AV, Lukashin AV, Anshelevich VV, ''et al.'' |title=Fluctuations in superhelical DNA |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=6 |pages=967–682 |year=1979 |doi=10.1093/nar/6.3.967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta G/N=10RT \sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The linking number is a numerical invariant that describes the linking of two closed curves in three-dimensional space. Intuitively, the linking number represents the number of times that each curve winds around the other. The linking number is always an integer, but may be positive or negative depending on the orientation of the two curves&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_supercoil&amp;oldid=417575151&lt;/ref&gt;.
Since the linking number ''L'' of supercoiled DNA is the number of times the two strands are intertwined (and both strands remain covalently intact), ''L'' cannot change. The reference state (or parameter) ''L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a circular DNA duplex is its relaxed state. In this state, its writhe ''W'' = 0. Since ''L = T + W'', in a relaxed state ''T = L''. Thus, if we have a 400 bp relaxed circular DNA duplex, ''L ~ 40'' (assuming ~10 bp per turn in B-DNA). Then ''T ~ 40''.

*Positively supercoiling:
*:T = 0, W = 0, then L = 0
*:T = +3, W = 0, then L = +3
*:T = +2, W = +1, then L = +3
*Negatively supercoiling:
*:T = 0, W = 0, then L = 0
*:T = -3, W = 0, then L = -3
*:T = -2, W = -1, then L = -3

Negative supercoils favor local unwinding of the DNA, allowing processes such as [[DNA transcription|transcription]], [[DNA replication]], and [[DNA recombination|recombination]]. Negative supercoiling is also thought to favour the transition between B-DNA and [[Z-DNA]], and moderate the interactions of DNA binding proteins involved in [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Plant Biotechnology |author=H. S. Chawla |publisher=Science Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=1578082285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_supercoil&amp;oldid=417575151&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA sequencing==
RNA sequencing was one of the earliest forms of nucleotide sequencing. The major landmark of RNA sequencing is the sequence of the first complete gene and the complete genome of Bacteriophage MS2, identified and published by Walter Fiers and his coworkers at the University of Ghent (Ghent, Belgium), between 1972 and 1976.
Prior to the development of rapid DNA sequencing methods in the early 1970s by Frederick Sanger at the University of Cambridge, in England and Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam at Harvard, a number of laborious methods were used. For instance, in 1973, Gilbert and Maxam reported the sequence of 24 basepairs using a method known as wandering-spot analysis.
The chain-termination method developed by Sanger and coworkers in 1975 soon became the method of choice, owing to its relative ease and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxam and Gilbert method===
In 1976–1977, Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert developed a DNA sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases. Although Maxam and Gilbert published their chemical sequencing method two years after the ground-breaking paper of Sanger and Coulson on plus-minus sequencing,Maxam–Gilbert sequencing rapidly became more popular, since purified DNA could be used directly, while the initial Sanger method required that each read start be cloned for production of single-stranded DNA. However, with the improvement of the chain-termination method (see below), Maxam-Gilbert sequencing has fallen out of favour due to its technical complexity prohibiting its use in standard molecular biology kits, extensive use of hazardous chemicals, and difficulties with scale-up.
The method requires radioactive labeling at one 5' end of the DNA (typically by a kinase reaction using gamma-32P ATP) and purification of the DNA fragment to be sequenced. Chemical treatment generates breaks at a small proportion of one or two of the four nucleotide bases in each of four reactions (G, A+G, C, C+T). For example, the purines (A+G) are depurinated using formic acid, the guanines (and to some extent the adenines) are methylated by dimethyl sulfate, and the pyrimidines (C+T) are methylated using hydrazine. The addition of salt (sodium chloride) to the hydrazine reaction inhibits the methylation of thymine for the C-only reaction. The modified DNAs are then cleaved by hot piperidine at the position of the modified base. The concentration of the modifying chemicals is controlled to introduce on average one modification per DNA molecule. Thus a series of labeled fragments is generated, from the radiolabeled end to the first &quot;cut&quot; site in each molecule. The fragments in the four reactions are electrophoresed side by side in denaturing acrylamide gels for size separation. To visualize the fragments, the gel is exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography, yielding a series of dark bands each corresponding to a radiolabeled DNA fragment, from which the sequence may be inferred.
Also sometimes known as &quot;chemical sequencing&quot;, this method led to the Methylation Interference Assay used to map DNA-binding sites for DNA-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dideoxynucleotide Chain-termination methods ===
[[Image:Sequencing.jpg|thumb|right|Part of a radioactively labelled sequencing gel]] Because the chain-terminator method (or Sanger method after its developer [[Frederick Sanger]]) is more efficient and uses fewer toxic chemicals and lower amounts of radioactivity than the method of Maxam and Gilbert, it rapidly became the method of choice. The key principle of the Sanger method was the use of dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) as DNA chain terminators.

The classical chain-termination method requires a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleotidephosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These ddNTPs will also be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in automated sequencing machines. The DNA sample is divided into four separate sequencing reactions, containing all four of the standard deoxynucleotides (dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP) and the DNA polymerase. To each reaction is added only one of the four dideoxynucleotides (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, or ddTTP) which are the chain-terminating nucleotides, lacking a 3'-hydroxyl (OH) group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides, thus terminating DNA strand extension and resulting in DNA fragments of varying length&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;.

The newly synthesized and labelled DNA fragments are heat denatured, and separated by size (with a resolution of just one nucleotide) by gel electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel with each of the four reactions run in one of four individual lanes (lanes A, T, G, C); the DNA bands are then visualized by autoradiography or UV light, and the DNA sequence can be directly read off the X-ray film or gel image. In the image on the right, X-ray film was exposed to the gel, and the dark bands correspond to DNA fragments of different lengths. A dark band in a lane indicates a DNA fragment that is the result of chain termination after incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, or ddTTP). The relative positions of the different bands among the four lanes are then used to read (from bottom to top) the DNA sequence&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:DNA Sequencin 3 labeling methods.jpg|thumb|left|DNA fragments are labelled with a radioactive or fluorescent tag on the primer (1), in the new DNA strand with a labeled dNTP, or with a labeled ddNTP. (click to expand)]] Technical variations of chain-termination sequencing include tagging with nucleotides containing radioactive phosphorus for radiolabelling, or using a primer labeled at the 5’ end with a fluorescent dye. Dye-primer sequencing facilitates reading in an optical system for faster and more economical analysis and automation.  The later development by [[Leroy Hood]] and coworkers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith LM, Sanders JZ, Kaiser RJ, ''et al'' |title=Fluorescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis |journal=Nature |volume=321 |issue=6071 |pages=674–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3713851 |doi=10.1038/321674a0 |quote=We have developed a method for the partial automation of DNA sequence analysis.

Chain-termination methods have greatly simplified DNA sequencing. For example, chain-termination-based kits are commercially available that contain the reagents needed for sequencing, pre-aliquoted and ready to use. Limitations include non-specific binding of the primer to the DNA, affecting accurate read-out of the DNA sequence, and DNA secondary structures affecting the fidelity of the sequence&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Dye-terminator sequencing ===
[[Image:CE Basic.jpg|thumb|left|Capillary electrophoresis (click to expand)]]

''Dye-terminator sequencing'' utilizes labelling of the chain terminator ddNTPs, which permits sequencing in a single reaction, rather than four reactions as in the labelled-primer method. In dye-terminator sequencing, each of the four dideoxynucleotide chain terminators is labelled with fluorescent dyes, each of which emit light at different wavelengths. 

Owing to its greater expediency and speed, dye-terminator sequencing is now the mainstay in automated sequencing. Its limitations include dye effects due to differences in the incorporation of the dye-labelled chain terminators into the DNA fragment, resulting in unequal peak heights and shapes in the electronic DNA sequence trace [[chromatogram]] after [[capillary electrophoresis]] (see figure to the left). 

This problem has been addressed with the use of modified DNA polymerase enzyme systems and dyes that minimize incorporation variability, as well as methods for eliminating &quot;dye blobs&quot;. The dye-terminator sequencing method, along with automated high-throughput DNA sequence analyzers, is now being used for the vast majority of sequencing projects&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Challenges ===
Common challenges of DNA sequencing include poor quality in the first 15–40 bases of the sequence and deteriorating quality of sequencing traces after 700–900 bases.  [[Base calling]] software typically gives an estimate of quality to aid in quality trimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlPhred - Quality Base Calling&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrap.com/phred/ |title=Phred - Quality Base Calling |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlBase-calling for next-generation sequencing platforms — Brief Bioinform&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/01/18/bib.bbq077.full |title=Base-calling for next-generation sequencing platforms — Brief Bioinform |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where DNA fragments are cloned before sequencing, the resulting sequence may contain parts of the cloning vector.  In contrast, PCR-based cloning and emerging sequencing technologies based on pyrosequencing often avoid using cloning vectors.  Recently, one-step Sanger sequencing (combined amplification and sequencing) methods such as Ampliseq and SeqSharp have been developed that allow rapid sequencing of target genes without cloning or prior amplification.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, K.; Berg, K.; Eshleman, J. (2005). &quot;Sequencing of genomic DNA by combined amplification and cycle sequencing reaction&quot;. Clinical chemistry 51 (1): 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, D.; Cookson, B. (2010). &quot;SeqSharp: A general approach for improving cycle-sequencing that facilitates a robust one-step combined amplification and sequencing method&quot;. The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD 12 (3): 272–277. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;

Current methods can directly sequence only relatively short (300–1000 [[nucleotides]] long) DNA fragments in a single reaction. The main obstacle to sequencing DNA fragments above this size limit is insufficient power of separation for resolving large DNA fragments that differ in length by only one nucleotide. In all cases the use of a primer with a free 5' end is essential&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;.



=== Automation and sample preparation ===
[[Image:Sanger sequencing read display.gif|thumb|500px|right|View of the start of an example dye-terminator read ]] Automated DNA-sequencing instruments (DNA sequencers) can sequence up to 384 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 24 runs a day. DNA sequencers carry out capillary electrophoresis for size separation, detection and recording of dye fluorescence, and data output as fluorescent peak trace chromatograms. Sequencing reactions by thermocycling, cleanup and re-suspension in a buffer solution before loading onto the sequencer are performed separately. A number of commercial and non-commercial software packages can trim low-quality DNA traces automatically. These programs score the quality of each peak and remove low-quality base peaks (generally located at the ends of the sequence). The accuracy of such algorithms is below visual examination by a human operator, but sufficient for automated processing of large sequence data sets&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_sequencing&amp;oldid=422803407&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <comment>/* Enzymes in Citric acid cycle pathway */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The citric acid cycle — also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), the Krebs cycle, or the Szent-Györgyi-Krebs cycle — is a series of enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions, which is of central importance in all living cells that use oxygen as part of cellular respiration. In eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. The components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established by seminal work from Albert Szent-Györgyi and Hans Krebs. In aerobic organisms, the citric acid cycle is part of a metabolic pathway involved in the chemical conversion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and water to generate a form of usable energy. Other relevant reactions in the pathway include those in glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation before the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation after it. In addition, it provides precursors for many compounds including some amino acids and is therefore functional even in cells performing fermentation&lt;REf&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citric_acid_cycle&amp;oldid=425212991&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Enzymes in Citric acid cycle pathway==
===Citrate synthase===
The enzyme citrate synthase (E.C. 2.3.3.1 [previously 4.1.3.7]) exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the Citric Acid Cycle (or Krebs Cycle). Citrate synthase is localized within eukaryotic cells in the mitochondrial matrix, but is encoded by nuclear DNA rather than mitochondrial. It is synthesized using cytoplasmic ribosomes, then transported into the mitochondrial matrix. Citrate synthase is commonly used as a quantitative enzyme marker for the presence of intact mitochondria.
Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of the two-carbon acetate residue from acetyl coenzyme A and a molecule of four-carbon oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon citrate.Oxaloacetate will be regenerated after the completion of one round of the Krebs Cycle.
&lt;gallery&gt;
 Image:Acetyl-CoA.svg|[[acetyl-CoA]]
 Image:Oxaloacetic acid.png|Oxaloacetic acid
 Image:Citrate wpmp.png|Citric acid
&lt;/gallery&gt;

acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + [[H2O|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] → citrate + [[Coenzyme A|CoA-SH]]

Oxaloacetate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme.  This induces the enzyme to change its conformation, and creates a binding site for the acetyl-CoA.  Only when this citroyl-CoA has formed will another conformational change cause thioester hydrolysis and release coenzyme A.  This ensures that the energy released from the thioester bond cleavage will drive the condensation.

===Aconitase===
Aconitase (aconitate hydratase; EC 4.2.1.3) is an enzyme that catalyses the stereo-specific isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a non-redox-active process.
&lt;gallery&gt;

 Image:Threo-Ds-isocitrate wpmp.png|&lt;center&gt;[[Isocitric acid]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;


===Isocitrate dehydrogenase===
Isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) and (EC 1.1.1.41), also known as IDH, is an enzyme that participates in the citric acid cycle. It catalyzes the third step of the cycle: the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) and CO2 while converting NAD+ to NADH. This is a two-step process, which involves oxidation of isocitrate (a secondary alcohol) to oxalosuccinate (a ketone), followed by the decarboxylation of the carboxyl group beta to the ketone, forming alpha-ketoglutarate. Another isoform of the enzyme catalyzes the same reaction, however this reaction is unrelated to the citric acid cycle, is carried out in the cytosol as well as the mitochondrion and peroxisome and uses NADP+ as a cofactor instead of NAD+.

Within the citric acid cycle, isocitrate, produced from the isomerization of citrate, undergoes both oxidation and decarboxylation. Using the enzyme Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH), isocitrate is held within its active site by surrounding arginine, tyrosine, asparagine, serine, threonine, and aspartic acid amino acids. The first box shows the overall isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. The reactants necessary for this enzyme mechanism to work are isocitrate, NAD+/NADP+, and Mn2+ or Mg2+. The products of the reaction are alpha-ketoglutarate, carbon dioxide, and NADH + H+/NADPH + H+. Water molecules are used to help deprotonate the oxygens (O3) of isocitrate.
The second box is Step 1, which is the oxidation of the alpha-C (C#2).Oxidation is the first step that isocitrate goes through. In this process, the alcohol group off the alpha-carbon (C#2) is deprotonated and the electrons flow to the alpha-C forming a ketone group and removing a hydride off C#2 using NAD+/NADP+ as an electron accepting cofactor. The oxidation of the alpha-C allows for a position where electrons (in the next step) will be coming down from the carboxyl group and pushing the electrons (making the double bonded oxygen) back up on the oxygen or grabbing a nearby proton off a nearby Lysine amino acid.
The third box is Step 2, which is the decarboxylation of oxalosuccinate. In this step, the carboxyl group oxygen is deprotonated by a nearby Tyrosine amino acid and those electrons flow down to carbon 2. Carbon dioxide leaves the beta carbon of isocitrate as a leaving group with the electrons flowing to the ketone oxygen off the alpha-C placing a negative charge on the oxygen of the alpha-C and forming an alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The lone pair on the alpha-C oxygen picks up a proton from a nearby Lysine amino acid.
The fourth box is Step 3, which is the saturation of the alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3. In this step of the reaction,[5][6] Lysine deprotonates the oxygen off the alpha carbon and the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen of the alpha carbon comes down reforming the ketone double bond and pushing the lone pair (forming the double bond between the alpha and beta carbon) off, picking up a proton from the nearby Tyrosine amino acid. This reaction results in the formation of alpha-ketoglutarate, NADH + H+/NADPH + H+, and CO2&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isocitrate_dehydrogenase&amp;oldid=423880128&lt;/ref&gt;.

===α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase===
The oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) or α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is an enzyme complex, most commonly known for its role in the citric acid cycle.
The  reaction catalyzed by this enzyme in the citric acid cycle is:
:[[α-ketoglutarate]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] + [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] → [[Succinyl CoA]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[NADH]] 
This reaction proceeds in three steps:
decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate,
reduction of NAD+ to NADH,
and subsequent transfer to CoA, which forms the end product, succinyl CoA.
ΔG°' for this reaction is -7.2 kcal mol-1. The energy needed for this oxidation is conserved in the formation of a thioester bond of succinyl CoA.
===Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase===
Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (succinate thiokinase) catalyzes the formation of succinate and coenzyme-A, a 4-carbon metabolite, from succinyl-CoA.
Succinyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes a reversible step in the citric acid cycle, which involves the substrate-level phosphorylation of GDP.

&lt;gallery&gt;
 Image:Succinyl-CoA wpmp.png|[[succinyl-CoA]]
 Image:Succinate wpmp.png|[[succinate]] 
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===Succinate dehydrogenase===
Succinate dehydrogenase or succinate-coenzyme Q reductase (SQR) or Complex II is an enzyme complex, bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane of mammalian mitochondria and many bacterial cells. It is the only enzyme that participates in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.

''In step 8 of the citric acid cycle, SQR catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. This occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane by coupling the two reactions together.''
===Fumarase===
Fumarase (or fumarate hydratase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of Fumarate to S-malate. Fumarase comes in two forms: mitochondrial and cytosolic. The mitochondrial isoenzyme is involved in the Krebs Cycle (also known as the Citric Acid Cycle), and the cytosolic isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of amino acids and fumarate. Subcellular localization is established by the presence of a signal sequence on the amino terminus in the mitochondrial form, while subcellular localization in the cytosolic form is established by the absence of the signal sequence found in the mitochondrial variety.
This enzyme participates in two other metabolic pathways:  reductive carboxylation cycle (CO2 fixation) and in renal cell carcinoma also.

===Malate dehydrogenase===
Malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) (MDH) is an enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate (using NAD+) and vice versa (this is a reversible reaction). Malate dehydrogenase is not to be confused with malic enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate, producing NADPH.
Malate dehydrogenase is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the synthesis of glucose from smaller molecules. Pyruvate in the mitochondria is acted upon by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate, a citric acid cycle intermediate. In order to get the oxaloacetate out of the mitochondria, malate dehydrogenase reduces it to malate, and it then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once in the cytosol, the malate is oxidized back to oxaloacetate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. Finally, phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) converts oxaloacetate to phosphoenol pyruvate.

==Steps of Krebs cycle or Citric acid cycle pathway==

Two carbon atoms  are oxidized to [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the energy from these reactions being transferred to other metabolic processes by [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and as electrons in NADH and [[Ubiquinol|QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The  NADH generated in the TCA cycle may later donate its electrons in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] to drive ATP synthesis; [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is covalently attached to succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme functioning both in the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to coenzyme Q, which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain&lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citric_acid_cycle&amp;oldid=425212991&lt;/ref&gt;.

The citric acid cycle is continuously supplied with new carbon in the form of acetyl-CoA, entering at step 1 below&lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citric_acid_cycle&amp;oldid=425212991&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mitochondria in animals, including humans, possess two succinyl-CoA synthetases: one that produces GTP from GDP, and another that produces ATP from ADP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Johnson |first1=JD|last2=Mehus|first2= JG|last3= Tews |first3=K|last4= Milavetz|first4= BI|last5=Lambeth|first5= DO| title=Genetic evidence for the expression of ATP- and GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetases in multicellular eucaryotes| journal=J Biol Chem| year=1998 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.273.42.27580| pages=27580–6 |volume=273 |issue=42| pmid=9765291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants have the type that produces ATP (ADP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase). Several of the enzymes in the cycle may be loosely-associated in a multienzyme protein complex within the mitochondrial matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnes|first1= SJ|last2=Weitzman|first2= PD |title=Organization of citric acid cycle enzymes into a multienzyme cluster |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=201 |issue=2 |pages=267–70 |year=1986 |month=June |pmid=3086126 |doi=10.1016/0014-5793(86)80621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized by nucleoside-diphosphate kinase to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP).

== How many people are atheists? ==
It's hard to know how many atheists there are.  For one thing, not everyone means the same thing by &quot;atheist&quot;.  Also, some religions are consistent with atheism of some kind, so that a person can follow that religion and be an atheist at the same time.  Jainism is like this, to some extent [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Hinduism|Hinduism]], and some forms of [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Buddhism|Buddhism]].  Those people may describe themselves as members of the religion rather than as atheists.  Another problem is that atheists are persecuted in some places, so people in those places may not be willing to admit to atheism.

It's been estimated that about twelve percent of everyone in the world describe themselves as &quot;nonreligious&quot;, which is one definition of atheist.  But only about two and a half percent describe themselves as &quot;atheist&quot;.

== Where is atheism practiced? ==

Atheism is fairly common in countries that are or were communist, and also in [[WJ:Europe|Europe]], and Australia and New Zealand.  It is somewhat less common in the [[WJ:North America/United States|United States]] and southern [[WJ:South America|South America]].

== What are the main beliefs of atheism? ==

Atheists believe lots of different things.  Some are deeply spiritual people.  Just as there are lots of different kinds of ''theists'' &amp;mdash;people who believe in gods (perhaps one, perhaps many)&amp;mdash; there are just as many different kinds of ''atheists'' &amp;mdash; people who, whatever else they believe, don't believe in gods.

Many atheists believe in the value of skepticism, and of science.  These two are very closely related.  Skepticism is questioning beliefs and asking for evidence to support them.  The basic premise of science is that we should choose our theories about the physical world based on experimental evidence.

[[File:HumanismSymbol.svg|thumb|The Happy Human symbol, a symbol of secular humanism.]]
Nonreligious atheists are often '''secular humanists'''.  Secular humanism emphasizes morality, rationality, and social justice.  It says that the world is governed by natural laws, rather than supernatural beings; and that the difference between right and wrong comes from the nature of humans, and of the world, and of the way humans live together, rather than from supernatural beings.

Many atheists, especially nonreligious ones, place a lot of importance on tolerating other people's beliefs.  That doesn't mean not ''criticizing'' others' beliefs; skepticism requires us to question beliefs, whether our own beliefs or other people's.  But it does mean not ''persecuting'' others for their beliefs.

Some secular humanists promote '''spoof religions'''.  This can promote tolerance for others' beliefs while at the same time pointing out the dangers of not being skeptical enough.  A spoof religion that has gained some attention in recent years is the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, also called Pastafarianism.  In 2005, the Kansas school board voted to allow Intelligent Design &amp;mdash;the idea that the complexity of the world can only be explained by its being created by God&amp;mdash; to be taught in biology classes, alongside evolution.  A physics graduate, Bobby Henderson, sent the board a letter saying that since he believed the world was created by a flying sphaghetti monster, they should teach that alongside the other theories.  Two years later, the board reversed its decision.  If you see someone on the Internet say &quot;Thank FSM&quot; instead of &quot;Thank God&quot;, the &quot;FSM&quot; stands for &quot;Flying Spaghetti Monster&quot;.

=== Different kinds of unbelief ===

The word ''atheism'' is used in at least two different ways.  Technically, the word means &quot;without gods&quot;; that is, atheism is not believing in any god(s).  But &amp;mdash;careful!&amp;mdash; not believing in gods is different from believing there are no gods.  ''Not believing in gods'' names something you ''don't'' believe in: gods.  ''Believing there are no gods'' names something you ''do'' believe in: you believe that there are no gods.  The word &quot;atheism&quot; is sometimes used for one of these things, sometimes for the other.  So to keep them straight, we call the not-believing-in-them '''weak atheism''', and the believing-there-aren't-any '''strong atheism'''.  All strong atheists are weak atheists (because you can't believe they do and at the same time believe they don't exist).  But many weak atheists are not strong atheists (because they neither actively believe gods exist, nor actively believe gods don't exist).

[[File:AtheismImplicitExplicit3.svg|thumb|Different kinds of atheists.&lt;br/&gt;Weak atheists (&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/font&gt;) are divided into implicit atheist and explicit atheists.  Some explicit atheists are strong atheists (&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''purple'''&lt;/font&gt;).]]
Some people also distinguish between weak atheists who have never thought about whether gods exist, and weak atheists who have thought about it.  Weak atheists who haven't thought about it are called '''implicit atheists'''.  Baron d'Holbach, a French philosopher in the 1700s, wrote &quot;All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God.&quot;  When children have no notion of gods, they can't have thought about whether gods exist.  Weak atheists who have thought about it are called '''explicit atheists'''.

There's another word you may have heard:  '''agnostic'''.  People sometimes use that word to mean someone who doesn't have an opinion on whether gods exist &amp;mdash; a weak atheist.  But the word ''agnostic'' was actually coined (that is, invented as a word) specially to mean something different from that.  It was coined in 1869 by an English Biologist named Thomas Henry Huxley, who promoted Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.  He defined the word to mean someone who believes that it's impossible to know whether or not gods exist.  Yes, that's naming something that agnostics do believe in: they do believe that there's no knowing whether or not gods exist.

== What texts does atheism hold sacred? ==
Something is ''sacred'' if it is treated with deep respect and reverence.  You don't have to believe in any supernatural being to hold something sacred.  However, so far there are no texts that are widely viewed with that level of reverence by secular humanists.

There are some books that are widely respected by secular humanists.  Richard Dawkins, an outspoken modern critic of theism, has written a number of books exploring the implications of the theory of evolution &amp;mdash; which is of much interest to secular humanists, as evolutionary theory explains how simple laws of physics can give rise to the vast complexity of the world without any need for supernatural beings to make the complexity happen.  His most famous book on this subject is ''The Selfish Gene'', which is about the theory of evolution itself; another is ''The Blind Watchmaker'', which explores in detail one example of evolution producing something so complex that, once produced, it looks as if someone had designed it.  He has also written a book specifically about religion, called ''The God Delusion''.

A work associated with both skepticism and spoof religion is ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'', a science fiction/fantasy work that carries conspiracy theories to absurd extremes, and so teaches readers to be skeptical about conspiracy theories (and skeptical about most everything else, too).

The spoof religion Pastafarianism has a book setting forth its core beliefs, ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', published in 2006 by Bobby Henderson who &quot;founded&quot; the Church with his letter to the Kansas school board.

== What are some main holidays and practices of atheism? ==
Since the 1990s, there has been increasing observation of ''Darwin Day'' on February 12, a commemoration of Charles Darwin, the discoverer of evolution, on the anniversary of his birth.  You don't have to be a secular humanist to want to commemorate Charles Darwin, but it does enjoy some popularity among secular humanists.

The spoof religion Pastafarianism has several holidays.  One Pastafarian holiday, called simply ''Holiday'', occurs around the same time of year as Christmas, Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah and does not have a fixed precise date.  So, any use of the phrase &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; or &quot;Holiday greetings&quot; is claimed to be evidence of support for Pastafarianism.

== What is the history of atheism? ==

== Who are some famous people who have practiced atheism? ==
* Douglas Adams
* Richard Dawkins
* Sigmund Freud 
* John Lennon
* Susan B. Anthony &lt;!-- agnostic --&gt;
* Brad Pitt
* Thomas Edison
* Helen Keller
* Mark Zuckerberg
* Bertrand Russell

== What is a story from atheism? ==
There is a popular story about French astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon LaPlace and French Emperor Napoleon I.  Like many such stories, it apparently didn't happen quite the way it is told, but the truth isn't too far from the story.

The ''story'', as usually told, says that in the early 1800s, LaPlace presented Napoleon with a copy of his ''Mécanique Céleste'' (Celestial Mechanics), a set of books about how the [[WJ:Solar System|solar system]] works.  Napoleon asked him why he had written all these books about the workings of the solar system without mentioning God, to which LaPlace replied (so the story goes) &quot;''Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là''&quot; &amp;mdash; &quot;I had no need of that hypothesis&quot;.

The story is often taken to mean that LaPlace had not needed to suppose the existence of God.  Actually, the issue with the ''Mécanique Céleste'' seems to have been whether God has to intervene to make the solar system work.  More than a century earlier, English physicist Isaac Newton had claimed that if the solar system were left to work on its own for long enough, eventually the planets would wobble out of their orbits, unless God intervened to keep the solar system stable.  LaPlace disagreed with this; he believed that no divine intervention was needed to keep the solar system stable.

It's also not clear whether LaPlace actually said the exact words &quot;''Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là''&quot; to Napoleon.  However, this saying (&quot;I had no need of that hypothesis&quot;) is often quoted as a model of skepticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is one of the three major macromolecules (along with DNA and proteins) that are essential for all known forms of life.
Like DNA, RNA is made up of a long chain of components called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase (sometimes called a nitrogenous base), a ribose sugar, and a phosphate group. The sequence of nucleotides allows RNA to encode genetic information. For example, some viruses use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material, and all organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to carry the genetic information that directs the synthesis of proteins.
Like proteins, some RNA molecules play an active role in cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function whereby mRNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) links amino acids together to form proteins.
The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, with two differences--(a) RNA contains the sugar ribose while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom), and (b) RNA has the nucleobase uracil while DNA contains thymine (uracil and thymine have similar base-pairing properties).
Unlike DNA, most RNA molecules are single-stranded. Single-stranded RNA molecules adopt very complex three-dimensional structures, since they are not restricted to the repetitive double-helical form of double-stranded DNA. RNA is made within living cells by RNA polymerases, enzymes that act to copy a DNA or RNA template into a new RNA strand through processes known as transcription or RNA replication, respectively&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNA&amp;oldid=424952312&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Structure of RNA==
[[Image:Beta-D-Ribofuranose.svg|thumb|left|100px|Ribose.]]
[[Image:Deoxyribose1.PNG|thumb|Right|400px|Chemical equilibrium of deoxyribose in solution.]]
Each nucleotide in RNA contains a ribose sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or uracil (U). Adenine and guanine are purines, cytosine, and uracil are pyrimidines. A phosphate group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each at physiological pH, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases may form hydrogen bonds between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil.However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge, or the GNRA tetraloop that has a guanine–adenine base-pair&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNA&amp;oldid=424952312&lt;/ref&gt;.

An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. This results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.

Ribose is an aldopentose, that is a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde functional group at one end. In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The deoxyribose derivative, found in DNA, differs from ribose by having a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxyl group in carbon C2'.
Like many monosaccharides, ribose occurs in water as the linear form H-(C=O)-(CHOH)4-H and any of two ring forms: ribofuranose (&quot;C3'-endo&quot;), with a five-membered ring, and ribopyranose (&quot;C2'-endo&quot;), with a six-membered ring. The ribofuranose form is predominant in aqueous solution.
The &quot;D-&quot; in the name D-ribose refers to the stereochemistry of the chiral carbon atom farthest away from the aldehyde group (C4'). In D-ribose, as in all D-sugars, this carbon atom has the same configuration as in D-glyceraldehyde.
Ribose comprises the backbone of RNA, a biopolymer that is the basis of genetic transcription. It is related to deoxyribose, as found in DNA. Once phosphorylated, ribose can become a subunit of ATP, NADH, and several other compounds that are critical to metabolism&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNA&amp;oldid=424952312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgs PG (2000). &quot;RNA secondary structure: physical and computational aspects&quot;. Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics 33: 199–253. &lt;/ref&gt;.
==RNA bases and its nucleotides==

'''Adenine (A)'''

Adenine (A,) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative) with a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration, in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and protein synthesis, as a chemical component of DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA.

'''Cytosine (C)'''

Cytosine (C) is one of the four main bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine.


'''Guanine (G)''' 

Guanine (G) is one of the four main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. 


'''Uracil (U)'''
[[Image:Uracil tautomers.png|right|thumb|Uracil tautomers: Amide or lactam structure (left) and imide or lactim structure (right)]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;/&gt;
Found in [[RNA]], it [[base pair|base-pairs]] with [[adenine]] and replaces [[thymine]] during [[DNA]] transcription. [[Methylation]] of uracil produces [[thymine]].It turns into thymine to protect the DNA and to improve the efficiency of [[DNA replication]]. Uracil can base-pair with any of the bases, depending on how the molecule arranges itself on the [[helix]], but readily pairs with [[adenine]] because the methyl group is repelled into a fixed position. Uracil pairs with adenine through [[hydrogen bonding]].  Uracil is the [[hydrogen bond acceptor]] and can form two hydrogen bonds. Uracil can also bind with a [[ribose]] sugar to form the [[ribonucleoside]] [[uridine]].  When a [[phosphate]] attaches to uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate is produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horton1&quot;&gt;Horton, Robert H.; ''et al.''Principles of Biochemistry. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uracil undergoes amide-imidic acid tautomeric shifts because any nuclear instability the molecule may have from the lack of formal [[aromaticity]] is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability. The amide [[tautomer]] is referred to as the [[lactam]] structure, while the imidic acid tautomer is referred to as the [[lactim]] structure. These tautomeric forms are predominant at [[pH]] 7. The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.

Uracil also recycles itself to form nucleotides by undergoing a series of [[phosphoribosyltransferase reaction]]s. Degradation of uracil produces the substrates [[aspartate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonia]].

:C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Oxidative degradation of uracil produces urea and maleic acid in the presence of [[hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or in the presence of diatomic [[oxygen]] and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Uracil is a [[weak acid]]; the first site of [[ionization]] of uracil is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zorbach1&quot;&gt;Zorbach, W.W. Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry: Physical and Physicochemical Aids in Determination of Structure. Vol 2. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative charge is placed on the oxygen anion and produces a [[Acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of less than or equal to 12.  The basic pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -3.4, while the acidic pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.38&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. In the gas phase, uracil has 4 sites that are more acidic than water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee1&quot;&gt;Lee, J.K.; Kurinovich, Ma. ''J Am Soc Mass Spectrom.'''''13'''(8), 2005, 985-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uracil is a common and naturally occurring pyrimidine derivative. Originally discovered in 1900, it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein that was found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. It is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light.

==Types of RNA==

===RNAs involved in protein synthesis===

====Messenger RNA====
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a molecule of RNA encoding a chemical &quot;blueprint&quot; for a protein product. mRNA is transcribed from a DNA template, and carries coding information to the sites of protein synthesis: the ribosomes. Here, the nucleic acid polymer is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein. In mRNA as in DNA, genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides arranged into codons consisting of three bases each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons that terminate protein synthesis. This process requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA (tRNA) mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, while ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the central component of the ribosome's protein manufacturing machinery&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Messenger_RNA&amp;oldid=421869704&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:MRNA structure.svg|thumb|700px|center|The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA. A fully processed mRNA includes a [[5' cap]], [[5' UTR]], [[coding region]], [[3' UTR]], and poly(A) tail.]]

====Ribosomal RNA====
Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) is the RNA component of the ribosome, the organelle that is the site of protein synthesis in all living cells. Ribosomal RNA provides a mechanism for decoding mRNA into amino acids and interacts with tRNAs during translation by providing peptidyl transferase activity. The tRNAs bring the necessary amino acids corresponding to the appropriate mRNA codon.

====tRNA====
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA molecule (usually about 73-95 nucleotides) that transfers a specific active amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has a 3' terminal site for amino acid attachment. This covalent linkage is catalyzed by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. It also contains a three base region called the anticodon that can base pair to the corresponding three base codon region on mRNA. Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, but because the genetic code contains multiple codons that specify the same amino acid, tRNA molecules bearing different anticodons may also carry the same amino acid&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transfer_RNA&amp;oldid=424698874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felsenfeld G, Cantoni G (1964). &quot;Use of thermal denaturation studies to investigate the base sequence of yeast serine sRNA&quot;. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 51 (5): 818–26.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===RNAs involved in post-transcriptional===


====Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA)====
Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA) is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III and are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing (removal of introns from hnRNA), regulation of transcription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining the telomeres. They are always associated with specific proteins, and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) or sometimes as snurps. These elements are rich in uridine content.

====Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)====
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs and small nuclear RNAs. There are two main classes of snoRNA, the C/D box snoRNAs which are associated with methylation, and the H/ACA box snoRNAs which are associated with pseudouridylation. snoRNAs are commonly referred to as guide RNAs but should not be confused with the guide RNAs that direct RNA editing in trypanosomes.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Small_nuclear_RNA&amp;oldid=423606232&lt;/ref&gt;

After transcription, nascent rRNA molecules (termed pre-rRNA) are required to undergo a series of processing steps in order to generate the mature rRNA molecule. Prior to cleavage by exo- and endonucleases the pre-rRNA undergoes a complex pattern of nucleoside modifications. These include methylations and pseudouridylations, guided by snoRNAs.
Methylation is the attachment or substitution of a methyl group onto various substrates. The rRNA of humans contain approximately 115 methyl group modifications. The majority of these are 2'O-ribose-methylations ( where the methyl group is attached to the ribose group). 
Pseudouridylation is the conversion (isomerisation) of the nucleoside uridine to a different isomeric form pseudouridine(Ψ). Mature human rRNAs contain approximately 95 Ψ modifications.
Each snoRNA molecule acts as a guide for only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of snoRNA molecule (see snoRNA guide families below). The snoRNA molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides) which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the chemical modification of the target base&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Small_nuclear_RNA&amp;oldid=423606232&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Ribonuclease P (RNase P)====
Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a type of Ribonuclease which cleaves RNA. RNase P is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme – a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein based enzyme would. Its function is to cleave off an extra, or precursor, sequence of RNA on tRNA molecules

====Telomerase RNA ====
Telomerase RNA component, also known as TERC, is an RNA gene found in eukaryotes, that is a component of telomerase used to extend telomeres. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence. The vertebrate telomerase RNAs have a 3' H/ACA snoRNA-like domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Earlier the name &quot;carbohydrate&quot; was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Following this definition, some chemists considered formaldehyde CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be the simplest carbohydrate,
while others claimed that title for glycolaldehyde. Today the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons.
Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides with general formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n'' is three or more.  A typical monosaccharide has the structure H-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(C=O)-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;-H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many hydroxyl groups added, usually one on each carbon atom that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]].   Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], fructose, and glyceraldehyde.  However, some biological substances commonly called &quot;monosaccharides&quot; do not conform to this formula (e.g., [[uronic acids]] and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]), and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g., formaldehyde CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[inositol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).
The open-chain form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a heterocyclic compound|closed ring form where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] carbonyl group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (-OH) react forming a hemiacetal with a new C-O-C bridge.
Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called polysaccharides (or oligosaccharides) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, deoxyribose, a component of DNA, is a modified version of ribose; chitin is composed of repeating units of N-acetylglucosamine, a nitrogen-containing form of glucose.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate&amp;oldid=424717553&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbohydrates and their conformations==

Monosaccharide Conformation
Pyranose and furanose forms can exist in different conformers and one can interconvert between the different conformations if an energy penalty is met. For the furanose system there are two possible conformers: Twist (T) and Envelope (E). In the pyranose system four conformers are possible: Chair (C), Boat (B), Skew (S), Half-Chair (H) or Envelope (E). In all cases there are four or more atoms that make up a plane. In order to define which atoms are above and below the plane one must orient the molecule so that the atoms are numbered clockwise when looking form the top. Atoms above the plane are prefixed as a superscript and atoms below the plane are suffixed as a subscript. If the ring oxygen is above or below the plane it must be prefixed or suffixed appropriately

Conformational Analysis
Chair conformation of six membered rings have a dihedral angle of 60° between adjacent substituents thus making it the most stable conformer. Since there are two possible chair conformation steric and stereoelectronic effects such as the anomeric effect, 1,3 diaxial interactions, dipoles and intramolecular hydrogen bonding must be taken into consideration when looking at relative energies. Conformations with 1,3 diaxial interactions are usually disfavored due to steric congestion and can shift equilibrium to the other chair form (example: 1C4 to 4C1). The size of the substituents greatly affects this equilibrium. However, intramolecular hydrogen bonding can be an example of a stabilizing 1,3 diaxial interaction. Dipoles also play a role in conformer stability, aligned dipoles lead to an increase in energy while opposed dipoles lead to a lowering of energy hence a stabilizing effect, this can be complicated by solvent effects. Polar solvents tend to stabilize aligned dipoles. All interaction must be taken into account when determining a preferred conformation
Conformations of five membered rings are limited to two, envelope and twist. The envelope conformation has four atoms in a plane while the twist form only has three. In the envelope form two different scenarios can be envisioned; one where the ring oxygen is in the four atom plane and one where it is puckered above or below the plane. When the ring oxygen is not in the plane the substituents eclipse and when it is in the plane torsional strain is relieved. Conformational analysis for the twist form is similar thus leading to the two forms being very close in energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate&amp;oldid=424717553&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anomers and related Effects===
Anomers are diastereoisomers of glycosides, hemiacetals or related cyclic forms of sugars, or related molecules differing in configuration only at C-1. When the stereochemistry of the first carbon matches the stereochemistry of the last stereogenic center the sugar is the α-anomer when they are opposite the sugar is the β-anomer.In organic chemistry, the anomeric effect or Edward-Lemieux effect is a stereoelectronic effect that describes the tendency of heteroatomic substituents adjacent to a heteroatom within a cyclohexane ring to prefer the axial orientation instead of the less hindered equatorial orientation that would be expected from steric considerations. This effect was originally observed in pyranose rings by J. T. Edward in 1955; at that time, N.-J. Chii and R. U. Lemieux began to study the anomerization equilibria of the fully acetylated derivatives of several aldohexopyranoses. The term &quot;anomeric effect&quot; was introduced in 1958.The anomeric effect got its name from the term used to designate the C-1 carbon of a pyranose, the anomeric carbon. Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anomeric_effect&amp;oldid=409805462&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Image:glucoseab.png|none|500px|The α- and β-anomers of D-glucopyranose.]] 
The anomers of glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer on the right having an OH group pointing up equatorially in the lower right-hand corner of the figure, and the alpha anomer on the left having that OH group pointing down axially.
The anomeric effect can be generalized to any system with the general formula R–Y–C–Z, where Y is an atom with one or more electronic lone pairs, and Z is an electronegative atom. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1–2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars. In this general case, the molecule need not be cyclic. For example, a small molecule that exhibits the anomeric effect and that is often used for theoretical studies is dimethoxymethane. In the case of dimethoxyethane the gauche,gauche conformation is about 3–5 kcal/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the trans,trans conformation—this is about two times as big as the effect in sugars because there are two rotatable bonds that are affected.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate&amp;oldid=424717553&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anomeric Effect''

Anomers can be interconverted through a process know as mutarotation. The anomeric effect more accurately called the endo-anomeric effect is the propensity for heteroatoms at C-1 to be oriented axially. This is counter intuitive as one would expect the equatorially anomer to be the thermodynamic product. This effect has been rationalized through dipole-dipole repulsion and n-σ* arguments.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate&amp;oldid=424717553&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reverse Anomeric Effect''

The reverse anomeric effect, proposed in 1965 by R. U. Lemieux, is the tendency for electropositive groups at the anomeric position to be oriented equatorially. Original publication reported this phenomenon with N-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-4-methylpyridinium bromide. However, further studies have shown the effect to be a solvation and steric issue. It is accepted that there is no generalized reverse anomeric effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate_conformation&amp;oldid=421342369&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroxymethyl Conformation

Rotation around the C-5/C-6 bond is described by the angle ω. Three possible staggered conformations possible; gauche-trans (gt), gauche-gauche (gg), trans-gauche(tg). The name indicates the interaction between O-5 and OH-6 first followed by the interaction between OH-6 and C-4.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate_conformation&amp;oldid=421342369&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Oligosaccaharide Conformation===
In addition to the factors affecting monosaccaride residues, conformational analysis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides requires consideration additional factors.

Exo-Anomeric Effect
Exo-anomeric effect is similar to the endo-anomeric effect. The difference being that the lone pair being donated is coming from the substituent at C-1. However, since the substituent can be either axial or equatorial there are two types of exo-anomeric effects, one from axial glycosides and one from equatorial glycosides as long as the donating orbital is anti-periplanar to the accepting orbital.

Glycosidic Torsion Angles


Three angles are described by φ, ψ and ω (in the case of glycosidic linkages via O-6). Steric considerations and anomeric effects need to be taken into consideration when looking at preferred angles.

{{quotation|[[File:Alpha-D-Glucopyranose.svg|thumb|180px|α-D-Glucopyranose]]
'''Pyranose''' is a collective term for [[carbohydrate]]s that have a chemical structure that includes a six-membered ring consisting of five carbon atoms and one oxygen atom. The name derives from its similarity to the oxygen heterocycle [[pyran]], but the pyranose ring does not have double bonds. A pyranose in which the anomeric OH at C(l) has been converted into an OR group is called a pyranoside.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pyranose&amp;oldid=392158898&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formation of Pyranose'''
The pyranose ring is formed by the reaction of the [[hydroxyl]] group on carbon 5 (C-5) of a sugar with the aldehyde at carbon 1. This forms an intramolecular [[hemiacetal]]. If reaction is between the C-4 hydroxyl and the aldehyde, a [[furanose]] is formed instead.

[[File:Haworth Projection.png|thumb|right|Haworth Projection of beta-D-glucopyranose]]
 
[[Hermann Emil Fischer]] won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1902) for his work in determining the structure of the D-[[aldohexose]]s. However, the linear, free-aldehyde structures that Fischer proposed represent a very minor percentage of the forms that hexose sugars adopt in solution. It was [[Edmund Hirst]] and Clifford Purves, in the research group of [[Walter Haworth]], who conclusively determined that the hexose sugars preferentially form a pyranose, or six-membered, ring. Haworth drew the ring as a flat hexagon with groups above and below the plane of the ring – the Haworth projection.

A further refinement to the conformation of pyranose rings came when Sponsler and Dore (1926) realized that Sachse’s mathematical treatment of six-membered rings could be applied to their [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray structure]] of [[cellulose]].It was determined that the pyranose ring is puckered, to allow all of the carbon atoms of the ring to have close to the ideal tetrahedral geometry.

The conformations of the pyranose ring are superficially similar to that of the cyclohexane ring. However, the specific nomenclature of pyranoses includes reference to the ring oxygen, and the presence of hydroxyls on the ring have distinct effects on its conformational preference. There are also conformational and stereochemical effects specific to the pyranose ring.

''Nomenclature of Pyranose Rings''&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pyranose&amp;oldid=392158898&lt;/ref&gt;


To name conformations of pyranose, first the conformer is determined. The common conformers are similar to those found in cyclohexane, and these form the basis of the name. Common conformations are Chair (C), Boat (B), Skew (S), Half-Chair (H) or Envelope (E). The ring atoms are then numbered; the anomeric, or hemiacetal, carbon is always 1. Oxygen atoms in the structure are, in general, referred to by the carbon atom they are attached to in the acyclic form, and designated O. Then:
*Position the ring so that, if looking at the top face, the atoms are numbered clockwise. 4 (or 5, in the case of an envelope) atoms will be in a plane
*Atoms above the plane are written before the conformer label, as a superscript
*Atoms below the plane are written following the conformer label, as a subscript

Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be hydrolyzed to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general chemical formula of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)n, literally a &quot;carbon hydrate.&quot; Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n = 3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and L-glyceraldehyde.

'''Triose'''

A triose is a monosaccharide containing three carbon atoms. There are only two trioses, an aldotriose (glyceraldehyde) and a ketotriose (dihydroxyacetone). Trioses are important in respiration. Namely, lactic acid and pyruvic acid are derived from aldotriose and ketotriose, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate&amp;oldid=424717553&lt;/ref&gt;
The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-aldotriose is &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[Glyceraldehyde]]    

[[Image:D-glyceraldehyde-2D-skeletal.png|150px]]

The ketotriose is  [[dihydroxyacetone]]:

[[Image:Dihydroxyacetone.png|150px]]

'''Tetrose'''

A tetrose is a monosaccharide with 4 carbon atoms. They have either an aldehyde functional group in position 1 (aldotetroses) or a ketone functional group in position 2 (ketotetroses).The aldotetroses have two chiral centers (&quot;asymmetric carbon atoms&quot;) and so 4 different stereoisomers are possible. There are two naturally occurring stereoisomers, the enantiomers of erythrose and threose having the D configuration but not the L enantiomers. The ketotetroses have one chiral center and, therefore, two possible stereoisomers: erythrulose (L- and D-form). Again, only the D enantiomer is naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tetrose&amp;oldid=401443888&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Pentose'''

A pentose is a monosaccharide with five carbon atoms. Pentoses are organized into two groups. Aldopentoses have an aldehyde functional group at position 1. Ketopentoses have a ketone functional group in position 2 or 3.The aldehyde and ketone functional groups in these carbohydrates react with neighbouring hydroxyl functional groups to form intramolecular hemiacetals and hemiketals, respectively. The resulting ring structure is related to furan, and is termed a furanose. The ring spontaneously opens and closes, allowing rotation to occur about the bond between the carbonyl group and the neighbouring carbon atom — yielding two distinct configurations (α and β). This process is termed mutarotation.
Ribose is a constituent of RNA, and the related deoxyribose of DNA.
A polymer composed of pentose sugars is called a pentosan.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldopentoses'''
The aldopentoses have three chiral centers and therefore eight different stereoisomers are possible.

'''Hexose'''
In Biochemistry, a '''hexose''' is a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms, having the chemical formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Hexoses are classified by functional group, with '''aldohexoses''' having an aldehyde at position 1, and '''ketohexoses''' having a ketone at position 2. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexose&amp;oldid=403295413&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Configurations of the D series of aldoses containing six carbon atoms.pdf|thumb|Configurations of the D series of aldoses containing six carbon atoms]]


'''Aldohexoses'''
The aldohexoses have four chiral centres for a total of 16 possible aldohexose stereoisomers (2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;/&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; configuration is based on the orientation of the hydroxyl at position 5, and does not refer to the direction of [[optical activity]].
The eight &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-aldohexoses are&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexose&amp;oldid=403295413&lt;/ref&gt;:

Of these &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomers, all except &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[altrose]] are naturally occurring. &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Altrose, however, has been isolated from strains of the bacterium ''[[Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens]]''.

A classical jingle to remember the hexoses is &quot;All atruists gladly make gum in gallon tank&quot;.

'''Cyclic hemiacetals'''
It has been known since 1926 that 6-carbon aldose sugars form cyclic [[hemiacetal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;m_b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Morrison, Robert Thornton and Boyd, Robert Neilson|title=Organic Chemistry|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|edition= 2nd}} Library of Congress catalog 66-25695&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram below shows the hemiacetal forms for D-glucose and D-mannose.

:[[Image:HexosesHemiacetal.svg|500px|center]]

The numbered carbons in the open-chain forms correspond to the same numbered carbons in the hemiacetal forms. The formation of the hemiacetal causes carbon number 1, which is symmetric in the open-chain form, to become asymmetric in the cyclic version. This means that both glucose and mannose (as well as all the other aldohexoses) each have two cyclic forms. In solution, both of these exist in equilibrium with the open-chain form. The open-chain form, however, does not crystallize. Hence the two cyclic forms become separable when they are crystallized. For example, D-glucose forms an alpha crystal that has [[specific rotation]] of +112° and melting point of 146 °C, as well as a beta crystal that has specific rotation of +19° and melting point of 150 °C.&lt;ref name=&quot;m_b&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexose&amp;oldid=403295413&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ketohexoses'''
The [[ketohexose]]s have 3 chiral centres and therefore eight possible stereoisomers (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Of these, only the four &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomers are known to occur naturally: &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexose&amp;oldid=403295413&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the naturally occurring hexoses are capable of being fermented by yeasts.

Mutarotation:
The aldehyde and ketone functional groups in these carbohydrates react with neighbouring [[hydroxyl]] functional groups to form [[intramolecular]] [[hemiacetal]]s and [[hemiketal]]s, respectively. The resulting ring structure is related to [[pyran]], and is termed a [[pyranose]]. The ring spontaneously opens and closes, allowing rotation to occur about the bond between the [[carbonyl]] group and the neighbouring carbon atom, yielding two distinct configurations (α and β). This process is termed [[mutarotation]]. Hexose sugars can form [[disaccharide|dihexose]] sugars with a condensation reaction to form a 1,6-[[glycosidic bond]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexose&amp;oldid=403295413&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heptose'''
A heptose is a monosaccharide with seven carbon atoms.
They have either an aldehyde functional group in position 1 (aldoheptoses) or a ketone functional group in position 2 (ketoheptoses).
There are few examples of C-7 sugars in nature, among which are&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heptose&amp;oldid=418087311&lt;/ref&gt;:

Sedoheptulose or D-altro-heptulose (a ketose)

Mannoheptulose, found in avocados

L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (an aldose).

Ketoheptoses have 4 chiral centers, whereas aldoheptoses have 5&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heptose&amp;oldid=418087311&lt;/ref&gt;.

==What is Haworth projection?==
[[Image:Glucose Haworth.png|thumb|right|A Haworth projection of the structure for [[Glucose|&amp;alpha;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucopyranose]]]]
The three-dimensional structure of a monosaccharides in cyclic form is usually represented by its Haworth projection. In this diagram, the α-isomer has the OH- of the anomeric carbon below the plane of the carbon atoms, and the β-isomer has the OH- of the anomeric carbon above the plane. Pyranoses typically adopt a chair conformation, similar to cyclohexane. In this conformation the α-isomer has the OH- of the anomeric carbon in an axial position, whereas the β-isomer has the OH- of the anomeric carbon in equatorial position.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monosaccharide&amp;oldid=423519127&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|'''What is Mutarotation?''' Mutarotation is the change in the [[optical rotation]] that occurs by epimerization (that is the change in the equilibrium between two [[epimer]]s, when the corresponding [[stereocenter]]s interconvert). Cyclic [[sugar]]s show mutarotation as α and β [[anomeric]] forms interconvert.&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/M04073.html mutarotation]&lt;/ref&gt;
The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each anomer and their ratio in the solution.

Mutarotation was discovered by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1846, when he noticed that the specific rotation of aqueous sugar solution changes with time. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Derek Horton|title=The Development of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biology|journal=Carbohydrate Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications|pages=1–28 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1016/B978-0-08-054816-6.00001-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed017p153 Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut—An early sugar chemist. Hewitt G. Fletcher, J. Chem. Educ., 1940, 17 (4), p 153, DOI: 10.1021/ed017p153]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Measurement''' 

[[Image:generalmutamech.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Interconversion of α and β anomers]]
The α and β anomers are [[diastereomer]]s of each other and usually have different specific rotations. A solution or liquid sample of a pure α anomer will rotate [[Polarization (waves)|plane polarised light]] by a different amount and/or in the opposite direction than the pure β anomer of that compound. The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each anomer and their ratio in the solution.

[[Image:glucoseab.png|545px|center]] 

For example if a solution of β-D-[[glucopyranose]] is dissolved in water, its specific optical rotation will be +18.7. Over time, some of the β-D-glucopyranose will undergo mutarotation to become α-D-glucopyranose, which has an optical rotation of +112.2. Thus the rotation of the solution will increase from +18.7 to an equilibrium value of +52.5 as some of the β form is converted to the α form. The equilibrium mixture is actually about 64% of β-D-glucopyranose and about 36% of α-D-glucopyranose, though there are also with traces of the other forms including furanoses and open chained form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Francis Carey|title=Organic Chemistry |edition=4th, McGraw-Hill Higher Education Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observed optical rotation of the sample is the weighted sum of the optical rotation of each anomer weighted by the amount of that anomer present. Therefore one can use a polarimeter to measure the rotation of a sample and then calculate the ratio of the two anomers present from the enantiomeric excess, as long as one knows the rotation of each pure anomer. One can monitor the mutarotation process over time or determine the equilibrium mixture by observing the optical rotation and how it changes.}}


===Cyclic isomers===
A monosaccharide often switches from the acyclic (open-chain) form to a cyclic form, through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom. The resulting molecule has an hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose. The reaction is easily reversed, yielding the original open-chain form.
In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms. These forms are called furanoses and pyranoses, respectively — by analogy with furan and pyran, the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the double bonds of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called glucofuranose. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring (the same of oxepane), rarely encountered, are called septanoses.For many monosaccharides (including glucose), the cyclic forms predominate, in the solid state and in solutions, and therefore the same name commonly is used for the open- and closed-chain isomers. Thus, for example, the term &quot;glucose&quot; may signify glucofuranose, glucopyranose, the open-chain form, or a mixture of the three.
Cyclization creates a new stereogenic center at the carbonyl-bearing carbon The -OH group that replaces the carbonyl's oxygen may end up in two distinct positions relative to the ring's midplane. Thus each open-chain monosaccharide yields two cyclic isomers (anomers), denoted by the prefixes 'α-' and 'β-'. The molecule can change between these two forms by a process called mutarotation, that consists in a reversal of the ring-forming reaction followed by another ring formation.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monosaccharide&amp;oldid=423519127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaccharides==
There are two different types of disaccharides: reducing disaccharides, in which one monosaccharide, the reducing sugar, still has a free hemiacetal unit; and non-reducing disaccharides, in which the components bond through an acetal linkage between their anomeric centers and neither monosaccharide has a free hemiacetal unit. Cellobiose and maltose are examples of reducing disaccharides. Sucrose and trehalose are examples of non-reducing disaccharides. 
Formation&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disaccharide&amp;oldid=424536634&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed. For example; milk sugar (lactose) is made from glucose and galactose whereas the sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets (sucrose) is made from glucose and fructose.
The two monosaccharides are bonded via a dehydration reaction (also called a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis) that leads to the loss of a molecule of water and formation of a glycosidic bond.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disaccharide&amp;oldid=424536634&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Properties'''

The glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxyl group on the component monosaccharide. So, even if both component sugars are the same (e.g., glucose), different bond combinations (regiochemistry) and stereochemistry (alpha- or beta-) result in disaccharides that are diastereoisomers with different chemical and physical properties.
Depending on the monosaccharide constituents, disaccharides are sometimes crystalline, sometimes water-soluble, and sometimes sweet-tasting and sticky-feeling.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disaccharide&amp;oldid=424536634&lt;/ref&gt;

Sucrose is the organic compound commonly known as table sugar and sometimes called saccharose. A white, odorless, crystalline powder with a sweet taste, it is best known for its role in human nutrition. The molecule is a disaccharide derived from glucose and fructose with the molecular formula C12H22O11. About 150,000,000 tonnes (metric tons) are produced annually.

Lactulose  is a synthetic sugar used in the treatment of constipation[1] and hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease. It is a disaccharide (double-sugar) formed from one molecule each of the simple sugars (monosaccharides) fructose and galactose. The commercial syrup used for treatment of constipation is dyed yellow-orange. It is produced commercially by isomerization of lactose.

Lactose was discovered in milk in 1619 by Fabriccio Bartoletti, and identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.  Lactose is a disaccharide sugar that is found most notably in milk and is formed from galactose and glucose. Lactose makes up around 2~8% of milk (by weight), although the amount varies among species and individuals. It is extracted from sweet or sour whey. The name comes from lac, the Latin word for milk, plus the -ose ending used to name sugars. It has a formula of C12H22O11.

Maltose (English pronunciation: /ˈmɒltoʊz/), or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from two units of glucose joined with an α(1→4)bond. The isomer &quot;isomaltose&quot; has two glucose molecules linked through an α(1→6) bond. Maltose is the second member of an important biochemical series of glucose chains. Maltose is the disaccharide produced when amylase breaks down starch. It is found in germinating seeds such as barley as they break down their starch stores to use for food.
The addition of another glucose unit yields maltotriose; further additions will produce dextrins (also called maltodextrins) and eventually starch (glucose polymer).
Maltose can be broken down into two glucose molecules by hydrolysis. In living organisms, the enzyme maltase can achieve this very rapidly. In the laboratory, heating with a strong acid for several minutes will produce the same result. Isomaltose is broken by isomaltase.
The production of maltose from germinating cereals, such as barley, is an important part of the brewing process. When barley is malted, it is brought into a condition in which the concentration of maltose-producing amylases has been maximized. Mashing is the process by which these amylases convert the cereal's starches into maltose. Metabolism of maltose by yeast during fermentation then leads to the production of ethanol and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maltose&amp;oldid=421158773&lt;/ref&gt;

Trehalose, also known as mycose or tremalose, is a natural alpha-linked disaccharide formed by an α,α-1,1-glucoside bond between two α-glucose units. In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye, and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from trehala manna, a substance made by weevils, and named it trehalose. It can be synthesised by fungi, plants, and invertebrate animals. It is implicated in anhydrobiosis — the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. It has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food and cosmetics. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles, by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/rehydration cycle. Trehalose has the added advantage of being an antioxidant. Extracting trehalose used to be a difficult and costly process, but, recently, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) confirmed an inexpensive extraction technology from starch for mass production. Trehalose is currently being used for a broad spectrum of applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trehalose&amp;oldid=422266481&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellobiose is a disaccharide with the formula [HOCH2CHO(CHOH)3]2O. The molecule is derived from the condensation of two glucose molecules linked in a β(1→4) bond. It can be hydrolyzed by bacteria or cationic ion exchange resins to give glucose. Cellobiose has eight free alcohol (COH) groups and three ether linkages, which give rise to strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds
It can be obtained by enzymatic or acidic hydrolysis of cellulose and cellulose rich materials such as cotton, jute, or paper. Cellulose is a polymer of glucose units linked by β(1→4) bonds.
Treatment of cellulose with acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid, gives cellobiose octoacetate, which cannot engage in hydrogen bonding and is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cellobiose&amp;oldid=420992539&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polysaccharides==
Polysaccharides are polymeric carbohydrate structures, formed of repeating units (either mono- or di-saccharides) joined together by glycosidic bonds. These structures are often linear, but may contain various degrees of branching. Polysaccharides are often quite heterogeneous, containing slight modifications of the repeating unit. Depending on the structure, these macromolecules can have distinct properties from their monosaccharide building blocks. They may be amorphous or even insoluble in water.
Polysaccharides have a general formula of C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; where x is usually a large number between 200 and 2500. Considering that the repeating units in the polymer backbone are often six-carbon monosaccharides, the general formula can also be represented as (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; where 40≤n≤3000.

===Storage polysaccharides===
'''Starch''' or amylum is a carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined together by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by all green plants as an energy store. It is the most important carbohydrate in the human diet and is contained in such staple foods as potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava.
Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin. Glycogen, the glucose store of animals, is a more branched version of amylopectin.
Starch is processed to produce many of the sugars in processed foods. When dissolved in warm water, it can be used as a thickening, stiffening or gluing agent, giving wheatpaste.
Amylose is made up of α(1→4) bound glucose molecules. The carbon atoms on glucose are numbered, starting at the aldehyde (C=O) carbon, so, in amylose, the 1-carbon on one glucose molecule is linked to the 4-carbon on the next glucose molecule (α(1→4) bonds).  The structural formula of amylose is pictured at right. The number of repeated glucose subunits (n) is usually in the range of 300 to 3000, but can be many thousands.
There are three main forms of amylose chains can take. It can exist in a disordered amorphous conformation or two different helical forms. It can bind with itself in a double helix (A or B form), or it can bind with another hydrophobic guest molecule such as iodine, a fatty acid, or an aromatic compound. This is known as the V form and is how amylopectin binds to amylose to form starch. Within this group, there are many different variations. Each is notated with V and then a subscript indicating the number of glucose units per turn. The most common is the V6 form, which has six glucose units a turn. V8 and possibly V7 forms exist as well. These provide an even larger space for the guest molecule to bind.
This linear structure can have some rotation around the phi and psi angles, but, for the most part, bound glucose ring oxygens lie on one side of the structure. The α(1→4) structure promotes the formation of a helix structure, making it possible for hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atoms bound at 2-carbon of one glucose molecule and the 3-carbon of the next glucose molecule.
Amylopectin  is a soluble polysaccharide and highly branched polymer of glucose found in plants. It is one of the two components of starch, the other being amylose.
Glucose units are linked in a linear way with α(1→4) glycosidic bonds. Branching takes place with α(1→6) bonds occurring every 24 to 30 glucose units. In contrast, amylose contains very few α(1→6) bonds, which causes it to be hydrolyzed more slowly but have higher density.
Its counterpart in animals is glycogen, which has the same composition and structure, but with more extensive branching that occurs every 8 to 12 glucose units.
Plants store starch within specialized organelles called amyloplasts. When energy is needed for cell work, the plant hydrolyzes the starch, releasing the glucose subunits. Humans and other animals that eat plant foods also use amylase, an enzyme that assists in breaking down amylopectin.
Starch is made of about 70% amylopectin by weight, though it varies depending on the source (higher in medium-grain rice to 100% in waxy rice, waxy potato starch, and waxy corn, and lower in long-grain rice, amylomaize, and russet potato, for example). Amylopectin is highly branched, being formed of 2,000 to 200,000 glucose units. Its inner-chains are formed of 20-24 glucose subunits.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glycogen''' is the molecule that functions as the secondary long-term energy storage in animal and fungal cells. It is made primarily by the liver and the muscles, but can also be made by glycogenesis within the brain and stomach.
Glycogen is the analogue of starch, a less branched glucose polymer in plants, and is commonly referred to as animal starch, having a similar structure to amylopectin. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids). In the liver hepatocytes, glycogen can compose up to 8% of the fresh weight (100–120 g in an adult) soon after a meal. Only the glycogen stored in the liver can be made accessible to other organs. In the muscles, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1% to 2% of the muscle mass). However, the amount of glycogen stored in the body - especially within the red blood cells,liver, and muscles - mostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits such as intermittent fasting. Small amounts of glycogen are found in the kidneys, and even smaller amounts in certain glial cells in the brain and white blood cells. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo.

===Structural polysaccharides===
[[File:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|right|360px|A strand of cellulose (conformation I&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;), showing the [[hydrogen bond]]s (dashed) within and between cellulose molecules.]]
'''Cellulose'''
The structural component of plants are formed primarily from cellulose. Wood is largely cellulose and lignin, while paper and cotton are nearly pure cellulose. Cellulose is a polymer made with repeated glucose units bonded together by beta-linkages. Humans and many other animals lack an enzyme to break the beta-linkages, so they do not digest cellulose. Certain animals can digest cellulose, because bacteria possessing the enzyme are present in their gut. The classic example is the termite.Cellulose has no taste, is odourless, is hydrophilic with the contact angle of 20–30, is insoluble in water and most organic solvents, is chiral and is biodegradable. It can be broken down chemically into its glucose units by treating it with concentrated acids at high temperature.
Cellulose is derived from D-glucose units, which condense through β(1→4)-glycosidic bonds. This linkage motif contrasts with that for α(1→4)-glycosidic bonds present in starch, glycogen, and other carbohydrates. Cellulose is a straight chain polymer: unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs, and the molecule adopts an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen molecules on the same or on a neighbor chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. This strength is important in cell walls, where the microfibrils are meshed into a carbohydrate matrix, conferring rigidity to plant cells.
Compared to starch, cellulose is also much more crystalline. Whereas starch undergoes a crystalline to amorphous transition when heated beyond 60-70 °C in water (as in cooking), cellulose requires a temperature of 320 °C and pressure of 25 MPa to become amorphous in water.
Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Natural cellulose is cellulose I, with structures Iα and Iβ. Cellulose produced by bacteria and algae is enriched in Iα while cellulose of higher plants consists mainly of Iβ. Cellulose in regenerated cellulose fibers is cellulose II. The conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II is not reversible, suggesting that cellulose I is metastable and cellulose II is stable. With various chemical treatments it is possible to produce the structures cellulose III and cellulose IV.
Many properties of cellulose depend on its chain length or degree of polymerization, the number of glucose units that make up one polymer molecule. Cellulose from wood pulp has typical chain lengths between 300 and 1700 units; cotton and other plant fibers as well as bacterial celluloses have chain lengths ranging from 800 to 10,000 units.[10] Molecules with very small chain length resulting from the breakdown of cellulose are known as cellodextrins; in contrast to long-chain cellulose, cellodextrins are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.
Plant-derived cellulose is usually found in a mixture with hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and other substances, while microbial cellulose is quite pure, has a much higher water content, and consists of long chains.
Cellulose is soluble in cupriethylenediamine (CED), cadmiumethylenediamine (Cadoxen), N-methylmorpholine N-oxide and lithium chloride / dimethylformamide.This is used in the production of regenerated celluloses (as viscose and cellophane) from dissolving pulp.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chitin'''
Chitin is one of many naturally occurring polymers. It is one of the most abundant natural materials in the world. Over time it is bio-degradable in the natural environment. Its breakdown may be catalyzed by enzymes called chitinases, secreted by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, and produced by some plants. Some of these microorganisms have receptors to simple sugars from the decomposition of chitin. If chitin is detected, they then produce enzymes to digest it by cleaving the glycosidic bonds in order to convert it to simple sugars and ammonia.
Chemically, chitin is closely related to chitosan (a more water-soluble derivative of chitin). It is also closely related to cellulose in that it is a long unbranched chain of glucose derivatives. Both materials contribute structure and strength, protecting the organism.Chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen; it is synthesized from units of N-acetylglucosamine (to be precise, 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose). These units form covalent β-1,4 linkages (similar to the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose). Therefore, chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer substituted with an acetyl amine group. This allows for increased hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymers, giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.
In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in a hardened proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, it is leathery, but, when encrusted in calcium carbonate, it becomes much harder. The difference between the unmodified and modified forms can be seen by comparing the body wall of a caterpillar (unmodified) to a beetle (modified).N-Acetylglucosamine (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, or GlcNAc, or NAG) is a monosaccharide derivative of glucose. It is an amide between glucosamine and acetic acid. It has a molecular formula of C8H15NO6, a molar mass of 221.21 g/mol, and it is significant in several biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of a biopolymer in the bacterial cell wall, built from alternating units of GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), cross-linked with oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc. This layered structure is called peptidoglycan.GlcNAc is the monomeric unit of the polymer chitin, which forms the outer coverings of insects and crustaceans.Polymerized with glucuronic acid it forms hyaluronan.

'''Arabinoxylans'''
Arabinoxylans are the copolymers of two pentose sugars - arabinose and xylose.

===Bacterial polysaccharides===
[[Image:Peptidoglycan en.svg|thumb|300px|Peptidoglycan.]]
Bacterial polysaccharides represent a diverse range of macromolecules that include peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharides, capsules and exopolysaccharides; compounds whose functions range from structural cell-wall components (e.g. peptidoglycan), and important virulence factors (e.g. Poly-N-acetylglucosamine in S. aureus), to permitting the bacterium to survive in harsh environments (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the human lung). Polysaccharide biosynthesis is a tightly regulated, energy-intensive process and understanding the subtle interplay between the regulation and energy conservation, polymer modification and synthesis, and the external ecological functions is a huge area of research. The potential benefits are enormous and should enable for example the development of novel antibacterial strategies (e.g. new antibiotics and vaccines) and the commercial exploitation to develop novel applications.

'''Bacterial capsular polysaccharides'''
Pathogenic bacteria commonly produce a thick, mucous-like, layer of polysaccharide. This &quot;capsule&quot; cloaks antigenic proteins on the bacterial surface that would otherwise provoke an immune response and thereby lead to the destruction of the bacteria. Capsular polysaccharides are water soluble, commonly acidic, and have molecular weights on the order of 100-1000 kDa. They are linear and consist of regularly repeating subunits of one to six monosaccharides. There is enormous structural diversity; nearly two hundred different polysaccharides are produced by'' E. coli'' alone. Mixtures of capsular polysaccharides, either conjugated or native are used as vaccines.
Bacteria and many other microbes, including fungi and algae, often secrete polysaccharides as an evolutionary adaptation to help them adhere to surfaces and to prevent them from drying out. Humans have developed some of these polysaccharides into useful products, including xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan.
Most of these polysaccharides exhibit interesting and very useful visco-elastic properties when dissolved in water at very low levels. This gives many foods and various liquid consumer products, like lotions, cleaners and paints, for example, a viscous appearance when stationary, but fluidity when the slightest shear is applied, such as when wiped, poured or brushed. This property is referred to as pseudoplasticity, or shear thinning.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polysaccharide&amp;oldid=422863369&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peptidoglycan'''
Peptidoglycan, also known as murein, is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh-like layer outside the plasma membrane of bacteria (but not Archaea), forming the cell wall. The sugar component consists of alternating residues of β-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid. Attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids. The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer.
The peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall is a crystal lattice structure formed from linear chains of two alternating amino sugars, namely N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc or NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc or NAM). The alternating sugars are connected by a β-(1,4)-glycosidic bond. Each MurNAc is attached to a short (4- to 5-residue) amino acid chain, containing D-alanine, D-glutamic acid, and meso-diaminopimelic acid in the case of Escherichia coli (a Gram negative bacteria) or L-alanine, D-glutamine, L-lysine, and D-alanine in the case of Staphylococcus aureus (a Gram positive bacteria). These amino acids, except the L-amino acids, do not occur in proteins and are thought to help protect against attacks by most peptidases
Cross-linking between amino acids in different linear amino sugar chains occurs with the help of the enzyme transpeptidase and results in a 3-dimensional structure that is strong and rigid. The specific amino acid sequence and molecular structure vary with the bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peptidoglycan&amp;oldid=422040621&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LPS'''

LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, contributing greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria, and protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. LPS also increases the negative charge of the cell membrane and helps stabilize the overall membrane structure. It is of crucial importance to gram-negative bacteria, whose death results if it is mutated or removed. LPS is an endotoxin, and induces a strong response from normal animal immune systems. It has also been implicated in non-pathogenic aspects of bacterial ecology, including surface adhesion, bacteriophage sensitivity, and interactions with predators such as amoebae.
LPS acts as the prototypical endotoxin because it binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex, which promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in many cell types, but especially in macrophages. In Immunology, the term &quot;LPS challenge&quot; refers to the process of exposing a subject to an LPS that may act as a toxin.
LPS is also an exogenous pyrogen (external fever-inducing substance).
Being of crucial importance to gram-negative bacteria, these molecules make candidate targets for new antimicrobial agents.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lipopolysaccharide&amp;oldid=423382830&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers doubt reports of generalized toxic effects attributed to all lipopolysaccharides, in particular, for cyanobacteria.It comprises three parts:

O antigen (or O polysaccharide)

Core oligosaccharide

Lipid A

==Glycan==
[[Image:Glicoprotein.svg|thumb|right|N-linked protein glycosylation (N-glycosylation of N-glycans) at Asn residues (Asn-x-Ser/Thr motifs) in glycoproteins.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddock &amp; Molinari (2006) Journal of Cell Science 119, 4373-4380&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term glycan refers to a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide. Glycans usually consist solely of O-glycosidic linkages of monosaccharides. For example, cellulose is a glycan (or, to be more specific, a glucan) composed of beta-1,4-linked D-glucose, and chitin is a glycan composed of beta-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Glycans can be homo- or heteropolymers of monosaccharide residues, and can be linear or branched. Glycan may also be used to refer to the carbohydrate portion of a glycoconjugate, such as a glycoprotein, glycolipid, or a proteoglycan.
Glycans can be found attached to proteins as in glycoproteins and proteoglycans. In general, they are found on the exterior surface of cells. O- and N-linked glycans are very common in eukaryotes but may also be found, although less commonly, in prokaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glycan&amp;oldid=417977294&lt;/ref&gt;

'''N-Linked glycans'''

N-Linked glycans are found attached to the R-group nitrogen (N) of asparagine in the sequon. The sequon is a Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr sequence, where X is any amino acid except proline and may be composed of N-acetyl galactosamine, galactose, neuraminic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, fructose, mannose, fucose, and other monosaccharides.

Assembly:
In eukaryotes, N-linked glycans are derived from a core 14-sugar unit assembled in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. First, two N-acetyl glucosamine residues are attached to dolichol phosphate, a lipid, on the external side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Five mannose residues are then added to this structure. At this point, the partially finished core glycan is flipped across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, so that it is now located within the reticular lumen. Assembly then continues within the endoplasmic reticulum, with the addition of four more mannose residues. Finally, three glucose residues are added to this structure. Following full assembly, the glycan is transferred en bloc by the glycosyltransferase oligosaccharyltransferase to a nascent peptide chain, within the reticular lumen. This core structure of N-linked glycans, thus, consists of 14 residues (3 glucose, 9 mannose, and 2 N-acetylglucosamine).&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glycan&amp;oldid=417977294&lt;/ref&gt;



Once transferred to the nascent peptide chain, N-linked glycans, in general, undergo extensive processing reactions, whereby the three glucose residues are removed, as well as several mannose residues, depending on the N-linked glycan in question. The removal of the glucose residues is dependent on proper protein folding. These processing reactions occur in the Golgi apparatus. Modification reactions may involve the addition of a phosphate or acetyl group onto the sugars, or the addition of new sugars, such as neuraminic acid. Processing and modification of N-linked glycans within the Golgi does not follow a linear pathway. As a result, many different variations of N-linked glycan structure are possible, depending on enzyme activity in the Golgi.

''Functions and importance''
N-linked glycans are extremely important in proper protein folding in eukaryotic cells. Chaperone proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as calnexin and calreticulin, bind to the three glucose residues present on the core N-linked glycan. These chaperone proteins then serve to aid in the folding of the protein that the glycan is attached to. Following proper folding, the three glucose residues are removed, and the glycan moves on to further processing reactions. If the protein fails to fold properly, the three glucose residues are reattached, allowing the protein to re-associate with the chaperones. This cycle may repeat several times until a protein reaches its proper conformation. If a protein repeatedly fails to properly fold, it is excreted from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by cytoplasmic proteases.
N-linked glycans also contribute to protein folding by steric effects. For example, cysteine residues in the peptide may be temporarily blocked from forming disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues, due to the size of a nearby glycan. Therefore, the presence of a N-linked glycan allows the cell to control which cysteine residues will form disulfide bonds.
N-linked glycans also play an important role in cell-cell interactions. For example, tumour cells make N-linked glycans that are abnormal. These are recognized by the CD337 receptor on Natural Killer cells as a sign that the cell in question is cancerous.
The targeting of degradative lysosomal enzymes is also accomplished by N-linked glycans. The modification of an N-linked glycan with a mannose-6-phosphate residue serves as a signal that the protein to which this glycan is attached should be moved to the lysosome. This recognition and trafficking of lysosomal enzymes by the presence of mannose-6-phosphate is accomplished by two proteins: CI-MPR (cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor) and CD-MPR (cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor).&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glycan&amp;oldid=417977294&lt;/ref&gt;

'''O-Linked glycans'''

In eukaryotes, O-linked glycans are assembled one sugar at a time on a serine or threonine residue of a peptide chain in the Golgi apparatus. Unlike with N-linked glycans, there is as of yet no known consensus sequence. However, the placement of a proline residue at either -1 or +3 relative to the serine or threonine is favourable for O-linked glycosylation.

''Assembly''
The first monosaccharide attached in the synthesis of O-linked glycans is N-acetyl-galactosamine. After this, several different pathways are possible. A Core 1 structure is generated by the addition of galactose. A Core 2 structure is generated by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to the N-acetyl-galactosamine of the Core 1 structure. Core 3 structures are generated by the addition of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine to the original N-acetyl-galactosamine. Core 4 structures are generated by the addition of a second N-acetly-glucosamine to the Core 3 structure. Other core structures are possible, though less common.

A common structural theme in O-linked glycans is the addition of polylactosamine units to the various core structures. These are formed by the repetitive addition of galactose and
N-acetyl-glucosamine units. Polylactosamine chains on O-linked glycans are often capped by the addition of a sialic acid residue (similar to neuraminic acid). If a fucose residue is also added, to the next to penultimate residue, a Sialyl_lewis_x (SLex)) structure is formed.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycan&lt;/ref&gt;
===Proteoglycans===
Proteoglycans are glycoproteins that are heavily glycosylated. The basic proteoglycan unit consists of a &quot;core protein&quot; with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s). The point of attachment is a Ser residue to which the glycosaminoglycan is joined through a tetrasaccharide bridge (For example: chondroitin sulfate-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-PROTEIN). The Ser residue is generally in the sequence -Ser-Gly-X-Gly- (where X can be any amino acid residue), although not every protein with this sequence has an attached glycosaminoglycan. The chains are long, linear carbohydrate polymers that are negatively charged under physiological conditions, due to the occurrence of sulfate and uronic acid groups. Proteoglycans occur in the connective tissue.
Proteoglycans can be categorised depending upon the nature of their glycosaminoglycan chains. Proteoglycans can also be categorised by size (kDa). &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proteoglycan&amp;oldid=423972661&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* VOB ID */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">IFO (“information”) files impose a structure on the raw MPEG data. The VMG has an IFO file, and there is also one in each VTS. The two kinds of IFO files (VMG vs VTS) have a common initial structure, but differ in later parts.

(see diagram [http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/ifo.html here] for now)

Here are kept various tables of pointers to find the titles, chapters and so on. Here also the ''attributes'' of the video, audio and subpicture streams are summarized. Some of this (e.g. audio format) is redundant and could be obtained by scanning the actual MPEG data (though presumably having it here is more convenient for player initialization), while other info, particularly the language-code assignments, is important for letting the user configure the playback of the titles. This information does not include the actual stream IDs; these are to be found within each PGC (below).

== Program Chains (PGCs) ==

(see [http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/pgc.html here] for diagram for now)

Each PGC has an entry in an IFO file. The PGC’s VM commands and colour table are kept here, along with pointers to find the corresponding MPEG data in the VOB files.

Note that the PGC colour table defines colours in [[w:YCbCr|Y,Cr,Cb]] format with no transparency component. Instead, transparency (which DVD-Video refers to as ''contrast'') is specified when the colour is referenced in the subpicture stream, or in a menu button definition.

Here will also be found ''stream control'' information, 8 entries for audio streams and 32 entries for subpicture streams. These correspond in order to the audio and subpicture attributes entries in the earlier part of the IFO. They define the particular stream numbers corresponding to those streams within the MPEG data for this PGC. Note that each subpicture stream control entry has room for 4 different stream numbers, being the streams to use for narrowscreen footage on a narrowscreen TV, widescreen footage on a widescreen TV, or widescreen footage on a narrowscreen TV in letterbox or pan-and-scan modes.

The ability to have different stream IDs for corresponding streams in different PGCs is presumably to allow easier authoring of a disc, by being able to combine preexisting material from different sources, without having to reprocess them all to assign consistent stream IDs. The “SCR discontinuity” flag that each cell has looks like part of this purpose as well: it warns the player about discontinuities in clock timestamps, saving the authoring system the bother of reprocessing the MPEG data to assign consistent timestamps.

=== Cells and Programs Within the PGC ===

The cell position information table explicitly lists all the cells that make up this PGC. These cells do not have to occur in sequence in the MPEG data, and the same cells can be referenced multiple times. This allows for the same material to be presented in multiple different ways, without the need for complicated programming of explicit cell-level sequencing using the interaction machine.

The program map entry table defines the groupings of cells into programs within the PGC. Each entry specifies a starting index into the cell position information table, and specifies the inclusion of all cells listed from that point in the table up to prior to the start of the next program.

== Menu Groupings ==

Both the VMG and VTS IFO headers include sections listing all the menus. These are grouped by ''language units'', each identified by ISO639 language code. Within each language unit there can be one or more menus, and each menu can consist of one or more PGCs. However, it’s not clear that these language units serve anything more than an informational purpose, since all selection of menus is done by explicit execution of VM instructions.

== Title Map ==

The VMG IFO includes an additional section that assigns a sequential index to every title in every titleset. This is used for cross-domain jump instructions in the VM: instead of being able to say “jump titleset ''m'' title ''n''”, you have to say “jump title ''i''”, where ''i'' is an index into this table that lists ''m'' and ''n''.

== VOB ID ==

Each cell is identified by a 16-bit “VOB ID” concatenated with an 8-bit “cell ID” within that VOB. This “VOB” doesn’t correspond to the segmentation into multiple .VOB files in the output DVD-Video file structure; it could correspond to input MPEG source files used to author the structure, with each input file being assigned an incremental VOB ID starting from 1. Thus, if an input source MPEG file is smaller than 524272 sectors, then the next input source file will be concatenated onto the same output .VOB file, but the VOB ID will increase.

But does this really matter? The player doesn’t care how the input source files were divided up.

== VMGM_C_ADT, VTSM_C_ADT, VTS_C_ADT ==

These ''xxx''_C_ADT tables are indexed by VOBU number, and return information about which cell the VOBU belongs to. These tables define the cells.

== VMGM_VOBU_ADMAP, VTSM_VOBU_ADMAP, VTS_VOBU_ADMAP ==

These ''xxx''_VOBU_ADMAP tables are indexed by VOBU number, and return the starting sector, relative to the start of the containing VOB, of the VOBU.

== Where the VOBs Are ==

Both the ''xxx''_C_ADT and ''xxx''_VOBU_ADMAP tables above locate things (cells, VOBUs) by sector number ''within the containing VOB''. But there’s no table of where the VOBs themselves start. (Remember, VOBs have nothing to do with the division into .VOB files in the DVD-Video directory structure.) So how do you find the VOBs?

It seems to me the player has to deduce these, as follows:

* The first VOB begins at the start of the first .VOB file. From this, you can determine the start of each cell and VOBU within the first VOB.
* By examining the ''xxx''_C_ADT tables, you can deduce the highest cell number within each VOB. This gives you the highest sector number within the first VOB.
* Therefore, the next sector following must be the start of the second VOB. Redoing from the previous step on this VOB lets you work out its highest sector number.

And so on in sequence, until you have all the VOBs mapped out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Subpictures''' are used to display subtitles as well as menu buttons, overlaid on the video. These are stored in an MPEG stream (private stream 1) as a sequence of ''Sub-Picture Unit''s (SPUs). SPUs may be broken across multiple MPEG stream packets.

Each SPU contains an image bitmap with 2 bits per pixel, split into odd and even fields, stored using a [[w:Run-length_encoding|run-length-encoded]] (RLE) compression format. This is accompanied by a sequence of commands that control the actual display of the bitmap, including the choice of which four colours from the PGC colour table to use. There is also a time delay that can be specified before executing the commands.

(see [http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/spu.html here] for more details for now)

A complete SPU cannot exceed 65535 bytes, because the length header field is only 16 bits. However, an uncompressed full-screen subpicture image can be as large as 103680 bytes (= 720 * 576 / 4) for PAL, or 84600 bytes (= 720 * 480 / 4) for NTSC, and RLE compression performs poorly when there are only short runs of identical pixels. Any image which cannot be RLE-compressed to fit within the limit is simply not allowed.

Subpictures may be turned off or on under user control, or their display may be ''forced'' so they are always visible. User-controllable subpicture display is useful for showing subtitles, while forced subpictures are useful for buttons in menus—you don’t want the user wondering where the buttons have gone!

At most one subpicture stream can be visible at a time, overlaid on the video image, which will show through wherever the subpicture pixels are not fully opaque.

== Widescreen Considerations ==

One subtlety to keep in mind with widescreen video is that in this case ''subpictures are scaled to fit the screen, not the video''. Specifically, if widescreen video is being shown “letterboxed” on a narrowscreen TV, the subpicture display area will still include the parts occupied by the black bars above and below the video image. As they say, “this is a feature, not a bug”; presumably, the point is to allow you to use the black area to show subtitles, leaving the video image untouched. The PGC header allows you to specify up to four alternative subpicture streams to be substituted as appropriate, depending on the following situations:
* narrowscreen footage (“normal”) being viewed on all TVs
* widescreen footage being viewed on a widescreen TV
* widescreen footage being letterboxed on a narrowscreen TV
* widescreen footage being shown in “pan-and-scan” mode on a narrowscreen TV

(Though of course narrowscreen video will only use the first one, and widescreen will not use the first one.)

      <comment>/* Buttons */ clarify change to colours, not pixel values</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">NAV (navigation) PACKs contain one PCI (Presentation Control Information) packet and one DSI (Data Search Information) packet. I’m not sure if the order of the two is important, but every VOBU must begin with a NAV PACK.

== PCI Packet ==

The PCI packet defines buttons. Here is also hidden the flag that turns on Macrovision APS copy-protection for the video in this VOBU.

(see [http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/pci_pkt.html here] for more details for now)

=== Buttons ===

Buttons are the way for the user to interact with the DVD-Video content. They can appear in both menus and titles. Their appearance and behaviour is defined by the currently-visible subpicture stream, in conjunction with information from the last-seen PCI packet. Since all this information is coming from the VOB file which is being continuously read by the player, buttons can be ''dynamic'': they can appear and disappear, change their appearance, and move around over time.

Each button belongs to a button group, of which there may be up to three. Button groups fulfil two conflicting purposes: on one hand they allow different colour schemes (choice of highlighted/selected colours), on the other hand they offer alternative layouts when widescreen footage is being shown on a narrowscreen set in letterbox or pan-and-scan modes versus on a widescreen set. This is why, even though there is room for 36 button entries, a widescreen menu can be limited to as few as 12 buttons, if you provide three alternative button layouts for widescreen footage.

A button can be in one of 3 states: the ''normal'' state is that defined by the subpicture stream. One button will always be in the ''highlighted'' state: this is indicated by the subpicture pixels within the button’s rectangle having their colours (including transparency) taken from the relevant table entry in the PCI, overriding what the subpicture stream specifies. As the user uses the up/down/left/right keys on the remote, the highlighted state moves from button to button, according to the corresponding spatial relationship information as defined in the PCI tables.

Just to be clear: switching between normal, highlighted and selected states is done purely by changing the colours (and transparencies) assigned to the pixel values; the pixel values do not change from those specified in the subpicture stream.

Then, when the user presses the “OK” or “Enter” button, the highlighted button is (supposed to be) briefly shown in the “selected” state, and then the interaction command associated with that button is executed. Some players don’t seem to bother to show the button in the selected state.

Buttons can also be defined as “auto-action” buttons; this means the associated command is executed immediately the button becomes highlighted, without waiting for the “OK” press. This is particularly handy for defining menus that require more buttons than can fit on one screen; the “next screen” and “previous screen” buttons can be auto-action ones, saving the number of keypresses the user needs to switch between screens.

A common technique is for the “normal” state, as defined by the subpicture stream, to show no visible (opaque) subpicture pixels at all. Instead, it is up to the video layer to define what the user sees as the “normal” appearance of the buttons. This is because the video layer allows for more elaborate, full-colour images, while subpictures are limited to a maximum of four colours. Of course, the “highlighted” and “selected” embellishments are still limited to the four-colour maximum.

== DSI Packet ==

The DSI packet has links to preceding and following VOBUs at various predefined time offsets from 0.5 seconds up to 120 seconds. This helps the player to implement its trick-play (fast forward/reverse) modes. It also defines how VOBUs corresponding to different camera view angles are interleaved.

(see [http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/dsi_pkt.html here] for more details for now or See also [http://dvd.sourceforge.net/nav_notes nav_notes] for some C slightly different pseudo code).

      <comment>/* Permitted Jumps/Calls */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">DVD-Video specifies a low-level [[w:Machine language|machine-language]] instruction set that is used to define interactions with the user. Instruction sequences are invoked when the user selects an on-screen button, and may also be triggered at various other points, such as the end of a cell or a PGC, or when the disc is inserted into the player.

The instruction set is commonly referred to as the “VM” (Virtual Machine) language, but the implication of calling it “virtual” is that there cannot be ''real'' hardware that directly implements this instruction set. But why not? That’s why I am here using the term “interaction machine”, which makes it clearer what the purpose of the instruction set is.

(Note that I’m avoiding using the term “program” for sequences of instructions in this instruction set, because that already has a completely different meaning in DVD-Video.)

Each instruction is 8 bytes long. This sounds like a lot, because each instruction can do several things at once: for example, perform a comparison, set a register, jump to some location.

(For now: instruction set [http://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/dvdinfo/vmi-sum.html summary] and [http://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/dvdinfo/vmi.html details])

There are 16 ''general-purpose parameter registers'' (GPRMs), each of which can hold an unsigned 16-bit integer. Their use is entirely up to the instruction-sequence writer. They are the only data storage available to instruction sequences. There are no indirect or indexed addressing modes available.

There are also various ''system parameter registers'' (SPRMs), with predefined meanings to the player. There are special instructions for accessing these, and some of them are read-only.

(SPRMs are listed [http://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/dvdinfo/sprm.html here] for now)

Interaction instructions can be found in the following places:

* a cell can end with a single instruction to be executed when the cell has finished playing.
* a button specifies a single instruction to be executed when the button is selected.
* the pre- and post-sections of a PGC can each contain a sequence of instructions, to be executed before the PGC starts playing and after it finishes, respectively.
* the FPC contains a sequence of instructions which automatically start executing when the disc is inserted into the player.

The single-instruction limitation on buttons is not a big issue in practice; it’s easy enough for the single instruction to be “jump to location ''n'' in post-section of PGC”, to execute a longer sequence of instructions beginning at that location ''n''.

Most operations can be executed conditionally: the condition is based on comparing either two GPRMs, or a GPRM and a literal value from the instruction, according to a choice of comparison operators.

Besides being conditional, instructions can perform the following sorts of operations:

* transfer of control within an instruction sequence, or terminate an instruction sequence
* ''link'' (transfer to a cell, program, PTT or PGC within the same domain), optionally specifying a button to show as highlighted
* ''jump'' or ''call''—transfer to a PGC or PTT in another domain. Call differs from jump in that the current (or an alternative specified) cell location is saved as the address to return to on execution of a resume instruction. Only a single such cell location can be saved; executing a new call overwrites the return address from the previous call. [http://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/dvdinfo/vmi-jmp.html Not all combinations] are allowed
* set a GPRM to either a literal value, the value of another GPRM, or the value of an operation involving a GPRM and a literal value
* set specified SPRMs to specified values (might be literal or from a GPRM, depending on the instruction). Only certain SPRMs can be set this way
* combination of a set-GPRM and a link (conditionals not allowed)
* combination of a conditional, set-GPRM and link, in 3 variations: 1) the set is unconditionally done, then the conditional test is used to decide if the link should be done 2) the conditional test is used to decide if the set followed by the link should be done 3) the conditional test is used to decide if the set should be done; in either case, the link is always done

== Permitted Jumps/Calls ==

Here is a table of the permitted transfers between domains, and the names of the instructions to use.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &lt;SUB&gt;from&lt;/SUB&gt;\to !! FPC !! VMG !! VTSM !! VTST
|-
| FPC || || JumpSS || JumpSS || JumpTT
|-
| VMG || JumpSS || || JumpSS || JumpTT, RSM
|-
| VTSM || JumpSS || JumpSS || || JumpVTS_TT, JumpVTS_PTT, RSM
|-
| VTST || CallSS || CallSS || CallSS || JumpVTS_TT, JumpVTS_PTT
|}

Note that, from a VTS (menu or title), it is not permitted to jump directly into another VTS. You have to set up indirect jumps via the VMG. Note also that, from a title, you have to “call” rather than “jump” into a menu; this is to allow the menu to use RSM to resume playback of the title.

Beside the intro, the page has no technical info and the links appear to be broken and both redirect to the main Parrot doc page (http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/latest/html/) which does not contain any links to embedding.

I googled around and found the page that I think the link was intended for: http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/docs/embed.pod.html ...

      <comment>pic, explanation of blocks as signal producers &amp; signal consumers</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:VisSim screenshot.PNG|thumb|Vissim screenshot. A sine function and a [[Signals and Systems/Noise|noise generator]] are connected by wire to a sum junction and the result is added to a plot block. Via an alternate wire, the signal is filtered with a [[Electronics/Expanded Edition Resonance|Butterworth filter]] and added to the plot block in an alternate color to show the effect of the filter.]]
VisSim is based around a core product that acts as an interpretive compiler that accepts as input model diagrams saved in files with the &quot;.VSM&quot; extension. The core product, VisSim, is used for general modeling, simulation and control system design applications. It comes with a large library of blocks, which are roughly split into two groups; signal producers and signal consumers. An example of a signal producer is a [[Trigonometry/Graph of Sine Squared|sine function]] and an example of a signal consumer is the Plot block. Blocks can be &quot;wired&quot; together and large amounts of blocks can be selected to form a compound block, to ease readability of diagrams.
==For model viewers==
Most new users of VisSim are interested in the block called the &quot;Plot Block&quot; most of all. This is because most new users are simply running a simulation model in the View-only version of VisSim, and most often the results of any simulation are shown in the plot block. For first time users, therefore, the most important button on VisSim's menu will be the green &quot;Go arrow&quot; used to commence simulation. Depending on the model, the user can change many parameters of a simulation interactively. The View-only version of VisSim looks and feels just like the developer version, except the model cannot be modified. For this reason, VisSim is often used for training purposes and test runs.
==For model builders==
For model builders, VisSim's visual interface offers a simple method for constructing and simulating large-scale complex dynamic systems; its math engine provides fast, accurate solutions for linear, nonlinear, continuous time, discrete time, time varying and hybrid system designs. It's layering capablilities enables a hierarchical design that is referred to as model-based development. Using VisSim's statechart view, the [[Introduction to Software Engineering/UML|UML design]] can be run in real time.
